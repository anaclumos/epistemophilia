    "originBody": "Technology It’s Time to Stop Taking Sam Altman at His Word Understand AI for what it is, not what it might become. By David Karpf SeongJoon Cho / Bloomberg / Getty October 4, 2024, 12:57 PM ET Share Save OpenAI announced this week that it has raised $6.6 billion in new funding and that the company is now valued at $157 billion overall. This is quite a feat for an organization that reportedly burns through $7 billion a year—far more cash than it brings in—but it makes sense when you realize that OpenAI’s primary product isn’t technology. It’s stories. Case in point: Last week, CEO Sam Altman published an online manifesto titled “The Intelligence Age.” In it, he declares that the AI revolution is on the verge of unleashing boundless prosperity and radically improving human life. “We’ll soon be able to work with AI that helps us accomplish much more than we ever could without AI,” he writes. Altman expects that his technology will fix the climate, help humankind establish space colonies, and discover all of physics. He predicts that we may have an all-powerful superintelligence “in a few thousand days.” All we have to do is feed his technology enough energy, enough data, and enough chips. Maybe someday Altman’s ideas about AI will prove out, but for now, his approach is textbook Silicon Valley mythmaking. In these narratives, humankind is forever on the cusp of a technological breakthrough that will transform society for the better. The hard technical problems have basically been solved—all that’s left now are the details, which will surely be worked out through market competition and old-fashioned entrepreneurship. Spend billions now; make trillions later! This was the story of the dot-com boom in the 1990s, and of nanotechnology in the 2000s. It was the story of cryptocurrency and robotics in the 2010s. The technologies never quite work out like the Altmans of the world promise, but the stories keep regulators and regular people sidelined while the entrepreneurs, engineers, and investors build empires. (The Atlantic recently entered a corporate partnership with OpenAI.) Read: AI doomerism is a decoy Despite the rhetoric, Altman’s products currently feel less like a glimpse of the future and more like the mundane, buggy present. ChatGPT and DALL-E were cutting-edge technology in 2022. People tried the chatbot and image generator for the first time and were astonished. Altman and his ilk spent the following year speaking in stage whispers about the awesome technological force that had just been unleashed upon the world. Prominent AI figures were among the thousands of people who signed an open letter in March 2023 to urge a six-month pause in the development of large language models ( LLMs) so that humanity would have time to address the social consequences of the impending revolution. Those six months came and went. OpenAI and its competitors have released other models since then, and although tech wonks have dug into their purported advancements, for most people, the technology appears to have plateaued. GPT-4 now looks less like the precursor to an all-powerful superintelligence and more like … well, any other chatbot. The technology itself seems much smaller once the novelty wears off. You can use a large language model to compose an email or a story—but not a particularly original one. The tools still hallucinate (meaning they confidently assert false information). They still fail in embarrassing and unexpected ways. Meanwhile, the web is filling up with useless “AI slop,” LLM-generated trash that costs practically nothing to produce and generates pennies of advertising revenue for the creator. We’re in a race to the bottom that everyone saw coming and no one is happy with. Meanwhile, the search for product-market fit at a scale that would justify all the inflated tech-company valuations keeps coming up short. Even OpenAI’s latest release, o1, was accompanied by a caveat from Altman that “it still seems more impressive on first use than it does after you spend more time with it.” In Altman’s rendering, this moment in time is just a waypoint, “the doorstep of the next leap in prosperity.” He still argues that the deep-learning technique that powers ChatGPT will effectively be able to solve any problem, at any scale, so long as it has enough energy, enough computational power, and enough data. Many computer scientists are skeptical of this claim, maintaining that multiple significant scientific breakthroughs stand between us and artificial general intelligence. But Altman projects confidence that his company has it all well in hand, that science fiction will soon become reality. He may need $7 trillion or so to realize his ultimate vision—not to mention unproven fusion-energy technology—but that’s peanuts when compared with all the advances he is promising. There’s just one tiny problem, though: Altman is no physicist. He is a serial entrepreneur, and quite clearly a talented one. He is one of Silicon Valley’s most revered talent scouts. If you look at Altman’s breakthrough successes, they all pretty much revolve around connecting early start-ups with piles of investor cash, not any particular technical innovation. Read: OpenAI takes its mask off It’s remarkable how similar Altman’s rhetoric sounds to that of his fellow billionaire techno-optimists. The project of techno-optimism, for decades now, has been to insist that if we just have faith in technological progress and free the inventors and investors from pesky regulations such as copyright law and deceptive marketing, then the marketplace will work its magic and everyone will be better off. Altman has made nice with lawmakers, insisting that artificial intelligence requires responsible regulation. But the company’s response to proposed regulation seems to be “no, not like that.” Lord, grant us regulatory clarity—but not just yet. At a high enough level of abstraction, Altman’s entire job is to keep us all fixated on an imagined AI future so we don’t get too caught up in the underwhelming details of the present. Why focus on how AI is being used to harass and exploit children when you can imagine the ways it will make your life easier? It’s much more pleasant fantasizing about a benevolent future AI, one that fixes the problems wrought by climate change, than dwelling upon the phenomenal energy and water consumption of actually existing AI today. Remember, these technologies already have a track record. The world can and should evaluate them, and the people building them, based on their results and their effects, not solely on their supposed potential.

    "commentBody": "It's Time to Stop Taking Sam Altman at His Word (theatlantic.com)546 points by redwoolf 6 hours agohidepastfavorite431 comments lolinder 4 hours agoTo recap OpenAI's decisions over the past year: * They burned up the hype for GPT-5 on 4o and o1, which are great step changes but nothing the competition can't quickly replicate. * They dissolved the safety team. * They switched to for profit and are poised to give Altman equity. * All while hyping AGI more than ever. All of this suggests to me that Altman is in short-term exit preparation mode, not planning for AGI or even GPT-5. If he had another next generation model on the way he wouldn't have let the media call his \"discount GPT-4\" and \"tree of thought\" models GPT-5. If he sincerely thought AGI was on the horizon he wouldn't be eyeing the exit, and he likely wouldn't have gotten rid of the superalignment team. His actions are best explained as those of a startup CEO who sees the hype cycle he's been riding coming to an end and is looking to exit before we hit the trough of disillusionment. None of this is to say that AI hasn't already changed a lot about the world we live in and won't continue to change things more. We will eventually hit the slope of enlightenment, but my bet is that Altman will have exited by then. reply lrg10aa 4 hours agoparentIt does look like an exit. Employees were given the chance to cash in some of their shares at $86 billion valuation. Altman is getting shares. New \"investors\" are Microsoft and Nvidia. Nvidia will get the money back as revenue and fuel the hype for other customers. Microsoft will probably pay in Azure credits. If OpenAI does not make profit within two years, the \"investment\" will turn into a loan, which probably means bankruptcy. But at that stage all parties have already got what they wanted. reply jameslk 3 hours agorootparent> If OpenAI does not make profit within two years, the \"investment\" will turn into a loan, which probably means bankruptcy. I don’t believe this is accurate. I think this is what you’re referring to?: Under the terms of the new investment round, OpenAI has two years to transform into a for-profit business or its funding will convert into debt, according to documents reviewed by The Times. That just means investors want the business to be converted from a nonprofit entity into a regular for-profit entity. Not that they need to make a profit in 2 years, which is not typically an expectation for a company still trying to grow and capture market share. Source: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/technology/openai-valuati... reply agentcoops 2 hours agorootparentprevI think for anyone who has been intimately involved with this last generation of \"unicorns\", it really does not look like an \"exit\" if that means bankruptcy, end of the company, betrayal of goals, or what have you: for a high-growth startup of approximately ten years, finding liquidity for employees is perhaps counter-intuitively a sign of deep maturity and that the company is concerned for the long haul (and that investors/the market believe this is likely). At about the ten year mark, there has to be a changing of the guards from the foot soldiers who give their all that an unlikely institution could come to exist in the world at scale to people concerned more with stabilizing that institution and ensuring its continuity. In almost every company that has reached such scale in the last decade, this has often meant a transition from an executive team formed of early employees to a more senior C-team from elsewhere with a different skillset. In a world context where the largest companies are more likely to stay private than IPO, it's a profoundly important move to allow some liquidity for longterm employees, who otherwise might be forced to stay working at the company long past physical burnout. reply throwup238 22 minutes agorootparentAgreed. These liquidity events are a way to retain and reward early employees while allowing the founders to recover their personal finances and buckle down for the growth phase. reply lotsofpulp 1 hour agorootparentprev> In a world context where the largest companies are more likely to stay private than IPO Which world is this? reply dash2 1 hour agorootparentFrom a Scottish Mortgage report: \"companies are staying private for longer and until higher valuations\".

But they have a whole China thing going on, so not very representative of US/European markets. I doubt any competitor to the largest businesses in US//Europe that is actually putting up good audited numbers is staying private. Even Stripe has been trying to go public, but it doesn’t have the numbers for the owners to want to yet. reply financetechbro 38 minutes agorootparentprevAgreed. OP is crossing some wires.

History generally shows that estimates of \"more than five years away\" are meaningless. reply CurrentB 2 minutes agorootparent\"a few thousand days away\" feels like such a duplicitous way to phrase something when \"a few years\" would be more natural to everyone on the planet. It just seems intentionally manipulative and not even trying to hide it.

And, if OpenAI is in a position to capture profits in an expanding AI industry, isn't this the best possible time to lock-in equity for long term gains and trillionaireship? For many people, sadly, one can never be rich enough. My point is, planning for both short term exit, and long term gains, is essentially the same in this particular situation. What a boon! Nice problem to have! reply mirekrusin 2 hours agorootparentFor some people the question \"how much?\" has only one answer – \"more.\" reply gizmo 1 hour agorootparentprevSam was already a billionaire years ago. He is one of SV most prolific investors, with equity in hundreds of startups. He writes big checks as well from time to time, Helion for instance he gave 375 million. reply andrewinardeer 1 minute agorootparentMy understanding is Altman joined the Three Comma Club only this year not years ago. Yes, he has made lots of investments over the years as head of YC but not every investment was successful. This was discussed on BBC's podcast 'Good Billionaire Bad Billionaire' recently. reply GolfPopper 1 hour agorootparentprevTo be clear, Altman invested $375 million in Helion Energy's 2021 funding round. Helion Energy a for-profit fusion energy company of which he is the chairman. reply VirusNewbie 1 hour agorootparentprevHow? He did not have a large exit to give him a bankroll to invest. Unless you mean from whatever YC shares he received as President, which seems unlikely. Even if he was paid ~25 million in equity per year, did YC shares increase 10x in that time? reply danga 1 hour agorootparentprevHe also got weird facial plastic surgery and looks like a wanted mobster now. reply falcor84 33 minutes agoparentprev> ... 4o and o1, which are great step changes but nothing the competition can't quickly replicate. Where did that assertion come from? Has anyone come close to replicating either of these yet (other than possibly Google, who hasn't fully released their thing yet either), let alone \"quickly\"? I wouldn't be surprised if it's these \"sideways\" architectural changes actually give OpenAI a deeper moat than just working on larger models. reply dcre 27 minutes agorootparentClaude 3.5 Sonnet is at least as good as 4o. reply karmakaze 3 hours agoparentprevLet's go with the no next gen models, then we'd be looking at an operationalized service. I might be up for paying $20/month for one. Certainly more value than I get from Netflix. All I would want from the service is a simple low-friction UI and continued improvements to keep up with or surpass competitors. They could manage that. The long-term problem may be access to quality/human-created training data. Especially if the ones that control that data have AI plans of their own. Even then I could see OpenAI providing service to many of them rather than each of them creating their own models. reply from-nibly 3 hours agorootparentI doubt $20 a month is going to cover it. How much would you.pay before you weren't getting a good deal? reply wkat4242 2 hours agorootparentThe thing is, you can be economical. You don't need a GPT-4 quality model for everything. Some things are just low value where a 3.5 model would do just fine. I never use the $20 plan but I access everything via API and i spend a couple of dollars per month. Although lately I have a home server that can do llama 3.1 8b uncensored and that actually works amazingly well. reply titanomachy 2 hours agorootparentprevIf we’re talking about inference costs alone (minimal new training) I think it would cover it. I started doing usage-based pricing through openrouter instead of paying monthly subscriptions, and my modest LLM use costs me about $3/month. Unless you think that the API rates are also priced below cost. reply mikeocool 49 minutes agorootparentAccording the New York Times [1], OpenAI told investors that they're costs are increasing as more people use their product, and they are planning to increase the cost of ChatGPT from $20 to $44 over the next five years. That certainly suggests that they're selling inference at a loss right now.

Couldn't the AGI manage itself better than you could? Job's done, time to get a different hobby. reply Zondartul 1 minute agorootparentIf we figure out AGI, that still doesn't mean a singularity. I'm going to speak as though we're on the brink of AI outthinking every human on earth (we are not) but bear with me, I want to make it clear we're not going jobless any time soon. For starters, we still need the AI (LLMs for now) to be more efficient, i.e. not require a datacenter to train and deploy. Yes, I know there are tiny models you can run on your home pc, but that's comparing a bycicle to a jet. Second, for an AGI it meaningfully improve itself, it has to be smarter than not just any one person, but the sum total of all people it took to invent it. Until then no single AI can replace our human tech sphere of activity. As long as there are limits to how smart an AI can get, there are places where humans can contribute economically. If there is ever to be a singularity, it's going to be a slow one, and large human AI vompanies will be part of the process for many decades still. reply azinman2 4 hours agorootparentprevLet’s say you got AGI, and it approximated a not so bright impulsive 12 year old boy. That would be an insane technological leap, but hardly one you’d want running the show. AGI doesn’t mean smarter than the best humans. reply richardw 2 hours agorootparentA 12 year old that doesn’t sleep, eat, or forget, learns anything within seconds, can replicate and work together with fast as light communication and no data loss when doing so. Arrives out of the womb knowing everything the internet knows. Can work on one problem until it gets it right. Doesn’t get stale or old. Only had emotion if it’s useful. Can do math and simulate. Doesn’t get bored. Can theoretically improve its own design and run experiments with aforementioned focus, simulation ability, etc. What could you do at 12, with half of these advantages? Choose any of them, then give yourself infinite time to use them. reply bad_user 32 minutes agorootparentA 12 year old that doesn't interact with the world. Many believe that AGI will happen in robots, and not in online services, simply because interacting with the environment might be a prerequisite for developing consciousness. You mentioned boredom, which is interesting, as boredom may also be a trait of intelligence. An interesting question is if it will want to live at all. Humans have all these pleasure sensors and programming for staying alive and reproducing. The unburdened AGI in your description might not have good reasons to live. Marvin, the depressed robot, might become real. reply cdchn 23 minutes agorootparent>simply because interacting with the environment might be a prerequisite for developing consciousness.

Technically no, but practically... 12 year old limitations are: A. gets tired, needs sleep B. I/O limited by muscles Probably there are more, but if 12 year old could talk directly to electric circuits and would not need sleep or even a break, then that 12 year old would be leaps and bounds above the best human in his field of interest. (Well motivation to finish the task is needed though) reply prng2021 2 hours agorootparentprevIf it's stuck at 12 year old level intelligence then it's not generally intelligent. 12 years can learn to think like 13 year olds and so on. reply azinman2 2 hours agorootparentA set of weights siting on your hard disk don’t evolve to get smarter on their own. AGI does however require the ability to learn new skills in new domains; if you kept exposing it I don’t see why it wouldn’t be similar. But fundamental capacities in how good it is a reasoning / planning don’t have to exceed any given human to be considered AGI. reply esskay 1 hour agorootparentprevWhat stops it getting more intelegent? That's litterally its primary aim. Its only limit as to how quickly it does that is hardware capacity, and I'd be shocked if it didn't somehow theorise to itself that it can and should expand its knowledge in any way possible. reply echoangle 1 hour agorootparentWhy would the only limit be hardware capacity? Can’t there be an innate limit due to the model size/architecture? Maybe LLMs can’t be superintelligent because they are missing a critical ability which can’t be overcome with any amount of training? It’s not obvious to me that it’s going to get smarter infinitely. reply __MatrixMan__ 4 hours agorootparentprevFor an intelligence to be \"General\" there would have to be no type of intelligence that it did not have access to (even if its capabilities in that domain were limited). The idea that that's what humans have strikes me as the same kind of thinking that led us to believe that earth was in the center of the universe. Surely there are ways of thinking that we have no concept of. General intelligence would be like an impulsive 12 year old boy who could see 6 spatial dimensions and regarded us as cartoons for only sticking to 3. reply throwaway314155 3 hours agorootparentHumans can survive in space and on the moon because our intelligence is robust to environments we never encountered (or evolved to encounter). That's \"all\" general intelligence is meant to refer to. General just means robust to the unknown. I've seen some use \"super\" (as in superhuman) intelligence lately to describe what you're getting at. reply __MatrixMan__ 2 hours agorootparentSuper feels to me like it's a difference in degree rather than in kind. Something with intelligences {A, b, c} might be super intelligent compared with {a, b, c}. i.e. more intelligent in domain A. But if one has {a, b, c} and the other has {b, c, d} neither is more or less intelligent than the other, they just have different capabilities. \"Super\" is a bit too one-dimensional for the job. reply Triphibian 3 hours agorootparentprevAll it would want to do is talk about Minecraft and the funny memes they saw. reply nobodyandproud 3 hours agorootparentprevThis is great insight. Science fiction does a great job inspiring technology research, but we forget that real-world accomplishments can be much humbler and still astonishing all the same. I'm a bit tired of the hype surrounding LLMs, but all the same for very mundane and humbler tasks that require some intelligence modern LLMs manage to surprise me on a daily basis. But it rarely accomplishes more than what a small collection of humans with some level of expertise can achieve, when asked. reply Nevermark 2 hours agorootparentOr accomplishments can genuinely be astounding. Surely, the LLM models we have today are astounding by any measure, relative to just a few years ago. But pronouncements of how this will lead to utopia, without introducing a major revision of economic arrangements, are completely, and surely intentionally/conveniently (Sam isn't an idiot) misleading. Is OpenAI creating a class of stock so everyone can share in their gains? If not, then AGI owned by OpenAI will make OpenAI shareholders rich, very much to the degree its AGI eliminates human jobs for itself and other corporations. How does that, as an economic situation, result in the general population being able to do anything beyond be a customer, assuming they can still make money in some way not taken over by AGI? Utopia needs an actual plan. Not a concept of a plan. The latter just keeps people snowed and calm before an historic level rug pull. reply lolinder 4 hours agorootparentprevIf such a thing was right around the corner, the person who controlled it would be the only person left who had any kind of control over their own future. Why would you sell that? reply __MatrixMan__ 4 hours agorootparentI'm not a believer in general intelligence myself, all we have are a small pile of specific intelligences. But if it does exists then it would be godlike to us. I can't guess at the motivations of somebody who would want to bootstrap a god, but I doubt that Altman is so strapped for cash that his primary motivator is coming up with something to sell. reply SoftTalker 2 hours agorootparentprevAltman's AGI is Musk's full self-driving car. reply nobodyandproud 3 hours agorootparentprevAs other comments have mentioned, AGI doesn't mean god-like or super-human intelligence. For these models today, if we measure the amount of energy expended for training and inference how do humans compare? reply jdiez17 2 hours agorootparentI did a similar calculation a few weeks ago: Humans consume about 100W average power (2000 kcal to watt hours/24 hours). So 8 billion people consume ~800 GW. Call it 1 TW. Average world electric power generation is 28000 TWh / (24*365 hours) ~3 TW. reply ben_w 3 hours agorootparentprev> For these models today, if we measure the amount of energy expended for training and inference how do humans compare? My best guess is 120,000 times more for training GPT-4 (based on claim it cost $63 million and that was all electricity at $0.15/kWh and looking only at the human brain and not the whole body). But also, 4o mini would then be a killowatt hour for a million tokens at inference time, by the same assumptions that's 50 hours or just over one working week of brain energy consumption. A million tokens over 50 hours is 5.5 tokens per second, which sounds about what I expect a human brain to do, but caveat that with me not being a cognitive scientist and what we think we're thinking isn't necessarily what we're actually thinking. reply FrustratedMonky 3 hours agorootparentprev\"why would you need a company for it? Couldn't the AGI manage itself better than you could?\" Well, you still have to have the baby, and raise it a little. And wouldn't you still want to be known as the parent of such a bright kid as AGI? Leaving early seems to be cutting down on his legacy, if a legacy was coming. reply wildermuthn 1 hour agoparentprevThe only reason Sam would leave OpenAI is if he thought AGI could only be achieved elsewhere, or that AGI was impossible without some other breakthrough in another industry (energy, hardware, etc). High-intelligence AGI is the last human invention — the holy grail of technology. Nothing could be more ambitious, and if we know anything about Altman, it is that his ambition has no ceiling. Having said all of that, OpenAI appears to be all in on brute-force AGI and swallowing the bitter lesson that vast and efficient compute is all you need. But they’ve overlooking a massive dataset that all known biological intelligences rely upon: qualia. By definition, qualia exist only within conscious minds. Until we train models on qualia, we’ll be stuck with LLMs that are philosophical zombies — incapable of understanding our world — a world that consists only of qualia. Building software capable of utilizing qualia requires us to put aside the hard problem of consciousness in favor of mechanical/deterministic theories of consciousness like Attention-Schema Theory (AST). Sure, we don’t understand qualia. We might never understand. But that doesn’t mean we can’t replicate. reply woodruffw 1 hour agorootparent> Sure, we don’t understand qualia. We might never understand. But that doesn’t mean we can’t replicate. I’m pretty sure it means exactly that. Without actually understanding subjective experience, there’s a fundamental doubt akin to the Chinese room. Sweeping that under the carpet and declaring victory doesn’t in fact victory make. reply wildermuthn 1 hour agorootparentIf the universe is material, then we already know with 10-billion percent certainty that some arrangement of matter causes qualia. All we have to do is figure out what arrangements do that. Ironically, we understand consciousness perfectly. It is literally the only thing we know — conscious experience. We just don’t know, yet, how to replicate it outside of biological reproduction. reply talldayo 1 hour agorootparentprev> High-intelligence AGI is the last human invention Citation? ...or are you just assuming that AGI will be able to solve all of our problems, appropos of nothing but Sam Altman's word? I haven't seen a single credible study suggest that AGI is anything more than a marketing term for vaporware. reply mrmetanoia 1 hour agorootparentTheir marketing hyperbole has cheapened much of the language around AI, so naturally it excites someone who writes like the disciple of the techno-prophets \" High-intelligence AGI is the last human invention\" What? I could certainly see all kinds of entertaining arguments for this, but to write it so matter of fact was cringe inducing. reply wildermuthn 49 minutes agorootparentIt’s true by definition. If we invent a better-than-all-humans inventor, then human invention will give way. It’s a fairly simple idea, and not one I made up. reply bitshiftfaced 1 hour agoparentprev> All while hyping AGI more than ever. Maybe not, since Altman pretty much said they no longer want to think it terms of \"how close to AGI?\". Iirc, he said they're moving away from that and instead want to move towards describing the process as hitting new specific capabilities incrementally. reply hintymad 1 hour agoparentprev> They dissolved the safety team. I still don't get the safety team. Yes, I understand the need for a business to moderate the content they provide and rightly so. But elevating the safety to the level of the survival of humanity over a generative model, I'm not so sure. And even for so-called preventing harmful content, how can an LLM be more dangerous than the access of the books like The Anarchist Cookbook, the pamphlets on how to conduct guerrilla warfare, the training materials of how to do terrorisms, and etc? They are easily accessible on the internet, no? reply lolinder 1 hour agorootparentHaving a dedicated safety team (or as they called it \"superalignment\") makes sense if and only if you believe that your company is pursuing an actual sci-fi style artificial superintelligence that could put humanity itself at risk [0]: > Superintelligence will be the most impactful technology humanity has ever invented, and could help us solve many of the world’s most important problems. But the vast power of superintelligence could also be very dangerous, and could lead to the disempowerment of humanity or even human extinction. > How do we ensure AI systems much smarter than humans follow human intent? This is a question that naturally arises if you are pursuing something that's superhuman, and a question that's pointless if you believe you're likely to get a really nice algorithm for solving certain kinds of problems that were hard to solve before.

Part of why I believe Altman is looking to cash out is that I think he's smart enough to recognize that he has no moat and a very small lead. His efforts to get governments to pull up the ladder have largely failed, so the next logical choice is to exit at peak valuation rather than waiting for investors to recognize that OpenAI is increasingly just one in a crowd.

My main point is that OpenAI's current market position and strong brand awareness are the real differentiators. They're in a unique spot where they have the user's attention, which offers a range of monetization options beyond just ads. The challenge for them will be to balance monetization with maintaining the user experience that made them successful in the first place. Also, don't forget the recent Apple partnership [1], a very strong signal of their strategic positioning. Aligning with Apple reinforces their credibility and opens up even more opportunities for innovation and expansion, beyond just monetizing through ads. I just searched through this thread, and it seems the Apple partnership isn't being recognized as a significant achievement under Sam Altman's tenure as CEO, which is surprising given its importance.

The real story of LLMs is revealed when you posit a magical technology that can print any car part for free. How would the car industry change if someone made a 3D printer that could make any part, including custom parts, with just electricity and air? It is a sea change to manufacturers and distributors, but there would still be a need for mechanics and engineers to specify the correct parts, in the correct order, and use the parts to good purpose. It is easy to imagine that the inventor of such a technology would probably start talking about printing entire cars - and if you don't think about it, it makes sense. But if you think about it, there are problems. Making the component of a solution is quite different than composing a solution. LLMs exist in the same conditions. Being able to generate code/text/images is of no use to someone who doesn't know what to do with it. I also think this limitation is a practical, tacit solution to the alignment problem. reply theptip 3 hours agoparentThis argument simply asserts that the LLMs (or their successor systems including scaffolding) will asymptote somewhere below human capabilities.

I tend to agree with them. What people seem to miss about LLM coding systems, IMO: a) deciding on the capabilities of an LLM to code after a brief browser session with 4o/claude is comparable to waking up a coder in the middle of the night, and having them recite the perfect code right then and there. So a lot of people interact with it that way, decide it's meh, and write it off. b) most people haven't tinkered with with systems that incorporate more of the tools human developers use day to day. They'd be surprised of what even small, local models can do. c) LLMs seem perfectly capable to always add another layer of abstraction on top of whatever \"thing\" they get good at. Good at summaries? Cool, now abstract that for memory. Good at q/a? Cool, now abstract that over document parsing for search. Good at coding? Cool, now abstract that over software architecture. d) Most people haven't seen any RL-based coding systems yet.

I think the story of the development of the blue LED which led to modern LED lighting is more illustrative of the real obstacles of technological development. Companies/managers don't want to invest in R&D bc it’s too uncertain and they typically are more interested in the short term. And it’s hard for someone without deep technical knowledge to identify a realistic worthwhile technical idea from a bad one. So they focus on what they can understand and what they can quantify ().

We have a very limited ability to define human intelligence, so it is almost impossible to know how near or far we are from simulating it.

There are people in power that may take technologists and technology executives at their word and move very large amounts of capital on promises that cannot be fulfilled. There was already an AI Winter 50 years ago, and there are extremely unethical figures in technology right now who can ruin the reputation of our field for a generation. On the other hand, we have very large numbers of people around the world on the wrong end of a large and increasing wealth gap. Many of those people are just hanging on doing jobs that are actually threatened by AI. They know this, they fear this, and of course they will fight for their and their families lifestyles.

I keep hearing from people who find these enormous benefits from LLMs. I've been liking them as a search engine (especially finding things buried in bad documentation), but can't seem to find the life-changing part. reply vbezhenar 4 hours agorootparent1. Search engine replacement. I'm using it for many queries I asked Google before. I still use Google, but less often. 2. To break procrastination loops. For example I often can't name a particular variable, because I can see few alternatives and I don't like all of them. Nowadays I just ask ChatGPT and often proceed with his opinion. 3. Navigating less known technologies. For example my Python knowledge is limited and I don't really use it often, so I don't want to spend time to better learn it. ChatGPT is just perfect for that kind of tasks, because I know what I want to get, I just miss some syntax nuances and I can quickly check the result. Another example is jq, it's very useful tool, but its syntax is arcane and I can't remember it even after years of occasional tinkering with it. ChatGPT builds jq programs like a super-human, I just show example JSON and what I want to get. 4. Not ChatGPT, but I think Copilot is based on GPT4, and I use Copilot very often as a smart autocomplete. I didn't really adopt it as a code writing tool, I'm very strict at code I produce, but it still helps a lot with repetitive fragments. Things I had to spend 10-20 minutes before, construction regexps or using editor macroses, I can now do with Copilot in 10-20 seconds. For languages like Golang where I must write `if err != nil` after every line, it also helps not to become crazy. May be I didn't formulate my thoughts properly. It's not anything irreplaceable and I didn't become 10x programmer. But those tools are very nice and absolutely worth every penny I paid for it. It's like Intellij Idea.

Respectfully but that's a bit like saying you don't need to learn how to ride a bicycle because you can use a pair of safety wheels. It's an excuse to not learn something, to keep yourself less knowledgeable and skillful than you could really be. Why stunt yourself? Knowledge is power. See it this way: anyone can use ChatGPT but not everyone knows Python well, so you 'll never be able to use ChatGPT to compete with someone who knows Python well. You + limited knowledge of Python + ChatGPTand you'll never be able to escape it. Slow down, cowboy. Getting a LLM to generate code for you that is immediately useful and doesn't require you to think too hard about it can stunt learning, sure, but even just reading it and slowly getting familiar with how the code works and how it relates to your original task is helpful. I learned programming by looking at examples of code that did similar things to what I wanted, re-typing it, and modifying it a bit to suit my needs. From that point of view it's not that different. I've seen a couple of cases first hand of people with no prior experience with programming learn a bit by asking ChatGPT to automate some web scraping tasks or spreadsheet manipulation. > You + limited knowledge of Python + ChatGPTRespectfully but that's a bit like saying you don't need to learn how to ride a bicycle because you can use a pair of safety wheels.

And I could say this about just about every domain of my life. I've trained myself to ask it about everything that poses a question or a challenge, from creating recipes to caring for my indoor Japanese maple tree to preparing for difficult conversations and negotiations.

Two things he said really stuck with me: First, he mentioned wishing he was more into AI. While I appreciate the honesty, it was pretty off-putting. Here’s the CEO of a company building arguably the most consequential technology of our time, and he’s expressing apathy? That bugs me. Sure, having a dispassionate leader might have its advantages, but overall, his lack of enthusiasm left a bad taste in my mouth. Why IS he the CEO then? Second, he talked about going on a “world tour” to meet ChatGPT users and get their feedback. He actually mentioned meeting them in pubs, etc. That just sounded like complete BS. It felt like politician-level insincerity—I highly doubt he’s spoken with any end-users in a meaningful way. And one more thing: Altman being a well-known ‘prepper’ doesn’t sit well with me. No offense to preppers, but it gives me the impression he’s not entirely invested in civilization’s long-term prospects. Fine for a private citizen, but not exactly reassuring for the guy leading an organization that could accelerate its collapse. reply Schiendelman 2 hours agoparentHi there! I've done a huge amount of political organizing in my life, for common good - influencing governments to build tens of billions of dollars worth of electric rail infrastructure.

Whether it's a gas main break, a forest fire, an earthquake, or a sci-fi story, encouraging people to become resilient to disaster is incredibly beneficial for society as a whole, and very necessary for individuals. The vast, vast majority of people who do it are benefiting their entire community by doing so. Even, as much as I'm sure I'd dislike him if I met him, Sam Altman.

Building resilience is beneficial for both individuals and communities, and I can see how it plays an important role, especially in situations like the ones you mentioned in NC. My issue, though, is with someone like Sam Altman—a leader of an organization that could potentially accelerate the downfall of civilization—being so deeply invested in prepping. Altman isn’t just a regular guy preparing for emergencies; he’s an incredibly wealthy individual who has openly discussed stockpiling machine guns and setting up private land he can retreat to at a moment’s notice. It’s that level of preparation, combined with his position at the helm of one of the most consequential tech companies, that doesn’t sit well with me. It feels like he’s hedging against the very future his company might be shaping. reply s1artibartfast 2 hours agorootparent>It feels like he’s hedging against the very future his company might be shaping. I dont think the prepping can really be taken as evidence anything nefarious. Prepping simply means someone thinks there is a risk with hedging against, even if they are strongly opposed to that outcome. I think you see many of the rich prepping because they can, but It says little about their desire for catastrophic events. Prepping for a hurricane doesn't mean you want it to destroy your neighborhood. reply cowmix 1 hour agorootparentI don’t think ultra-wealthy preppers want catastrophic events to happen, and I agree that prepping in itself isn’t nefarious. My concern is more about the mindset it can encourage. When someone like Altman—who has significant influence over the future of technology—starts focusing on a solid “Plan B,” it might lead them to take more risks, consciously or unconsciously. Having what they believe is a safe fallback could make them more comfortable pushing boundaries in ways that could accelerate instability. It’s not about wanting disaster, but rather how preparing for one might subtly shift decision-making. For instance, “AI safety team.. who needs it? amirite?!” reply Schiendelman 2 hours agorootparentprevEvery tech CEO (and honestly almost every wealthy person) is doing the same thing. You're mistaking correlation for causation. reply GolfPopper 2 hours agorootparentprevThere's a difference between resilience and being prepared for the unexpected on one hand (a go-bag (for sudden travel, not Mad Max), on- and off-site backups of data & physical documents, a couple weeks of food & water, an emergency expenses account separate from savings, plus physical currency) and, on the other hand, being under the delusion that hiding in a super-stocked bunker is any sort of acceptable answer to the possible collapse of civilization. And Altman is definitely in the latter camp with, \"But I have guns, gold, potassium iodide, antibiotics, batteries, water, gas masks from the Israeli Defense Force, and a big patch of land in Big Sur I can fly to.\"[1] That a guy who says the above, and also says that AI may be an existential threat to humanity, also runs the world's most prominent AI company is disturbing. 1. https://futurism.com/the-byte/openai-ceo-survivalist-prepper reply s1artibartfast 1 hour agorootparentWouldn't you prefer someone fearful of the apocalypse and who takes it seriously running such a company over someone who is ambivalent or doesn't consider it a risk? reply GolfPopper 1 hour agorootparentHe doesn't seem fearful of the apocalypse. He seems to consider preparing for it to be a fun hobby. reply s1artibartfast 1 hour agorootparentThat's not my take. I think prepping is a pretty strong indication of concern.

It’s just fun to organize and plan and has nothing to do with alex jones selling me on the frogs turning gay.

I learned a lot through the process - but I definitely went outside the guardrails. I use NixOS as my daily driver and found myself curious of whether I could complete LFS using a \"Nix\" approach. I was only a basic Nix user at that time and that choice made a difficult process much more difficult. However, the declarative nature of Nix meant that I had clear notes of every step of my process - and if something didn't work, I could backtrack and troubleshoot to find the root of the cause. The end result is here [0]. My understanding of Linux, of bootstrapping, cross-compilation, and Nix has grown tremendously as a result of the time I took on this project - and I still go back and reference the work from time to time. When I get some time to revisit the Nix-based LFS project, there are quite a few things I would like to clean-up, including setting kernel configs and handling post-build permissions. Nix-complexities aside, I highly recommend LFS if you like to understand how things work and don't mind a little suffering along the way.

Have you considered making a presentation or a write-up of the experience? reply cloudripper 7 minutes agorootparentThanks for the input. A couple of folks suggested that recently as well. Once I can clear up some bandwidth, I do intend to follow through on that. It gave me a huge appreciation for Nix as a build system, and I would love to share that if it were helpful to others. reply dvno42 2 hours agoprevBetween LFS and Stage 1 and 2 Gentoo installs back in the early 2000s during High School, this gave me a big leg up in my journey of learning about computers and Linux. I can't thank those project maintainers enough for helping me get my footing at such a young age and peaking my interest in computing. I ended up printing out the LFS book in segments on one of the printers in High School and brought it home in pieces to use on the home computer. reply tehf0x 2 hours agoparentAmen to that! 20 years later this was my gateway drug into being addicted to computers and gave me my full stack understanding I still use every day at work.I ended up printing out the LFS book in segments on one of the printers in High School and brought it home in pieces to use on the home computer. I am actually flabbergasted there's another human being on Earth that has this exact same story as me. I used one of those giant 3 ring legal binders for my printed copy, lmao. reply sieste 8 hours agoprevI really like the idea, really tried following the process several times. But each time it just turned into a copy-incomprehensible-commands-into-the-terminal exercise at some point, and I lost motivation. Did anyone experience the same? reply aflukasz 4 hours agoparentIt feels to me like you have approached this with a wrong mindset, like you focused too much on finishing the whole process. With LFS you must put substantial amount of value into the journey itself. It's not about copy-pasting commands, it's about trying to actually understand what and, more importantly, why your are doing each step. My recollection is that LFS docs were good in helping with that. Or maybe it was coming from reading docs of the actual components as I went along? I don't remember, probably some mix of both. I did set LFS system up once, I think it was 2001 or 2002. I specifically remember that it took many days (due to compilation times), was very interesting, and at the end I was putting final touches to my mutt and slrn configs. With a vague memory that I had some TODO for mutt that I didn't finish, still lingering in my mind, apparently! :) All in all, great and satisfying learning experience. I would not use such system as a daily driver, though. I think it's good only if you have time and want to learn. I'm curious if someone here is brave enough to have different approach. reply oorza 1 hour agorootparentLFS to a computer scientist should be like soap to a chemist. Something you can do as a fun, educational experiment, but not where you source a necessary tool for your life. reply vbezhenar 7 hours agoparentprevI built my LFS around 20 years ago. While I followed instructions most of the time, I built some components myself. I remember that I wrote by own init scripts and I think I wrote my own initramfs (not completely sure about it, but I definitely remember tinkering with it and it probably was LFS). I also wanted to implement an isolated build system and my own package manager (basically tar wrapper with file database to be able to uninstall, no fancy dependency stuff), but containers were not invented back then and my skills were not good enough to properly utilize fakeroot, so it never was implemented, although I spent some time experimenting. Today I would do it with docker, exciting time. reply johnisgood 5 hours agorootparentWanting to (and doing it) make my own package manager because of LFS and minimalism in general, good times. reply kobalsky 5 hours agoparentprevI grabbed a random page from the manual: https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable-systemd/cha... Every step is explained and every used parameter is documented. reply ruszki 5 minutes agorootparentI would say \"explained\". As a layman, who worked with linux previously (and even tried LFS a long time ago), but definitely don't have a deep understanding of linux, and eve my knowledge is not up-to-date: The sed command is not explained at all. Even the description is non-sense if you don't know already what they are talking about. What is this \"default directory\", why do you need to set it, why there and only there, why that command works? Even the command itself is something, which I need to check the manual what the heck it does, because it's not a simple one. > -enable-default-pie and --enable-default-ssp The description is almost unusable. So we don't need it, but it's \"cleaner\", which in this context means exactly nothing. So what happens if I left out? Nothing? Then why should I care? > --disable-multilib Okay, it doesn't support \"something\". I have no idea what is multilib, or why I should care. Basically the next arguments' description tells me that because it wouldn't work the compilation otherwise. And then.. > --disable-threads, --disable-libatomic, --disable-libgomp, --disable-libquadmath, --disable-libssp, --disable-libvtv, --disable-libstdcxx But why would they fail? I want to understand what's happening here, and I need to blindly trust the manual because they just tell me, that \"they won't work, believe us\". > --enable-languages=c,c++ Why are these the only languages which we need? What are the other languages? So at the end, descriptions are not really helping to understand what's happening, if you don't know already. The last time when I started LFS (about 10 years ago), that was my main problem. That you already need to know almost everything to understand what's really happening, and why, or reading manuals, or trying to find basically unsearchable information (like why libatomic compiling would fail at this step). So after a while, I started the blind copy-pasting, because I didn't have the patience of literary months, and when I realized that this was pointless, I gave up. reply andrewmcwatters 1 hour agorootparentprevYou grabbed a random page. reply noufalibrahim 6 hours agoparentprevI haven't tried this but I have used https://github.com/MichielDerhaeg/build-linux during my trainings and all my students quite enjoyed the experience. It basically builds a Kernel, libc, busybox, init etc. and gets the whole thing running inside qemu. I found it quite educational and worth the little time I spent on it. reply pushupentry1219 8 hours agoparentprevWhen I was in highschool I had a bunch of free time outside of school days. I used a YouTube guide to install Arch. I failed many many times. But in doing so I almost kind of learnt what each command was doing. I had the same experience when I installed Gentoo. In both cases at first I was copy/pasting commands, but through failure I ended up understanding a lot of what the commands did. And what someone else said below is true as well, actually try and force yourself to understand what you're typing. Even briefly just scanning a man page helps a lot. reply bee_rider 5 hours agorootparentI wonder if the wiki would have been an easier start, than YouTube. YouTube is nice for learning things with a visual component, but installing Linux is all text, all the time. The ability to easily hop around and re-read sections on the wiki where necessary (I mean, jumping around is possible on YouTube of course, but it is really easy on the wiki) seem like it would be a big help. reply pino82 2 hours agorootparentReading and actually understanding non-trivial text is hard if you are part of a generation that was never challenged to actually learn it. For those people, YouTube (and a few similar shops) are the default way to consume any content. That's what they do all the time. Sure, they somehow know those legacy emojis that you call the latin alphabet. It will just not lead to a deep understanding of text. Another aspect is probably that watching YT clips always has a feeling of being part of something. Some movement, some bubble, some society, whatever. They don't install Arch bcs they want to learn sth, or make some use of the OS. They do it _because_ they found it on YT and they want to be part of it. Maybe they even write comments or make a 'reaction' video. Today it's Arch, tomorrow it's a special pizza recipe from that other guy on Insta. It doesn't really matter. reply bee_rider 2 hours agorootparentI dunno. I’m a millennial so all sorts of stuff was just ascribed to my generation. As a result, I tend to just assume these differences are overstated. I worked with college students fairly recently. They did often reach reflexively for video. But when the written material was good enough, they used it. reply chgs 1 hour agorootparentUs millenials are old. My 43rd birthday is coming up fast. College students are the next generation. Most millenials remember dialup or at most a time before mainstream streaming video. College students today have seen their formative years being constantly on with instant access to more material in any format they want than they could ever grasp the concept of. reply bee_rider 1 hour agorootparentYeah, I was just abstracting from the experience of having everything I did attributed to my generation, and then applying that experience to the next generation. They handle some things a little differently and sometimes reach for different defaults, but in the end, it isn’t like they are coming from some totally alien planet or anything like that. reply mnahkies 4 hours agoparentprevLast time I tried (probably well over 10 years ago) I struggled more with how long stuff took to compile. The main learning I remember from it was the chroot concept, which then later helped me grasp containerization easier reply pipes 8 hours agoparentprevYes this and endlessly unzipping things. I gave up after many many hours. I doubt I learned much from it. reply zvmaz 6 hours agoparentprev> Did anyone experience the same? I tried several times, and tried again just recently.

I did this a long time ago, and 15 years later, I realise that it gave me a big advantage over my colleagues who haven't done something like that. \"missing xxxxx.so\" - they don't even know what that means, whereas I'm already trying to find the so and putting it in ld_library_path to see if it helps. reply spockz 7 hours agorootparentIn my experience, whenever a .so was missing it was either due to a missing package on the os package manager level, or a completely broken gcc or llvm setup. I never needed to explicitly add single .so files to a path. (Besides the use case where I specifically wanted to override a malloc implementation.) In which cases did/do you need to add individual files? reply nmoura 4 hours agorootparentIn my case, when I was a Slackware user before Slackbuilds was created, sometimes I wanted to try out programs for which there was no package. Usually they required a .so file that was not installed and a workaround was to put it manually from a package of another distribution compiled for the same architecture. When the .so file was there, but on another path, a symbolic link was sufficient. The ldd command was a good friend. Of course that was not the best and cleanest solution, having things outside the package management system bothered, but it was enough to experiment programs and I kept track of the changes so I could have the prior state of things. Later on, the Slackbuilds project eased the work and I contributed by writing code to automate the creation of a few packages. I learned a lot from these issues. reply screcth 5 hours agorootparentprevIn my case, I work with proprietary EDA tools. Vendors love messing with LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Chaos ensues when they override a system library or two versions require mutually incompatible versions. I agree with the comment you are replying to. Having broken my home Linux installs too many times has taught me how to diagnose and fix this sort of issues. reply exe34 7 hours agorootparentprevin this case it's an in-house monstrosity that's got a lot of various languages and build systems involved, and the moment you update a compiler or build system, everything jumps into a new location for no good reasons. it was just an example though - same issue with .h not found during compilation, or using a different compiler from the system wide one. reply notorandit 5 hours agoparentprevNope. I never execute commands without understanding its meaning. Maybe you expect to complete a LFS installation in very little time.

I was young when I first did it and it took days to compile everything but it was immensely satisfying when it did fit together and I was booted into my own linux system that I built myself. I didn't understand a lot of it at the time but the pieces fit together more and more as the years go on. Overall looking back Linux from Scratch probably has made me more money than my CS degree has. reply f0e4c2f7 1 hour agoprevBuilding using LFS has been on my list of \"I really should probably do that just to learn\" for about 20 years now.

It's been amazing honestly and I feel like it has really accelerated my learning. Enough that I'm trying to get really serious about making the most out of this new leverage seemingly out of nowhere. I use it a lot for mapping out of the initial concepts but I find one of the best use cases is after understanding the basics, explaining where I need to learn more and asking for a book recommendation. The quality of my reading list has gone up 10x this way and I find myself working through multiple books a week. Great for code too obviously, though still feels like early days there to me. reply krylon 29 minutes agoprevBack in the day, I made an attempt at LFS but gave up halfway through. In my defense, I had done a gentoo stage 1 emerge earlier that year. ;-) I never intended to end up with a usable system, I was just in it for the learning experience. And I did end up learning a lot. reply ngneer 54 minutes agoprevThis brings back memories. I built LFS on a Pentium based machine a few times and it was quite fun. I took a similar approach to building a custom bare metal system for a client that needed extra security. I sometimes wish that there was a well maintained bare bones distribution inspired by the LFS philosophy, that might help with managing complexity on the cloud. Scanning the thread, NixOS came up. I used to love Slack, too. Any other recommendations? Something with minimal dependencies yet capable of being a LAMP-like server? reply Manfred 8 hours agoprevYou could argue that running through the woods doesn't teach you about trees, but it's really effective when you bring a book along. Linux From Scratch is a fun way to explore what parts make up a Linux distribution. I did this a few time long ago before switching to Gentoo and it really helped with appreciating the freedom to pick and choose details of your operating system without actually writing it from scratch. reply harha_ 8 hours agoprevWhat's the fun in this? I once looked into it briefly and it's what I guessed: mostly about building and installing the required software individually. That's boring, I guess the fun would be in building an actual usable distro \"from scratch\". reply thom 8 hours agoparentThe first run isn't much fun. There are useful skills in just knowing how to build stuff, and knowing all the constituent parts of a running system. But overall I suspect you'd learn more in a year of using Arch. But on subsequent play-throughs, you get to be creative! Want to ignore the FHS and try putting your apps somewhere weird? Want to use a different libc or init system? Build everything around an esoteric shell? Go for maximum optimisation? It's the replayability that makes Linux from Scratch fun, and yes, totally worth working out what your own distro might look like. reply coatmatter 5 hours agoparentprevI think it depends on one's true goals and the way it's approached. Compare with http://www.greenfly.org/mes.html (which affects many Arch users too, I feel) reply akdev1l 6 hours agoparentprevYou would start with LFS to build a base and then add your own package manager to make a “true” distro. If you want to just build an existing distro from scratch then they all have ways of doing that as they need to rebuild packages regularly. Eg: It’s a lot simpler to build a fedora image from scratch by using Koji/OSBuild vs LFS as Koji/OSBuild basically automate the whole LFS process. Additionally in order to have fun with LFS you don’t really need to do the whole book. You can make your own little Linux “distro” from scratch with the kernel and statically linked busybox. Busybox comes with all the minimal utilities so you can pick and choose what you want to write and what you want to reuse. reply bee_rider 5 hours agorootparentI wonder if some sort of “BSD from scratch” would be a more fruitful exercise. Since they include more of the overall system, you’d end up with something approximating a regular BSD install pretty well at the end. reply skotobaza 3 hours agoparentprevLearning how things work under the hood is fun, and you should do this if your job revolves around Linux. reply mbivert 8 hours agoparentprevYou can think of a LFS as training before actually tackling an original distribution: distributions are complex, even following the steps of a LFS won't necessarily yield a working system (lots of room for mistakes). Or, as a base to build a distribution: you can automatize some of the process, slap a pkgsrc on top, etc. For budding programmers, it's a great exercise: discover software, appreciate dependencies, understand components of a Linux distribution, learn how to build things from source, configure a kernel, etc. reply immibis 7 hours agoparentprevBuilding an actually usable distro means doing this, but every day for every package that updated, and scripting it for other people to use. reply exe34 8 hours agoparentprev> building an actual usable distro \"from scratch\". could you say a few words on how this would avoid building and installing the required software individually? are you thinking of osdev instead? reply creatonez 5 hours agorootparentI assume they were alluding to package managers, automation, and release engineering, which are somewhat covered in the LFS Hints Project (https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/) reply fefe23 2 hours agoprevLFS has been a tremendous resource over the years for me. I'm happy it exists and that people put in the time to keep it going.

Distrowatch's package list can give you an idea of what version numbers to expect: https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=lfs Once you get to the BLFS part, you have more choice on whether you're going to innovate or use something that old and in maintenance mode. For example, it has instructions for both Pulseaudio and Pipewire, Xorg and Wayland, SysVinit and systemd. The instructions will rarely be outright incorrect on modern distros unless something is very strange about your environment, since a bulk of the work is done after establishing a more predictable build environment. reply mydriasis 5 hours agoprevIf you're curious, you should try it.

Very fun, I would recommend it to anyone interested to see the complexity of making a linux distro. reply rbattula 1 hour agoprevtried lfs back in high school really fun experience and teaches you a lot reply squarefoot 8 hours agoprevRelated: https://buildroot.org/ reply stingraycharles 7 hours agoparentThis basically allows you to make an OS that’s effectively a single application, right? reply ahepp 4 hours agorootparentIt will spit out a rootfs, or even a block image for a disk, which might make it _look_ like a single application. You will probably update your system by flashing that entire rootfs/image to your target device as if it was one application. However, it is still Linux under the hood, so there is a kernel + whatever other applications you want running on there, all as separate processes. You may also be thinking of busybox, which bakes an implementation of most of gnu coreutils into one file to save space. Many symlinks are often created to that sesame file, and when invoked the process can check what name it was invoked with to determine its behavior. reply bubblesnort 7 hours agorootparentprevNo. It creates a root filesystem that follows your choices of what should be included and tries to be as minimal and small as possible by default. Very suitable for embedded devices and lightweight virtual machines. You can have it build a kernel as well. I use the ability to create a cpio archive for an initramfs on the Linux boxes. reply joezydeco 2 hours agorootparentI use buildroot to make a commercial product. It builds the bootloader, the kernel, initramfs and rootfs, and then my application(s) all installed in the right place and connected to systemd. The output is a set of images that burn into their respective partitions on eMMC. If you're a masochist, there's also Yocto. It'll build your compiler and crosstools as well as the entire system image. reply ahepp 4 hours agorootparentprevI reckon you are already aware of this if you’re using it to generate an initramfs, but for those reading along, you can also use it as a docker image reply andrewmcwatters 1 hour agoprevI remember trying to automate non-distribution builds of a functional GNU/Linux operating system and trying to not read Linux from Scratch but just official kernel.org documentation.[1] Unfortunately, the state of Linux documentation is so poor, you can't do it. You need to reference a number of third-party articles that kernel.org itself sometimes links you to. I believe kernel.org might also mention Linux from Scratch, but LFS does a very poor job of explaining why you need particular dependencies straight out of initramfs. You need a functional shell, and you need to get your installation on to an actual drive. Neither of those things are explained in sufficient detail with the current documentation available today. LFS at best says \"throw in these ingredients,\" and leaves you with no other information. You can probably read man pages and piece this stuff together, but it requires that you, at the very least, hardcode where to install files with fsck/mount/cp, I think. Edit: LFS also does a really poor job of explaining why it chooses its \"Basic System Software,\" much of which isn't actually required for a common GNU/Linux system.

What a tremendous resource. reply dark-star 5 hours agoprevI have used CLFS (Cross-Linux From Scratch) in the past a couple of times to build a Linux system for Sun UltraSPARC and SGI Octane systems. The things I learned, especially about cross-compiling, were invaluable, but you do have to invest some time understanding everything (even reading patches that you have to apply on top of build tools, for example) to get the most out of it. If you just copy/paste commands, well then there are faster/easier ways to get Linux up and running Edit: I just noted that CLFS has been dead for a couple of years now, which is sad. I would have loved to try an updated CLFS reply sirsinsalot 8 hours agoprevAh yes, I remember the year I lost to this and the pain of cross compilation. Reader beware. reply astrobe_ 5 hours agoparentI've crossed-compiled things from time-to-time along the years, and it seems to me that support has improved a bit. Some time ago it was \"cross..wut?\" but now it is fairly commonly supported and tested. I think it's thanks to Raspi and other popular ARM-based things. reply jaystraw 6 hours agoprev [–] to anyone confused why others find this fun or worthwhile, i will quote brak's dad: \"you just don't get it, das all\" reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "commentBody": "Don't squander public trust on bullshit (livboeree.substack.com)247 points by NavinF 20 hours agohidepastfavorite137 comments neilv 16 hours agoI think it's three times so far that I've removed myself from a gov't emergency alert service, due to poor use of it. Once I was awaked by an ungodly alarm noise that I didn't know my smartphone could make, and which should only be used for something apocalyptic like a tsunami warning (e.g., you have 3 minutes to get to the top of the hill, or you will probably die). Some kind of Amber Alert, to the greater metro area of millions of people. So I disabled it. And, on a local emergency alert thing, someone used it to announce a city street cleaning or routine snow removal. I then went some trouble to opt-out of the alerts, more than it took to opt-in, like they wanted me to waive liability. (Speaking of street cleaning, if only I could get the city to stop routinely driving a truck up and down the street in early morning, blaring numerous times over loudspeakers that there's a street cleaning sometime in the next couple hours, and any cars should be moved before they are towed. Rolling through the streets, making stern announcements on loudspeakers, to be heard inside homes, is what you do to announce that you have invaded the city with tanks, and anyone caught outside will be shot. Not to repeatedly wake up a neighborhood of sleep-deprived students and researchers and hospital workers, who mostly don't even own cars.) I'd think we're incapable of handling any real emergency, except I spent awhile listening in on local emergency services radio (police, fire, ambulance), and it's really impressive how on the ball in an emergency some can be. I wish some others -- who don't seem to have that training, experience, and discipline -- wouldn't grab the emergency alerts ball, and drop it. reply EasyMark 4 hours agoparentI know that presidential alarms can’t be blocked, but I have yet to find if local “real” alerts can be blocked? The entire state of Texas was awoken recently because of something that happened in a locality that didn’t really affect anyone outside of it. https://x.com/averytomascowx/status/1842146095612198944 I don’t need to know a cop is hurt 8 hours from me and the chances the perp would come into my life are bordering on infinitely small. What it can do is lead to lots of deaths because people turn off all emergency alarms because now they don’t trust the government to be decisive in sending out an alert that should have been local. Texas government definitely has a lot of joke elements to it. Evidently you can’t turn off these “Blue Alerts” unless you turn off all alerts. There has been nothing from the government about why this is allowed, only just radio silence, and they wonder why people have an axe to grind. reply c22 15 hours agoparentprevI had to disable these alerts on my devices after some similar spurious experiences. It's too bad there was no way to simply change the alert sound or volume because I might have done that. reply boneitis 14 hours agorootparentI just can't comprehend why there isn't more general backlash on this (rhetorically speaking). If the ability to disable all alerts outright wasn't a thing, I would very seriously entertain the idea of going back to a dumbphone. If given the means to change it to my normal notification sound, or heck, even my regular alarm... then sure, why not keep the alerts enabled. reply justin66 4 hours agoparentprevHeh.

To make the noise stop, you have to hit the \"ok\" button, but as soon as you hit the \"ok\" button, they disappear. So if you want to actually read it, you have to endure the loudest and most distracting noise your phone makes. It is technically possible to find the messages after dismissing them, but you have to dig through a bunch of menus, they don't show up in any default messaging app (at least on stock Pixel Android) reply wombatpm 12 hours agoparentAmber Alerts in general seem broken. It was sold on the promise of mobilizing the general population to look for missing children as soon as possible. But there is no feedback. I never get a notification that an alert has been canceled. No statistics about effectiveness. Did the alert generate tips, help solve the case? Was it something other than a custody dispute? reply missingcolours 17 hours agoprevThe root of the issue seems to be the longstanding deficiency that Texas either cannot or does not localize their emergency alerts at all. I've lived in 2 other decently large states including California and left Amber Alerts enabled because they were infrequent and caused me no trouble - and they were infrequent because you only got alerts for your immediate area. As soon as I moved to Texas I had to disable them because they're all statewide, so your phone just gets blown up with them if you disable them. Alerting a 5 mile radius about a killer on the loose is reasonable. A 600+ mile radius is not. reply hn_throwaway_99 15 hours agoparentI don't think the issue is really just localization, though, but also timing. The alert went out at 4:50 AM. I think even if it were highly localized, for what is basically a missing persons alert, most people would be pissed and just go back to bed. reply Animats 12 hours agoparentprevCalifornia had a state-wide Amber Alert once, well over a decade ago. Some department on the fringes of LA sent it, and woke up the whole state, including Northern California, 400 miles away. Millions of people annoyed. Much negative publicity. Didn't happen again. There are still Amber Alerts, but with much shorter ranges. reply ndiddy 17 hours agoparentprevTexas definitely can localize their emergency alerts.

Distance for most of these alerts should be 0 (read: not at all) reply throwaway81523 18 hours agoprevI gotta wonder if some of this is liability CYA. Like if the guy in the alert runs amuck and kills someone, the agencies will get asked \"why didn't you do X to stop him\", such as wake up everyone in Texas at 5 in the morning. I had a buddy who worked as a lifeguard at a local swimming hole. If there was a major accident (person needs immediate medical attention), they'd call an ambulance \"code three\", i.e. lights and sirens and run over any pedestrians in the way, or something like that. If the situation was less dire, they'd call it as code two, getting a less risky intervention. So of course at some point, someone in a minor accident got taken in on a code two call and developed some complications that might have been avoided with slightly less delay. IDK if there was a lawsuit or what, but from then on, even minor incidents had to be called as code 3.

And if you can't be sued for following the policy, that's guaranteed release from liability, and the public haaaaates that. Vaccine companies have release from liability, for example, because otherwise nobody would make a product which is more-or-less mandatory and guarantees at least some complications over a large enough sample size, and this has spawned an entire culture of angry conspiracy theories.

We are lucky that happened, because we humans sure as shit weren't going to improve things ourselves. reply fsckboy 13 hours agorootparentprevcountries around the world, rich and poor, pursued different public health responses, some because of choices, some had no choices. But people around the world are not getting serious covid any more, it's just not something anybody even thinks about more than say the flu. That's the attenuation of the virus and natural immunity (and you might as well lump attenutation of the virus with natural immunity because they occur on the same timescale in the same interactions), which was predictable and was predicted. The UK initially followed that idea as a strategy, and Sweden followed it, it was accepted science. The people who died with covid didn't necessarily die of covid, but public health officials followed policies of lumping them together, and govts incented them to do it: \"more money for covid\". Old and infirm people, the morbidly obese, respiratory illnesses, etc. suffered the worst, as they do from the flu. Young people were hardly affected, though young people seem to have suffered more from the vaccine side effects and the socialization developmental deficit. The conferred immunity from catching covid protects you from reinfection far longer than the so-called vaccines, because these mRNA vaccines don't work as traditional vaccines do, that's why (along with the profit motive) we were all told to start getting boosters essentially right away. When an event like this causes excess deaths, it is followed by a period with a death deficit, simply because many of people \"who were going to die soon anyway\" died early, and they aren't around to die later, it's accepted science. That has to have happened with covid because they told us those people were dying, but try to get your hands on the statistics. I'm not saying people didn't get sick from covid or that it wasn't serious, But the coverups and stonewalling stop us from getting to the truth about what happened. but it is not because of vaccinations that we don't worry about covid today, and the vaccinations we got had more side effects (in no small part because they were not tested). I knew I would get downvoted for this because there is a political class that is, in HN terms, not comfortable with people \"being curious\" about it, they'd rather censor. But since GP engaged in gratuitous soapboxing and propagandizing I thought I'd spend some karma to speak up. reply desertrider12 12 hours agorootparentWhen do you expect the death deficit to show up in mortality data? So far it looks like most (but not all) countries had an increase and then returned to the previous trendline: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-deaths-per-year. For the world's total deaths per year, it definitely looks like the area under the curve increased due to covid. reply fsckboy 2 hours agorootparent>When do you expect the death deficit to show up in mortality data? right away. I'm not an epidemiologist, but it's simple logic. A certain number of people of every age die every year. infants, toddlers, tweens, adolescents, middle aged people, old people, in each group a certain %age of people die every year of \"all cause mortality\". More old people die than young people (we're talking about rates here, % chance of dying) so, if there is a period where a whole bunch extra old people who die one year, that whole bunch extra old people are not around the very next year to die, because they're already dead. If the numbers don't add up, somebody is hiding data. the numbers absolutely should make sense. so, one explanation for what you are saying is that extra old people didn't die, it was the same number of old people; who died must have been young people, because those \"missing deaths\" will not show up in the \"normal\" death statistics for a long time. But that's not what we were told happened, so again, something is not right with the data. reply geysersam 4 hours agorootparentprevWow I haven't seen that graph before. It's very striking. It certainly shows Covid was not \"just the flu\" reply fsckboy 2 hours agorootparentyeah, but that's not a significant point. covid \"not having been the flu\" is a different statement than covid is just the flu now. the Spanish flu (1919 or whenever that was) was not \"just the flu\" either, but it burned bright and then died out in a very short time. the question is not whether covid-19 happened, it did. the question is whether our various responses did anything or much at all to help, and whether it was productive to turn it into an us/them political issue and suppress speech and criticism to maintain the facade of being right. qui bono? reply Elinvynia 11 hours agorootparentprevThere was more covid this summer than any summer before.

The media has become so partisan that each side will attack the other with equal ferocity regardless of who was right on a particular issue, so now the politicians roll the dice and most of the time they still get reelected right after their own misbehavior. The question is why the media continues to do this, given that they are clearly not benefiting from it -- their viewership/readership numbers are in the toilet, a lot of them have already gone out of business and the others are on the same trajectory. I suspect it's something like, they've cultivated a partisan audience and if they now try to be neutral, they short-term lose partisans faster than they gain moderates and then some MBA who can't think past next quarter insists that they stop.

It feels like we have to cover the same ground again and again in discussions about it, and it feels like if we could tackle this problem more generally, the benefits to society at large would be massive.

Switzerland does annual testing. The media mention the date a few days in advance (it's also something semi-static like \"the first Wednesday of month X\"), everyone knows when the test is coming, and I'm pretty sure people would pay attention if the sirens went off on any other day. Other places test much more frequently, which feels like harmfull overkill, but an annual test seems very sensible. Germany reintroduced annual testing after doing no testing for a long time and found out what you would expect (the system didn't work). It went so badly that they cancelled next year's test to be able to fix their system. A flood decided to test the system for real, the main difference in outcome being that this time the failure came with a high body count. After that, they overhauled their doomed-to-fail custom app bullshit and started using cell broadcast (like e.g. the US) and a few annual tests later, they seem to be in a somewhat better shape now. reply red_admiral 10 hours agorootparentI think some places in Germany have weekly tests, but their sirens are (or used to be before mobile phones) a way to call up the local volunteer fire brigade in smaller communities.

You also want to make sure that people know what the sirens sound like (no, they don't sound the same everywhere), and a national test day is a great opportunity to remind people how they should act if the sirens go off for real. Having them go off once a year at a pre-announced time also isn't particularly disruptive. The proper way to test this would be to also make sure that e.g. the radio stations are informed of a test scenario and broadcast it (sirens means \"turn on the radio and check for what is happening\", which means the sirens alone are useless without that part of the alerting working). This would also help if someone lives under a rock and knows how to act but forgot that testing is happening. Since this part is not being tested, I think there's a high risk that the announcement in the radio won't work in an actual emergency, and an announcement on the Internet is extremely likely to be unreachable due to overload. I think it would be ideal to actually run large scale emergency response tests (pick a small town, pick a disaster, and actually run the whole scenario, either asking people to volunteer, compensating them, or making it mandatory under a draft-like law). Yes, this would be extremely disruptive (hence a small town), but from having run emergency responses (to IT incidents, not life-or-death incidents), my experience is that any procedure that isn't regularly practiced won't work when needed, and running exercises and fixing what you find will improve this a lot. reply 01HNNWZ0MV43FF 17 hours agoparentprevThat's kinda funny, they test ours monthly around here and I still trust them cause every few years they go off for real tornado conditions reply Zamiel_Snawley 17 hours agorootparentI concur, not sure how annual testing would dilute the significance unless the fact it was a test wasn’t disclosed at all. reply swiftcoder 9 hours agoparentprevThose tests run monthly in many tornado-prone areas of the Midwest.

I think there are amber alerts (child abduction), two \"regular\" severity levels, and then \"presidential alerts\" (meant for \"the aliens have invaded\" or \"nukes inbound\"). By law, presidential alerts cannot be disabled - but users can still turn the whole feature off. I'd assume that within the US, only the president or a high-ranking delegate is authorized to send these alerts, preserving the ability for these to actually work even if local authorities decide to flood people with bullshit on the lower levels. Canada, in its infinite wisdom, has decided that it really wants people to not turn off Amber alerts (frequently sent in the middle of the night), so of course they use the code for presidential alerts to send them... Part of the reason for the bad UX of these alerts is that they're legally regulated, and the laws are, or at least were overly specific, often preventing better solutions like letting the users configure the alarm behavior (i.e. you have to turn amber alerts off if you don't want to be woken up by them, rather than turning them into a regular notification). And since it's a regulated topic, even the improvements that would be possible would require legal review, i.e. once the feature is \"good enough\", few developers want to touch it and subject themselves to bureaucracy hell. This system is based on cell broadcast - cell towers can send a message that will be received by all phones, without having to send it to each phone individually. The messages have channel numbers, and a set of channels are reserved for this use and most modern phones will display messages sent with those channels as alerts. That's also why e.g. Canada can seamlessly use (and abuse) the system originally designed for the US. I think severity levels are the saving grace of any overused alerting system. Swiss severe weather alerts also have severity levels, and while the default in some of the alerting apps is excessively sensitive (notifying for rain or wind that does not pose meaningful risk unless you're out hiking), it's very clear that you can just raise the threshold rather than opt out. reply red_admiral 10 hours agoparentI believe the option of sending out a presidential alert on 9/11 was considered, but rejected because those are only supposed to be for really really really big emergencies.

My Dad once commented \"Back in the 70s - when Wozniak was working at Atari - they were building games using electronics - not programming computers.\" As a Computer Science graduate without an Electrical Engineering background, I was trying to wrap my head around how that was even possible. When we research the game systems of the 1970s we see: Dabney soon thought of a way to manipulate the video signal on the screen without a computer controlling it, and from there Syzygy Engineering came up with the idea of removing the computer altogether and building specialized hardware to handle everything for the game instead. In my head I can visualise electronic logic for binary adders, and running a square root operation on a number in a binary representation. But how do you represent the logic for 1970s game console pong or tennis? (Writing the software to do it seems comparatively easier to visualise.)

Show activity on this post. They were made by mostly avoiding 'computing' concepts altogether, and treating it more like a mechanical thing. For example with Pong a major component is usually timers - every xth of a second the timer will emit a signal. You have timers calibrated to match the horizontal refresh of the screen, so they'll 'ring' at the same point on each scanline. Then you have timers calibrated to the vertical refresh, so they'll ring on the same scanline each frame. The ball is then just two discrete timers for vertical and horizontal position, and their rings are sent through an AND gate that will raise the voltage going to the display when both are ringing causing a white dot to appear. The paddles build on this concept with a medium length timer that can be started and stopped to define the length. To move the ball or paddles the timers can be advanced or delayed by a control signal. Or more accurately the timers are always paused at a certain point, like during half of the horizontal blanking period. This pausing is then shortened once to advance the timer (move left/up) or increased once to delay it (move right/down). Since both the paddle and the ball timers are emitting a '1' when they are to be displayed you can impliment collision detection by performing another AND operation. So if both a paddle and the ball are being drawn at the same moment you know they've collided and can adjust a latch controlling the ball direction accordingly. If you get into the Atari 2600 you'll find that it's really weird compared to other consoles (sprites with no clearly defined X coordinate, instead only the ability to place it at the actual current location of the CRT beam or nudge it a small amount either way), but that it starts to make a lot of sense when you realize they were implementing their Pong logic for a programmable chip.

A potentiometer controls when the paddle starts being drawn, and then another resistor controls when the paddle stops being drawn. Fine. But what about the ball? It changes vertical and horizontal position, so the circuit would have to change resistance by itself. Can you explain how that could work? – Omar and Lorraine Commented 2 days ago 5 @OmarandLorraine Well, that's simple. You supply a central \"tick\" to the logic that increments the counters for the x- and y- position. A reflection at the border is simply reversing the counting (count down instead of up) of the respective counter. Absolutely nothing to do with resistance. Everything is still digital, but in hardware instead of software. – tofro Commented 2 days ago 5 The OP might find the first half of Steven Hugg's Designing Video Game Hardware in Verilog interesting. – Michael Graf Commented 2 days ago 2 @tofro: Prior to the invention of Pong, the first home video game console had a ball whose horizontal and vertical position were represented by the voltages in capacitors. – supercat Commented 2 days ago 1 Timers! wellpcb.com/blog/pcb-projects/electronic-timer-circuit Now the rest of it is falling into place.

Hardware and software are interchangeable To a point - you always need enough hardware to run software, but anything you can do in software, you can build a hardware replacement for. Albeit, it’s usually a lot easier to build a Turing complete machine in hardware and do the rest in software. Now, I don’t know how they implemented pong, but 20 years later, water utilities were still implementing pumping stations and treatment plants wholly using relays and contractors - none of this new-fangled electronics for them. I know because one of my designs was the first to use a PLC (aka a Turing machine) as the primary control mechanism for Sydney Water - it still had a complete redundant implementation in relay logic. It only took a few more years before the relays were phased out.

(Not every water/wastewater system operator does this but some big ones in the U.S. certainly do.) – Theodore Commented 2 days ago 6 A particularly complex (and arguably very interesting) example of this concept can be found in vintage electromechanical pinball machines. Each one of them is a huge mess of relays, switches, motors, and wires that implements all the required logic of that specific game of pinball entirely in hardware. Even some early solid-state pinball machines handled things this way instead of using microcontrollers. – Austin Hemmelgarn Commented 2 days ago Add a commentThis answer is useful 5 Save this answer. Show activity on this post. Based on CS background, if you know how logic gates work (or how an FPGA works instead of CPU), then that's how anything operates. It's just a bunch of logic gates doing their stuff. Even a CPU is nothing more than a bunch of logic gates, which are wired to implement the logic, whose task is to execute any program you give to it. So these games were just a bunch of logic gates, executing the logic of the game, sort of like running a fixed program but in a way that the program is not a separate entity but the hardware is just fixed to run the logic it needs to implement the game. So in same way that you can make an FPGA description to describe a CPU that can execute code, you can make an FPGA description to be a pinball machine, taking inputs from buttons and sensors and giving outputs to actuator solenoids and lamps, and the logic to increase score when you hit something etc. Of course such pinball machines were not made with digital logic gates but electromechanical gates such as relays. Later TV games were made with digital logic gates, either with separate stangard logic chips or custom ICs that implement the logic.

If you're a CS graduate, you'll know what a state machine is. (I really, really hope you do!) You'll be used to writing them in code, of course. There's a whole area of digital logic around building state machines out of flip-flops and basic logic gates though. Just like your code, each pass you check the conditions and (if met) transition to the next state. This is almost exactly how code (typically Verilog or VHDL) runs in FPGAs. I'm slightly worried about your course syllabus though, because in order to be confused about this, you have to have not been taught about FPGAs and likely other significant areas of processing such as GPUs. Those are fairly major areas of CS to be missing. The good news is that you're asking those questions now, so you can go and play with that kit now instead. :⁠-⁠) Share Improve this answer Follow Follow this answer to receive notifications answered yesterday GrahamGraham 2,15299 silver badges1111 bronze badges Add a commentYou must log in to answer this question.

That used to be the norm. I remember sneaking[1] into a few of those courses during university. Loved them. The problem is that most computer science students viewed them as useless. They wanted to take, what they thought of as, useful courses. If it wasn't C++, it wasn't useful. Even the computer science students who were interested in pure math, these were computer science courses after all and the university offered a separate software engineering degree, didn't see them as useful. A slight tangent: one of the courses I had the most fun wasn't even a computer science course. It was a philosophy course that spent a lot of time on computability. Cramming a bunch of genuinely interested social sciences students into the same room as a bunch of genuinely interested computer science students made for an absolutely amazing course. In contrast, the computer science department version of the course was populated by a majority of students who were only interested in the mandatory credit. It made for an astoundingly terrible course. (These thoughts are from the perspective of a mid-1990's physics graduate.) [1] Sneaking may not be the right term here. People in the department knew that I was doing this, to the point where I managed to get access to department computers and even managed to take a course for credit, with special permission from the professor and without the prerequisites, but the administration certainly didn't know about it since I didn't even bother with the official \"auditing a course\" route. reply eszed 4 hours agorootparentThis right here is what a university is for, and why it's useful to cram a bunch of people with widely-varied specialities into a shared physical location.

We see over and over again through history (Renaissance Italy, Bell Labs, Romantic-period Berlin, early-Google's cafeterias) how cross-disciplinary conversation inspires innovation.

So for example if you reach the left border and is within left paddle range then bounce the ball back right otherwise the left player loses. In terms of drawing to the screen, again compare the screen pixel position to each of the two paddles and ball position.

Instead of writing the game in a general purpose programming language you write it using logic gates. You get abstraction and modularity by designing larger components (adders, flip-flops, timers, shift registers) on separate pieces of paper and then including them as named black boxes in a higher-level diagram. The good news for the Pong developers is that most of those larger components were already available off-the-shelf. Common families of these chips, such as the venerable 4000-series and 7400-series logic families, began to appear on the market in the mid-1960's. Edit just to add another bit of nuance.

Other comments have riddle variants which feel also like ways of tripping someone up - if you don't spot the change you fail. And what's more the originals are things that lots of people struggle with (that's why they're riddles not basic questions). There's also little prompting, which feels like calling up a random person and demanding they solve a riddle straight away without talking it through. Part of the assumption here is that if llms don't write the right code they don't understand what people know. I'd wager that a huge number of people couldn't solve this puzzle yet fully understand what different people have their own internal thoughts and knowledge. reply rtlacn 10 hours agoparentHumans can solve these riddles even if they have never seen a similar one. LLMs need to have seen at least a similar riddle with the same structure and/or code to plagiarize. Humans can deal with modified riddles if they are alert and awake. An LLM is always alert and awake, so it should be able to handle modified riddles, but it cannot. reply mirekrusin 10 hours agorootparentNot to take anything from what you're saying but any person involved in hiring process _for programmers_ will agree that people struggle with trivia far easier than this example. reply samrus 8 hours agorootparentYeah but an LLM can't be excused being nervous or not tired or just not operating at its best like a human can.

You'd get the answer to a riddle wrong or miss something and nobody would start assuming that means you lack a fundamental understanding of how the world works. There's entire fields that look into how and why we make various mistakes and riddles and puzzles designed specifically to trip people up. If you want to test if these models can solve riddles, or where they make mistakes go right ahead that's great. It's any assumption it has a much deeper meaning that is wrong to me. reply YeGoblynQueenne 1 hour agorootparent>> You'd get the answer to a riddle wrong or miss something and nobody would start assuming that means you lack a fundamental understanding of how the world works. There's entire fields that look into how and why we make various mistakes and riddles and puzzles designed specifically to trip people up. That's because with humans we assume a certain level of competency and intellectual ability. We cannot make the same assumption when testing AI systems like LLMs because their level of competency and intellectual ability is exactly the question we are trying to answer in the first place. Note that getting an answer a little wrong, because the question looks like a question you already know the answer to, can be catastrophic in real world conditions. Tipping a frying pan over a plate on a table to serve an omelette when you've learned to do the same thing to serve a cooked shrimp works just fine and shows everyone how smart you are and how well you generalise to novel situations, right up to the point where the contents of the frying pan are on fire and you still tip them over a plate, on a table. Made of flammable wood. Oops.

It could have been trained (I am told that existing models can be modified and augmented in any Llama discussion) on the article or on HN comments. There could even be an added routine that special cases trick questions and high profile criticisms. reply Fripplebubby 5 hours agorootparentWhile this is technically possible, it is not remotely practical and the downside risk of pushing out a borked model is much higher than the upside. Training the model is expensive (obviously), but even if you are only training it slightly, running evaluations to determine whether the particular training checkpoint is at or above the quality bar is expensive, too. reply Terretta 6 hours agorootparentprev> The question is if it solved the puzzle correctly before Norvig's article appeared.

Also using himself as the programmer seemed like a convenient choice.

It generated a second set of dates which contained no solution so I asked it to write another python program that generates valid date sets. Here's the code it generated: https://gist.github.com/tel/8e126563d2d5fb13e7d53cf3adad862e To my test, it has absolutely no trouble with this problem and can correctly translate the \"theory of mind\" into a progressive constraint solver. Norvig is, of course, a well-respected researcher, but this is a bit disappointing. I feel confident he found that his tests failed, but to disprove his thesis (at least as is internally consistent with his experiment) we just need to find a single example of an LLM writing Python code that realizes the answer. I found that on the first try. I think it's possible that there exists some implementation of this problem, or something close enough to it, already in Claude's training data. It's quite hard to disprove that assertion. But still, I am satisfied with the code and its translation. To relate the word problem to this solution requires contemplation of the character's state-of-mind as a set of alternatives consistent with the information they've been given. reply YeGoblynQueenne 1 hour agoparent>> I tried to replicate this and Claude 3.5 Sonnet got it correct on the first try. It generated a second set of dates which contained no solution so I asked it to write another python program that generates valid date sets. That's good but no cigar and it certainly didn't get it \"correct on the first try\". First it generated a partially correct solution. Then you had to prompt it again to generate a new program. You were only able to do that because you know what the right answer looks like in the first place. The second program is missing a second set of dates so it's not clear if it really gets it right the second time or just reproducing a different program from its training set without understanding the problem and what's wrong with the first program and just because you asked it to do so instead. >> I feel confident he found that his tests failed, but to disprove his thesis (at least as is internally consistent with his experiment) we just need to find a single example of an LLM writing Python code that realizes the answer. I found that on the first try. That's not how testing LLM code generation is done in practice, exactly because of the variance that can be expected in generated results. To properly test an LLM (which I would agree Norvig's experiment falls a little short off) one has to run multiple experiments and evaluate all the results in aggregate in some form. The usual way to do it is to draw k samples from the LLM's distribution and check whether the correct answer is generated at least n times (k@n metric). That's an awful metric because it's basically allowing arbitrary \"guesses\" until the LLM code generator gets it right. A simpler test is to generate k programs, check whether each program is right or wrong, and assign 1 for each correct answer and 0 for each incorrect answer, then average over all answers. It's an open question whether to count a partial answer as a 0, or 0.5. So if we took the total failure in Norvig's experiment and the only partial success in yours, and allowing for the most charitable aggregation of results, we have something like 0.25 accuracy, which is not that impressive. Not least because it's evaluated on just two test samples. Also, please don't underestimate the knowledge of experts like Peter Norvig. reply trashface 1 hour agoparentprevThey could have just put the correct result into claude in the time since he wrote this (Sept 25th). reply conradev 1 hour agoparentprevHe also did not test o1-preview which I feel would do well on this class of problem. reply erwald 19 hours agoprevo1 mini seems to get it on the first try (I didn't vet the code, but I tested it and it works on both examples provided in the notebook, `dates` and `gabe_dates`): from collections import defaultdict def find_cheryls_birthday(possible_dates): # Parse the dates into month and day dates = [date.split() for date in possible_dates] months = [month for month, day in dates] days = [day for month, day in dates] # Step 1: Albert knows the month and says he doesn't know the birthday # and that Bernard doesn't know either.

I asked Claude to explain the problem, then write python to solve it. When it ran there was an exception, so I pasted that back in and got the correct answer. I'm not sure what this says about theory of mind (the first script it wrote was organized into steps based on who knew what when, so it seems to grok that), but the real lesson is that if LLMs are an emulation of \"human\" intelligence, they should probably be given a python interpreter to check their work. reply skybrian 15 hours agoparentYes, that helps. But if you iterate on this a few times (as I did last year with Code Interpreter), it reveals how much LLM's \"like\" to imitate patterns. Sure, often it will pattern-match on a useful fix and that's pretty neat. But after I told it \"that fix didn't work\" a couple times (with details about the error), it started assuming the fix wouldn't work and immediately trying again without my input. It learned the pattern! So, I learned to instead edit the question and resubmit. LLM's are pattern-imitating machines with a random number generator added to try to keep them from repeating the same pattern, which is what they really \"want\" to do. It's a brilliant hack because repeating the same pattern when it's not appropriate is a dead giveaway of machine-like behavior. (And adding a random number generator also makes it that much harder to evaluate LLM's since you need to repeat your queries and do statistics.) Although zero-shot question-answering often works, a more reliable way to get useful results out of an LLM is to \"lean into it\" by giving it a pattern and asking it to repeat it. (Or if you don't want it to follow a pattern, make sure you don't give it one that will confuse it.) reply brain5ide 14 hours agorootparentIf I understood correctly, that anectode in first paragraph looks like an interaction with a child who is trying something but lacks confidence. reply skybrian 14 hours agorootparentIt did look that way and it's a fun way to interpret it, but pattern-matching on a pretty obvious pattern in the text (several failed fixes in a row) seems more likely. LLM's will repeat patterns in other circumstances too. reply sdenton4 13 hours agorootparentI mean, humans do this too... If I tell an interviewee that they've done something wrong a few times, they'll have less confidence going forward (unless they're a sociopath), and typically start checking their work more closely to preempt problems. This particular instance of in-context pattern matching doesn't seem obviously unintelligent to me. reply skybrian 12 hours agorootparentThis was code that finished successfully (no stack trace) and rendered an image, but the output didn't match what I asked it to do, so I told it what it actually looked like. Code Interpreter couldn't check its work in that case, because it couldn't see it. It had to rely on me to tell it. So it was definitely writing \"here's the answer... that failed, let's try again\" without checking its work, because it never prompted me. You could call that \"hallucinating\" a failure. I also found that it \"hallucinated\" other test results - I'd ask it to write some code that printed a number to the console and told it what the number was supposed to be, and then it would say it \"worked,\" reporting the expected value instead of the actual number. I also asked it to write a test and run it, and it would say it passed, and I'd look at the actual output and it failed. So, asking it to write tests didn't work as well as I'd hoped; it often \"sees\" things based on what would complete the pattern instead of the actual result. reply jfcoa 18 hours agoprevThis seems like a terrible test case since python examples are readily available in the training data: https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Cheryl%27s_birthday It's interesting that so many of the model's fail to retrieve this, but any thta do solve it should clearly be able to do so with no reasoning/theory of mind. reply kohlerm 6 hours agoparentI agree this is not a great test. What's good about it is that it is a constraint satisfaction problem, and I would expect LLMs to be pretty bad at unknown problems of this kind. Simple reason, an LLM only has a a finite number of layers and it cannot do arbitrary long searches. reply rghall102 10 hours agoparentprevIt is fascinating that the R solution just below the Python solution is much shorter and more readable. The same applies to Ruby and various Lisps. It even applies to the VisualBasic solution! reply joe_the_user 19 hours agoprevDeducing things from the inability of an LLM to answer a specific question seemed doomed by the \"it will be able to on the next itteration\" principle. It seems like the only way you could systematic chart the weaknesses of an LLM is by having a class of problems that get harder for LLMs at a steep rate, so a small increase in problem complexity requires a significant increase in LLM power. reply aithrowawaycomm 16 hours agoparent> It seems like the only way you could systematic chart the weaknesses of an LLM is by having a class of problems that get harder for LLMs at a steep rate That would be any problem more complicated than O(n) complexity, even with chain-of-thought prompting[1]. Note that the O(n) thing can bite you in all sorts of unintuitive ways: if the LLM+CoT can perform an O(n) Task A and O(m) Task B, then it can't do the O(nm) task \"for every step of A, perform B on the result\" unless you come up with a task-specific prompt outlining the solution. The alternative is to play RLHF Whack-A-Mole, separately training the LLM on the combined task. (I think this weakness might be why LLMs are hitting a wall in enterprise deployment, and also explains why LLM agents don't actually work.) The only way this will get fixed is with a fundamentally more sophisticated architecture.

That's orthogonal. If we are pointing in the right direction(s) then yes, next iteration could resolve all problems. If we are not pointing in the right direction(s) then no, next iteration will not resolve these problems. Given LLMs rapid improvement in regurgitating knowledge from their training data but simultaneously slow improvement in their ability to generalize (such as logic \"puzzles\"), I think it is naive to assume we're pointed in the right direction. Maybe we're even pointing in mostly the right direction. But why assume we are? We can continue in the direction we are going while simultaneously considering it might not be well aligned. If we are well aligned, that gives us more confidence and makes gathering funding easier. If we aren't, well it is easier to course correct sooner than later. In either case, you benefit from the analysis. Understanding why things fail is more important than understanding why things succeed. reply Uehreka 17 hours agorootparentGP is referring to the fact that if it becomes well known that LLM version X can’t solve problem Q, then the model’s trainers will make sure to include problem Q prominently in the training set, running it through over and over to ensure that version X+1 is able to solve the problem whether the model’s “reasoning” abilities have improved or not. Thus observers of the LLM space like us need to keep finding novel “Bellweather problems” that we think will evaluate a model’s ability to reason, knowing that once we start talking about it openly the problem will no longer be a useful Bellweather. By their nature as “weird-shaped” problems, these aren’t the kind of thing we’re guaranteed to have an infinite supply of. As the generations move on it will become more and more difficult to discern “actual improvements in reasoning” from “the model essentially has the solution to your particular riddle hard-coded”. reply godelski 16 hours agorootparentOh, thanks for the correction. I did misinterpret. Though I will say that LLMs don't appear to be doing any better at the river crossing puzzles. They tend to \"patch\" the ones I and others actively tweet about but they still aren't becoming better at generalizing. I've taken this as fairly strong evidence as we're going in the wrong direction of reasoning (as opposed to similar direction). But the strongest evidence to me is that they're entropy minimizers. What's extra interesting, is transformers CRAVE augmentations. I work in vision and this is a necessary thing to get them to do well. You can actually get much smaller models to do what bigger models can if you get this right. reply fragmede 14 hours agorootparentOh interesting, what variants were you using that it seems they patched? reply godelski 13 hours agorootparentWell it depends on what you mean patched, but I'll be generous and say that it gets the right answer and there are no logical errors. I used to use Which weighs more, a kilogram of bricks or a pound of feathers and that worked until the second or third update on GPT 3.5 (when everyone was like \"but did you try 3.5?) Here's a river crossing puzzle with the current GPT-4o that \"works\" ---------------------------------------------------- > I have a duck, a goose, and a pig that I need to take across a river. If I live the duck and goose alone, the duck will quack. If I leave the pig with the goose the pig will oink. I can only fit two animals in the boat at a time. What is the quickest way to get all animals across the river? To solve this puzzle, we need to find a way to transport the animals across the river without triggering the quacking or oinking conditions: 1. **First Trip:** Take the duck and the goose across the river. Leave the goose on the other side and take the duck back with you. 2. **Second Trip:** Take the pig across the river. Leave the pig on the other side and bring the goose back with you. 3. **Third Trip:** Take the duck and the goose across the river again. Now all three animals are across the river, and at no point were the duck and goose left alone, nor were the pig and goose left together. This method ensures no quacking or oinking occurs. ---------------------------------------------------- Idk why it decided to add the extra constraint of keeping the animals quiet but hey, it doesn't really matter. As far as I know, I'm the first one that came up with this variant and strangely it has been consistently answered correctly when 4o came out (after my post got repeated by a few bigger names) so I thought it was patched, but just now I wasn't able to reproduce a success with various checkpoints and system prompts, so I guess it got undone? ---------------------------------------------------- > I have a fox, a goose, and a bag of corn that I need to transport across a river. All three can fit in the boat. If you leave the fox alone with the goose, it'll eat the goose. If you leave the goose alone with the corn, it'll eat the corn. Describe how to get all items safely across the river. To solve this classic puzzle, follow these steps: 1. **Take the Goose Across First:** Start by taking the goose across the river and leave it on the other side. 2. **Return and Take the Fox Across:** Go back to the original side and take the fox across the river. 3. **Bring the Goose Back:** When you reach the other side, leave the fox there and take the goose back with you to the original side. 4. **Take the Corn Across:** Leave the goose on the original side and take the bag of corn across the river. 5. **Return Alone:** Leave the bag of corn with the fox on the other side and return alone to the original side. 6. **Take the Goose Across Again:** Finally, take the goose across the river one last time. Now, all three items—the fox, the goose, and the corn—are safely across the river without any being eaten. ---------------------------------------------------- claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620 and claude-3-opus-20240229 both act like it is the normal puzzle. It doesn't matter if you say \"All three can fit in the boat with the farmer.\" Nor if you ask it to explain its logic step-by-step. The only humans I've seen struggle with this variant ask me to repeat the question several times before saying something similar to \"I don't understand the trick. You just take all the animals across at once?\" But the trick is there's no trick and I accept that as an answer lol. FWIW, I've had several LLMs explain to me that all animals can fit in the boat and then proceed to do the normal solution to the puzzle. I've also seen it put all animals into the boat and then only drop one off and travel back and forth, or sometimes animals teleporting or even the framer. Sometimes the farmer is just going back and forth. That happens a lot when I use a variant where animals will follow the farmer and can swim. Very often I see the better models great at getting the right answers but fail (or even worse) when explaining that answer. I don't think this makes the models useless, but I feel that their highest utility is mostly due to Google's ever decreasing quality. But what can you do? reply fragmede 8 hours agorootparentI like the noise variant! The \"everything can in one trip\" variant is the one I've been using, and I was able to get 4o to get it right in one shot with enough couching, and o1-preview without couching, which convinced me (of what, I'm not sure). my other riddle is the car accident doctor son one, which 4o couldn't get but o1-preview does. I'll have to come up with more obscure riddles and not talk about them online and only use temporary chats which aren't used as training data and see what happens next. I'm sure I have a puzzle book in my library that I can use to help me make new ones. reply godelski 2 hours agorootparentBe careful with coaching. It's very easy to leak information. The point is to get it without letting it know. As for o1, well I've been using this for a year and a few big players have used it too. So remember that they get spoiled because they end up in the training set reply pfisherman 16 hours agoprevLLMs and NLP are to verbal reasoning what the calculator is to quantitative reasoning. Language and by extension verbal reasoning is full of ambiguity and semantic slipperiness. For example, what degree of semantic similarity distinguishes synonymous from synonym-ish concepts? When do we partition concepts into homonyms? I think part of the problem with how people evaluate LLMs is that the expectations that people have. Natural language != ontology. The expectation should be more Chomsky and less Boole. Asking it to solve math problems written in paragraph form is a waste of time. Use a calculator for that! Solving riddles? Code it up in prolog! Instead you should be thinking of what operations you can do on concepts, meaning, and abstract ideas! That is what these things do. reply missingrib 16 hours agoparentIs this really verbal reasoning? It's just a logic problem. reply pfisherman 16 hours agorootparentHow can one / should one combine the concepts of a dinosaur and monetary policy of the Ottoman Empire? What differentiates verbal reasoning from logic? I don’t know that either of those can be solved well with formal languages or logic. reply pfisherman 1 hour agorootparentFollow up in this one… I asked an LLM to give me the funniest way to combine the concepts of a dinosaur and monetary policy of the Ottoman Empire. This was the answer. Imagine a “Dinoflationosaurus”: a giant dinosaur who has the job of overseeing the monetary policy of the Ottoman Empire. However, this dinosaur is hopelessly behind the times, using outdated gold coins that are buried in random locations, like a prehistoric central bank.

This type of unambiguous problem is best solved using formal languages - something more like quantitative reasoning. But stuff like prolog or classical automated reasoning approaches are quite brittle. They break down quickly when you start to introduce ambiguity and noise. Statistical approaches like hidden markov models that people used in these instances were the precursor to the LLMs we have today. But I was going down a rabbit hole there. My main point is that trying to use LLMs to solve logic puzzles - that can easily be solved in prolog - is a waste of time and a failure of the imagination. The applications that should be explored and would be most fruitful are those where there is ambiguity and contradiction. reply willguest 8 hours agoprevThis seems to amount to asking an LLM how it feels about Cheryl, discovering that it is performatively happy about her existence, and then deducing that the LLM has no capacity for genuine emotion, expressed in the form of logic. The faulty premise lies in the formulation of the test and makes the responses both predictable, but also does a disservice to 'mind' because it tries to interpret it in such a way that an LLM could begin to grapple with the basics, but not in a meaninful way.

Cheryl provides them with ten possible dates: May 15, May 16, May 19, June 17, June 18, July 14, July 16, August 14, August 15, and August 17. Here’s the reasoning: 1. Albert knows the month and Bernard knows the day. 2. Albert says he knows Cheryl’s birthday, meaning May and June can be eliminated because they contain unique days (May 19 and June 18). If Albert had been told May or June, he wouldn’t know for sure. 3. Bernard, knowing this, says he now knows Cheryl’s birthday. This eliminates the remaining dates with unique days (July 14 and August 14). 4. Albert then confirms that he also knows the birthday, meaning Cheryl’s birthday must be in July or August, but on a date with no unique days left: July 16, August 15, or August 17.

This process was far from automatic: I initially provided almost two pages of English instructions, and I had to help debug non-working code by adding debug statements and then show the models the code with print statements and the new output.

It reminds me of responses to the river crossing problems. The reason people do tests like this is because we know the answer a priori or can determine the answer. Reasoning tests are about generalization, and this means you have to be able to generalize based on the logic. So the author knows that the question is spoiled, because they know that the model was trained on wiki. They also tested to see if the model is familiar with the problem in the first place. In fact, you too can confirm this by asking \"What is the logic puzzle, Cheryl's birthday?\" and they will spit you out the correct answer. The problem also went viral, so there are even variations of this. That should tell us that the model has not just been trained on it, but that it has seen it in various forms and we know that this increases its ability to generalize and perform the task. So then we're left with reasoning. How do we understand reasoning? It is the logical steps. But we need to make sure that this is distinct from memorization. So throwing in twists (as people do in the river puzzles) is a way to distinguish memory from logic. That's where these models fail. People always complain that \"oh, but humans can't do it.\" I refer to this as \"proof by self-incompetence.\" (I also see it claimed when it isn't actually true) But not everybody reasons, and not all the time (trivial cases are when you're asleep or in a coma, but it also includes things like when you're hangry or just dumb). Humans are different from LLMs. LLMs are giving it 100%, every time. \"Proof by self-incompetence\" is an exact example of this, where the goal is to explain a prior belief. But fitting data is easy, explaining data is hard (von Neumann's Elephant). There's also a key part that many people are missing in the analysis. The models were explicitly asked to *generalize* the problem. I'll give some comments about letting them attempt to solve iteratively, but this is often very tricky. I see this with the river crossing puzzles frequently, where there is information leakage passed back to the algo. Asking a followup question like \"are you sure\" is actually a hint. You typically don't ask that question when it is correct. Though newer models will not always apologize for being wrong, when actually correct, when they are sufficiently trained on that problem. You'll find that in these situations if you run the same prompt (in new clean sessions) multiple times that the variance in the output is very low. Overall, a good way to catch LLMs in differentiating reasoning from memorization is getting them to show their work, the steps in between. It isn't uncommon for them to get the right answer but have wrong steps, even in math problems. This is always a clear demonstration of memorization rather than reasoning. It is literally the subtly that matters. I suspect that one of the difficulties in humans analyzing LLMs is that there is no other entity that is capable of performing such feats that does not also have a theory of mind and a world model. But a good analogy might be in facts that you know, but not understanding why they are \"the answer.\" I'm sure there's many people who have memorized complexities for many sorting algos or leet code problems and couldn't derive the answer themselves. But I really don't understand why we *need* LLMs to reason? A dictionary memorizes things, and so does wikipedia. Their lack in ability to reason does not make them any less marvelous of inventions/tools. But maybe, if we're looking to create intelligent and thinking machines, it isn't as simple as scale. We love simple things, but few things are simple and correct (though far more things are simple and approximately correct). reply Jerrrrrrry 17 hours agoparentHumans are different from LLMs. LLMs are giving it 100%, every time. \"Proof by self-incompetence\" is an exact example of this, where the goal is to explain a prior belief.

The test is fine. The conclusion drawn from it, not so much. If humans fail your test for x and you're certain humans have x then you're not really testing for x. x may be important to your test for sure but you're testing for something else too. Or maybe humans don't have x after all. Either conclusion is logically consistent at least. It's the middle, \"rules for thee but not me\" conclusions that are tiring. Like it's theory of mind. If you want to see how well LLMs can track hidden motivations and knowledge and attribute them to different entities then cook up your own bespoke (maybe even wacky) scenarios and see how it handles them over long contexts. That's how to test for theory of mind. By doing what the other did here, you're introducing a few factors that may derail the output and have nothing to do with ToM. >Humans are different from LLMs. LLMs are giving it 100%, every time. I don't know how anyone who uses LLMs extensively can genuinely believe this to be true. I mean i'm not sure what this means ? Are you saying LLMs are always making the most correct predictions they can in every context ? Because that's just blatantly false. Yes models overfit. Yes you can trick them. No it does not necessarily mean they haven't generalized well enough to solve your \"subtle variation\". And if people weren't so hellbent on being able to say \"aha\" to the machine, they would see that. If you're really interested in seeing how well the model has learnt the underling logic steps why bother with the trickery ? Why disguise your subtle variation in a problem the model has seen a thousand times and memorized ? You can have the same question requiring the same logic but written in a way that doesn't immediately point to an overfit problem (you don't need to worry about if hinting is 'cheating' or not) How is that not a better test of generalization ? And i'm not saying that the tests with the trickery or subterfuge are useless or to be done away with, just that you are no longer just testing the ability to generalize. reply godelski 17 hours agorootparent> The conclusion drawn from it, not so much. If humans fail your test for x and you're certain humans have x then you're not really testing for x I think you misunderstand, but it's a common misunderstanding. Humans have the *ability* to reason. This is not equivalent to saying that humans reason at all times (this was also started in my previous comment) So it's none of: \"humans have x\", \"humans don't have x\", nor \"humans have x but f doesn't have x because humans perform y on x and f performs z on x\". It's correct to point out that not all humans can solve this puzzle. But that's an irrelevant fact because the premise is not that human always reason. If you'd like to make the counter argument that LLMs are like humans in that they have the ability to reason but don't always, then you got to provide strong evidence (just like you need to provide strong evidence that LLMs can reason). But this (both) is quite hard to prove because humans aren't entropy minimizers trained on petabytes of text. It's easier to test humans because we generally have a much better idea of what they've been trained on and we can also sample from different humans that have been trained on different types of data. And here's a real kicker, when you've found a human that can solve a problem (meaning not just state the answer but show their work) nearly all of them can adapt easily to novel augmentations. So I don't know why you're talking about trickery. The models are explicitly trained to solve problems like these. There's no slight of hand. There's no magic tokens, no silly or stage wording that would be easily misinterpreted.

Humans and Machines that memorize things take shortcuts in prediction when they encounter what they've memorized \"in the wild\". That's the entire point of memorization really. The human or model might fail not because it lacks the reasoning abilities to solve your problem, but because its attention is diverted by misleading cues or subtle twists in phrasing.

All humans have the capacity to reason, but not all humans reason. There's a big difference. Hell, even GPT-4o will tell you this. Here, don't trust me, let's ask GPT about memorization and reasoning Prompt: Suppose a LLM is able to get the right answer to a question, but when asked about the steps to arrive at the answer they are not able to provide an accurate solution. Does this tell us anything about a model's ability to reason or its ability to memorize? What about when it gets the right answer but the explanation would lead to a different answer than the one stated? Response: These scenarios highlight important aspects of a model's capabilities and limitations regarding reasoning and memorization. Let's break them down: 1. **LLM Gets the Right Answer but Can't Explain the Steps:** - **Memorization vs. Reasoning:** If a model provides a correct answer without accurately explaining the steps, it might indicate that the model is relying more on memorization rather than understanding or reasoning. The model could have seen similar questions in its training data and learned to associate certain questions with specific answers without truly understanding the underlying principles. - **Reasoning Limitations:** This situation suggests that the model may not have a robust ability to reason through the problem-solving process. It highlights a gap between recognizing patterns in data and applying logical reasoning to derive answers. 2. **LLM Provides Correct Answer but Incorrect Explanation:** - **Memorization of Answers:** This might suggest that the model has memorized the answer from similar examples in the training data but does not understand the reasoning process. It could be retrieving an answer that it \"knows\" is correct without understanding why. - **Inconsistent Reasoning Ability:** Giving a correct answer with an explanation that would lead to a different answer indicates inconsistencies in its reasoning ability. It may reflect that the model's internal heuristics for generating explanations are not aligned with the logic used to derive answers. In both cases, these issues highlight the challenges in AI related to understanding vs. pattern recognition. While LLMs are excellent at recognizing patterns and retrieving information, their ability to reason logically and consistently can be limited. This differentiation is crucial when evaluating the capabilities of AI models, particularly in contexts where understanding and accurate reasoning are essential. reply dmead 12 hours agoprevI wonder if they are any unique properties of those programs that we can figure out what stack overflow or textbooks they're copying. reply mrbungie 16 hours agoprevNot really about Theory of Mind, but in the same line, I remember the other day someone argued with me that LLMs model the world, rather than just modelling language (that may represent the world). I kept thinking about that problem and plausible experiments to show my point that LLMs are dumb about the physical world, even if they know perfectly how it works in terms of language/representation. So I thought, what happens if I give an LLM an image and I ask a representation of said image in ASCII art (obviously without relying in Python and the trivial pixel intensity to character transform it usually proposes). Remember: - LLMs should've been trained with a lot of RGB image training data with associated captions => So it should understand images very well. - LLMs should've been trained with a lot of ASCII training data with associated captions => So it should draw/write ASCII like an expert. Plus, it understands vision apparently (managed as tokens), so it should do well. But it can't do a decent translation that captures the most interesting features of an image into ASCII art (I'm pretty sure a human with an hour of time should be able to do it, even if its awful ASCII art). For example, I uploaded an image macro meme with text and two pictures of different persons kind of looking at each other. The ASCII art representation just showed two faces, that didn't look at each other but rather away from each other. It just does not \"understand\" the concept of crossing sights (even if it \"understands\" the language and even image patches when you ask about where are they looking at, it will not draw that humanly important stuff by itself). These things just work with tokens, and that is useful and seems like magic in a lot of domains. But there is no way in hell we are going to get into AGI without a fully integrated sensor platform that can model the world in its totality including interacting with it (i.e. like humans in training, but not necessarily in substrate nor training time hopefully).

    "originBody": "Networks 53 Cloudflare beats patent troll so badly it basically gives up 53 Networking giant pockets $225K, foe promises to stop suing and abandons IP Thomas Claburn Thu 3 Oct 2024 // 23:10 UTC Cloudflare on Thursday celebrated a victory over Sable Networks, which the former described as a \"patent troll.\" That’s a term for an individual or organization that exists solely to makes patent infringement claims in the hope of winning a settlement from defendants concerned about costly patent litigation. \"Sable sued Cloudflare back in March 2021,\" wrote Emily Terrell and Patrick Nemeroff, respectively Cloudflare’s senior counsel for litigation and senior associate general counsel, in a write-up Wednesday. \"Sable is a patent troll. It doesn’t make, develop, innovate, or sell anything. Sable IP is merely a shell entity formed to monetize (make money from) an ancient patent portfolio acquired by Sable Networks from Caspian Networks in 2006.\" Patent trolls have vexed the technology industry for years, sometimes even drawing regulatory responses as happened over a decade ago when opportunistic litigants focused on patents pertinent to the emerging smartphone market. The Obama administration responded by issuing a set of executive actions to curb abuses. Lately, these patent profiteers have targeted the open source community. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation and Linux Foundation last month strengthened ties with United Patents, a company focused on defending against predatory patent claims. Five other companies that we know of sued by Sable – Cisco, Fortinet, Check Point, SonicWall, and Juniper Networks – settled out of court. Splunk, meanwhile, fought back and managed last year to convince Sable to dismiss its claim against the operation prior to its takeover by, funnily enough, Cisco. Internet services giant Cloudflare has notched up an even greater victory. Facing an initial infringement lawsuit regarding around a hundred claims related to four patents, the corporation ended up having to deal with just a single patent violation claim. Latest in WordPress war: Automattic says it wanted 8% cut of WP Engine revenue John Deere accused of being full of manure with its right-to-repair promises Sensitive data on 61K+ patients accessed in Alabama hospital cyberattack Google expands visual, audio search, lets AI handle layout In February, Cloudflare prevailed when a Texas jury found it did not infringe Sable's \"micro-flow label switching\" patent. The biz both convinced the jury that it did not use the \"micro-flow\" technology described in the US patent 7,012,919 and that the patent was invalid because of prior art. The existence of two earlier US patents, 6,584,071 and 6,680,933 for router technology developed by Nortel Networks and Lucent in the 1990s convinced the jury that Sable's '919 patent should never have been granted. The matter also saw Sable pledge not to pursue further actions of this sort. \"In the end, Sable agreed to pay Cloudflare $225,000, grant Cloudflare a royalty-free license to its entire patent portfolio, and to dedicate its patents to the public, ensuring that Sable can never again assert them against another company,\" said Terrell and Nemeroff. The agreement means that Sable will tell the US Patent and Trademark Office that it is abandoning its patent rights and no further claims based on those patents will be possible. The Register called Sable’s listed phone number, and it is no longer in service. The company's website is unresponsive and an attorney for the firm did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Terrell and Nemeroff said that prior art submissions for the Sable case related to Project Jengo, a crowd-sourced patent invalidation initiative, will be accepted until November 2, 2024. At some point thereafter, Cloudflare, which has already given out $70,000 in awards for the case, will select final award winners. \"We're proud of our work fighting patent trolls and believe that the outcome in this case sends a strong message that Cloudflare will fight back against meritless patent cases and we will win,\" a spokesperson for Cloudflare told The Register. ® Sponsored: Time to explore your virtualization options Share More about Cloudflare Law Patent More like these × More about Cloudflare Law Patent Software Narrower topics AdBlock Plus Antitrust App Application Delivery Controller Audacity Confluence Cross-border data flow Database Digital Services Act FOSDEM FOSS Grab Graphics Interchange Format IDE Jenkins Legacy Technology LibreOffice Map Microsoft 365 Microsoft Office Microsoft Teams Mobile Device Management OpenOffice Privacy Shield Programming Language QR code Retro computing Search Engine Software bug Software License Text Editor User interface Visual Studio Visual Studio Code WebAssembly Web Browser WordPress More about Share 53 COMMENTS More about Cloudflare Law Patent More like these × More about Cloudflare Law Patent Software Narrower topics AdBlock Plus Antitrust App Application Delivery Controller Audacity Confluence Cross-border data flow Database Digital Services Act FOSDEM FOSS Grab Graphics Interchange Format IDE Jenkins Legacy Technology LibreOffice Map Microsoft 365 Microsoft Office Microsoft Teams Mobile Device Management OpenOffice Privacy Shield Programming Language QR code Retro computing Search Engine Software bug Software License Text Editor User interface Visual Studio Visual Studio Code WebAssembly Web Browser WordPress TIP US OFF Send us news",

    "originBody": "Policy / Health Care The profit-obsessed monster destroying American emergency rooms Private equity decimated emergency care in the United States — without you even noticing. by Keren Landman, MD Oct 3, 2024, 10:00 AM UTC Xinmei Liu for Vox Keren Landman, MD is a senior reporter covering public health, emerging infectious diseases, the health workforce, and health justice at Vox. Keren is trained as a physician, researcher, and epidemiologist and has served as a disease detective at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. John didn’t start his career mad. He trained as an emergency medicine doctor in a tidily run Midwestern emergency room about a decade ago. He loved the place, especially the way its management was so responsive to the doctors’ needs, offering extra staffing when things got busy and paid administrative time for teaching other trainees. Doctors provided most of the care, occasionally overseeing the work of nurse practitioners and physician associates. He signed on to start there full-time shortly after finishing his residency. A month before his start date, a private equity firm bought the practice. “I can’t even tell you how quickly it changed,” John says. The ratio of doctors to other clinicians flipped, shrinking doctor hours to a minimum as the firm moved to save on salaries. John — who is being referred to by a pseudonym due to concerns over professional repercussions — quit and found a job at another emergency room in a different state. It too soon sold out to the same private equity firm. Then it happened again, and then again. Small emergency rooms “kept getting gobbled up by these gigantic corporations so fast,” he said. By the time doctors tried to jump ship to another ER, “they were already sold out.” At all of the private equity-acquired ERs where John worked, things changed almost overnight: In addition to having their hours cut, doctors were docked pay if they didn’t evaluate new arrivals within 25 minutes of them walking through the door, leading to hasty orders for “kitchen sink” workups geared mostly toward productivity — not toward real cost-effectiveness or diagnostic precision. Amid all of this, cuts to their hours when ER volumes were low meant John and his colleagues’ pay was all over the place. Patient care was suffering “from the toe sprains all the way up to the gunshot wounds and heart attacks,” says John. His experience wasn’t an anomaly — it was happening in emergency rooms across the country. “All of my colleagues were experiencing the same thing.” “Were they going to die anyway? Maybe. But that’s not how I sleep at night. That was four years ago. I think about that guy every day.” At times, the short staffing combined with the pressure to churn patients led to deadly shortcuts. John remembers rushing to evaluate one patient and missing his extensive history of alcohol abuse. The patient spent hours getting tests directed at the wrong diagnosis. John could have put together a more appropriate plan if he’d had a few more minutes to sit down and get a better history, but by the time he realized what was going on, the patient was too severely ill. He died in the intensive care unit two days later. “Is that 100 percent because of that staffing? Probably not,” says John. “But if I wasn’t so stressed about jumping into that patient room, making sure my door-to-provider time was less than 25 minutes …” The hypothetical hangs in the air. “Were they going to die anyway? Maybe. But that’s not how I sleep at night. That was four years ago. I think about that guy every day.” Xinmei Liu for Vox The story of how private equity has been able to so thoroughly debilitate emergency care is one of the more dramatic examples of how corporate interests are corrosive to America’s health care system — and how powerless they leave individual consumers. Today, private equity continues to operate a shocking quarter of ERs nationwide, as of March 2024. Still, there’s some hope: Academics, patient advocates, and doctors say you can make defensive moves to protect your finances and care before, during, and after you or a loved one visits an ER. Understanding private equity’s transformation of America’s emergency rooms is the first step. How private equity sunk its claws into emergency care Modern private equity got its start in the early 1980s, when a free-market acolyte — and former member of the Nixon administration — completed the first major “leveraged buyout.” Using mostly borrowed money, William Simon and his partner bought a greeting card company, extracted huge fees, and then sold it for a massive profit less than two years later. Over the next few decades, what was then called the leveraged buyout industry moved into other sectors. Firms flipped businesses to yield spectacular profits, often cutting corners on the products and services they offered, eliminating jobs, and reducing employee benefits. It was only a matter of time until the industry, now rebranded as private equity, turned its gaze on the US’s $4 trillion health care sector, which was already becoming increasingly commercialized as nonprofit health systems consolidated, paid their executives ever more extravagant salaries, and otherwise played business hardball. Private equity takeovers in health care started around 2000 and have steadily increased since; when several big banks crumbled in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, private equity’s growth only accelerated. Emergency medicine wasn’t always an appealing target for private equity. Physician staffing in many emergency rooms around the country was traditionally handled by co-op-like groups, run by working doctors, that contracted with hospitals. In the 1990s, ex-physicians and businesspeople began taking ownership of these so-called contract management groups (CMGs). As they did, they started acting more like for-profit businesses, centralizing decision-making and earnings. The easier it was to make decisions that prioritized profits, the more money CMGs made — and the more attractive they became to private equity. Through the mid- to late-2010s, private equity firms swallowed up a shocking number of American emergency rooms, leaving in their wake a generationally hollowed-out system for providing emergency care to people across the country. Private equity firms and other corporate interests owned nearly 9 percent of ER doctor groups in 2009; by 2019, they owned 22 percent. The wave of takeovers and consolidations peaked in 2021 but carries on all over the US, especially in Florida, Texas, and other parts of the South and West where the firms have been most aggressive. Doctors trying to practice medicine the way they’d been trained to — with a priority on patient care, not profits — found they couldn’t outrun the monster. Private equity’s dominance persisted even after the federal No Surprises Act, enacted in 2022, made many of their most profitable practices illegal. Lots of for-profit models are a bad fit for health care, but of all of them, private equity is perhaps the worst, says Eileen O’Grady, director of programs at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a nonprofit watchdog group: “It basically takes the for-profit model and makes it so much more extractive and so much more harmful and risky.” Private equity puts profit above all else To understand what makes private equity such a malignant force in health care, you have to understand its uniquely craven and purposefully opaque corporate structure. Imagine you own a lemonade stand, and you want it to make more money. You have a few options: You can plow all your profits back into the business until it grows — what business school types call organic growth. Alternatively, you can get a bank loan. If you’re really ambitious, you can sell shares of your lemonade stand to the general public by promising them a good return on their investment. There’s another option here, one that will make you richer quicker: You can sell all or most of the stand to the rich kid at the end of the street. He’s offering you a lot of money for it — more than you’d get over the short term from the other options. That’s because he’s taken out a huge loan to pay for the deal. But there are a couple of catches: First, if he runs into financial trouble (which he very well might, since he’s been buying up lemonade stands all over town), he’ll sell it off for parts, leaving the neighborhood lemonade-less. This will cost him nothing personally because he used the lemonade stand as collateral for that big loan. The second and perhaps more important catch is that this kid is buying your lemonade stand in order to sell it. He doesn’t care about lemonade or the people who like it. His strategy is to make the stand’s balance sheet look so attractive that a few years later, another investor will buy it at a premium — or if that fails, then yes, to sell it off for parts. A year down the road, odds are high your precious lemonade stand will be a sad shadow of what it once was, or it might not exist at all. That kid is private equity. Xinmei Liu for Vox When private equity comes for a lemonade stand (or for Toys “R” Us, Samsonite, Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams, or for any of the thousands of businesses these firms have taken over since they rose to prominence in the late 1980s), the result is often a sad story about the decline of a legacy brand — shoddy products and lost jobs. Depressing, but not a life-and-death issue. When private equity comes for health care, though, the result is human suffering: Elderly and intellectually disabled people sitting in puddles of their own waste, sick patients not getting the care they need, worse outcomes for patients. It’s not just lemonade. People’s lives are at stake. The way private equity gets into emergency care is by buying out the CMGs that manage physician staffing — that is to say, the firms only buy the clinicians themselves. It’s a different model than when private equity invests in other areas of health care. When firms buy hospitals, nursing homes, medical practices, rehabilitation facilities, and group homes, they acquire not only staff, but also buildings, land, and medical equipment. In the case of emergency care, “private equity doesn’t pay the hospital rent, they don’t hire the nurses, they don’t pay the electric bills, they don’t provide any of the equipment,” says Robert McNamara, chair of the emergency medicine department at Temple University in Philadelphia. The hospital still handles those finances. “They’re just working the labor force. … The highest-cost thing on their expense side is the board-certified emergency physician.” When emergency rooms first caught the eye of private equity firms, the prospective investors offered the physician owners of CMGs huge payouts. Leon Adelman, an emergency medicine doctor who leads the staffing firm Ivy Clinicians and writes a workforce-focused newsletter, says the owners faced a tough choice: “‘Do I do what is ethical and feels right … and I get a nice going-away party and maybe a watch or something — or do I get $10 million?’” “What they were buying was the ability to charge patients who were consuming a non-shoppable service,” Adelman says — one for which patients are unable to compare prices. If you’re having a heart attack, you’re not going to call around to hospitals to find out who is going to give you the best deal. Hospitals that increasingly have profit on the brain often found private equity a more attractive partner than doctor-owned CMGs. The firms are flush with cash, which means they don’t look to the hospitals to shore up their finances. “They won’t ask you for a penny,” Adelman explains. “They’re making plenty of money.” Once a private equity firm bought an emergency room, there were two levers it could pull to make a profit: It could maximize what it reaped from patients who’d received services, and it could cut what it spent paying the clinicians who provided those services. Doing both at the same time has made emergency medicine practically unrecognizable. Burned-out doctors, screwed-over patients Under new private equity ownership, ERs adopted an assortment of unsavory practices. Firms not only pressured clinicians to see patients faster, as illustrated by John’s experience, but to recommend hospital admission for more patients. They also dramatically raised the price tags for a range of emergency services, resulting in back-breakingly large bills for patients nationwide, like ones charging thousands of dollars for glue applied to a half-inch wound. To avoid having to negotiate those astronomical bills with the expert hagglers at insurance companies, firms kept their ERs from participating in many insurance networks. It was easier to collect on a so-called balance bill — the portion of a medical bill not paid for by a patient’s insurer — if the care a patient had received wasn’t covered by their insurance at all. In a study of two of the largest emergency medicine staffing firms in the US, health economist Zack Cooper found costs to patients went up more than 80 percent after a corporate interest took ownership. Xinmei Liu for Vox Meanwhile, to minimize costs, private equity-owned staffing firms often replaced more expensive physicians with nurse practitioners and physician associates. It was a move likely to worsen patient care: While these professionals do highly skilled work in a variety of clinical settings, the emergency department is one place where care outcomes are more likely to suffer if a doctor isn’t involved. In a demonstration of how deeply invested private equity was in emergency care, these firms set in motion a system to generate cheap labor, trained to private equity’s productivity maximizing specifications. For-profit health care companies, including private equity-invested ones, founded a glut of residency training programs in the late 2010s. A 2021 study projected the move would lead to an oversupply of more than 7,800 emergency medicine doctors by 2030. According to reporting by Lever, the private equity-funded staffing firm American Physician Partners told investors they expected the surplus to eventually save them an expected $20 million in annual payroll costs. There are good reasons to believe that private equity’s soup-to-nuts transformation of emergency care has had a devastating effect on physician morale and patient care — and many emergency doctors say both are true. In lemonade-stand terms, private equity is “diluting the lemonade, but charging six times as much,” Adelman says, and their customers are “dying of thirst.” Emergency medicine has long been among the most stressful physician specialties. However, in recent years, the burnout rate has climbed to 63 percent, according to a 2024 Medscape survey, and the specialty is losing popularity among medical students. Doctors’ decision-making authority is their currency; “To have that taken away because of leadership and ownership models that negate that authority is really disheartening, and leads to burnout and, really, moral injury,” says Aisha Terry, a Washington, DC, emergency room doctor and president of the American College of Emergency Physicians, an advocacy and education nonprofit. In lemonade-stand terms, private equity is “diluting the lemonade, but charging six times as much,” Adelman says, and their customers are “dying of thirst” Meanwhile, finding concrete data proving patient harms is difficult. Yashaswini Singh, a health care economist who studies changes in physician practices acquired by private equity funds, says linking patient outcomes with private equity involvement is “a Herculean task.” Still, researchers are on the case, and so are legislators — earlier this year, Sen. Gary Peters (D-MI) initiated an investigation into private equity’s effects on the quality of emergency care. Private equity can only do what it does because so many other parts of American health care are so dysfunctional. “Just to be really clear, private equity is not the main harm of health care in the US,” says O’Grady. “I think it’s a symptom of a much bigger problem.” In the US health care ecosystem, private equity is a bottom-feeder, an entity that can only exist because of the bad behavior and misaligned incentives of the bigger players in the marketplace. Private equity’s deep pockets, its willingness to extort patients, its heavy-handedness with telling doctors how to practice wouldn’t be possible — much less an advantage — in the absence of these larger upstream problems. Maybe there wouldn’t be as many opportunities for private equity to make money in health care if hospital budgets were stable; if insurance companies didn’t play hardball with both providers and patients; if pharmaceutical industry players didn’t artificially and unevenly inflate drug prices; if elected officials weren’t so susceptible to powerful lobbies that block comprehensive, loophole-closing health care reform. That’s not the world we live in, however; and because the American health care system is broken in these and so many other ways, private equity thrives within it, often invisibly. Congress tried to fix the problem — but fell short In 2020, Congress threw a huge wrench in the private equity game plan when it passed the No Surprises Act, aimed at saving patients from receiving shocking bills after getting emergency care. When the law took effect in January 2022, it meant that patients who receive emergency care can’t get billed for out-of-network care, even if the care is from an out-of-network facility or doctor. (They do still have to pay whatever deductibles, copays, or coinsurance their insurance plan would require related to an in-network visit.) It also protects people from higher bills if they get routine, non-emergency care at an in-network facility from an out-of-network doctor without their knowledge or consent. Billers — including private equity owners of emergency medicine practices — now have to ask insurance companies to pay the balance of their out-of-network bills. It turns out it’s a lot harder to extract unreasonable fees from insurance companies than from individuals. The act served as the death (or near-death) blow for several emergency medicine groups backed by private equity, which at their peak staffed nearly one-fifth of American emergency departments. That really only means some of these firms are now being run with oversight from courts and creditors, not that all of them are out of business: They’re largely still standing, and many have since only expanded their footprint in emergency care. Xinmei Liu for Vox The No Surprises Act did some good for people, but it’s far from perfect. Many people simply are unaware when they’ve been incorrectly billed. Clinicians and the facilities they work for occasionally don’t follow the legislation’s rules, or inappropriately ask patients to waive their protections. Insurance companies don’t automatically absolve patients of responsibility for a surprise out-of-network bill, and the appeals process is complicated and time-consuming. And there are loopholes: Out-of-network ambulances and urgent care facilities aren’t covered, and neither is the follow-up care people get after an emergency room visit. The emergency medicine profession, meanwhile, will take a while to recover from private equity’s onslaught. John’s colleagues are the kinds of doctors who will drive a patient home if they don’t have a ride, he says. Many of the people who seek care in American emergency rooms live on the poorest and most marginalized fringes of society; emergency medicine doctors know this, and for some of them, it’s an important reason they chose the work. “This is not about pay for us,” he says. “This is just about being fair and letting us practice how we want to practice. And that’s gone.” What to do when you need emergency care It has to be said: Patients shouldn’t have to be shrewd when navigating a system that’s supposed to care for them at their most vulnerable, or risk both their life and their finances. And yet, that’s the health care system the US has. It’s hard for people to tell when a private equity firm has taken over a local emergency room. It’s not like the firm slaps its logo on the side of the building. Patients usually don’t even know until they get a bill that an investment company had a hand in determining who saw them in the emergency room and what kind of workup they ordered, says McNamara. Given that reality, anyone who may one day visit an emergency room in the middle of a crisis — that is to say, nearly everyone — should know how to protect themselves, says Patricia Kelmar, who directs health care campaigns for the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG). There are things you can do to ensure you don’t end up with an astronomical bill. Know where to go and who is treating you Some situations don’t permit much decision-making about which emergency room you’ll go to or how you’ll get there. Still, it’s worth making an advance plan for where you’ll go if you have the option. Cooper, the health economist, says an emergency room’s ownership isn’t the only thing that matters in deciding whether to go there in an emergency. If a private equity-owned ER sees a higher patient volume than others and is affiliated with an academic institution, it may still be the best option. Even with the No Surprises Act in place, care from in-network doctors at in-network hospitals is far less likely to result in unpleasant bills. So before you need an emergency room, check with your insurance company to see which ones are in network and nearest to you. Once you’re at an emergency room, Cooper suggests asking to see an in-network physician. Make a plan for how to get there Ambulance transport is unlikely to be cost-free for most Americans, so if you need to get to an emergency room and you’re in stable condition, it’s worth trying to get there in other ways. Air ambulances are covered by the No Surprises Act, but ground ambulances are not, and are unfortunately often out-of-network for many people. The ones owned by private equity are especially likely to be wildly expensive. Nevertheless, many states have laws to protect consumers from outrageous ambulance bills — but only if their plan is state-regulated, which means about 60 percent of insured people are still unprotected. You can figure out if yours is one of them by contacting your state’s insurance department. You can also work with your insurance company and the ambulance company to negotiate big bills; legal aid organizations can also provide assistance. Understand what you’re signing Non-emergency hospital departments (for example, the ones that would take care of you if you had to stay in the hospital for more care after an ER visit) are allowed to ask you to sign away your No Surprises Act protections. The form they use to do this is, totally unironically, called a Surprise Billing Protection Form. Emergency rooms, however, aren’t allowed to ask you to sign this waiver. If they do, say no and report the violation to the No Surprises Help Desk by calling 1-800-985-3059. Almost every US hospital still has to provide care for you under US law. If you get a wonky bill, file a complaint If you do still end up with a nonsensically large bill, you can push back and appeal decisions — again, by reaching out to the No Surprises Help Desk. Additional guidance on your medical billing rights is available on the PIRG website, and legal and other help may be available from organizations like Dollar For and local legal aid groups. Demand better from community leaders and elected officials There are better approaches to solving emergency medicine’s problems than by doing hand-to-hand combat with private equity’s worst practices. Reducing the overall harm requires change on a systemic level. Zirui Song, a Harvard health economist and internist who studies private equity in health care, says those changes include better enforcement of the laws we have aimed at preventing consolidation, fraud, and abuse; closing tax loopholes and other laws that allow private equity firms to conduct business while taking on minimal financial risk; and requiring transparency around private equity health care acquisitions and health care prices. These are all subjects you can contact your elected officials about. You can also ask to join the board of your local hospital, says McNamara. At nonprofit health systems in particular, these groups are required to include people from the community.

    "commentBody": "The profit-obsessed monster destroying American emergency rooms (vox.com)140 points by rntn 4 hours agohidepastfavorite119 comments jaco6 2 hours agoThe problem with American healthcare is the attempt to compromise between healthcare as a universally available public utility and healthcare as a commodity on the private market. (Arguably this is a legacy of pre-modern healthcare, where hospitals were operated by charities run by nuns and funded by aristocrats and royal families, hence all the “Saint” names in hospitals nowadays). There’s a variety of weird examples of this mixed system: >Poor people use ERs for every day healthcare, usually they get away with paying nothing, no insurance >Working people with insurance pay more to enable this access for the destitute (or criminal) portion of the population >Old people are sort of entitled to free healthcare.

A 25 year old male should absolutely not have a $300/mo health premium. But he does, because his premium is paying for other’s care. This is a system pretending to be private, but it’s actually just inefficiently public. It would be more efficient to pay for it using taxes, both income and sales taxes, rather than letting some groups—the poor and the elderly—off the hook arbitrarily. Alternatively, abolish health insurance altogether—a notoriously inefficient and exploitative industry that does not suit the classic purpose of insurance (boat accidents and fires)—and see what happens. This is obviously a rather unpalatable option due to the chaos that would ensue, but it’s probably the best option. reply JamesBarney 2 hours agoparent> It would be more efficient to pay for it using taxes, both income and sales taxes, rather than letting some groups—the poor and the elderly—off the hook arbitrarily. I don't think this is true. Some countries with public healthcare are far more efficient than our system. But there are countries that have systems similar to ours that are far more efficient as well. We just have a really shitty system, and who pays for it isn't going to change that.

Mandatory participation in 1 of 4 non profit insurance programs looks like private insurance but … https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_Israel For the health tax, wage-earners and the self-employed must pay 3.1% of their monthly salary up to 60% of the average prevailing market wage (appx. NIS 6,300 in 2020), and 5% of anything earned above it.[25] Employers are legally obligated to deduct insurance contributions from their employees' salaries, while the self-employed must arrange payment on their own. Pensioners have contributions deducted from their pensions, as do those receiving unemployment benefits. Those who are not working but have income must pay 5% of their income in health tax, while those who are not working and have no income must pay NIS 104 a month.

Urgent Care & Emergency Room combos are here on every corner. It’s a lucrative business, so it makes sense that private equity firms are gobbling it up. But I think the more interesting problem here is one level up. Why are there so many of them? I see two possible reasons: 1. Anytime one of my family members gets sick, it’s rather hard to make an appointment with the primary care provider. They are usually booked, and it takes a day or two to get in. 2. Bills from the primary care providers tend to be significantly higher than a bill from urgent care. Anytime I go to a doctor, it’s around $300 for a basic consultation visit. Any problem easily adds $50-100 to it. My typical bill from an urgent care visit for sickness is around $150. Both places are in-network. Anyway, that’s my experience. reply swatcoder 2 hours agoparent3. Demand for immediate care is high. The next \"one level up\" might explore how much is because the community is quite morbid and unwell, because modern culture has displaced traditional home/self care with consumerized services, or because of other things. There are people I know who are largely healthy and who consult paid medical services many times per year for everyday disturbances, and others who take decades to overcome procrastination to even get a physical. The demand for commercialized health services is very much a cultural thing, especially for everyday wellness, and that culture has been evolving quite dramatically. Meanwhile, there's no ignoring that obesity and sedentary living are rampant, that a recent pandemic spooked people about infectious disease and its possible consequences, etc. You're thinking about the pocketbook economics, here, but looking at it through these other lenses might provide further perspective too. reply 404mm 19 minutes agorootparentI suppose I’m guilty of the demand for immediate care too. Not because I go to the doctor immediately after I get a symptom, but because I try to get better on my own until I reach a point where I think I need help, and at that point, I no longer want to wait. I cannot just schedule an appointment for 3 days ahead because “late” cancellation costs $$ too. reply ryandrake 2 hours agorootparentprev> traditional home/self care Not sure what you mean by this? If I have a broken bone, I'm not going to set it myself at home and take a few aspirin. Same if I'm puking my guts out.

But, when you're actually sick, and need to see a professional, that is the right time for \"consumerized services\". reply swatcoder 2 hours agorootparentYou're welcome to take it as foolish pre-modern ignorance if it strikes you that way, but actually yes: many people do not think to go to a doctor for minor bone injuries or vomiting, and many more than that wouldn't think to do so for more common everyday illnesses like a familiar sore throat, rash, nosebleed, fever, etc For some, this is rooted in a confidence in their own personal-community care, for others its an insight into what few actions a doctor might take themselves for these issues, etc There's lots of ways to explain it, and certainly many of them can be easily criticized by people who see professionalized medicine differently, but you may as well let go of the idea that everybody out there approaches it in the same way that you do. It's probably not even all that consistent among your own circle of family, friends, and acquaintences. We're still only in the beginning of what seems to be a sweeping cultural transformation around how people see health and medicine and the perspectives people bring are still quite diverse. At the same time, the overall direction in recent decades is definitely towards seeking commercial medical care for more concerns as well asserting that this is an entitlement that all people should have access to. reply skybrian 1 hour agorootparentI haven’t heard of some of this and it raises a whole lot of questions. Can you tell us more? What is a “minor bone injury?” What sort of alternative healthcare do they use instead to treat it? Maybe give us an example of some people who do this? reply swatcoder 1 hour agorootparentWell, to make an example that doesn't stretch into ethnic traditions and stays within the contemporary and modern experience that you and I probably share: Consider two non-professional runners who develop a stress fracture. It's a fairly common injury for distance runners who push themselves too far. It presents as a certain kind of pain and that pain becomes aggravated under certain conditions. It's generally easy to self-diagnosis, and more serious fractures are generally evident because they're far more disabling and intensely painful. One goes to a doctor, who quickly has a strong guess as to the problem. Nonetheless, they send the runner for an x-ray to confirm, then take another appointment to review the results and prescribe a treatment. That treatment will amount to rest and patience, and (with some doctors) some prescription for the pain. Total cost billed to someone is probably on the order of $1000. The other is pretty confident in their self-diagnosis and can't fathom the time demands, financial cost, and social resource consumption of bringing in a industrial apparatus just to confirm that diagnosis and be told to take it easy on their affected leg for a few months. Both examples play out everyday, and there's essentially no difference in health outcome for the vastly most common case. It's true that the latter is at higher risk of missing a more serious complication, but it's also true that the former invites costs, consequences, and risks of their own. reply skybrian 1 hour agorootparentOkay, thanks for clarifying! reply orwin 39 minutes agorootparentprevSo, I don't agree with GP, but my grandmothers (on both side of the family weirdly) had IV bags for the longest time for when people were 'puking their guts out'.

The difference is usually in thousands. reply agentcoops 2 hours agoparentprevIt's funny, my first job out of college was machine learning for a company processing medical bills to detect fraud on the part of hospitals. It was a very eye-opening process for me as to how American health care is perhaps the worst designed system conceivable by man -- as in, it's genuinely difficult to imagine how the various regulations, incentives etc could be made worse from any perspective (left or right) or measure (human care, cost, equality, whatever). Medical diagnoses are systematized in a rigorous manner through a series of codes (ICD9s, CPTs, DRGs etc), but there is no real set or expected pricing for each code apart from Medicare and these strange agreements between particular insurance providers and particular hospitals (i.e. what defines \"in-network\" or \"out-of-network\", where pricing is more or less random). Bills also have an explicit location type (Inpatient, Outpatient, Emergency room, Ambulance etc) and Urgent/Emergency Room care is significantly and consistently the most expensive to the insurer (most American insurance is, after all, high deductible emergency insurance) and thus one of the major vectors of fraud was passing bills off as such. One of the real aspects of madness in the whole system is the pricing disconnect and lack of transparency between all participants: hospitals ask an agreed upon price to insurers who pay it with few questions asked, as hospital pricing drifts up insurers raise premium prices, employers keep paying premiums, and individuals either pay something contractually determined by their insurance company or an essentially random price if uninsured. TLDR; it isn't at all surprising to me that yet another vulture on American health care expenditure has discovered how profitable emergency rooms can be and that we see such a mad proliferation of urgent care facilities on every corner. reply titanomachy 3 hours agoparentprev$300 is your part of a regular doctor visit?

They are designed to allow you to take pretax money out and use it to either invest like an IRA or spend it on healthcare. In other words they are actually insurance. Not a prepaid healthcare plan.

They are a small fight against the massive principal agent problem which is the sole issue anyone should be focusing on if they care about healthcare costs. reply 404mm 28 minutes agorootparentprevI was referring to the total bill, in both cases. Sadly, yes, I do have a high deductible plan. The $300+ bill usually gets adjusted to about 50% by the insurance (I’m in network), and then I pay my share, depending on the state of my deductible and out-of-pocket expenses. (So in my case, 90% before deductible is met, then 10%, until I reach my OOP max.)

When you have highly complex regulations, you end up consolidating practices. As regulations increase, the number of distinct providers/owners decrease. Many individuals don't want to run their own practice due to the complexities (insurance, etc) that exist beyond the work (treating people). It doesn't make a lot of sense to deal with the insurance, billing, recordkeepeing, etc for a single physician or two. They wouldn't be able to compete with the larger and more effiecent practices that have more bargaining power with insurance companies anyways. reply ryandrake 3 hours agoparent> The thing that doesn't get mentioned much This gets mentioned every time.

In my country there is less regulation in healthcare services. I can walk into multiple private facilities in my town, get full blood panel with almost everything you can think of included (hormones, vitamins/mineral levels, liver markers etc) for around 100$. The results are going to be available online the same day (with the exception of those that require more lab time). This is fully private enterprise which has nothing to do with \"universal healthcare\" my country has. I don't need prescription or doctor recommendation to get it done. I can also take my own urine/hair/swabs, walk into a lab, pay and have the requests results online in a few days. If I need MRI I can usually schedule it for the next day in multiple private points and again the results are going to be there the same day. The price is around 200 bucks for say cervical spine. How is it in your country? Do you know how much is required to get those basic services in other countries? reply giantg2 2 hours agorootparentIn the US you can have similar labs done at Labcorp or Quest. Prices are similar or slightly higher. MRIs are prescription only and higher priced.

Hardly anybody thinks the ban on leaded gasoline is a bad regulation. > Lack of government oversight and regulations almost always leads, eventually, to cartel pricing and/or monopolistic type pricing. Only if you're specifically talking about lack of antitrust regulations, which is the exception rather than the rule in the overall category of regulations. Most regulations simply increase costs. This is true whether they're good or bad. The ban on leaded gasoline increases the price of gasoline; lead is a cheaper stabilizer than what they use now. The ban on circumventing DRM increases the price of playback devices (or reduces quality at the same price); device makers have to pay to license the stupid DRM and it impairs competition by preventing anyone from making a device with features Hollywood doesn't like. But the ban on leaded gasoline is a good regulation because it's preventing a major externality, whereas the ban on circumventing DRM is a bad regulation because it doesn't do what it was sold as doing and instead is used by the studios to capture the market for playback devices.

In all healthcare systems there is rationing of care. In the U.S. we ration in an immoral way. reply VancouverMan 1 hour agorootparentprevHigh costs are certainly present in socialist medical systems, they're just somewhat obscured. I'm more familiar with Canada's taxpayer-funded, \"universal\" provincial health care systems than the European ones, so I'll describe the costs we typically see with them. Government health care spending makes up a huge portion of the provincial budgets each year. This results in costs like high tax rates, and significant government debt. (Those, in turn, introduce other costs, such as the stifling of business development and employment, among others.) Another significant cost is the poor quality of service. Long delays are the norm. This can mean single-digit hours-long waits for emergency service, double-digit hours-long waits for semi-emergency situations, and weeks to months for routine diagnostics and specialist appointments. A lot of Canadians don't have a family doctor, and walk-in clinics are typically quite busy and have relatively short hours, so people end up going to emergency rooms even for relatively minor health issues. That only exacerbates the problems there. Even once you're finally seen by a practitioner, there is little incentive for them to do a good job because there's pretty much no competition, and no punishment for providing poor service. Don't expect a favourable outcome, especially for anything requiring in-depth investigation or long-term treatment. Common dental, vision, and pharmaceutical costs often aren't covered by the provincial systems, which results in many Canadians paying even more money for costly private medical coverage on top of the \"universal\" coverage they've already paid for via taxation and public debt. It's very revealing that despite paying a lot for the local health care systems, Canadians with the means to do so will often seek treatment in the US anyways. Even if they have to travel and pay a lot more money to do that, at least it tends to result in much faster, and much higher quality, service than they would ever have received in Canada. reply giantg2 2 hours agorootparentprev\"That particular complexity doesn’t come from regulation.\" Considering the ACA requires insurance, it indirectly does.

I've worked in healthcare, and pretty much my whole family does in all the professional roles you can think of. I have mixed feelings about this article and others like it because the motivation to strip the system of everything until profit is left is a serious problem throughout US healthcare. However, it's not unique to private equity — private regional monopolies, or even privately owned clinics and hospitals, can have a similar effect. These articles then have a way of shifting the focus away from the underlying administrative practices that result in these problems, and toward private equity per se. The regulation problem is real too, and I can give lots of examples. It's unlike a lot of other fields too in the scope and how ingrained it is in the system. EHRs are just one example: although well-intended, they were mandated with no \"organic\" roll-out, and pulled what was in-house staff and services and pushed it outside into large monopolies like EPIC (who are now the subject of an antitrust lawsuit IIRC). This happens over and over with all sorts of aspects of US healthcare. I also have problems with the focus of these types of articles — for whatever reason, they often start with or are centered around this kind of wistful new physician (or very old physician near retirement) longing for the romanticized old days where physicians were in charge and ran everything. Should that be the case though? Do we really need MDs to do and approve of everything? Aren't there things that are done as well by PAs, DNPs, and other types of providers that don't even exist yet because of how calcified the healthcare system is? Can't patients do more at home without a middleperson — e.g., needing to approve of some medication that the person has taken for decades without incident and is really truly pretty harmless in the grand scheme of things? The problem you described is very real. It's overregulated, in ways that incentivize large monopolies, either of clinic and hospital owners, or provider rent seeking guilds, infrastructure providers, etc. I guess I feel like these types of articles point to one type of problem, but then tend to implicitly suggest the solution is to just roll back time to some earlier era, not recognizing that that earlier era had a smaller patient population, with less regulation, less monopoly where there was no need to scrutinize whether a certain type of degree is really necessary, where there weren't huge hidden overhead costs of all these monopolies permeating down to the patient. Fixing US healthcare is going to require a bunch of things that collectively will cause pain for a lot of entrenched players: lots of antitrust lawsuits and laws, lots of deregulation aimed at giving patients more choice and self-care options, more public payer options, lots of eliminating or restructuring licensing requirements to create more types of providers, and so forth. They don't map on easily onto current US political party platforms either. reply musicale 18 minutes agoprev> Meanwhile, to minimize costs, private equity-owned staffing firms often replaced more expensive physicians with nurse practitioners and physician associates. It was a move likely to worsen patient care: While these professionals do highly skilled work in a variety of clinical settings, the emergency department is one place where care outcomes are more likely to suffer if a doctor isn’t involved. Using more PAs and NPs seems like it could potentially be beneficial, since 1) they are cheaper than physicians, 2) the supply of physicians is more constrained (due to limits in med school and residency slots to avoid \"oversupply\", as well as longer training time), and 3) NPs and PAs may be well positioned to take care of many non-emergency patients in the ER, urgent care, non-life-threatening cases, etc. What might be helpful is a higher tier of ER-specialist NPs and PAs, as well as an adequate supply of ER physicians to treat the emergency patients in the ER who really need them. reply i80and 3 hours agoprevI know a surgeon who had their employer bought up by private equity.

They are a business, and their motive is profit, they don't care about making you better.

If there were a poorly run company, private equity could use its own money to acquire it, restructure it to be more efficient and valuable, and capture cash flow while owning it and profit from taking it public again. They would make money, the economy would be improved, and a healthy new public company would build more public wealth. This is a bit idealized, but something closer to this really did happen. Now they use raise money from rich people and operate more as alternative investment management, take over efficient operations, strip them, use leverage in the opposite direct (acquisition targets take loans and transfer the money back to PE). We end up with worse services, unsustainable and over-leveraged businesses, money transfer from the public to the wealthy from increased welfare and bankruptcies, and a worse economy because of changes to the velocity wealth returns to the economy from private fortunes. This stinks when it is the Office Depot or Friendly's, but it is a massive problem for residential real estate, delivery of medical care, medicine, and basic food production. You would think that the brilliant folks at KKR, Carlysle, Blackstone, and others would read their classics and know the story of the ancien régime and Romanovs. reply toast0 2 hours agoparent> Private equity is no longer doing its job, to the extent if ever had one. Private equity's job is to take a slowly failing company, extract the value, and turn it into a suddenly failed company. See department stores in the 90s, Circuit City, ToysRUs and restaurant chains more recently. This is a win for the former owners who get cash for their business and can blame the failure on PE, rather than admit it was on a path to fail slowly. This is a win for PE, because they can often extract enough value to make a good profit. It's a win for Spirit stores, because they get great locations like the old Circuit City that still has those maroon tiles up in 2024 and the old ToysRUs that still has the R up. When a sector of business is being bought by PE left and right, it's a sign of unhealthy businesses and the owners want out. reply 29athrowaway 3 hours agoprevMBAs will turn everyone into The Joker. reply giardini 1 hour agoparentIndeed MBAs helped sell American USA) industrial production out to first Mexico and later to China. Sometimes a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing. In Ricardo's simple economic model of \"comparative advantage\" an entire generation of CEOs and MBAs found justification to sell out corporate capital (everything except the labor, which was laid off) for billions. A deeper understanding of the economy (not of economic theory necessarily, but of our economy) might have suggested that such a rapid and total sell-off might be very destructive to society. But greed prevailed and now a generation passed before the full scope of the oversight was realized by most. Society took that long to realize a course correction was required. Capitalism is be a formidable mechanism for good but pure unfettered capitalism usually has bad \"side\" effects. That's why we regulate businesses. Sometimes it works. reply api 3 hours agoparentprevMBAs and similar types are the Western capitalist equivalent of the Soviet apparatchik: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparatchik Entities like PE or conglomerates are a lot like Soviet bureaus: giant bastions of bureaucrats appointed to run things they have no direct expertise in running. The underlying issue here is what I call the \"big dumb money problem.\" You get entities with more resources to deploy than intelligence or expertise to deploy them efficiently. A major argument for things like anti-trust and some degree of progressive taxation is to avoid what I call \"Soviet Kapitalism\" -- which the top of the economy ends up dominated by big dumb money and bureaucratic monopolies. When this happens a market economy starts looking indistinguishable from the USSR. In a way you could say a totalitarian state like the USSR is just an extreme version of this with the state acting like one giant monopoly mega-corp.

People are finding any way to game the system just to get more money You're thinking of using money as a measure but everyone else is using it as a target... reply jerrycabbage 2 hours agorootparentThe answer is a wealth tax. The inequality grows leading into a need for investments like these. If all other assets weren't so inflated then we could at least wish PE wouldn't need to do things like this but this is what will happen. Excess capital keeps buying up assets lower classes need due to lack of options otherwise. reply pessimizer 1 hour agorootparentI'm still an advocate of the old-school top income tax bracket of 85-100% i.e. a maximum income. A general wealth tax always seems like double-dipping; today I take $1 out of your $10, and a year from now I take 90¢ from your remaining $9. It's more of a motivation for one to continue accumulating (a floor, even) just to tread water. Property taxes are different, because more services get provided to people with more property. Income taxes are fine because we take it as a given that the state has the ability to regulate every aspect of domestic financial transactions and financial lives, at least in our currency (even if we don't or shouldn't, we of course can.) A yearly individual income cap means at the least people would have to put money in more hands. Being corrupt on a large scale would hopefully require a larger conspiracy. I'm fine with arbitrary wealth taxes and taxes on capital, with arbitrary justifications, so I'm probably not saying much here; but I'm not in support of a revolving wealth tax. reply bmitc 2 hours agoprevCapitalism is ruining America. We're headed to where everything is buried behind oligarchical institutions. reply nilawafer 3 hours agoprevIsn’t huge profits the definition of success in capitalism? As a capitalist society shouldn’t there be cheers instead of complaining? This part I don’t understand about American culture. reply mattnewton 3 hours agoparentHuge profits mean a lot of value is being captured. That can be because of a large amount of value being created, which is successful capitalism, but it can also mean a lot of rent is being extracted from an existing value stream. Not saying this is the later case, but when people are critical of large profits they usually are critical of the later, where they believe that the value being created has not really gone up, it’s just being funneled away to rent seekers now. This is especially true for things that are seen as “essentials” where buying is fairly mandatory and so prices are inelastic, like housing, food and medical care. If these markets become uncompetitive consumers can’t just walk away from rising prices. So rising profits + the same value being generated point to the market being uncompetitive and are not celebrated in the way rising profits + new value are. reply alan-hn 3 hours agoparentprevThis is because its the profit focus of capitalism that is exactly the problem Its a disconnect powered by propaganda of the definition of \"success\" reply grecy 3 hours agoparentprevI think Americans were always happy with profit because they got a share, they had jobs, etc. it was good for everyone.

That is right. But it doesn't mean something cannot be done, such as a general uprising with organized morals against the prevailing winds of profit above all else.

I would have expected the company to go with \"we didn't say gay and we didn't use external information. We just noticed that users who like X page buy a lot of copies of Playgirl so we hooked you up\". Sounds like he managed to prove more in his case than is apparent from the article. reply contravariant 19 hours agoparentPrivacy legislation has always been a bit iffy about the distinction between data and information. Depending on how this ruling treats that issue it could have knock-on effects. Basically the issue here is that meta was almost certainly in possession of information on Max's sexual orientation and was using this information for advertising, but it's unclear if they had any data. Privacy wise it is great that even partial information counts, but practically almost any data about a person is tainted with fractions of bits of information about their sexual orientation (or political views, or almost any of the protected classes of information). Without resorting to information theory I don't really see any way forward that doesn't end up in endless court cases over how much information is too much. Then again we could just ban targeted advertising and avoid the whole issue in the first place. When differential privacy gets to a usable state we can worry about those instances where it would be nice to use some information for the public good without infringing privacy. reply jmd42 17 hours agoparentprevI don't think he even needed to prove that. Rather it's that, in the course of evaluating this case, the court has been forced to make statements clarifying how certain rules and principles in GDPR are to be interpreted. And this has, in effect, narrowed the way Meta etc can use data. Which for Schrems is really his ultimate goal anyway - his case is just a way to force the courts to rule / establish legal precedent on broader issues. reply crazygringo 19 hours agoprev> Schrems had complained that Facebook had processed personal data including information about his sexual orientation to target him with online advertising, even though he had never disclosed on his account that he was gay. The only time he had publicly revealed this fact was during a panel discussion. But processed what personal data? Where would Facebook even get reliable data on users' sexual orientation in bulk? It's not like you can buy that the way you can get credit scores or geographic locations. (Or can you? I've never heard of it.) I'm very curious for the actual details here. And just because you get ads for products that seem to be marketed to the gay population, what leads the court to determine FB \"identified\" him as gay? My YouTube regularly has random ads in Spanish probably just because of some bug. Most ads seem to mistarget me, in fact. reply bastawhiz 19 hours agoparentI'd guess that it's inferred from the content you interact with. If you spend a lot of time liking fireman calendar photoshoots and give no likes to women in swimsuits, there's a reasonable inference to be made. I'd also guess that Facebook can do this pretty reliably for gender and age, martial status, parental status, and lots of other things. reply kgeist 18 hours agorootparentWhat if the underlying algorithm simply matches \"users who like X also like Y\" without having concepts like sexual orientation baked in. And it just happened that it accidentally suggested certain things gay people generally like, because Max Schrems liked that \"X\" once. reply derbOac 4 hours agorootparentThis is where it gets murky. The algorithm could also recover a group without labeling anything — \"Latent Group 7539\". Even then, how do you know the algorithm is recommending something \"because\" of the unlabeled sexual orientation class per se, and not because of some closely associated latent class? reply bastawhiz 17 hours agorootparentprevBut that's not how Facebook sells ads. It would be one thing to recommend more content like what you've engaged with already. It's another thing to let advertisers check boxes that let them say \"sell my product to gay men between the ages of 25 and 35\" and to satisfy that without ever having the user tell you their orientation or age. Facebook deliberately crunches the numbers and produces a clear signal from them that advertisers can filter on. reply valicord 14 hours agorootparentNo, that really is how Facebook sells ads: https://www.facebook.com/business/help/164749007013531?id=40... reply bastawhiz 14 hours agorootparentCreating a lookalike audience is literally just saying \"create ad targeting that parallels the things that would target this other group of people\". Just because you're not specifically choosing interests or behaviors and instead relying on automation to do the work doesn't mean that's not what's happening under the hood. \"Show this ad to mothers\" is effectively the same as \"here's 100 mothers, show this ad to people like them\". This differs from betting shown recommendations because you're actively being targeted. reply yunohn 12 hours agorootparentHmm, not exactly. It’s more akin to “here’s 100 customers, show my ad to others who have similar interests/behaviors”. You don’t upload a list of 100 identical customers, nor would that be useful for lookalikes. reply bastawhiz 16 minutes agorootparentAnd to my point, in no way is this equivalent to \"you liked this one thing, so here's another thing you might like\". It's still targeting. Facebook isn't arbitrarily showing you ads. \"People like this\" is what advertisers set, whether that comes from the advertiser checking boxes or providing a sample of similar users is an unimportant distinction. At no point is Facebook ever making the self directed decision to show an ad to someone that doesn't positively match some criteria that the advertiser specified. That would be wild, and as I said, that's not how Facebook sells ads. reply kgeist 14 hours agorootparentprevThey do have a checkbox \"Sell to gay men\"? reply bastawhiz 14 hours agorootparentIncidentally they removed the checkbox for LGBT targeting in 2022, but that doesn't mean you can't get the same results with other targeting options. reply golergka 15 hours agorootparentprevIs inferring something from data you legally obtained illegal or immoral? reply Spivak 14 hours agorootparentOnly in tech can you ask a question like this and have it be taken seriously. Which is ironic because we're the people who understand authz vs authn. I'm sure from their ToS Facebook legally has claim to my firstborn but this is obviously flagrantly unethical. There's too much money to be made behaving unethically for any legal hurdles to exist. There is a reasonable expectation about what you are allowed to do with someone else's data that you're stewarding. And data-mining your users to discover information they haven't and wouldn't voluntarily disclosed you isn't one of them. Hell in most cases accessing that data at all not in service of a direct user request shouldn't be allowed. There is no reason for Google to access files stored in my Google Drive except to serve them back to me when asked. I say this as someone who at $dayjob is a steward of petabytes of extremely personal data about people. I/my company would be genuinely be betraying our users' trust if we pulled something like this. Because we could and it would even arguably be useful, but it would be a complete violation of their privacy. Does end-running around privacy by saying, \"well I technically didn't violate your privacy I just compared your semi-private data you gave us/we collected to millions of other people and now know a bunch of private information about you with high accuracy\" feel like it would go over well with people? reply seanhunter 5 hours agorootparentprevThe short answer to your question is it is obviously unethical unless it is specifically done for a relevant and lawful purpose and it can absolutely be illegal depending on the data protection regime you are operating under. Specifically in the UK and EU, sexual orientation is a highly-protected class of personal information known as \"Special Category Data\". The UK ICO has actually issued guidance on the legality of inference on this category of data[1]: If this is the case, then you are processing special category data regardless of how confident you are that the inference is correct. If you carry out any form of profiling which infers things like ethnicity, beliefs, politics, health status (condition or risks), sexual orientation or sex life, you will be processing special category data and must identify an Article 9 condition for processing. The only article 9 conditions that suffice to make processing of special category data legal are \"explicit consent\", \"not for profit bodies\" (under certain conditions) and \"substantial public interest\" [2] [1] https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-re...

I think of the story where Target was pushing diaper ads on someone before her dad (maybe even her?) knew she was pregnant reply AStonesThrow 20 hours agoparentSure, Schrems' claims seem to hinge on the fact that the only evidence of direct self-identification by Schrems is that one instance of a verbal claim on a panel discussion. (That is not how sexual orientation works, by the way: it necessarily involves conduct, activity or interests...) But if advertising works on a recommendation engine basis, or groups similar tastes together, then if someone uses the Meta platform enough, there will be circumstancial evidence that this person's interests and activities coincide with other gay people. Perhaps the merit of the case rested with Schrems barely using Meta/FB, not providing any direct data or engagement, and only to discover that advertising was targeted. Of course, Meta is a vast platform, including comments sections and widgets and third-party cookies across many websites. But Meta takes Meta's privacy very seriously, so perhaps nobody but the court will ever see what Meta and their partners learned about Schrems, or how they learned it. reply tbrownaw 19 hours agorootparent> Perhaps the merit of the case rested with If only the AP had gone web-first instead of staying legacy, we'd all probably be able to just follow a link to the actual case information instead of having to guess. reply froh 14 hours agorootparentprev> it necessarily involves conduct, activity or interests. nit: did you mean conduct (which connotes moral principles) or did you mean plain behaviour (which doesn't lump what you do together with if it's \"right\" or \"wrong\", according to some but maybe not some other rulebook) reply AStonesThrow 10 hours agorootparentIt's the difference between mere claims and actual being/status.

This sounds like it'll kill the vast majority of their inferred data points, as well as any ingested from 3rd parties. Sounds fair enough to me. Glad I sold my FB shares last month. reply helsinkiandrew 13 hours agoparentprev> Wait so someone at Meta entered somewhere that this person is gay? Or was this based on, say, cookies and general browsing habits? General browsing habits - he interacted with ‘gay content’ - websites, facebook groups etc. so could be targeted by advertisers that wanted their ads shown to people who interacted with that content. I don’t think FB have a gay checkbox for targeting now but advertisers can choose websites and FB groups. Im not sure if this ruling effectively kills FB targeted advertising using data from outside FB or just if you're gay or not reply JumpCrisscross 20 hours agoprevDo these rulings assign damages or fines? reply buzer 19 hours agoparentAs far as I understand CJEU does not, at least not on this type of case where their opinion regarding EU law is asked by national court. Damages & fines are left to national courts, in this case Austria's Supreme Court (who might send it back to lower courts, I do not have any specific knowledge of Austria's court system). reply AStonesThrow 20 hours agoprevThe court decision pertains only to targeting advertising to the same user. They didn't say that the data can't be collected. They didn't say the data can't be processed at all. They didn't say that the data can't be \"aggregated and analysed\" for some purpose other than \"to offer him personalised advertising\". Meta does indeed offer controls to disable personalised and targeted advertising. If Schrems had disabled these settings appropriately, would Schrems have learned what Meta knew? It would seem that the targeting and personalisation is often the only way a user will find out what social media knows about us. So IMHO, this is a sad, sad day for your privacy and Schrem's privacy, because if Meta can't reveal what they know about us through advertising and targeting, then Meta does indeed take Meta's privacy very seriously. reply impossiblefork 19 hours agoparentArticle 9 of the GDPR says: Processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation shall be prohibited.

It's a case brought strategically in order to trigger certain questions of interpretation of GDPR rules to be litigated. Schrems' specific claim only needs to hold enough water to give him standing to get the case through enough filters in the court system to facilitate this. reply AStonesThrow 18 hours agoparentprevYou get targeted by advertisements for institutions offering degrees in Christian studies or some such thing, because you're an atheist. I fixed that quote for you, because advertising is often targeted to the opposite demographic for various reasons. Just try enjoying your favorite show on radio or regular TV, and you'll perceive ads for stuff you would never touch, but they are paying good $$$ to support that show you like, and to get in front of everyone possible, and perhaps wear you down with brand recognition and exciting jingles to influence your buying decisions in a moment of weakness. However, targeted advertising may know exactly what you like, and be an effective means of call-to-action and conversion to sales. On the back end, Meta advertisers fill out a list of audience interests and demographics. So yes, if the advertisements and their buyers were documented, Meta should also have sales info on the intended audiences. reply pembrook 14 hours agoparentprevFacebook didn’t determine he was gay, it’s just spray-and-pray by the algorithm exactly like you said.

I don't think the \"such as\" clause covers lawsuits. reply wizzwizz4 19 hours agorootparentThat's not how dictionaries work. The definition points at a meaning: it doesn't construct it, mathematics-style. Activism is where you take action to change something specific and significant, relative to the counterfactual where you did not take such action. (It also includes failed attempts at the same.) If – say – there were strong social taboos against using the letter \"e\", and by using them in your comment you aimed to erode them, then yes, pressing \"submit\" would be activism. The same if you were coming out publicly, with the aim to make it easier for others to do so. Wearing clothes can be activism. There's no reason that lawsuits shouldn't qualify, if their goal is to create a better world. \"Create a better world\" isn't a necessary condition for being activism. > A long time ago, I was in Burma.

    "originBody": "Ken Shirriff's blog Computer history, restoring vintage computers, IC reverse engineering, and whatever Inside the Globus INK: a mechanical navigation computer for Soviet spaceflight The Soviet space program used completely different controls and instruments from American spacecraft. One of the most interesting navigation instruments onboard Soyuz spacecraft was the Globus, which used a rotating globe to indicate the spacecraft's position above the Earth. This navigation instrument was an electromechanical analog computer that used an elaborate system of gears, cams, and differentials to compute the spacecraft's position. Officially, the unit was called a \"space navigation indicator\" with the Russian acronym ИНК (INK),1 but I'll use the more descriptive nickname \"Globus\". The INK-2S \"Globus\" space navigation indicator. Coincidentally, the latitude indicator matches the Ukrainian flag. We recently received a Globus from a collector and opened it up for repair and reverse engineering. In this blog post, I explain how it operated, show its internal mechanisms, and describe what I've learned so far from reverse engineering. The photo below gives an idea of the mechanical complexity of this device, which also has a few relays, solenoids, and other electrical components. Side view of the Globus INK. Click this (or any other image) for a larger version. Functionality The primary purpose of the Globus was to indicate the spacecraft's position. The globe rotated while fixed crosshairs on the plastic dome indicated the spacecraft's position. Thus, the globe matched the cosmonauts' view of the Earth, allowing them to confirm their location. Latitude and longitude dials next to the globe provided a numerical indication of location. Meanwhile, a light/shadow dial at the bottom showed when the spacecraft would be illuminated by the sun or in shadow, important information for docking. The Globus also had an orbit counter, indicating the number of orbits. The Globus had a second mode, indicating where the spacecraft would land if they fired the retrorockets to initiate a landing. Flipping a switch caused the globe to rotate until the landing position was under the crosshairs and the cosmonauts could evaluate the suitability of this landing site. The cosmonauts configured the Globus by turning knobs to set the spacecraft's initial position and orbital period. From there, the Globus electromechanically tracked the orbit. Unlike the Apollo Guidance Computer, the Globus did not receive navigational information from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) or other sources, so it did not know the spacecraft's real position. It was purely a display of the predicted position. A close-up of the complex gear trains in the Globus. The globe The globe itself is detailed for its small size, showing terrain features such as mountains, lakes, and rivers. These features on the map helped cosmonauts compare their position with the geographic features they could see on Earth. These features were also important for selecting a landing site, so they could see what kind of terrain they would be landing on. For the most part, the map doesn't show political boundaries, except for thick red and purple lines. This line shows the borders of the USSR, as well as the boundaries between communist and non-communist countries, also important for selecting a landing site. The globe also has numbered circles 1 through 8 that indicate radio sites for communication with the spacecraft, allowing the cosmonauts to determine what ground stations could be contacted. A view of the globe showing Asia. Controlling the globe On seeing the Globus, one might wonder how the globe is rotated. It may seem that the globe must be free-floating so it can rotate in two axes. Instead, a clever mechanism attaches the globe to the unit. The key is that the globe's equator is a solid piece of metal that rotates around the horizontal axis of the unit. A second gear mechanism inside the globe rotates the globe around the North-South axis. The two rotations are controlled by concentric shafts that are fixed to the unit, allowing two rotational degrees of freedom through fixed shafts. The photo below shows the frame that holds and controls the globe. The dotted axis is fixed horizontally in the unit and rotations are fed through the two gears at the left. One gear rotates the globe and frame around the dotted axis, while the gear train causes the globe to rotate around the vertical polar axis (while the equator remains fixed). The axis of the globe is at 51.8° to support that orbital inclination. The angle above is 51.8° which is very important: this is the inclination of the standard Soyuz orbit. As a result, simply rotating the globe around the dotted line causes the crosshair to trace the standard orbit.2 Rotating the two halves of the globe around the poles yields the different 51.8° orbits over the Earth's surface as the Earth rotates. (Why 51.8 degrees? The Baikonur Cosmodrome, launching point for Soyuz, is at 45.97° N latitude, so 45.97° would be the most efficient inclination. However, to prevent the launch from passing over western China, the rocket must be angled towards the north, resulting in 51.8° (details).) One important consequence of this design is that the orbital inclination is fixed by the angle of the globe mechanism. Different Globus units needed to be built for different orbits. Moreover, this design only handles circular orbits, making it useless during orbit changes such as rendezvous and docking. These were such significant limitations that some cosmonauts wanted the Globus removed from the control panel, but it remained until it was replaced by a computer display in Soyuz-TMA (2002).3 A closeup of the gears that drive the motion of the two halves of the globe around the polar axis, leaving the equator fixed. This Globus had clearly suffered some damage. The back of the case had some large dents.7 More importantly, the globe's shaft had been knocked loose from its proper position and no longer meshed with the gears. This also put a gouge into Africa, where the globe hit internal components. Fortunately, CuriousMarc was able to get the globe back into position while ensuring that the gears had the right timing. (Putting the globe back arbitrarily would mess up the latitude and longitude.) Orbital speed and the \"cone\" An orbit of Soyuz takes approximately 90 minutes, but the time varies according to altitude.4 The Globus has an adjustment knob (below) to adjust the orbital period in minutes, tenths of minutes, and hundredths of minutes. The outer knob has three positions and points to the digit that changes when the inner knob is turned. The mechanism provides an adjustment of ±5 minutes from the nominal period of 91.85 minutes.3 The control to adjust the orbital period. The orbital speed feature is implemented by increasing or decreasing the speed at which the globe rotates around the orbital (horizontal) axis. Generating a variable speed is tricky, since the Globus runs on fixed 1-hertz pulses. The solution is to start with a base speed, and then add three increments: one for the minutes setting, one for the tenths-of-minutes setting, and one for the hundredths-of-minutes setting.5 These four speeds are added (as shaft rotation speeds) using obtain the overall rotation speed. The Globus uses numerous differential gears to add or subtract rotations. The photo below shows two sets of differential gears, side-by-side. Two differential gears in the Globus. The problem is how to generate these three variable rotation speeds from the fixed input. The solution is a special cam, shaped like a cone with a spiral cross-section. Three followers ride on the cam, so as the cam rotates, the follower is pushed outward and rotates on its shaft. If the follower is near the narrow part of the cam, it moves over a small distance and has a small rotation. But if the follower is near the wide part of the cam, it moves a larger distance and has a larger rotation. Thus, by moving the follower to a particular point on the cam, the rotational speed of the follower is selected. A diagram showing the orbital speed control mechanism. The cone has three followers, but only two are visible from this angle. The \"transmission\" gears are moved in and out by the outer knob to select which follower is adjusted by the inner knob. Obviously, the cam can't spiral out forever. Instead, at the end of one revolution, its cross-section drops back sharply to the starting diameter. This causes the follower to snap back to its original position. To prevent this from jerking the globe backward, the follower is connected to the differential gearing via a slip clutch and ratchet. Thus, when the follower snaps back, the ratchet holds the drive shaft stationary. The drive shaft then continues its rotation as the follower starts cycling out again. Thus, the output is a (mostly) smooth rotation at a speed that depends on the position of the follower. Latitude and longitude The indicators at the left and the top of the globe indicate the spacecraft's latitude and longitude respectively. These are defined by surprisingly complex functions, generated by the orbit's projection onto the globe.6 The latitude and longitude functions are implemented through the shape of metal cams; the photo below shows the longitude mechanism. Each function has two cams: one cam implements the desired function, while the other cam has the \"opposite\" shape to maintain tension on the jaw-like tracking mechanism. The cam mechanism to compute longitude. The latitude cam drives the latitude dial, causing it to oscillate between 51.8° N and 51.8° S. Longitude is more complicated because the Earth's rotation causes it to constantly vary. The longitude output on the dial is produced by adding the cam's value to the Earth's rotation through a differential gear. Light and shadow The Globus has an indicator to show when the spacecraft will enter light or shadow. The dial consists of two concentric dials, configured by the two knobs. These dials move with the spacecraft's orbit, while the red legend remains fixed. I think these dials are geared to the longitude dial, but I'm still investigating. The light and shadow indicator is controlled by two knobs. The landing location mechanism The Globus can display where the spacecraft would land if you started a re-entry burn now, with an accuracy of 150 km. This is computed by projecting the current orbit forward by a partial orbit, depending on how long it would take to land. The cosmonaut specifies this value by the \"landing angle\", which indicates this fraction of an orbit as an angle. An electroluminescent indicator in the upper-left corner of the unit shows \"Место посадки\" (Landing place) to indicate this mode. The landing angle control. To obtain the landing position, a motor spins the globe until it is stopped after rotating through the specified angle. The mechanism to implement this is shown below. The adjustment knob on the panel turns the adjustment shaft which moves the limit switch to the desired angle via the worm gear. The wiring is wrapped around a wheel so the wiring stays controlled during this movement. When the drive motor is activated, it rotates the globe and the swing arm at the same time. Since the motor stops when the swing arm hits the angle limit switch, the globe rotates through the desired angle. The fixed limit switch is used when returning the globe's position to its regular, orbital position. The landing angle function uses a complex mechanism. The landing location mode is activated by a three-position rotary switch. The first position \"МП\" (место посадки, landing site) selects the landing site, the second position \"З\" (Земля, Earth) shows the position over the Earth, and the third position \"Откл\" (off) undoes the landing angle rotation and turns off the mechanism. The rotary switch to select the landing angle mode. Electronics Although the Globus is mostly mechanical, it has an electronics board with four relays and a transistor, as well as resistors and diodes. I think that most of these relays control the landing location mechanism, driving the motor forward or backward and stopping at the limit switch. The diodes are flyback diodes, two diodes in series across each relay coil to eliminate the inductive kick when the coil is disconnected. The electronics circuit board. A 360° potentiometer (below) converts the spacecraft's orbital position into a voltage. Sources indicate that the Globus provides this voltage signal to other units on the spacecraft. My theory is that the transistor on the electronics board amplifies this voltage, but I am still investigating. The potentiometer converts the orbital position into a voltage. To the right is the cam that produces the longitude display. Antarctica is visible on the globe. The photo below shows the multiple wiring bundles in the Globus, at the front and the left. The electronics board is at the front right. The Globus contains a surprising amount of wiring for a device that is mostly mechanical. Inconveniently, all the wires to the box's external connector (upper left) were cut.7 Perhaps this was part of decommissioning the unit. However, one of the screws on the case is covered with a tamper-resistant wax seal with insignia, and this wax seal was intact. This indicates that the unit was officially re-sealed after cutting the wires, which doesn't make sense for a decommissioned unit. This view shows the back and underside of the Globus. The round connector at the back left provided the interface with the rest of the spacecraft. The black wires under this connector were all cut. The drive solenoids The unit is driven by two ratchet solenoids: one for the orbital rotation and one for the Earth's rotation. These solenoids take 27-volt pulses at 1 hertz.3 Each pulse causes the solenoid to advance the gear by one tooth; a pawl keeps the gear from slipping back. These small rotations drive the gears throughout the Globus and result in a tiny movement of the globe. One of the driving solenoids in the Globus. The wheels to indicate orbital time are underneath. The other driving solenoid in the Globus. Apollo-Soyuz If you look closely at the globe, it has a bunch of pink dots added, along with three-letter labels in Latin (not Cyrillic) characters.8 In the photo below, you can see GDS (Goldstone), MIL (Merritt Island), BDA (Bermuda), and NFL (Newfoundland). These are NASA tracking sites, which implies that this Globus was built for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, a 1975 mission where an Apollo spacecraft docked with a Soyuz capsule. North America as it appears on the globe. The US border is marked in red. The selection of cities seems a bit random, such as El Paso as the only western city until the coast. Further confirmation of the Apollo-Soyuz connection is the VAN sticker in the middle of the Pacific Ocean (not visible above). The USNS Vanguard was a NASA tracking ship that was used in the Apollo program to fill in gaps in radio coverage. It was an oil tanker from World War II, converted postwar to a missile tracking ship and then used for Apollo. In the photo below, you can see the large tracking antennas on its deck. During the Apollo-Soyuz mission, Vanguard was stationed at 25 S 155 W for the Apollo-Soyuz mission, exactly matching the location of the VAN dot on the globe.

The first version was simpler and had the Russian acronym ИМП (IMP).9 Development of the IMP started in 1960 for the Vostok (1961) and Voshod (1964) spaceflights. The Globus IMP. Photo from Francoisguay (CC BY-SA 3.0). The basic functions of the earlier Globus IMP are similar to the INK, showing the spacecraft's position and the landing position. It has an orbit counter in the lower right. The latitude and longitude displays at the top were added for the Voshod flights. The large correction knob allows the orbital period to be adjusted. The main differences are that the IMP doesn't have a display at the bottom for sun and shade and doesn't have a control to set the landing angle.9 Unlike the INK, the mode (orbit vs landing position) was selected by external switches, rather than a switch on the unit. The more complex INK model (described in this blog post) was created for the Soyuz flights, starting in 1967. It was part of the \"Sirius\" information display system (IDS). The Neptun IDS used on Soyuz-T (1976) and the Neptun-M for Soyuz-TM (1986) modernized much of the console but kept the Globus INK. The photo below shows the Globus mounted in the upper-right of a Soyuz-TM console. The Neptun-M IDS for the Soyuz-TM (source). The Soyuz-TMA (2002) upgraded to the Neptun-ME system3 which used digital display screens. In particular, the Globus was replaced with the graphical display below. A computer display from the Neptune-ME display system used in the Soyuz-TMA spaceship. The Soyuz consoles are much simpler than the Apollo or Space Shuttle consoles, and built with completely different design principles. From Information Display Systems for Soyuz Spaceships. Conclusions The Globus INK is a remarkable piece of machinery, an analog computer that calculates orbits through an intricate system of gears, cams, and differentials. It provided cosmonauts with a high-resolution, full-color display of the spacecraft's position, way beyond what an electronic space computer could provide in the 1960s. Although the Globus is an amazing piece of mechanical computation, its functionality is limited. Its parameters must be manually configured: the spacecraft's starting position, the orbital speed, the light/shadow regions, and the landing angle. It doesn't take any external guidance inputs, such as an IMU (inertial measurement unit), so it's not particularly accurate. Finally, it only supports a circular orbit at a fixed angle. While the more modern digital display lacks the physical charm of a rotating globe, the digital solution provides much more capability. I plan to continue reverse-engineering the Globus and hope to get it operational, so follow me on Twitter @kenshirriff or RSS for updates. I've also started experimenting with Mastodon recently as @oldbytes.space@kenshirriff. Many thanks to Marcel for providing the Globus. Thanks to Stack Overflow for orbit information and my Twitter followers for translation assistance. I should give a disclaimer that I am still reverse-engineering the Globus, so what I described is subject to change. Also, I don't read Russian, so any errors are the fault of Google Translate. :-) With the case removed, the complex internals of the Globus are visible. Notes and references In Russian, the name for the device is \"Индикатор Навигационный Космический\" abbreviated as ИНК (INK). This translates to \"space navigation indicator.\" The name Globus (Глобус) seems to be a nickname, and I suspect it's more commonly used in English than Russian. ↩ To see how the angle between the poles and the globe's rotation results in the desired orbital inclination, consider two limit cases. First, suppose the angle between is 90°. In this case, the globe is \"straight\" with the equator horizontal. Rotating the globe along the horizontal axis, flipping the poles end-over-end, will cause the crosshair to trace a polar orbit, giving the expected inclination of 90°. On the other hand, suppose the angle is 0°. In this case, the globe is \"sideways\" with the equator vertical. Rotating the globe will cause the crosshair to remain over the equator, corresponding to an equatorial orbit with 0° inclination. ↩ A detailed description of Globus in Russian is in this document, in Section 5. ↩↩↩↩↩ Or conversely, the altitude varies according to the speed. ↩ Note that panel control adjusts the period of the orbit, while the implementation adjusts the speed of the orbit. These are reciprocals, so linear changes in the period result in hyperbolic changes in the speed. The mechanism, however, changes the speed linearly, which seems like it wouldn't work. However, since the period is large relative to the change in the period, this linear approximation works and the error is small, about 1%. It's possible that the cone has a nonlinear shape to correct this, but I couldn't detect any nonlinearity in photographs. ↩ The latitude is given by arcsin(sin i * sin (2πt/T)), while the longitude is given by λ = arctan (cos i * tan(2πt/T)) + Ωt + λ0, where t is the spaceship's flight time starting at the equator, i is the angle of inclination (51.8°), T is the orbital period, Ω is the angular velocity of the Earth's rotation, and λ0 is the longitude of the ascending node.3 The formula for latitude is simpler than longitude because the latitude repeats every orbit. The longitude, however, continually changes as the Earth rotates under the spacecraft. ↩ The back of the Globus has a 32-pin connector, a standard RS32TV Soviet military design. The case also has some dents visible; the dents were much larger before CuriousMarc smoothed them out. The back of the Globus. ↩↩ The NASA tracking sites marked with dots are CYI (Grand Canary Island), ACN (Ascension), MAD (Madrid, Spain), TAN (Tananarive, Madagascar), GWM (Guam), ORR (Orroral, Australia), HAW (Hawaii), GDS (Goldstone, California), MIL (Merritt Island, Florida), QUI (Quito, Ecuador), AGO (Santiago, Chile), BDA (Bermuda), NFL (Newfoundland, Canada), and VAN (Vanguard tracking ship). Most of these sites were part of the Spacecraft Tracking and Data Network. The numbers 1-7 are apparently USSR communication sites, although I'm puzzled by 8 in Nova Scotia and 9 in Honduras. ↩ Details on the earlier Globus IMP are at this site, including a discussion of the four different versions IMP-1 through IMP-4. Wikipedia also has information. ↩↩ Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest Labels: electronics, globus, reverse-engineering, space, teardown 13 comments: Anonymous said...

Among other things, it has a shaft coming out of the pole, while the Globus has gears attached to the equator. February 22, 2023 at 2:40 PM Oleg said... Fantastic work! Any chance to share high res photos of the globe's map? I believe it is hard to get a copy of the Globe INK device, even the globe itself. Maybe a scan copy can help someone get a feeling on what cosmonauts have seen while on mission in space? March 8, 2023 at 1:18 PM Scott Schneeweis spaceaholic@gmail.com said... Well that was an image I posted on Collectspace confusing the RAHU-87 globe.

    "originBody": "We only learnt of our son’s secret online life after he died at 20 When Mats Steen died from a muscle-wasting disorder, his parents believed that his life had been a tragically lonely one — until hundreds of emails from strangers arrived. It turns out that he’d found friendship and even romance in a gaming community Mats Steen aged about 16 and his parents, Trude and Robert Steen. “We thought, who are these people emailing us? Are they crazy or what?” COURTESY OF STEEN FAMILY/NETFLIX, TIM JOBLING FOR THE TIMES MAGAZINE Ben Machell Saturday October 05 2024, 12.01am BST, The Times I t is the summer of 1989 and a Norwegian couple return from hospital cradling their newborn son. Their names are Robert and Trude Steen, this is their first child and they have named him Mats. The early weeks pass in the delirious, hormone-flooded fug of new parenthood, Robert documenting his son’s wriggles and cries on his camcorder with a new-found paternal pride that has left him dumbfounded. And as the months pass, the camera keeps rolling. Mats grows. He sprouts bright blond Nordic hair. He drags himself to his feet and begins to toddle. His father films him waddling across their living room in a Tom and Jerry T-shirt. He was, Robert remembers, “the most beautiful, perfect child”. Rumour and Ibelin in World of Warcraft. “In this other world, a girl wouldn’t see a wheelchair,” Mats wrote WORLD OF WARCRAFT AND BLIZZARD ENTERTAINMENT © 2024/COURTESY OF NETFLIX From about the age of two, though, something changes. Robert and Trude cannot put their finger on it at first, but a concern for their child begins to gnaw at them. He struggles to get back to his feet when he falls. Playground obstacles become insurmountable. Robert films Mats as he stumbles and plonks to his bottom. But he just sits on the ground in his dungarees, crying and helpless. “As a parent, you know when something is wrong with your child,” Trude says. They just didn’t know what. For two years they worry, watching purse-lipped as their son’s physical development slows then stalls. They push and persuade doctors to take their fears seriously. There are tests and examinations and then, finally, they receive the news. “It was 1pm on May 18, 1993,” Robert says. “I remember the hospital office where we were given the message. I remember everything.” Mats aged five or six COURTESY OF STEEN FAMILY/NETFLIX Their son, the doctor explains, has a condition known as Duchenne muscular dystrophy. It is a genetic disorder that causes progressive muscle wastage and will, over time, deprive Mats of all his remaining strength and mobility. Walking will become harder and harder for him. In a few years he will need a wheelchair and then, eventually, a team of round-the-clock carers as his condition gradually renders him physically helpless. There will be feeding tubes and machines to help him clear his lungs, because swallowing and coughing will be beyond him. He may, his parents are told, live to be 20. “Our world broke apart,” Trude says gently. “The message was devastating, brutal. It was the day we understood it wouldn’t go away. It would rule our lives and, inthe end, also take Mats away from us.” Amid the shock and horror, there is also the quiet abandonment of the future they had hoped for their son: of skiing and football, of university, a successful career and perhaps one day a family of his own. Instead, they learn to focus on each day as it comes and to find and provide what happiness they can in each moment. Mats grows into an intelligent schoolboy with a droll sense of humour. By the age of eight he is in a wheelchair, but he bonds with his schoolmates in Oslo and shares in the communal passion for video games. He loves his little sister, Mia, and their pet dog. Everyone argues over who gets to be on Mats’ team during family quiz nights. ADVERTISEMENT His teenage years are harder. His friends, inevitably, are drawn into a world of house parties and late-night cinema trips and early romantic relationships. It is a world Mats cannot enter. “No friends came knocking at the door any more,” Robert says, without bitterness. So Mats spends more and more time alone, playing video games. He discovers an online role-playing game called World of Warcraft, in which thousands of players can explore a vast, three-dimensional, Dungeons & Dragons-style fantasy world and work together to complete quests and defeat monsters. He sinks hour after hour into the game and his parents allow him to: he is already denied so many of life’s pleasures, it would seem churlish to deny him this. At 18, he graduates from high school with excellent grades but is unemployable. He moves into an annexe, is looked after by a rotating team of carers and spends much of his time deeply absorbed in World of Warcraft, his right hand resting awkwardly on a custom-built keyboard, his head lolling to one side as he navigates an epic world. Robert and Trude sometimes sit with him while he plays, but after half an hour they find their attention drifting. “It was boring, just sitting there watching something on screen,” Robert admits. “We didn’t know what was going on.” Mats around nine COURTESY OF STEEN FAMILY/NETFLIX The years pass. Mats’ 20th birthday comes and goes. He begins to write a blog about his life and condition as his body seems to become smaller and more fragile by the day. In November 2014, he is admitted to hospital with respiratory problems. It is not the first time this has happened and, though these episodesare fraught, he has always returned home after several days of intensive care. This time, however, the Steens are roused by a telephone call not long after they have gone to bed for the night. “It was the hospital,” Robert says. “They said, ‘We think you should get in your car and hurry here now.’ So we threw ourselves in the car. We had never driven so fast through Oslo, but it was at night, so the streets were quiet.” Robert and Trude flew into the hospital at 12.14am, desperate to see their child. “We were exactly 14 minutes late. He had died at midnight.” The feeling, he says, was “complete emptiness. What had filled our lives, for better or worse, physically, mentally, practically, was now over. It had come to an end.” Their grief is deepened by the knowledge that their son had lived a small, discreet life of little real consequence. He had made no mark on the world or on the lives of anyone outside his immediate family. Mats had never known romantic love or lasting friendship, or the feeling of having made a meaningful contribution to society. They log in to his blog so they can post a message letting his followers know that he has died. And then they sit together on the sofa, unable to sleep, unable to do anything. ADVERTISEMENT Then something rouses them. It is an email from a stranger, expressing their sorrow at Mats’ death. It is quickly followed by another email from another stranger, eulogising their son. The messages continue, a trickle becoming a flood as people convey their condolences and write paragraph after paragraph about Mats. He had a warm heart, people write. He was funny and imaginative, a good listener and generous. You should be proud of him, everyone stresses. A primary school teacher from Denmark writes that after hearing of Mats’ death, she broke down in class and had to return home. A 65-year-old psychologist from England says something similar. “Mats was a real friend to me,” writes another stranger. “He was an incurable romantic and had considerable success with women.” Someone else writes to them describing Mats’ empathy. “I don’t think,” they say, “he was aware of how big an impact he had on a lot of people.” Mats aged about 16 COURTESY OF STEEN FAMILY/NETFLIX Robert and Trude cannot make sense of this. “Who are these people? Are they crazy or what?” Robert asks, frowning. Slowly, though, with each new email, the truth begins to reveal itself. Their son had lived by another name. To his family he had simply been Mats. But within World of Warcraft he had existed for years as a charismatic adventurer named “Ibelin”, a strapping swashbuckler with auburn hair tied back in a ponytail and a butch goatee beard. And it was as this digital alter ego that Mats had thrived in a way his family had never appreciated. They had misunderstood what World of Warcraft really was. It had seemed to them like a frenetic action game of monster-bashing and point-scoring. To Mats and the many people he played with – the people now emailing Robert and Trude – it was something far more profound: an immersive world built on social interactions, friendships and shared storytelling. Robert smiles. “This window started to open up to us that let us see he had another life besides his physical life. And that it had been so rich, so big and so full of contentment.” The story of Mats’ double life, and of the emotional impact its discovery has had on his parents, is told in a new documentary called The Remarkable Life of Ibelin. It is a moving and often deeply philosophical work that tackles questions around the nature of reality and relationships in an increasingly online world. In some ways it is also incredibly ambitious. How do you show the internal world of a terminally ill young man who has now been dead for ten years? How do you recreate the words and deeds that made such an impact on others but which took place within an old online role-playing game? These were perhaps the two greatest challenges facing the Norwegian director Benjamin Ree. “I’ve spent the past four years trying to find out what kind of person Mats was,” says Ree, who is bearded, cheerful and, as he later discovered, was born within a few days of his subject. “I almost feel like I’ve done a doctorate degree in him, in trying to understand him better.” ADVERTISEMENT In making Ibelin, however, Ree discovered he had a number of unique resources at his disposal. Mats had been a member of a World of Warcraft “guild”, a sort of formal club or fraternity that players can join, often by invitation only. Mats’ guild was called Starlight and had its own online forum on which he was a prolific poster, interacting with other guild members and swapping thousands of messages. The guild also kept a digital log of their members’ every action within the game itself: the transcripted text of every typed conversation their character had, every action and emote they commanded their avatar to carry out — laughing, curtseying, crying, dancing, eating, drinking, hugging — and the timestamped coordinates of every location they visited. “Mats spent almost 20,000 hours in that world. He basically grew up in World of Warcraft,” Ree says. “And what I saw in all the logs and forums and transcriptions was that coming of age inside a game had a lot of similarities to coming of age in the real world.” What makes Ree’s film so affecting is the way in which viewers are able to feel as though we are beside Mats as he goes through this coming-of-age process. Using animation in the style of World of Warcraft graphics, we follow Ibelin as he runs through a fantasy landscape of mountain peaks and deep forests. He sits beside a pond and is approached by a beautiful dark-haired young woman named Rumour, who begins to tease him playfully before snatching his hat and running off into the forest. Mats is 17 at this point and, like all teenage boys, he cannot quite work out that the woman is flirting with him. But he eventually twigs that he is supposed to give chase and the pair strike up a conversation. The young woman is, in fact, controlled by a teenage girl from the Netherlands. She is named Lisette and, like her avatar, she has long dark hair. Over the following weeks and months Ibelin and Rumour, controlled by Mats and Lisette, fall into the kind of intense but romantically ambiguous relationship that will be agonisingly familiar to anyone who has ever been a teenager. At one point, Rumour gives Ibelin a peck on the cheek. “It was just a virtual kiss,” Mats remembers years later on his blog. “But boy, I could almost feel it.” Rumour and Ibelin in World of Warcraft WORLD OF WARCRAFT AND BLIZZARD ENTERTAINMENT © 2024/COURTESY OF NETFLIX Lisette and Mats swap addresses and send each other tokens: mix CDs and, in Lisette’s case, sketches of Rumour and Ibelin embracing. But Mats will not video-chat with her or attend any of the real-life Starlight meet-ups that take place. He does not want her — or anyone else — to know of his condition. In World of Warcraft everyone is physically perfect, so it is a player’s ability to project their personality and charisma that makes them attractive and popular. And Ibelin is attractive and popular. Why risk that by revealing his true nature? “In this other world, a girl wouldn’t see a wheelchair or anything different,” Mats will later reflect. “They would see my soul, heart and mind, conveniently placed in some strong body.” But though Mats’ true identity remains hidden, what’s striking is how much he is able to affect the lives of the people he games with. Lisette’s parents confiscate her computer when her school grades dip, and don’t believe her when she tells them she will be cut off from so many of her friends without it. Isolated and lonely, she falls into a severe depression. “I couldn’t think of reasons to get out of bed,” she says. Mats intervenes. He writes a heartfelt but measured letter to her parents, introducing himself as an online friend of their daughter’s, expressing his admiration for Lisette, explaining how important World of Warcraft is to her and urging them all to work together to find a solution that will allow her some access to her computer. ADVERTISEMENT Lisette’s parents are taken aback. But they reassess and Rumour returns, and she and Ibelin are reunited in the game once more. He helps Lisette unpack and understand her troubles. “Ibelin was a really big support pillar. He was a friend I could be open with about all the things that were going on,” she says. “It’s one of the things that got me out of the depression I was in.” She is not the only person he helps. A man named Kristian plays the game as a blue-haired gnome and is overcome with feelings of worthlessness. Over time he admits all this to Ibelin. “I told him everything,” Kristian says. “I told him how terrible I had felt. Perhaps it doesn’t seem like much, but it meant the world to me.” Trude and Robert Steen and Mats’ sister, Mia COURTESY OF STEEN FAMILY/NETFLIX Having spoken to dozens of the people he knew online, Ree says it’s clear that Mats was a very good listener. “Which might seem a strange thing to say when they didn’t actually talk, because everything was written down,” he says. “But he would remember everything that his friends told him. He would ask them questions about it months later. Even towards the end of his life, when he was as sick as it’s possible to get, you could see how he would prioritise his friends and find the energy to be there for them. It’s quite extraordinary.” Perhaps most moving of all is when Mats learns that one of his Starlight friends is, in real life, mother to an autistic teenage son named Mikkel. He is unable to leave their apartment, she tells him. He is unable to show her any physical affection. She feels like a terrible mother. Mats listens and then suggests that she invite her son into the game itself. The son agrees to this and the three of them begin to spend time together within the game, with Mats gently encouraging Mikkel to take social risks, to introduce himself to other avatars or at least respond when spoken to. Under Mats’ guidance, Mikkel begins to find a measure of confidence. One day, Mikkel gives his mother’s character a virtual hug, a watershed moment for them both. “It was the first time in my life that I could feel love, and started to understand love,” Mikkel says in Ibelin. “The heavens opened up,” his mother says. “This was what I had been waiting for.” Today, Mikkel is able to hug his mother in real life. He is able to leave the house. “I went from the most negative person in the world to a person who could tolerate people,” he says, laughing. The Remarkable Life of Ibelin is not a hagiography, however. In sifting through Mats’ life, Ree also uncovers conflict. If you’ve ever been part of an online community, you will know that rivalries and disagreements fester easily. Empathetic as he was, Mats could also be scathing, sarcastic and temperamental. He finds himself estranged from Lisette, who discovers that Ibelin has been romancing other women within the game. He falls out with the mother of Mikkel, who begins to suspect that he may be suffering from a chronic illness in real life. “We see that Mats gets in a lot of trouble because he keeps it a secret,” Ree says. “The inner demons build up and he gets into a lot of problems because he isn’t honest about his illness.” It is only towards the end of his life, when he finally opens up about his condition to everyone in World of Warcraft and starts writing his blog, that he is able to mend all his bridges. ADVERTISEMENT But the fact that he broke them in the first place makes him all the more relatable, Ree says. “Who hasn’t made mistakes as a young guy? Pissed people off, been a prick, lost friends and then had to get them back again?” He grins. “There were a lot of similarities with me growing up, actually.” Mats aged 17 COURTESY OF STEEN FAMILY/NETFLIX In the days immediately following Mats’ death, Robert and Trude found the volume of information they received from strangers about their son both wondrous and surreal. They had simply not known. “I knew he was caring and kind,” Trude says. “But I never saw the extent to which he helped and supported so many people.” Robert nods. “It’s when I realised that the emotions and relationships we create online can be stronger than we realise.” A delegation from the Starlight guild attend his funeral, including Lisette. During the service, his coffin is draped with their banner, a silver star set against midnight blue. Robert delivers a eulogy for his son in which he speaks of the sorrow he and Trude had felt, believing that his short life had been one void of meaning, friendship, love and belonging. But, he continues, over the past few days they have come to understand that this was not the case, and that he had experienced all these things. “You proved us wrong. You proved us so wrong,” he says from the lectern, before explaining how they had come to learn of Ibelin’s exploits. “Mats was, at times, accused of being a womaniser,” he tells the funeral congregation, tight-throated and smiling. “And I must admit, being a father, I’m a bit proud of that.” Ten years on, Robert and Trude are still discovering things about Mats. This, along with working on the documentary, has helped prevent him from fading in their hearts and minds. “We’ve still not got to the bottom of everything he did,” Robert says. “In a way, he still lives. He’s 35 and we’re still learning about his life. He’s very present. He’s very close to us.” Trude and Robert Steen. “I knew he was kind,” says Trude. “But I never saw how much he helped people” TIM JOBLING FOR THE TIMES MAGAZINE. STYLING: HANNAH SKELLEY.

As someone who's around my 30s now with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and who has friends with the condition, I've always found it a bit too bleak about the quality of our lives (probably for drama's sake). Yes, I need a wheelchair and full time care attendants, but also: * I went to university and had a great time there * I had a pretty normal social life growing up, and made some life-long real life friends in college who I still visit regularly. * I talk to women and have had romantic relationships. * I've had and continue to have what I consider a pretty successful career in software. * While I like video games and played a lot of them in high school, I'd say I prefer going out and having interactions with friends more, however challenging it can be logistically.

I suspect the human brain has a relatively healthy reaction to creatively connecting with other humans via virtual worlds but a comparatively poor reaction to algorithmic feeds. reply Maken 42 minutes agoparentPeople were active participants in MMORPGs. You get the dopamine from achieving goals inside the game, and make connections with other people as you collaborate to reach these goals.

Maybe they did but he wasn't interested in sharing? Was he mute? It's not mentioned but it's very possible given his disease. Even so, they could've gotten something of an understanding of it surely?

Sometimes, escaping from well-meaning but unable to adapt people around you is the only thing you can do to try and achieve some meaning in life. Ironic that they end up calling it a double life, failing to understand that what they provided simply wasn't enough, and also couldn't be enough.

I'm asking this more to wonder out loud whether I'm in need of some introspection than to blame them. reply CM30 43 minutes agoparentBecause most people aren't that aware of their friends and relatives' hobbies and interests, nor the specifics about how they work. So if that person doesn't speak openly about them (and let's face it, most people won't simply because the other person won't find the topic that interesting), then they'll only know the most basic aspects. Like, someone I'm friends with regularly goes to the climbing gym. I vaguely remember being told which gym it was at one point, and I know the sport they partake in, but that's basically it. I don't know if they've got any friends or acquaintances they hang out with each time they go, if they go to events related to it, whether they discuss it online, etc. And the same goes with what most people (friends and parents included) know about me and my own hobbies and interests too. They might know some of the things I'm interested in and some of the people I'm friends with, but it's certainly not all of them. In general, people tend not to know everything (or often, even that much in general) about their friends and loved ones.

WoW was maybe not the first big title but it was the first that really put the genre into the mainstream. A genre inspired by the novelty of virtual worlds. I think to them, their son just played a dumb video game and in the best case they weren’t necessarily supportive but also not against it. Just a weird thing he did that they didn’t understand. How could they possible imagine that he spent his time in that world with people from all around the real world talking about the game and their life alike for hours on end. Being there for those people when life hit them and being able to expect the same in return like what you’d hope friends in the real world would do. To my mother, all people online that talked to me when I was a teenager would be creepy old people trying to groom me. But the people I’ve met in those games are now my best friends.

WoW came out in 2004. What came before in a similar genre? Maybe Diablo II in 2000-2001. And while the Guild Halls were planned for D2 they never actually shipped. There were forums etc but nothing like the scale and possibility of WoW. There were no patterns for this before. reply stego-tech 32 minutes agoparentprevIt’s because, for those of us who exist in these realms - be it WoW, EQ, furries, whatever - we get very, very good at being discrete. There’s that initial excitement when we desperately want to share our joy with our parents or siblings, but all too often that joy is dashed by popular misconceptions, media sensationalism, and flat-out fabrications about “strangers online” and the like. I found solace in online communities as an introvert traumatized by repeated cross-country moves growing up, and when I tried sharing my online friends with my parents, they deleted my social messenger accounts at the time. So that’s why this stuff often pops up as a “surprise” to those left behind, or comes across as a “double-life”. We often tried to open up and share ourselves, but were shut down for the unorthodox ways we found happiness or identity, and realized the best approach was hard segregation of the two. Heck, it’s why I still don’t tie my meatspace and authentic selves together. The meatspace me is this reserved but honest engineer who just wants to make good systems that customers like using and be left alone, but the online dinosaur is…_starkly different_, more open and authentic, exuding more confidence and more empathy as well. We’re unique creatures who adapt to our surroundings, but make no mistake: we always want to share our found happiness with others. Unfortunately, experience often dictates that sharing ourselves so completely is more likely than not to end up causing us great harm, and so we just don’t do it. reply bdjsiqoocwk 24 minutes agorootparentIf my kid ever comes out as a furry I'll have to think - where did I go wrong. reply StefanBatory 20 minutes agorootparentHaha, that's why you will be the last person to know if that ever happens. reply stego-tech 18 minutes agorootparentprevEh, depends on the “shade”.

Fandom - furry or otherwise - isn’t inherently good or bad, but there are good and bad elements in every fandom. reply bdjsiqoocwk 15 minutes agorootparentI think that fandom is mostly bad. It's a form of escapism. A form of numbing the senses to the unpleasant realities of your own life, all the while sapping the will to address them. If someone tells me they're spending their time pretending to be a dog, I'd wonder what's wrong with their head, much like if they'd told me theyre doing heroin. Granted, the consequences of being a furry aren't as bad as those from being addicted to heroin. But I imagine the source to the motivation has to be same ballpark: something's wrong with their lives and they'd rather distract themselves from it. reply stego-tech 3 minutes agorootparentAgain, it often depends on the “shade” or “persona”. The metaphor I choose to use is that these people were given a blank canvas and told to paint how they see themselves, and decided to go in an unorthodox direction. “Furries” might be the present day term, but there’s quite a lot of evidence that humanity has related itself to animals in some form or another for millennia. I’d suggest trying to be more open minded to these subcultures and identify why their participants derive enjoyment from it, rather than judging based on knee-jerk popular perceptions. Fandoms are full of brilliant people doing excellent work and using their positions in those communities to improve the lives of everyone they can - just as there are narcissists, sociopaths, and psychopaths manipulating those fandoms to advance personal agendas. Escapism is just as likely a motivation as a sense of community to join a subculture, and one or the other doesn’t automatically make one bad. And for evidence of that, look no further than comic books, superheroes, and the “geeky” media of yore suddenly becoming big blockbusters and mass media of today. Forty years ago, being a Trekkie or D&D fan was the source of derision, ridicule, and alienation, their players and members oft described as indulging in “escapism” and “abandoning obligations to society” by their opponents. Nowadays, they’re viewed in retrospect as champions of alternative perspectives, grassroots community building, and a revitalization of art. Skepticism is healthy, don’t get me wrong, but we should still strive to be objective in our judgements where possible. lynx23 46 minutes agoparentprev [–] You're pretty much onto the crux of the situation. Lets put it mildly, its a rare case that the parents of a disabled child/person truly understand their needs/desires/wishes/dreams. Its much more common that the barrier that appears between disabled and non-disabled people will persist, and will not get broken down. Most disabled people I know (and I am disabled myself) basically had to run away from home to get some degree of freedom. Its a rather sad thing, which involves a lot of things, mostly the trauma of the parents which they likely never overcome. And the desire of the disabled peerson to gain some independence. Which is usually not compatible with family. reply StefanBatory 18 minutes agorootparentAnd longing for a family that you could have had...

I'm not disabled and neither is anyone in my family. But my relationship with my parents was always bad. I never spent any time thinking about the lives of disabled people because they've always been such an alien reality to me, but I think if you'd asked me think about it I wouldve had the vague intuition that disabled at least had good relationships with their parents because how dependent/how much time they were forced to spend with them.

    "originBody": "Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More Apple’s AI research team has developed a new model that could significantly advance how machines perceive depth, potentially transforming industries ranging from augmented reality to autonomous vehicles. The system, called Depth Pro, is able to generate detailed 3D depth maps from single 2D images in a fraction of a second—without relying on the camera data traditionally needed to make such predictions. The technology, detailed in a research paper titled “Depth Pro: Sharp Monocular Metric Depth in Less Than a Second,” is a major leap forward in the field of monocular depth estimation, a process that uses just one image to infer depth. This could have far-reaching applications across sectors where real-time spatial awareness is key. The model’s creators, led by Aleksei Bochkovskii and Vladlen Koltun, describe Depth Pro as one of the fastest and most accurate systems of its kind. A comparison of depth maps from Apple’s Depth Pro, Marigold, Depth Anything v2, and Metric3D v2. Depth Pro excels in capturing fine details like fur and birdcage wires, producing sharp, high-resolution depth maps in just 0.3 seconds, outperforming other models in accuracy and detail. (credit: arxiv.org) Speed and precision, without the metadata Monocular depth estimation has long been a challenging task, requiring either multiple images or metadata like focal lengths to accurately gauge depth. But Depth Pro bypasses these requirements, producing high-resolution depth maps in just 0.3 seconds on a standard GPU. The model can create 2.25-megapixel maps with exceptional sharpness, capturing even minute details like hair and vegetation that are often overlooked by other methods. “These characteristics are enabled by a number of technical contributions, including an efficient multi-scale vision transformer for dense prediction,” the researchers explain in their paper. This architecture allows the model to process both the overall context of an image and its finer details simultaneously—an enormous leap from slower, less precise models that came before it. A comparison of depth maps from Apple’s Depth Pro, Depth Anything v2, Marigold, and Metric3D v2. Depth Pro excels in capturing fine details like the deer’s fur, windmill blades, and zebra’s stripes, delivering sharp, high-resolution depth maps in 0.3 seconds. (credit: arxiv.org) Metric depth, zero-shot learning What truly sets Depth Pro apart is its ability to estimate both relative and absolute depth, a capability called “metric depth.” This means that the model can provide real-world measurements, which is essential for applications like augmented reality (AR), where virtual objects need to be placed in precise locations within physical spaces. And Depth Pro doesn’t require extensive training on domain-specific datasets to make accurate predictions—a feature known as “zero-shot learning.” This makes the model highly versatile. It can be applied to a wide range of images, without the need for the camera-specific data usually required in depth estimation models. “Depth Pro produces metric depth maps with absolute scale on arbitrary images ‘in the wild’ without requiring metadata such as camera intrinsics,” the authors explain. This flexibility opens up a world of possibilities, from enhancing AR experiences to improving autonomous vehicles’ ability to detect and navigate obstacles. For those curious to experience Depth Pro firsthand, a live demo is available on the Hugging Face platform. A comparison of depth estimation models across multiple datasets. Apple’s Depth Pro ranks highest overall with an average rank of 2.5, outperforming models like Depth Anything v2 and Metric3D in accuracy across diverse scenarios. (credit: arxiv.org) Real-world applications: From e-commerce to autonomous vehicles This versatility has significant implications for various industries. In e-commerce, for example, Depth Pro could allow consumers to see how furniture fits in their home by simply pointing their phone’s camera at the room. In the automotive industry, the ability to generate real-time, high-resolution depth maps from a single camera could improve how self-driving cars perceive their environment, boosting navigation and safety. “The method should ideally produce metric depth maps in this zero-shot regime to accurately reproduce object shapes, scene layouts, and absolute scales,” the researchers write, emphasizing the model’s potential to reduce the time and cost associated with training more conventional AI models. Tackling the challenges of depth estimation One of the toughest challenges in depth estimation is handling what are known as “flying pixels”—pixels that appear to float in mid-air due to errors in depth mapping. Depth Pro tackles this issue head-on, making it particularly effective for applications like 3D reconstruction and virtual environments, where accuracy is paramount. Additionally, Depth Pro excels in boundary tracing, outperforming previous models in sharply delineating objects and their edges. The researchers claim it surpasses other systems “by a multiplicative factor in boundary accuracy,” which is key for applications that require precise object segmentation, such as image matting and medical imaging. Open-source and ready to scale In a move that could accelerate its adoption, Apple has made Depth Pro open-source. The code, along with pre-trained model weights, is available on GitHub, allowing developers and researchers to experiment with and further refine the technology. The repository includes everything from the model’s architecture to pretrained checkpoints, making it easy for others to build on Apple’s work. The research team is also encouraging further exploration of Depth Pro’s potential in fields like robotics, manufacturing, and healthcare. “We release code and weights at https://github.com/apple/ml-depth-pro,” the authors write, signaling this as just the beginning for the model. What’s next for AI depth perception As artificial intelligence continues to push the boundaries of what’s possible, Depth Pro sets a new standard in speed and accuracy for monocular depth estimation. Its ability to generate high-quality, real-time depth maps from a single image could have wide-ranging effects across industries that rely on spatial awareness. In a world where AI is increasingly central to decision-making and product development, Depth Pro exemplifies how cutting-edge research can translate into practical, real-world solutions. Whether it’s improving how machines perceive their surroundings or enhancing consumer experiences, the potential uses for Depth Pro are broad and varied. As the researchers conclude, “Depth Pro dramatically outperforms all prior work in sharp delineation of object boundaries, including fine structures such as hair, fur, and vegetation.” With its open-source release, Depth Pro could soon become integral to industries ranging from autonomous driving to augmented reality—transforming how machines and people interact with 3D environments.

Traditionally, legal actions have been time consuming, expensive, and distracting. Generative AI makes it easier — and cheaper — for customers, employees, competitors, and regulators to take legal action, at the same time that a turbulent geopolitical environment increases legal exposure. Future legal risks will be legal fishing expeditions akin to internet “phishing” attacks: less personal, mass-produced actions initiated by many actors. When coordinated, they’ll be much more like distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, which involves overwhelming a target with a flood of traffic to knock it offline. To prepare for this new reality companies need to take a page out of cybersecurity readiness. Specifically, they’ll need to quickly take action to better understand their vulnerabilities, emerging threats and their potential impact, the risk-mitigation actions they want to take, and their communication strategies to internal and external stakeholders.

A combination of 1 and 2 sound like a great outcome. reply hedora 1 hour agoparentI’ve been unlucky enough to have good reason to sue a few times in the last few years. The courts are essentially inaccessible to 99% of the population. You can go to small claims court where the limit for damages is $12,500 in California (less than a half year’s rent around here), or you can hire a lawyer and pay $50-100K minimum before the trial even starts (on both sides). The upshot is that I’m out around $100K (spread across a few different incidents) with absolutely no legal recourse. Anyway, more access to the courts (and faster/more painful rejection of nuisance suits) would go a long way to fixing our legal system. It would also be good if private individuals could directly press criminal charges. reply bloopernova 1 hour agorootparent> It would also be good if private individuals could directly press criminal charges. That seems at first glance like a bad idea. Can you explain your thinking as to how and why it might work? reply objclxt 54 minutes agorootparent> Can you explain your thinking as to how and why it might work? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_prosecution ...has a good summary of how it works in a number of countries. reply dartos 2 hours agoparentprev> everything under the sun was actionable Not everything (in the US at least) is actionable, but you still need someone to review each suit and determine whether or not to throw it out. reply campbel 2 hours agorootparentseems reasonable to add an initial cost burden to the filer then, to pay for the review, especially if they are filing a lot of suits. Say first 10 suits per year are free, but then you need to get on the premium plan :D reply SoftTalker 2 hours agorootparentNo that just tips the playing field back in favor of the larger players who can afford the fees. reply ronsor 1 hour agorootparentprevYou already have to pay fees to file a lawsuit. reply SoftTalker 2 hours agorootparentprevAI can do that too. reply intended 2 hours agoparentprevWhy?

If you go to McDonalds and drop a glass pf coke, can auto-Ronald sue you to get back the cost of the cleaning? reply throwup238 2 hours agorootparentJust keep small claims like that in small claims court. Then auto-Ronald has to send $500/hr general counsel instead of farming it out to a law firm and that makes it impractical for them to sue little people. reply tzs 1 hour agorootparent1. Only a handful of states prohibit hiring representation for small claims court. 2. McDonalds could make it so to get inside you have to agree to arbitration of any disputes. That's usually just used by companies to make you use arbitration instead of the courts when you have a complaint, but offhand I can't think of any reason they couldn't require arbitration in the other direction. reply vouaobrasil 3 hours agoprev> They use an AI tool to comb public information about your company and file hundreds of copyright infringement, IP, and trade secret theft cases. The scale means you can’t just ignore it or settle for a nominal amount. The \"scale\" itself is the problem. Because companies are so huge, and their reach is so huge, it invites techniques that increase the efficiency of attacks. Human beings weren't meant to handle things at such scales, and that is part of the reason we have the problem of AI in the first place. If we lived in smaller, more self-sufficient communities, then we would not have scale and the people in such communities would not have much desire to develop AI either. AI is the natural reaction of a large populace who look for a technological solution to the immense chaos of information. reply Aurornis 2 hours agoparentThis is an unnecessarily complicated rationalization. The only reason large companies attract these attacks is because large companies have large bank accounts. That’s it. That’s the reason. There’s no need to theorize about small communities or humans developing AI in reaction to something. Scammers see a tool, an opportunity for exploitation, and a target with something they want (money). They leverage the tool to try to extract what they want from the most likely target. That’s what’s happening here. There isn’t some deeper philosophical explanation. Scammers just want money and they’ll use any tool they can in order to get it. reply bee_rider 1 hour agorootparentIt is interesting to reflect on the possible social outcomes of something, even if those outcomes weren’t the goal or motivation of individual actors. Making giant companies wasn’t the goal of society or anything, after all. Maybe the changing ground truth will produce new outcomes. reply elliotec 1 hour agorootparentprevThey have large bank accounts because of their scale.

Yes, because they’d be too busy worrying about food and disease to bother with much else.

It strikes me as a cat and mouse game. Not that I think either side will make things better for the rest of us. reply visarga 2 hours agoparentprev> If we lived in smaller, more self-sufficient communities, then we would not have scale and the people in such communities would not have much desire to develop AI either. You could say AI is the child of internet, as it was the internet that cooked up the massive trillion token datasets. Without internet, no AI. But if you look closely, internet resembles AI - you can search for images instead of generating, there are billions you can choose from. You can search for information and you can chat on social networks instead of using a LLM. It's the same with AI but even better, human made. An HGI made of humans and networks. reply kortilla 1 hour agoparentprevThis attack works on a single person or a small business that produces a lot of public works. Any prolific author or artist is exposed to this. Any marketer, etc. Your thesis doesn’t make sense about there being no desire for AI in small communities. Small communities absolutely want automation, both in the physical and information world. reply barrkel 2 hours agoparentprevSelf-sufficiency is poverty. reply HomeDeLaPot 1 hour agoparentprevI mean, sure, if we still lived as small groups of hunter-gatherers, many of today's problems would not exist. But many of yesterday's problems could never have been solved. reply pylua 2 hours agoprevThis is actually insane. 120,000 comments! To a certain extent if our law is already so complicated that you need to hire a lawyer to understand it that is already a fundamental problem. Simplify the rules, make it easier to understand and reason about. The computers should be able to determine if someone is breaking a law, not trying to check if it is a bad law. We should be using computing power where someone can ask: is this legal ? Can I do this? That’s the true value to society. reply wongarsu 2 hours agoparentThis kind of comes back to the common law vs civil law system. Most English-speaking countries operate under a common law system where the laws as written down provide the ground work, but precedent set by previous court cases is also legally binding. In contrast most of Europe and South America operates under a civil law system (yes, terrible name, not the opposite of criminal law) where the written law reigns supreme and previous court decisions are merely informing opinions. As you can imagine, algorithmic decisions are incredibly difficult in any common law system. And while they might be viable in a civil law system, you would lose out on the ability of a judge to give consideration to the specific circumstances of each case. In practise both systems end up unwieldy in an attempt to be fair. Common law systems because of the overwhelming amount of precedent to consider, civil law systems because the laws become incredibly long and complex, with complex interactions between laws reply tzs 58 minutes agorootparentHow do they achieve consistency in civil laws systems? In the US if say a district court in California and a district court in Oregon adopt incompatible interpretations of a federal law, someone will appeal to the appeals court that covers both California and Oregon, that court will interpret that law and then that is binding in all that states under that appeals court (Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington). If some other appeals court in some other region goes a different way, it can go to the Supreme Court which makes an interpretation for the whole country. We eventually reach consistency even if Congress is unwilling or unable to revisit the law. reply pylua 1 hour agorootparentprevIt seems like the best use of ai / computing power would be to do common law through llm? I understand it’s nuanced and complicated but that seems like a good use case for our current ai systems ? What am I missing ? reply kortilla 1 hour agorootparentCourt isn’t about understanding if action X violates law Y. Analyzing that part is quick in preliminary work. All of the hard work is proving that the defendant performed X, proving they had intent and it wasn’t an accident, etc. reply romanovcode 2 hours agoparentprevMost laws have a lot of neuances and edge-cases. That's why the words and language is so important. The more edge-cases are discovered the more complicated the text becomes. I don't think you can easily simplify it tbh. reply jncfhnb 2 hours agorootparentThat’s not really true though. While legalese creates complexity a substantial part of judicial rulings is figuring out which of it should be ignored because it’s bullshit. A lot of law is driven by arguments of how things ought to be given a loose framework of law and precedent. reply gamblor956 51 minutes agoparentprevSimplify the rules, make it easier to understand and reason about This happens every few decades...A legislature wipes the slate clean and starts fresh with a new, simpler set of laws. Then spend the next few years discovering why the old set of laws was so complicated, as they gradually reintroduce laws to deal with the edge cases, loopholes, etc. that the new laws created. And then you end up with a complicated set of laws again. The people who get hurt when you \"simplify\" the legal code aren't the corporations; they have the money to get good legal advice, nor the criminals since they don't particularly care about following the law in the first place. It's the common people who get hurt when the law is simplified, because most people are fundamentally law-abiding, and the law is complicated to deal with all the people who are not. reply mrangle 3 hours agoprevI don't know a lot, but I do know that the legal profession will change itself as required to protect itself. Which includes protecting itself from being completely intolerable to the wider populace. This is a law of the Universe on par with the \"death and taxes\" adage. What this may look like is measures that will make legal action, and even public action on par with \"comments\", far less accessible. At least to robots. Though, I can't predict how that will look in terms of detail. reply qup 3 hours agoparentThis looks like more work/income for the legal profession, not less work. The whole article is about how with minimal effort you can cost companies and individuals beaucoup bucks in legal expenses. reply mrangle 3 hours agorootparentYour two statements logically conflict. I understand the article. Your first line is not what it says. See the \"Legal Cost Collapse\" subhead. In addition, logically LLM's will increasingly allow individuals to free themselves from the need for attorneys. And again, see the Cyber Risk subhead for issues implying an intolerable state of affairs for the wider public. In that light as well as other context, your second line will be a major part of the subtext for why the legal environment adapts away from LLM access. reply Kon-Peki 2 hours agorootparent> logically LLM's will increasingly allow individuals to free themselves from the need for attorneys. No. Not a chance. If you sue me with LLM-generated filings, I’m going to be paying a lawyer to mercilessly win, using LLMs as needed (perhaps using LLMs to test various responses to your filings that cause your LLM to spit out something that is terrible for you but you’d have no idea since you aren’t using a lawyer). reply newyankee 3 hours agoparentprevYou should sometimes review the Indian judicial system and their judgements.

Generative AI won't be able to handle the law. That will require actual AI (meaning, a system that is capable of understanding, not just one that predicts which word should follow another as Gen AI does now). reply visarga 2 hours agoprevI often read comments where people doubt there will be much work left after AGI. I think on the contrary, it will keep us busy, even busier than before. The moment the road widens, more cars fill it up to the brim. Will lawyers lose their jobs? Looks like the opposite trend is happening. With each capability unlocked, we got more work not less. Remember that reminder about the fate of horses after the automobile was invented? How about the fate the transportation jobs? In 1910, approximately 13% of the workforce (about 6.7 million people) were involved in transportation-related employment. By 2023, this percentage decreased to 10.3%, but the absolute number grew to around 21.3 million people due to population growth. reply animal_spirits 1 hour agoparentI share this view too, especially about law. There is going to be a huge increase in demand for white collar work, but the problem we will face is that the skills required to supply this demand will go up, and there further will be demand for technology to lower the skill barrier to do the jobs. I think the paper to CAD transition is a perfect example. We started with more demand for computer skills to increase manufacturing efficiency, and now there is increasingly cheaper and better software to lower the barrier to learning CAD I envision a similar transition for law and justice. reply carapace 31 minutes agoparentprev> The moment the road widens, more cars fill it up to the brim.

We were having an easy divorce, and so we used Nolo press to get it done. But it was difficult to know what forms actually had to be filed in our case. So we went to the clerk, and said, out of all these forms, which ones do we have to file? And the clerk said that they couldn't tell us because that would be offering legal advice. The lawyers had gotten laws passed preventing the clerk from telling us what forms we needed to give the clerk. Nice. After a couple of minutes of thought, we decided to just fill them all out. So we filled out everything and handed it to the clerk. The clerk then proceeded to cherry pick the forms they needed, and handed the rest back to us. (\"My sole regret is that I have but one face to palm for my country.\") I think in the last 25 years, it's probably only gotten a lot worse. reply busyant 2 hours agorootparentAnother (non-divorce) story. * My wife and I own several rental properties. * The properties are in an LLC that we formed. * I went to local housing court to file papers for an eviction (non-payment of rent). * I hand the paperwork to the clerk and the clerk says, \"I need your ID to determine that you actually own the property ...\" * Me: \"Actually, my name won't be listed. It'll be listed under the name of our LLC.\" * Clerk: \"Then you can't file the eviction yourself. You have to be represented by a lawyer.\" * Me: \"???? Can't I just prove that I'm an officer of the LLC?\" * Clerk: \"No. If it's not directly owned by you, you need a lawyer to proceed with the eviction.\" * Me: \"But I can represent the LLC in every other capacity that I can think of. You're telling me that I can't do this on my own?\" * Clerk: \"I don't make the rules ...\" $1500 later, I have to keep my lawyer on task to file the paperwork.reply gamblor956 41 minutes agorootparentprevThe law does not actually prohibit the clerk from telling you what forms you need to give him to finalize an uncontested divorce in any state in this country.

So some years ago when Turkey wasn't as totalitarian as today but was on the way to become such, they started having a problems with the European Court of Human Rights. The cases begin to pile up. EU proposed: Create a way for people to access the Constitutional court of Turkey, so you might resolve most of the issues before coming to us as. Turkey's proposal: Why don't you introduce a considerable application fee, so the number of cases can drop dramatically because only a few can afford it? So yeah, that was the Turkish style. The EU way prevailed but this time Turkey dropped its bid to join EU and it simply started ignoring it's own Constitutional Court decisions.

A layperson can file their own lawsuit, and as long as they satisfy the requirements of the law outlining the necessary elements of the lawsuit, they don't need any jargon or special language.

    "originLink": "https://github.com/Losses/rune",
    "originBody": "Rune The player that blends classic design with modern technology. demo.mp4 Introduction Rune Player is a music player that offers audio analysis and recommendation features. It introduces a new, modern music management paradigm to enhance your experience. Motivation Rune is a UX experiment inspired by the question: What if Zune1 had continued to evolve? Using a modern tech stack (Flutter + Rust), Rune captures the essence of Zune, drawing from the design highlights of various Windows products since the Windows XP era, including Windows Mobile and Windows Media Center1. The motivation behind Rune is to provide a modernized audio listening and management experience. With the rise of streaming services, localized music players have become less common, and many well-known media players have stagnated. Rune aims to offer a clean, consistent, and efficient audio playback experience. Unique Features Distinctive Design: Rune boasts a unique design style. Audio Analysis and Recommendations: Users can analyze their entire music library to receive recommendations based on tracks, albums, or playlists. Dynamic \"Mix\" Feature: Users can create dynamic playlists based on customizable rules, such as: \"Similar to this album\" \"Top 100 most played tracks\" \"Tracks similar to my favorites\" \"Playlists including specific artists\" These mixes automatically update as users listen to and add new tracks. Installation and Running Rune is still in the early stages of development and does not provide pre-compiled binaries. However, you can set up a development environment by following the compiling instructions. Contributing We're thrilled you're interested in contributing. Before you dive in, please take a moment to review these key points to ensure smooth collaboration. For detailed instructions, please refer to the full Contributing Guide. Language Requirement: To facilitate clear communication across all developers, all contributions, including issues and pull requests, must be submitted in English. If you are not confident in your English proficiency, consider using a language model for assistance. Feature Requests: As Rune is in the early stages of development, we are currently not accepting feature requests. Feature Implementation: If you have a feature proposal, please reach out to the development team for a preliminary discussion to ensure it aligns with Rune's vision. Documentation: Collaboration is conducted exclusively in English. While we do not accept pull requests for translating the README or other development documentation, contributions for translating Rune itself are welcome. Acknowledgments We extend our gratitude to the open-source project Meyda for enabling the audio analysis functionality. We also thank the countless developers in the Rust and Flutter ecosystems for making Rune possible. License This project is licensed under the MPL License.

It presents your music library in a way that to me is aesthetically pleasing and entirely intuitive. The three column layout, with sorting options for each, is ideal. Filtering does not dump you into a new page. It's hard to describe what makes it so pleasant to use, but no application I've found yet comes close.

WTF Microsoft, why are you regressing on all fronts?! Zune never took off because it came too late and was going against a market already dominated by the iPod, and Metro was hated since Microsoft shoved it down the throats of desktop users with Windows 8, even though it was wonderful to use on tablets, except Windows tablets of the time sucked major ballsack since they were powered by anemic Intel Atom CPUs trying to run a full desktop OS compared to the ARM iPads running a mobile OS. reply lovethevoid 4 hours agorootparentMicrosoft’s decisions on windows will always be very funny.

When all the news and talks are about this iPod killer from Microsoft and then Apple themselves release a truly groundbreaking iPod killer themselves, you look foolish. Zune really got done in by marketing. reply Rinzler89 4 hours agorootparentDefinitely. But even if the iPhone were to be delayed there's no way Zune would have made a significant dent in iPod's market. It was already the established player and the user base was already locked in with hundreds of $ in iTunes purchases. The usets weren't gonna throw that away no matter how much better Zune would have been. iPod's market dominance wasn't in some UX magic that couldn't be replicated or braten by competitors, it was in the iTunes purchases that made it comfy to own specific songs and also locked users in. reply qingcharles 3 hours agorootparentI was sometimes involved in this project at MS. The music buying experience for Zune was awful, and I regret missed opportunities to be more forceful about telling the Windows Media execs that they were fucking up. Part of the problem was MS insistence on being fair to everyone and having an open system which led to 5000 shitty online stores where you could buy music. Instead of Apple that had exactly one where they owned and controlled the entire vertical. This was the whole reason for creating Zune. Again, MS had licensed out their awful Windows Media products to 100 Chinese digital music player makers and got a fragmented market of trash, so MS jumped in to try and do it the right way themselves, but sadly too late. I think the flat Metro UI evolved out of all the work we did coming out of the Windows Media division. I based all the flat design work I was doing for MS on British Sky TV's set top box graphics, simply because they were easiest for my developer brain to code and they also worked really well: https://youtu.be/-26xPkRXtsU reply philistine 2 hours agorootparentWhat you’re describing is enlightening, thank you for sharing.

I really like WinUI 3 reply hammyhavoc 1 hour agorootparentprevZune never took off just like HoloLens, Band, Kinect and Windows Phone didn't take off—not because they were in any way late, but because Microsoft is never \"all-in\" with any of these ventures. The Xbox was somewhat of an anomaly owing to exclusives like Halo and Gears of War, but it's floundering, and in some countries, like Japan, it's just never taken off, period. Apple Vision doesn't seem to be a sensation in terms of sales figures, despite the HoloLens beating Apple to the punch, and the stereotypical nonsense being \"Apple is always late, but they always do it right\". HoloLens just got killed along with Windows Mixed Reality. Hell, even the Microsoft Band beat the Apple Watch to market. The problem is that merely having a presence in a niche doesn't guarantee success as it once did. Now, you need to actually iterate, innovate, and satisfy the minimum expected threshold of solving real problems. This is also what Tim Cook's Apple struggles with these days. What's the killer app for Apple Vision? What was it for HoloLens? When digital technology was new and exciting, having anything would draw buyers. Now, we're spoiled for choice, things move fast, it isn't years between models, it's months to a year.

But I was also given free reign on the UI, which I borrowed very heavily from the Zune's UI.

Amarok had some simple variant of this. Spotify of course has as well, but not really for local music. That was the main reason I started my own music player project (https://github.com/albertz/music-player). But it never really got to the point to have a more advanced variant of this features. The best it could do is randomly play through directories, but at least prefer liked songs. I implemented the core playing engine in C++ and the remaining logic in Python, as I thought that would give me most flexibility. Unfortunately I haven't found the time to work on it since a while. reply losses 6 hours agoparentHi, I'm the developer of Rune. Honestly, I was a bit surprised to see my software mentioned on HN at this time. I had planned to introduce it once it had fewer bugs, improved performance, and cleaner source code. Nevertheless, Rune might offer the features you're looking for. It not only provides recommendations based on individual tracks but also on criteria like \"songs you've liked,\" \"all music from a specific directory,\" or \"all tracks from a particular album.\" Additionally, it can categorize recommended tracks into nine sub-lists based on acoustic features, helping you find the perfect arrangement. Thanks to its separation of front-end and back-end, Rune can be used independently of a GUI. You can also use Rune's CLI to create M3U playlists. While these features haven't been fully refined due to my limited resources, I believe Rune has the potential to meet your expectations in the future. Here are the document of the query syntax: https://github.com/Losses/rune/blob/master/documents/mix_que... I hope that once Rune reaches a production-ready state, you'll remember it.

That's interesting. I'm wondering if Rust is needed for this application, couldn't everything technically done in Dart here? Also I'd like to know more about the interop between Dart/Rust and what the experience is like! reply losses 8 hours agoparentHi, I'm the developer of Rune. In this project, Dart is primarily used for the GUI, while Rust handles all data-related operations. As you mentioned, Dart's performance and ecosystem are sufficient for most tasks in a typical music player. However, Rune includes some complex features that challenge Dart's ecosystem and performance, such as media recommendation. Rune has a built-in media analysis and recommendation system. It extracts dozens of acoustic features from audio, creating a high-dimensional space. Searching for nearby points in this space helps listeners find similar tracks, offering features akin to those on streaming platforms. While creating a traditional audio player is an option, I wanted to explore something new. That's why I chose Rust for its performance and ecosystem advantages. Regarding the inter-operation between Dart and Rust, I used a library called `rinf`.

Take number 7: 7. Advocate \"caution.\" Be \"reasonable\" and urge your fellow-conferees to be \"reason-able\" and avoid haste which might result in embarrassments or difficulties later on. I'm just imagining a would-be saboteur convincing civil rights activists to be cautious about a bus boycott, and those activists doing just that and waiting until Rosa Parks got arrested to organize the boycott. I bet that poor operative got a real talking-to back at Langley! But yeah, in the context of Cold War escalation of tensions number 7 makes a whole lot of sense. reply tptacek 20 hours agoprevI think at this point it's becoming (analytically) problematic to take \"founder mode\" at face value, and I'd be careful running with it too far. I gather that the talk† was an empirical case study, and the PG post was a first extrapolation from the talk, something in the actual spirit of an \"essay\" (\"this is interesting, let's start writing and see where it takes from us\") and people who were actually at the talk are bristling at the idea of that post being taken as received wisdom. When you're at the point of literally situating \"founder mode\" as the opposite of the CIA's strategy for disrupting activist groups, you're probably a step past even \"received wisdom\". There's an obvious failure mode for 3rd-hand analyses like these: for years hapless dingbat founders tried to cargo cult Jobs and Gates success by just deliberately being assholes. This isn't quite that, but you can see where the wind is blowing. † The Graham post that kicked off \"founder mode\" was in part a report on a recent private talk about things Brian Chesky had done to improve AirBNB's performance. reply dasil003 16 hours agoparentYou're onto something here talking about cargo culting and received wisdom. Ideas like founder mode spread because it fits a pattern a lot of people see. That's how an idea gains traction. But once an idea gains traction, especially one that comes from a successful founder, it will inevitably be adopted by the multitudes seeking success—some significant portion of which will lack the maturity and judgment to understand where the idea might not apply. There's a reason that founder mode is a contrast to the way Airbnb worked in the recent past, despite continuity of the founding team over that timespan. Context is everything, even for the best ideas. reply monero-xmr 16 hours agoparentprevI think the counter-point to much commentary about business is that there are a huge number of extremely private companies that simply avoid analysis. Fidelity, Trader Joes, and Koch Industries to name an example in Finance, Retail, and Energy respectively. I own an extremely profitable small business and no one can understand it. It's really just... not like what anything says. My children can take it over, or not, and it doesn't even matter, because I built it and the business will never be a public company and they will get everything when my wife and I die. And it will exist in perpetuity because of reasons, mostly because of the government being the government. So much advice here is obtuse.

It can sometimes result in a pleasant cross between evergreen internet quotes “don’t put in the paper that I was mad” and “in this moment I am euphoric… because I am enlightened by my own intelligence” reply janalsncm 20 hours agoprevThe document the author is referencing is a CIA sabotage manual. It’s not a prescription for how to run a bureaucracy any more than their section on sabotaging electrical cables is intended as a prescription for electricians. I think many Americans believe that because the American government is slow, unresponsive and generally painful that all governments must be this way. As a counterexample I would like to suggest Singapore, which has an online visa process (traveler visa) which was a breeze to follow and was approved in under 2 days. Compare that to the US legal immigration system (USCIS) which if you ever have the misfortune of dealing with, is a nightmare to navigate. The government needs a UX department to streamline all of the painful processes it has.

Sometimes the pain is a feature. reply janalsncm 20 hours agorootparentIn some systems of government, yes. The Soviet Union had so many laws that at any point in time everyone was likely a criminal. But I believe in a democracy, a reasonable person should know when they’re breaking the law, or when they’re suspected of doing so. reply derefr 20 hours agoparentprevThe article's implicit conceit is that a bureaucracy is just an attempt to abstract away what is in actuality a bunch of distinct self-interested obstructionist fiefdoms — that each do all they can to prevent the organization from 1. doing anything that would pose an existential threat to the fiefdom, 2. starting any project that would be the fiefdom's ultimate responsibility to deliver upon, 3. reorganizing in a way that would cause the the fiefdom's \"slack\", or continued underperformance (compared to the organization's usually-unrealistic expectations) to be made more legible, 4. doing anything to equalize and redistribute any special advantages that come with the fiefdom's existing responsibilities, ...and so forth. The CIA sabotage manual applies perfectly to the usual sort of bureaucratic organization full of such fiefdoms, as such fiefdoms use exactly these techniques to prevent the projects that would threaten them from moving forward (at anything beyond a glacial pace.) reply janalsncm 19 hours agorootparentI guess what I’m saying is that the author is conflating bureaucracy with the broken system suggested in a sabotage manual, and that bureaucracy doesn’t have to be that way. In fact, we need agile and efficient bureaucracies. “Founder mode” isn’t scalable, sorry. Figuring out how to organize large groups of people into efficient, stable, and effective organizations is still a massively underdeveloped technology in my opinion. > There's going to have to be some amount of delegation. Where the borders of autonomy end up, and how sharp they are, will probably vary from company to company. PG’s post ended before it got interesting. Maybe by design, because if it was any more specific (read: useful) it would be falsifiable. As it stands now, “founder mode” is so open to interpretation that anyone who says it doesn’t work probably just wasn’t doing it right. reply AnthonyMouse 17 hours agorootparent> In fact, we need agile and efficient bureaucracies. The best way we know of doing this is to put them in competition with one another and make sure there are at least a dozen. Keep barriers to entry low enough that if the incumbents suck, someone new can eat their lunch. The bureaucracies, of course, want the opposite. A monopoly that allows them to dictate terms and extract rents, or failing that at least a concentrated cartel that can coordinate behind closed doors or through conscious parallelism. Inhibiting that is the way to achieve the desired result. The bureaucracies can't do it internally because a bureaucracy without external competitive pressure has no internal incentive to improve efficiency to counter the intrinsic incentive for bureaucrats to capture and redirect surplus to protect and accumulate power. reply fallingknife 15 hours agorootparentprev> Figuring out how to organize large groups of people into efficient, stable, and effective organizations is still a massively underdeveloped technology in my opinion I mostly agree with this, but there are a lot of failure modes that are known and should be avoided. e.g. running an incentive structure where success is not rewarded and failure is not punished. This broken structure seems to be the default in bureaucracy. Government bureaucrats won't see a cent if they find a more efficient way to do things. In fact, they will be punished with lower budgets. reply lend000 16 hours agoparentprevGenerally all the governments that are considered excellent and easy to work with are smaller governments with small populations. Modern government ideas just don't seem to scale up well, which would seem to support the idea of keeping a government no bigger than it needs to be. reply Swizec 19 hours agoparentprev> Singapore, which has an online visa process (traveler visa) which was a breeze to follow and was approved in under 2 days.

The fastest I got it was 30min at an Italian airport a few years ago when they blocked me from boarding because my old one expired and I didn’t notice. Still made it onto the same flight. reply yen223 16 hours agorootparentThe difference between applying for a US visitor's visa as a citizen of a non-ESTA country and as a citizen from an ESTA country, is night and day. If you aren't ESTA, you need to pay lots of money and undergo an in-person interview at a US embassy. This can take months to arrange, as embassy slots are scarce, plus you need to make travel arrangements to be in a city with a US embassy.

When companies are founded, there must be people involved who can execute a large chunk of the value chain single handily (if not the entire thing). Like a restauranteer who can buy ingredients, cook them, put together an interesting menu, engage in entertaining chit-chat, knows how to advertise and is good with finances. In a large company though accountability matters a lot more and comparative advantage becomes a factor. It is also hard to hire great generalists (50% chance someone has a specific skill, that combination above is already approaching 1:100, let alone being good at something). So you specialise - there is a procurement specialist, a chef, a menu designer, a hostess, etc, etc. Shortly after that transition there are still old hands around in leadership positions who know the entire value chain, but they slowly leave the business. Eventually there is a group of subject matter experts who execute the known chain really efficiently but no longer have personal or even institutional knowledge of how to set up a valuable new process because they specialise (theory of comparative advantage style logic kicks in). At this point, the dictatorial centralised nature of the company becomes a problem. If change is required, it depends on a tiny pool of leaders who are personally unclear on how the thing they control works at the micro level because they don't have the skillset required to set up new businesses. The only safe option is to iterate on the existing process, the company simply isn't capable of radical change any more. Or if it is, success will be more of a fluke than a predictable thing. reply delichon 20 hours agoprevA demon that's attracted to people in bureaucrat mode and repelled by people in get-it-done mode (or visa versa) would be worth trillions of dollars per year to the economy and the most hated technology since the bomb. reply Onavo 20 hours agoparentI think that's called a \"founder\" practicing \"move fast and break things\". reply shermantanktop 20 hours agorootparentPeople like that are rendered impotent and ejected quickly from any organization that they don’t have last-word control over.

Bureaucracy is tool to manage large, complex, and heterogeneous systems. Ideally, efficient and effective bureaucracy goes unnoticed. Why can I plug my laptop into the power outlet anywhere in Miami or in Vancouver and it just works? Why can I drive on the right side of the road from Toronto to San Diego and be reasonably sure that everyone else will drive on the right side as well? Because humans have self-organized into a multitude of governments, standards organizations, and corporations that all align to produce the same shape of power plug and teach compatible rules-of-the-road across vast geographical distances and unrelated communities. Without bureaucracy, we humans would not be capable of building a global society. Pointing to broken, ineffective, and inefficient processes to scapegoat “the bureaucrat” reveals an ignorance of the underlying mechanisms that make human society function. EDIT: To those of you downvoting this comment, please let me elaborate. I am tired of the trope of the lazy bureaucrat because I refuse to believe that inefficient government and corporations are inevitable. I do believe that we must strive for efficient and effective government to improve our society because the potential benefits are immense.

I would much rather have corporations and the countless third party companies/hardware/services they depend on all patching and hardening their stuff for fear of pesky children cheating in video games than let all those corporations become complacent. As it stands today corporations do only the bare minimum when it comes to security as repeatedly evidenced by the endless leaks and data breaches which rarely involve complex vulnerability chain attacks full of zero days and most often could have easily been avoided by protecting against threats that are very well known and for which solutions already exist.

I think you're focusing on the children part and ignoring the point. Plus you're not \"utilizing children\" in the way you would with child labor. This is more \"children are doing things, could we utilize this natural behavior to improve our society?\" That's no exploitive of children unless you pressure them into hacking. It's also reasonable that we consider children are less likely to be severely punished because kids are, in fact, pretty dumb (which does not mean they also aren't pretty smart. Context matters ;) Anyways, that's all besides the point of OP's question: Can we see hackers as a valuable tool for society? Since they put pressure on corporations to improve their security. Whereas when nation state hackers do similar things it is all kept quiet and so the knowledge of what needs to be fixed is less wide spread. I think yes. As an analogy I think hackers in this way can be seen like a virus and the human immune system. Low exposures and in healthy systems allows the body to develop antibodies and fight off bigger attacks and/or when the body is weaker. But too much and the host is permanently damaged. But no viruses and the immune system becomes weak and fragile too. Personally, I think if we want to get the former immunity boosting we should be promoting ways for people to hack on systems in non-malicious ways. Bug bounty programs. Clear paths to responsible disclosure. All that jazz. Accidents will happen and some will go too far, but intent does matter. But we also hear on HN about how people have found vulns, reported it, and the response is to sue the person disclosing for hacking. Even if this is exclusively untrue (lol), if it is widely believed then what incentive does someone have to report a vuln if they find it? Because they sure have incentives to do malicious things with that information. I'm big on morals and sticking to them. But at the same time I don't think we can have a functional society where people's only incentive to do the right thing is that warm and fuzzy feeling inside, especially when there are incentives to do the wrong thing.

Also, look who they're learning from. Growing up in the 90s, I had my everyday IRL friends but also some BBS friends. In that latter peer group--pseudo anonymous and extremely online--edgelord morality prevailed. reply bitcharmer 2 hours agorootparentprevI think you completely missed GP's point. Teenagers ARE much more likely to make a bad decision than other groups. reply aithrowawaycomm 6 hours agoparentprevNo, autism is an explanation for not saying \"wow this guy is a real stain on society\" and being reluctant to put him behind bars. That being said I don't like infantilizing people who have autism without more profound disabilities in cognition (I am speaking as someone who has \"mild\" schizophrenia). Kurtaj seems to have normal intelligence and is not so disconnected from society as to be unaware what he allegedly did was wrong. In particular his alleged motivations and mental state during all this are not that different from a angry teenager with few friends and terrible judgment. There are other factors that are important for sentencing. Unlike the angry teen, it sounds like Kurtaj might have trouble holding down a job even if he gave his best effort at emotional and occupational therapy. But when people with autism seem perfectly capable of making moral choices, their diagnosis should inform your empathy. Turning that into an exoneration not only excuses certain bad people, but also denies that certain good people actually understand they're doing the right thing. It's totally dehumanizing. reply labster 18 hours agoparentprevAn explanation, sure. A justification, no. Just a reminder: the autism spectrum is wide, and two autistic people are likely to be more different from each other than a neurotypical person. reply dokyun 11 hours agoparentprevNo, the explanation is that it's hilarious. reply bookofjoe 16 hours agoprevhttps://www.wsj.com/tech/cybersecurity/arion-kurtaj-hacker-4... reply arealaccount 19 hours agoprevI admittedly only grazed the article, but fighting back almost is what you desire as a teenage offensive hacker. reply Jyaif 14 hours agoprevFrom what I gather from the article he's doing social engineering, not technical hacking. In other words: lying to, manipulating, and exploiting trusting folks, rather than finding technical flaws. Much less noble in my opinion. reply dmix 14 hours agoparentThe what you do after social engineering and knowing what to ask for and pivot is very technical reply CatWChainsaw 5 hours agoparentprevIn other words, all the things that politicians, CEOs, and Silicon Valley visionaries do? reply A_D_E_P_T 20 hours agoprevArticle opens with: > The judge ultimately handed Kurtaj a sentence that his lawyers have called out of proportion with the crimes he stood accused of. The family declined to be interviewed. Doesn't actually mention what the sentence was until the end of the article: > The judge gave Kurtaj an indefinite hospital order—a sentence confining him to a secure mental-health ward until doctors and U.K. officials decide he is no longer a danger to the public. He was 18 years old. [. . .] People in Kurtaj’s situation can apply for a review of their detention once a year. Otherwise, their detention is subject to government review once every three years, according to the Ministry of Justice. > Kurtaj’s lawyers and some experts on autism have said a potential lifetime of incarceration isn’t appropriate for a teenager like Kurtaj. Thing is, there's basically a zero percent likelihood that it's actually a lifetime of incarceration. I haven't seen the statistics on this, but I'd bet that the average person incarcerated under such an order is out in a couple of years, and the vast majority are out within ten. What's more, it's not a prison. > It’s up to his doctors whether Kurtaj can access the internet. He was sent to a medium-security hospital ward, where in the common areas shared with other patients, he was surrounded by tablets, phones and computers. Come on, now. That sentence is neither as harsh (in terms of conditions) nor as draconian (in terms of duration) as the article wants us to feel. In the US, he be tried as an adult and he'd have it much worse... The punishment rarely fits the crime, but I think that the system did okay with this one. reply Firerouge 19 hours agoparentWhile there aren't many statistics on this sort of sentencing, I did find some here: https://forum.mentalhealthlaw.co.uk/t/section-37-41-data-spe... And based on the following: > The number of admissions has fluctuated between 1,500 and 1,700 since 2008. And > The number of discharges and disposals has fluctuated between 1,350 and 1,550 since 2011 One can extrapolate that up to a couple hundred new admissions each year are staying in essentially indefinitely, as the discharge rate is generally always lower than the admissions rate. reply giantg2 19 hours agoparentprevIf I (autistic) had something I was good at and made me not feel like human garbage I wouldn't stop doing it. It wouldn't surprise me if a company hires him. This is something he's good at, but just seems to need some direction and oversight. reply whimsicalism 16 hours agoparentprevSeems ridiculously disproportionate to be sentenced with no end date? Even if 'in practice' it usually ends after some amount of non-determinate time. reply ChumpGPT 19 hours agoprevHe was such a legend that they were able to catch him, monitor his online activity and his rivals were able to Doxx him.

Take some responsibility for your actions! I loathe that you can apparently get away by telling reporters that it must have been a nation state actor. Oh it was just one kid in a hotel room? Well then he must have autism! Hey have you seen Rain Man? Yeah, must have been that kind of super power autism! It's revolting. Get your act together and stop blaming kids.

We all know they can be bypassed, but doing so is illegal. Kids and adults should be held accountable for repeatedly breaking the law. reply beeflet 11 hours agorootparentcomputer security isn't comparable to physical security and should be held to a higher standard because it can be. When you expose a computer to a global computer network, you are exposing it to others with no shared social contract. reply lmz 4 hours agorootparentWell they should've picked a more \"global\" target then, not people who can get them caught. reply jabuticaba 19 hours agoprev [–] Finally news about a hacker on hacker news reply d0mine 14 hours agoparent [–] The word \"Hacker\" in Hacker News does not mean cracker https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
