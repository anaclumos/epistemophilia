I can see the difference in my phone usage/productivity on days when I have accidentally turned actuflow mode off (my main issue with the app is that if I accidentally swipe away the unlock window without typing an intention or pressing dismiss, actuflow turns off) and it has helped me get more done when I am on my phone. Hopefully more of the bugs will be sorted out soon. 3 people found this review helpful Did you find this helpful? Yes No Yaroslav Neznaradko April 23, 2021 Thank you so much for your review! Brenna Horton more_vert May 7, 2022 this is sooo close to what i am looking for but not quite. i would love a feature that allows you to set an intention each time you open an app, not just unlock your phone. being able to toggle which apps (ie. social media, youtube) ask you for a prompt would be awesome. it's kind of annoying to be asked to set an intention for stuff that is already mindful and responsible like music, maps, or texting. 19 people found this review helpful Did you find this helpful? Yes No Camden Mac Leod more_vert November 21, 2020 A great app for staying on track and making sure you're not wasting time on your phone! It's easy to get on your phone and end up 30 minutes later scrolling through Instagram wondering why you were on your phone in the first place. The only thing I would change is a feature to disable the app from certain hours. For example, I unlock my phone every few minutes at the gym to see the next workout, so it would be nice if I could have it not ask me each time from say, 7am - 8am when I'm working out. 16 people found this review helpful Did you find this helpful?

    "commentBody": "App that asks ‘why?’ every time you unlock your phone (play.google.com)512 points by jarko27 10 hours agohidepastfavorite273 comments TeMPOraL 2 hours agoI installed this in the morning to give it a test drive, and after several hours, I learned the following: it's great when I reach for the phone as a distraction; it's a big annoyance otherwise. E.g. each time I want to change the currently playing song, what was muscle memory gets scrambled by the interruption. Or, when I'm taking a lot of photos (like on my daughter's kindergarten event today), I tend to keep the screen off in between, and rely on being able to turn it on and shoot a photo in less than two seconds, total. Guess how that got screwed up by this app. The app itself is great, and I'm still a believer in the concept of managing executive function issues by throwing obstacles in front of bad habits and known focus black holes. However, this experience made me discover the third class of phone activity, next to \"distraction\" and \"work\" - quick, intermittent, on-the-fly use, the kind you ideally don't think much about. This class does not distract you... unless someone adds friction to it. I just saw the app has \"every N unlocks\" option, I'll try it out and see if this helps with the \"third class\". reply jarko27 28 minutes agoparentThanks for giving it a test drive! I'm thinking also about adding an option to have like 50% chance of a popup or a 75% chance, so it's less predictable. I first made it as every 2nd, 3d and so on, but maybe adding a randomness to it will be better? WDYT? reply TeMPOraL 6 minutes agorootparentFor my use case, randomness would make it even worse. For muscle memory, consistency is key. I don't know what the solution is - ideally, the app would not interrupt such quick actions like unlocking to take a photo or switch the song, but in practice, it can't exactly guess what I'm going to do before I do it. I was thinking about maybe \"unlock and don't show the popup for the next 5 minutes\", but then I already know that one of these days, I'll activate it for \"one quick check of Instagram\" (or HN), defeating the purpose of the application. Sorry I can't be more helpful. I've been mulling this problem (selective blocking in dual-purpose apps/sites) in my mind for a long time now, but I haven't found any solution so far. reply bornfreddy 2 hours agoparentprevMaybe the app should kick in only if you start using one of the \"bad\" apps, like a browser or a social network app? Being in the way when I want to snap a quick photo doesn't sound nice. reply gen220 55 minutes agorootparentWhat I did (helped me eventually delete them) was offload the \"bad\" apps on my phone so, if I wanted to access them, I'd have to wait for them to re-download. This is an iOS feature where the pointer to the app and the local data remains, but the app bundle itself is deleted. I think it's primary use case is to manage scarce disk space. It forced me to reckon with the fact that tapping on these apps is often a system 1 instinct. The forced delay to reinstall the app is an escape hatch into system 2 thinking, a mode in which I normally realize I don't even want to use the app, I'm just bored. And then I'd pick up a book or use my newspaper-reader-app (i.e. a more intent/system 2-driven choice). Off-loading apps or even just removing them from the home screen is really helpful. It gives your system 2 brain an opportunity to mutate your environment to make system 1 processes lead to more fruitful outcomes. For the same reason, I clear my browser history every month or so and avoid bookmarking certain sites like hn or reddit. reply koevet 2 hours agorootparentprevFor this use case, I use \"IChooseTo\" https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appsofuse.... reply throwawayk7h 1 hour agorootparentThis looks like it's based on a timer, and prevents you from using the app if you use it for, say, too long. Is that right? I have legitimate longform uses of my browser app as well as bad ones. reply jkukul 1 hour agorootparentprevI use iOS's built in Screen Time settings. For \"bad\" apps (Reddit, TikTok, etc) and \"bad\" websites (\"hackernews\", etc) I set a daily time limit of, let's say, 15 minutes. I configure a random password for Screen Time so that it's a real hassle to circumvent the daily limit when I get over it. reply hackernewds 1 hour agorootparentprevthis is 100% what I want, and I'd gladly pay $10/month for this reply lubujackson 27 minutes agoparentprevBetter solution: add in increasing delay before opening a time waster, increasing 1 second between each open over the course of the day. Openning Reddit for the 15th time today? 15 second wait (or longer). reply andai 1 hour agoparentprevThis is solved by having dedicated devices for camera and music player! (At least for these two examples, which are also my top non-distraction / non-social phone usage.) I don't have those yet but I wish I did! I was just thinking back to how cool the iPod was back in the day. (The one before touchscreens!) (I was also thinking how cool it would be if it had the iPod's UI but Rockbox's (and every other mp3 player in human history) support for just putting folders full of files on it... but I guess I'll keep dreaming!) reply cardanome 11 minutes agorootparentI actually went full old-school and got an portable cd-player. This has the side effect of me listening to music more intentionally and not wasting time selecting tracks and skipping around. Listening to a full album is great, something I rarely did before. And physically owning music feels great. Sure, it is less practical for traveling but it mostly sits on my desk to help me get through work. And CD's having a fixed run length helps me to take breaks so my tinnitus does not get worse. reply ar_lan 29 minutes agorootparentprevThat is a solution, but not an ideal one for many (most?). One of the great innovations of the smartphone is that I have all 3 devices in one small form factor, so I don't need to carry/travel with the bulk of many. reply TeMPOraL 1 hour agorootparentprevThat's fair. I miss MP3 players and even feature phones - all of them could be operated without looking at them! Alas, ever since Apple showed it's Courage™ by ditching the audio jack, Bluetooth headphones became ubiquitous (doubly so thanks to AirPods and alternatives). They're nice and all, but they also have mikes, so you want to use them for calling and voice messaging too, and then you can also put notifications on them, ... with Bluetooth device switching being what it is, this complements and reinforces smartphone's role as single device for everything. EDIT: I wonder if it's possible to have some kind of mixer wearable that would accept wireless audio streams (both in \"music\" and \"headset\" modes) from multiple devices, mix them together, and route to a single set of wireless headphones. That would solve a lot of the issues I have with wireless audio in practice. reply ar_lan 31 minutes agoparentprevThis sounds like a good case for an allowlist for certain applications - Camera, Spotify, Notes, etc. reply iandanforth 1 hour agoparentprevRe: The photos case: I have the camera app bound to a double click of my power button. I find it to be incredibly useful to have a way to immediately open my camera and Intenty doesn't override that flow. reply TeMPOraL 1 hour agorootparentHah, I used to do that too, however I changed it so double-press of the side button toggles the flashlight instead. I find this to have much better ROI. For camera, turning the screen off while camera app is open means I can just press the power button and slide up, and I'm back in camera app (unless Intenty interferes). For flashlight, having a quick key (that works even when the phone is locked) is a qualitative change - I use the phone flashlight much more often, now that I can casually turn it on and off with zero effort, like a traditional torch. There are actually two major use cases I have for that daily: - In autumn/winter, by the time I pick my kids up from the kindergarten, it's already dark. There's a stretch of pavement that's pitch dark, so I just casually light it up as we walk over it. (That was the driver behind me changing the button mapping from camera to flashlight; having done that, I now instinctively turn the flashlight on and off as I walk, lighting up dark spots.) - Have you ever tried to read something from a phone while walking at night? It's a big problem - the screen pretty much blinds you, unless you turn the brightness down to minimum. You can't read and monitor ground under your feet at the same time. However, if you also turn on the flashlight, the brightness of the screen and the light reflecting off the ground are similar, so reading becomes comfortable and you regain awareness of terrain. I figured out that trick long ago, first with Kindle (Paperwhite) - I'd put my phone against the back of the Kindle, turn the backlight on the reader, and the flashlight on the phone. But it works even better for reading from the phone itself. reply echelon 2 hours agoparentprevThis is where an OS-based agent would help. If it semantically understood the tasks we're trying to accomplish, it could filter the cases we care about. I'm even more excited about browser or OS agents being able to unilaterally scrub the web of all advertisements, spam, polarized toxicity, etc. Forget adblock - I can effectively block all the bad things Google, Meta, Twitter, etc. do and their army of PMs won't be able to stop me. This tech is going to rip the advertiser and algorithmic madness out of the internet and make it serve me and only me. reply hackernewds 59 minutes agorootparentneither Apple or Google will ever develop this given that their core Business depends on users using their phones often reply MortyWaves 3 hours agoprevNeeds an option for “my employer turned on shitty Microsoft ten-billion-factor auth settings”. To login to my work Microsoft account requires a passcode and then three face scans. reply autoexec 1 hour agoparentI had an employer want that too, but we protested. Basically making that the case that they'd need to provide us with phones so that we don't have to install invasive apps on our personal devices. We ended up getting tiny hardware tokens that go on a key ring and couldn't access GPS, cameras, microphones, sensor data, network, etc even if it wanted to. reply alexvitkov 59 minutes agoparentprevThis has always boggled my mind - If you don't trust me to pick a decent password and maintain my own machine, why in God's name would you trust me to write code or deploy/maintain company infrastructure? reply ryanmcbride 30 minutes agorootparentThey _don't_ trust you to do that stuff. Not unilaterally at least. In a healthy system you generally aren't able to change anything without sign off from multiple other people. reply tecleandor 55 minutes agorootparentprevNah, it's not lack of trust, it's just compliance and plausible deniability. reply poincaredisk 1 hour agoparentprevBut that's ok your work phone right? At least I hope you didn't agree to have it installed on your private phone. For work phone I guess a good strategy is to avoid installing anything non-work related, so the temptation to use it for anything is low. reply cglong 1 hour agorootparentNot GP, but I'm okay installing that stuff on my personal phone because it's isolated via Android Work Profile. reply autoexec 1 hour agorootparentHow is that keeping Microsoft from accessing your GPS, sensor data, wifi, camera/microphone etc? Sure, they can't get at SMS or your other apps and your work won't have access to your entire device but it means MS can still access your location (using GPS and nearby bluetooth/wifi), record audio/video, read/control sensors (accelerometer, proximity, gravity, temperature, pressure, magnetic field etc), have full network access, etc and can record and collect that data whenever they feel like it for the most part. reply cglong 32 minutes agorootparentThat's true with a separate work phone too right? And once I turn off the AWP for the day, all of that stops. reply johnisgood 1 hour agorootparentprevYou may want to try \"Shelter\" (https://f-droid.org/packages/net.typeblog.shelter/). reply encom 54 minutes agorootparentprevNo way I'm doing anything work related on any of my personal devices. I have a separate work phone. I turn it off at the end of the work day, and leave it at work. I used to answer emails from bosses and managers while at home (at a previous employer), but it gets out of hand quickly and then they expect you to do it. Never again. Set boundaries immediately. At 15:00 I'm gone. reply cglong 30 minutes agorootparentLeaving it at work goes one step further than my flow. I have AWP configured to automatically turn off at the end of the workday, so I become unavailable after that. There's always the possibility I can turn it back on after hours, but that extra step works well enough as a deterrent for me :) reply throwawayk7h 1 hour agoparentprevYou can usually do OTP from your pc directly, just install an OTP application on your pc like keepassxc reply CryptoBanker 1 hour agorootparentDoesn’t work if your work uses SSO like Okta reply deskr 1 hour agorootparentprevSecurity dept. would like to have a word. reply compootr 1 hour agorootparentsecurity theater dept. has entered the chat reply retSava 6 hours agoprevGreat! Apps like these are sorely needed. My feedback would be, apart from what others are saying about sub vs one-time purchase, to look at what Leechblock firefox extension is doing. The key point is to make it harder (but not impossible) for me to use the phone. A \"Do you need this?\" is a great start, but since I can easily sneak by, I will soon do that. Even if I click \"1 minute\" to get a reminder, that should not be a simple notification, but back to the large big screen covering things. What LB does is genius. You can enable a barrier so that if you reeeeeeally need to, you can get around, but it's annoying and time consuming, and thus the quick loop of \"pick up phone and get stuck\" is broken. The barrier in LB can be to type a (long) passphrase, or my favorite: a 64-char random string which cannot be copy-pasted. You need to manually look at 2-3 chars at a time and replicate the whole thing. Very effective. But again, also the snap back to reality thing. If I keep using it, throw up a big overlay with a good question \"Is your attention well spent?\" for example. Make me wait before I can continue. reply jarko27 6 hours agoparentAdvanced reminders are going to be a thing for the next big release. I agree that one problem is to pass the unlock, but staying on track with your intention is a different story. One periodical notification with static text can in theory fix that, but the chances are low in comparison to the full-screen pop-up. I intentionally focused on the unlock procedure first. For now, you can combine it with other apps like minimalistic launchers and apps that pop up after the app opens. But eventually, improving the reminder experience can make the solution more complete, I agree. About typing \"captcha\" or random characters. I think it's just a different type of nudge. Another can be a small mini-game to play like catching a moving object. I'm going to consider adding different types of nudges to the app. Thanks for the suggestion. reply youainti 2 hours agorootparentJust thinking about this, there might be room for a home launcher that helps manage attention this way. Probably more work than you are thinking of doing though. reply guitarlimeo 6 hours agoparentprevI tried LeechBlock for a while and had that 64-char random string passphrase thing on. Turns out I became really quick at typing those 64 characters to get my dopamine fix. reply artisanspam 5 hours agorootparentYou can make it up to 128 characters. That's impressive that you are able to type a random string of nonsense so fast. My hack was to take a picture on my phone, have Apple's image recognition copy the string to my iCloud clipboard, and I'd paste it on my mac. It's too easy to defeat the purpose of these things if you're even slightly driven. reply kibwen 2 hours agorootparent> It's too easy to defeat the purpose of these things if you're even slightly driven. Things like the OP and LeechBlock are tools for people who have already mostly conquered their addiction, to help keep them from relapsing. On their own, they're not sufficient to turn an addict into a non-addict. reply darkwater 3 hours agorootparentprevMay I ask you why you did install it in the first place, if you then hack your way around it?

All apps, and actually the phone manfacturers themselves make phones harder to use through user hostile patterns. Mandatory updates, re-logon, TOC confirmations, cookies, self promotions in the face, adverts, warnings, spray of notifications on marginal things, answering questions to important (or not) questions, selecting important (or not) huge amount of settings, suggestions (actually another self promotion mostly), update informations, etc. all make the phones as difficult to use as much those helps, or even more.

It's no longer on Google Play because of the maintenance burden of keeping it there, but here's a page with some screenshots: https://apkpure.com/spinach-motivation-lock-screen/com.tengu... The idea was that if you're unlocking your screen, you should at least: (1) reinforce a mantra, or (2) force yourself to acknowledge you shouldn't be unlocking the phone. Happy to share notes if you think that would be helpful. reply jarko27 15 minutes agoparentWow. It's so cool to see such a project.

Instead of “why”, it would send out notifications to a central server with a data pipeline into genAI which can generate reports on productivity. Employee not complying? Bye bye equity, severance Employee opening device too much? Fired. Of course C-level executives would get exempt from policy because “rules for thee but not for me” attitude. As for personal usage, I would much rather configure “Focus” mode to block certain apps from opening. Rather than rely on this. I would install this on phones of annoying people though for shits and giggles reply mrkramer 1 hour agoprevEven more cooler idea would be that the app restricts you to only communication apps when you choose \"communication\" intent or when you choose \"boredom\" it prompts you to enjoy IRL activities and tells you to leave your device aside.

I fiddled around a bit and it's possible to set up an automation that automatically exits back to the home screen after some pause, or displays a notification to try to nudge you out of the app. This is not as good as the app but it is free. Also, without the Safari extension, I don't think websites can be blocked. My own strategy is to simply use pi-hole to block time-wasting websites entirely.

I liked how the screen animation naturally made me take a deep breath, and I liked seeing how many times I've opened an app so far in the day. Unfortunately the free tier is quite limited - you can only enable it for one app, and you can't customize the duration of the blocking animation. reply princevegeta89 3 hours agoparentprevApps like this are a godsend. Putting away all the social media aside (where 95% of the content is fake/useless anyway), in reality there should really be no use for mobile phones besides using it for calls/music and some important things when you can't get to your laptop/desktop. I've realized recently that it takes at least 3 times more work and time to do things on a smartphone than to do the same things on a laptop. This holds true for messaging apps where we are so limited by the typing speed and error-prone nature of composing messages on a smartphone, and the lack of good multitasking options like on a desktop interface. I have more time in my life now, more than ever, after I started to avoid using my phone for things wherever I can. reply al_borland 4 hours agoparentprevI usually just delete the app if it's dominating my time on the phone or drawing me to it. reply edm0nd 2 hours agorootparentI went another route.

Anyway, really nice work! reply jarko27 9 hours agoparentThanks for giving it a try! > - isn't it possible to select multiple intentions? I've tried but when I turn on one, another one turns off. Here is the place where I made a UX mistake. I implemented nudges in a similar way as \"modes\" on iOS or routines on Samsung phones. You can enable one at a time. If you want to customise the content you see, you have to customise it inside nudge, not by enabling another one. I didn't make any UX tests before releasing this and I see a lot of confusion here. Apologise for that. > for apps like these I'm really missing a more expensive lifetime subscription. I'm okay with paying some more upfront if I don't have to pay a periodical fee.

The \"in-app purchases\" are for small complementary features, like making the screen appear on a schedule, making it impossible to skip the screen, and adding a lock button to lock the screen. Those features aren't essential for the app to function. > This app could just be an image set as your lock screen background. Well, yes and no. In the app, you can interact with the prompts.

For example, if you plan to use this app for 7 years (which is a reasonable expectation for a piece of software's lifetime) and it costs $2 a month, the net present value is somewhere around $138. That is, if you decide right now to use the app for 7 years, you are costing yourself $138 in today-dollars. Which is rather a lot. Of course the subscription does have the benefit that you can cut off your usage at any point, however the people asking for a perpetual irrevocable license are probably not the type who appreciate this capability. reply jarko27 8 hours agoparentprevThanks for the try.

If that's about using the phone less, like during focus time I pick it up habitually to procrastinate the screen can say \"Just put it down and check it at the scheduled time\". When I see the text I'm kind of dragged out of the habit loop and just putting it down or press the lock button. So it's a kind of replacement of one habit with another one. See an app screen? Lock the phone. If it is about a weekend or a vacation I put a text on the screen about being more relaxed and not having FOMO. Like 'If that's something important, you will know about it'. Here the mechanism is almost the same, I'm replacing the habit of checking stuff with something different like music or locking my phone back again. reply wruza 6 hours agoparentprevUsually it’s procrastination and anxiety escapism, and it’s all automatic.

The Northstar is to adjust the nudge automatically based on the level of fatigue from the screen. I know I'm far from it now. But I'm attempting.

Because these things require some thought and analysis if you truly think that you yourself are having issues with screen time or other attention-related issues. I may or may not have that right now but I for sure did some years ago. And if you are having issues with your attention? Boy, loading on more stuff that you are supposed to “attend to” for sure does not help. Someone who is having self-reported issues with their attention is not going to see some automated mindfulness message and go, oh wait time to slow down and take a good gander at what I want to spend my attention on right now. On the contrary that will just tire them more. Which makes them more susceptible to losing their awareness or attention.

I often leave the phone at home or in my car when I go out. I leave it by the front door when I'm at home instead of keeping it in my hand or pocket.

For the last two years it's usually either sitting in another room when I'm at home, or in my bag when I'm out, always on silent. Switched off an hour before bed. This is enough to eliminate the distraction for me. The main benefit is really just having more free time, focus and attention that you can channel into things you actually care about. So if anyone needs motivation to un-tether, think of it like this: being a phone user cuts your life roughly in half (in terms of the portion of time that's actually available to you to use). I could go even more extreme on the phone decoupling, for instance I still bring it with me if I'm going to a bar or something, but at the moment I'm more focused on whittling down social media usage on computers as well.

    "originBody": "Downtown Doug Brown Thoughts from a combined Apple/Linux/Windows geek. Home About Mac ROM SIMMs Software Microcontroller lessons Contact Nov 26 The capacitor that Apple soldered incorrectly at the factory Doug Brown Classic Mac, Computer repair 2024-11-26 There have been some past rumblings on the internet about a capacitor being installed backwards in Apple’s Macintosh LC III. The LC III was a “pizza box” Mac model produced from early 1993 to early 1994, mainly targeted at the education market. It also manifested as various consumer Performa models: the 450, 460, 466, and 467. Clearly, Apple never initiated a huge recall of the LC III, so I think there is some skepticism in the community about this whole issue. Let’s look at the situation in more detail and understand the circuit. Did Apple actually make a mistake? I participated in the discussion thread at the first link over a decade ago, but I never had a machine to look at with my own eyes until now. I recently bought a Performa 450 complete with its original leaky capacitors, and I have several other machines in the same form factor. Let’s check everything out! Here’s the affected section of the board before I removed the original capacitors. You can see that all three of these caps (C19, C21, and C22) have their negative side pointing upward, matching the PCB silkscreen that has the + sign at the bottom. If the miscellaneous gunk and ugly appearance of the solder joints in this picture isn’t a warning sign that you should replace the SMD electrolytic capacitors in any classic Mac from the ’90s at this point, I don’t know what is! Let’s take a closer look at the circuit after I removed them and cleaned everything up a bit. Yikes, C21 leaked really badly and damaged the solder mask and the copper underneath. When I removed it, there was a big puddle of goo sitting there. I haven’t installed new capacitors on this board yet, but I’m probably going to need to scrape more of that dark crud from the copper and cover it all up with UV-curable solder mask. Luckily, it’s just the ground plane so it’s not a huge deal. Anyway, the important thing to note in this picture is that the negative terminal of each capacitor goes to the ground plane. The positive terminals all head over to pins on the power supply connector. What’s happening here is there is one bulk capacitor for each of the three power rails provided by the power supply. C19 is for +5V, C21 is for +12V, and C22 is for -5V. You can see the trace from C22’s positive terminal going directly to the -5V pin on the power supply connector. This arrangement makes sense for the two positive power rails, but it’s backwards for the -5V rail. If the image above isn’t proof enough for you, here are a couple of pictures with my multimeter definitively showing that the positive terminal of C22 goes to -5V and the negative terminal goes to ground. That means when the system is powered on, there will be -5V across this capacitor. I really don’t need to do any additional analysis at this point in order to say that this is just plain wrong. You aren’t supposed to have a negative voltage across this type of capacitor. There’s a reason they have a marking that identifies the negative side. The voltage at the positive end should be greater than or equal to the voltage at the negative end. In other words, this capacitor’s positive end should have been connected to ground and the negative end should have been connected to -5V. Let’s compare and contrast this circuit with the corresponding circuit on an original Mac LC, which uses the exact same power supply. This is another system with its original leaky caps: They installed it correctly on the original LC (and the LC II). -5V goes to the negative end of the capacitor, and ground goes to the positive end, resulting in a net voltage of positive 5 volts across it. What about the LC 475, which is the successor to the LC III? If Apple miraculously discovered a special exception to the laws of physics during development of the LC III, I would expect them to have continued following this new rule with the design of the LC 475. Nope! It’s back to the same (correct) orientation that was used on the original LC. After seeing it myself and comparing the circuit with other Mac models of the era, I’m very confident that Apple made a boo-boo on the LC III. It’s not just a factory component placement issue; the PCB’s silkscreen is also incorrect. It’s basically the hardware equivalent of a copy/paste error when you’re writing code. I’m hoping to raise awareness of this mistake because all of the (very useful) recapping guide collections I’ve found on the Internet strangely fail to mention this reversed capacitor for some reason, even though it’s known to have caused problems for many people. But, you may ask, why didn’t it matter with the original liquid-filled electrolytic capacitor fitted on the board? Why didn’t this cause a huge uproar back in the day? Why didn’t everyone’s LC III explode in a giant fireball? Well, for one, the original capacitor was obviously tolerant of this mistake. It was rated for 16V but only -5V was being put across it. According to what I’ve read online, that’s more than enough reverse voltage to permanently damage this type of capacitor, but it may not be enough to cause it to violently explode. Plus, it is only involved with the -5V rail, which is really only needed for the RS-422 serial ports. The capacitor might not have been doing its job properly if it was installed backwards, but it didn’t seem to really be hurting anything. With the way that a lot of people in the hobby these days (including me) are using tantalum capacitors as replacements, I think it’s potentially dangerous that this backwards capacitor isn’t widely documented. Although the computer seems to work okay in this configuration with a normal electrolytic capacitor like what was installed by the factory, tantalum capacitors are not quite as forgiving when installed in reverse. Multiple people online have observed that when they have a tantalum capacitor installed in the original incorrect orientation, they end up with an incorrect voltage on the -5V rail. The original poster about this issue, paul.gaastra, said that with the tantalum capacitor installed backwards it was drawing 1.3 amps (way too much) and the voltage was only -2.3V. At best, this is going to result in serial port problems. At worst, you’re asking for the capacitor to explode or catch on fire. It’s probably not good for the power supply, either; it’s only rated for 75 mA on the -5V rail. The bottom line is that Apple’s silkscreen markings and factory placement for C22 on the LC III are flat out wrong. There’s no other correct answer. Please, if you are recapping one of these machines, install C22 backwards from what the silkscreen on the PCB says. If you don’t believe me, or want to double check for yourself, you can easily verify this with a multimeter in continuity test mode with the system powered off. The positive end of the cap needs to be connected to ground, and the negative end needs to be connected to -5V. Using your multimeter’s DC voltage mode, if you power on the system, you should see 5V across the capacitor (negative probe to negative side of cap, positive probe to positive side of cap). That’s how it is on every other Mac with a -5V rail.

Did you know that when electrolytic caps are manufactured, the two aluminum foil plates are identical and there is no insulating layer. Once assembled, with an electrolyte soaked porous sheet between the plates, a voltage is applied. This causes a chemical reaction with one of the plates, that creates a thin insulating layer. The layer surface also isn’t flat, but has a very complex structure with a high surface area, to maximize the capacitance. This process is called ‘forming’ the capacitor. The reason electros are (mostly) polarized, is that the chemical reaction can be reversed with opposite voltage, and as the ‘formed’ layer is removed, the capacitance (and voltage it can resist) decrease. The insulating layer also degrades over time while there is no voltage across the cap. So to restore vintage electronics, power should be applied very slowly ramping up to full voltage, to allow old electros to ‘reform.’ (If they didn’t leak and dry out.) But 5V is quite low. It’s possible that C22 completely de-formed, and then re-formed in reverse polarity. It didn’t leak and might even have been perfectly fine. Though replacing it was a good idea. C21 otoh… An important spec sheet number for eletros is the maximum ripple current they can handle. The reason it matters is that electros have an internal series resistance, and the ripple (AC) current is dissipating heat in that resistance. Cheap little caps like these will have relatively high internal resistance. And the +12V rail can have a fairly high ripple current. It would not surprise me at all if no one at Apple checked the +12V rail ripple current in this cap, or ever even looked at the spec sheet for the caps. That C21 leaked, suggests it was under-rated, and over time internal heating and resulting eletrolyte pressure broke the seal. Doug Brown @ 2024-11-26 23:11 Hi Guy, Thanks for the details about how caps work and how they are made! To be fair, all of the electrolytic caps had leaked on this board, including the other two in the picture. I think it’s more an old age thing than anything else. It’s a super common failure mode on lots of old electronics. Every Mac from the early ‘90s I have encountered has had caps with leakage like this. C21 was definitely the worst I’ve ever seen though. Anonymous @ 2024-11-27 00:34 I tried to fact check the statement regarding > the two aluminum foil plates are identical and there is no insulating layer. It doesn’t seem accurate, at least not with today current manufacturing techniques. One of the plate is highly etched beforehand to allow for the formation of the oxide layer. Also, the purity of the plates differ. Robo @ 2024-11-27 01:44 The two multimeter photos are same? Joakim @ 2024-11-27 04:21 Great writeup Doug! Apple surely must have known at an early stage, so it really makes you wonder if they made any tests verifying that it would sort of work anyway and therefore decided against doing a recall on it. Tech Tangents @ 2024-11-27 06:26 Thank you for posting about this! I’ve been trying to find known examples of these kinds of issues but haven’t run into any myself yet. I run Caps Wiki and someone had made a page about the LC III but had not mentioned it. I just updated the page to document this issue there as well. I’ve heard that ASUS also had a tendency to get the silkscreen wrong on their caps but they would install them electrically correct. So this issue can show up in other ways as well. Doug Brown @ 2024-11-27 07:01 Robo, the pictures are subtly different. In the first one I’m clipped onto the -5V pin of the power supply and probing the positive terminal of the cap. In the second one I’m clipped onto ground and probing the negative terminal. In both pictures the multimeter shows continuity. I agree Joakim, I feel like Apple must have been aware at some point. With the stock caps it didn’t seem to be a problem. The old cap didn’t look worse than any of the others after all these years. Thank you Tech Tangents! That’s great. Your updates on the page look awesome. Much appreciated! Yuhong Bao @ 2024-11-27 10:59 I believe that -5V was already almost obsolete by the time of the original IBM PC.

Electrolytic ones do. Thing is, electrolytic capacitors have far higher capacitance for their size -- though also higher resistance. It's something to check, but the polar ones should be clearly marked as such. reply magic_smoke_ee 7 hours agorootparentElectrolytic capacitors are kinda like lead-acid batteries in that they are polarized through manufacturing processes. A voltage is applied in the factory to anodize the anode with a thin oxide layer. For fun, I think it would be possible to buy a quality low voltage cap and reverse the polarity of it in-situ which would remove the anodization from the new cathode and deposit a new layer on the new anode (former cathode) hopefully without over-pressurizing it to bursting, albeit with much less anticipated lifespan. PSA: Electrolytic capacitors have a rough lifespan of 10 years. Any much older than that need to be checked out-of-circuit for ESR and then capacitance. Also, tantalums (historically) suck(ed).

The normal lifespan of a non-solid electrolytic capacitor of consumer quality, typically rated at 2000 h/85 °C and operating at 40 °C, is roughly 6 years.

What I have seen done is cheaping out on parts in order to get the price as low as possible, because customers shop primarily on price. Not to lash out, but it kind of hits a nerve for me, because people think we design products to purposely fail. Hell no, we try really hard to do the opposite, but everyone just loves to buy the cheapest shit. The $25 LED bulb that will last for eternity will rot on the shelf next to the $3 bulb that will probably be dead in 6 months. And one more \"they build these things to fail\" complaint will be posted online. reply belval 1 hour agorootparentTo be fair this is hardly limited to EE and is the issue with the race to the bottom in all product categories. Make long-lasting high-quality 100$ pants? People prefer spending 10$ on Shein. Additionally, the issue is that as a consumer, it's not easy to differentiate between quality markup and greedy markup. I don't see the cap manufacturer on the box so the 25$ light bulb might last 10 years or it might last 6 months just like the 3$ one. At least with the 3$ one I can come back and buy another... reply magic_smoke_ee 1 hour agorootparentprevI seriously doubt it's ever a deliberate conspiracy in engineering apart from shenanigans like what happened at VW, but it's net effect of product managers, accountants, and contract manufacturers who modify PCBs and BOMs after it's passed off to them to save money on retail products. And so it's likely unintentional with negligence, but it benefits the company. Except for some Samsung appliances made ~ 2010-2014 which seemed to fail just after their warranties expired. I suspect highly-optimized designs for \"consumables\" like incandescent lightbulbs and parts for cars use data to tweak design life, more often than not, in their favor. And, with the pressures of multinational oligopolies and BlackRock/Vanguard/State Street.. there is little incentive to invest $100M into a moderately-superior incandescent lightbulb using yesterday's technology that lasts 100kh and 5k cycles and sells for $1 more than the next one. Maybe if we (perhaps a science/engineering nonprofit thinktank that spanned the world and gave away designs and manufacturing expertise) had quasi-communism for R&D, we could have very nice things. It's not my fault if other people are too dumb to comprehend TCO because I would buy the $25 bulb if it had a 30 year warranty. reply kube-system 42 minutes agorootparent> Except for some Samsung appliances made ~ 2010-2014 which seemed to fail just after their warranties expired. And? That just sounds like they have good engineers. If you are designing a machine, you have an target lifetime. You'd obviously want the product to last through the warranty period, because warranty claims are a cost to the company. Every choice of a component affects lifetime. Designers of mass-market products can't just use premium components everywhere -- the mass market will not pay steep premiums for otherwise equivalent products. Value engineering and planned obsolescence are not the same thing, but they are often confused. That being said, Samsung appliances suck and I hate them. Mine failed within warranty several times. > And, with the pressures of multinational oligopolies and BlackRock/Vanguard/State Street.. there is little incentive to invest $100M into a moderately-superior incandescent lightbulb using yesterday's technology that lasts 100kh and 5k cycles and sells for $1 more than the next one. It isn't that. It's pressure at the shelf that does it. Consumers behavior simply does not reward equivalent-feature products with premium components that claim (true or not) to have a longer lifespan. Unfortunately, they will buy based on their uninformed sense of quality first. If you release a light bulb that is identical to the best selling one on the shelf, but claims 10x lifespan, your competitor will do something like gluing a weight in theirs, putting some marketing BS on the box, and will put you out of business. Consumers just don't pick products based on actual quality. reply magic_smoke_ee 32 minutes agorootparentYou're making a pretty awkward value judgement about what a \"good\" engineer is, but you're describing an unethical one with a bizword like \"value engineering\". I realize ethics are no longer understood by much of Western society because the culture teaches transactionality, worships trickle-down economics and greed, and hyperindividualism. > It isn't that. It's pressure at the shelf that does it. Consumers behavior simply does not reward equivalent-feature products with premium components that claim (true or not) to have a longer lifespan. Unfortunately, they will buy based on their uninformed sense of quality first. This is a failure of marketing and buzz of the sales channel(s) and manufacturers to educate properly, not the failure of the customer. reply kube-system 19 minutes agorootparentA good engineer is one that has a job, doesn't put their employer out of business, and produces work that fulfills the requirements they're given. Many people think there's some unethical conspiracy going on, and consumers actually want a product that lasts a long time, but companies are refusing to give it to them. But this is projection of individual preferences on to the market as a whole. Consumers want cheap shit that is in fashion, and their buying preferences prove this time and again. Maybe you want a 50 year old toaster in your kitchen, other people are buying products based on other factors. If consumers really wanted to pay a premium for high duty-cycle equipment with premium lifespans, they can already do that by buying commercial grade equipment. But they don't. If you are familiar with the history of home appliances, you'd probably come to appreciate the phrase 'value engineering'. Even poor people can afford basic electric appliances now because of the ingenuous ways that engineers have designed surprisingly usable appliances out of very minimal and efficient designs. If you look at ads for electric toasters 100 years ago, you'd see they cost over $300 in today's money adjusted for inflation. Thank god for value engineering. kube-system 52 minutes agorootparentprev> Intentional planned consumption/obsolescence No it isn't. It is simply optimization of price and the features/form-factor that many buyers have demanded. If anything, the lifespan of a ~$1.50 household LED bulb is quite incredible. I'm not sure exactly how anyone would be able to increase the lifespan at that price point and keep the traditional Edison form factor. > Amazon should be required to test all [..] products on its site such that they can prove safety and standards conformance. No, the manufacturers should be required to... the same way it works for literally every other product with safety regulations. reply Filligree 2 hours agorootparentprevThat, and customers insisting on preexisting form factors.

Is it a worse problem than Amazon inspecting themselves would be? Is it a worse problem than Amazon demonstrably already has with policing counterfeits? I'm just saying, you could hardly ask for a less-qualified authority for product testing. At least with independent certs it's vaguely possible to align the incentives correctly. With Amazon the incentives would be hosed from the start. 83 4 hours agorootparentprevBipolar electrolytic capacitors are a thing, I recently had to solder up a handful of them in some audio circuits. reply nuancebydefault 5 hours agorootparentprevOnce you have experienced blowing up a reversed elcap you will never forget its orientation. I never understood though what makes it leak current and hence heat up. reply marcosdumay 4 hours agorootparentModern electrolytic caps don't burn like they used to. The last few times I made a mistake, there wasn't even an explosion, even less a short-circuit. The thing slowly boiled and bubbled or unfolded. Anyway, it blows up because the capacitor's insulation layer isn't some stable material, it's a tiny oxide layer built over the metal plate by anodization. If you put a high voltage on it with the wrong polarity, you reverse that anodization and short the liquid and the metal electrodes. reply kevindamm 4 hours agorootparentprevThere's an aluminum oxide layer as a coating on both the anode and cathode inside the (electrolytic) capacitor. Under forward voltage it will gradually thicken but under reverse voltage it dissolves and causes a short. This increases the temperature which causes hydrogen ions to separate and bubble through the material, increasing pressure within the capacitor package until it bursts. reply fredoralive 9 hours agorootparentprevThere are polarised and unpolarised capacitors. Stuff like basic decoupling capacitors tend to be unpolarised. reply phire 11 hours agoparentprevI actually have an LC III in storage, so I might actually be able to make use of this article.

And even if it did, how high would the probability be that both machines were on different circuits with phases so much out of sync that it would matter? Unless I misunderstood your story reply mgsouth 58 minutes agorootparentTotally believable if the debugging device was doing something with a serial port. I once hacked something together to interface a PC serial port to a Raspberry Pi. The PC serial is real-ish RS-232, with negative voltages. The Pi side was just 0/3.3V positive. I had a nice 18-volt power brick laying around, and just split it's output down the middle--what was 0 volt ground was used as -9 volts, the middle voltage was now 0 volt ground, and the 18-v line was now +9 V. At first everything seemed OK. but when I plugged a monitor into the PI I Was Made To Realize a) the nice 18-volt PS really was high quality, and although it was transformer-isolated its output ground was tied to the wall socket earth, b) monitors also tie HDMI cable ground to earth, and so c) my lash-up now had dueling grounds that were 9V apart. reply yetihehe 7 hours agorootparentprevThat device was a cheap wifi power plug, had cheap unisolated power supply, it was never intended to have user accessible electrical parts sticking out, so no need for isolation. In such cases device has common ground with ac voltage. I don't know all specifics, but NEVER connect any single terminal of 220V plug to your computer ground (usb ground in this case). When it's properly grounded, most devices will survive this. But somehow monitor connected to that mac didn't survive it. And several milliseconds of full 220V before circuit breaker reacted, made very thin traces in debugger pretty much vaporise and explode. reply nuancebydefault 5 hours agorootparentIf i remember correctly, a lot of power supplies of cheap electronics have AC-coupled the low voltage side with the mains side.

The affected TVs were all at least 20 years old - that's well beyond the expected useful lifespan of even a modern TV, let alone an older model like these. Nor is it clear what Sony could reasonably have done to repair them; even by 2010, a lot of the parts used in CRT TVs were out of production and unavailable. reply shiroiushi 12 hours agorootparentMaybe you're too young to remember, but people used to keep TVs for much longer periods before HDTV and flat panels came out. Also, these TVs are apparently fire hazards. It doesn't matter that they're 20 years old (at the point of the \"recall\" in 2010). I doubt the parts necessary to fix them were out of production; you can get parts for truly ancient electronics still. Things like capacitors don't become obsolete. The recall doesn't specify exactly which component is problematic, but says it's age-related, which usually points to capacitors. reply tobr 12 hours agorootparentThis. I’ve known a TV that was in more or less daily use for over 30 years. Not sure why we stopped expecting that from electronics. reply shiroiushi 11 hours agorootparent>Not sure why we stopped expecting that from electronics. For TVs specifically, the technology changed a lot. For a long time, everyone was stuck on the NTSC standard, which didn't change much. At first, everyone had B&W TVs, so once you had one, there was no reason to change. Then color TV came out, so suddenly people wanted those. After that, again no reason to change for a long time. Later, they got remote controls, so sometimes people would want one of those, or maybe a bigger screen, but generally a working color TV was good enough. Because TVs were glass CRTs, bigger screens cost a lot more than smaller ones, and there wasn't much change in cost here for a long time. Then HDTV came out and now people wanted those, first in 720p, and later in 1080i/p. And flat screens came too, so people wanted those too. So in a relatively short amount of time, people went from old-style NTSC CRTs to seeing rapid improvements in resolution (480p->720p->1080->4k), screen size (going from ~20\" to 3x\", 4x\", 5x\", 6x\", now up to 85\"), and also display/color quality (LCD, plasma, QLED, OLED), so there were valid reasons to upgrade. The media quality (I hate the word \"content\") changed too, with programs being shot in HD, and lately 4k/HDR, so the difference was quite noticeable to viewers. Before long, the improvements are going to slow or stop. They already have 8k screens, but no one buys them because there's no media for them and they can't really see the difference from 4k. Even 1080p media looks great on a 4k screen with upscaling, and not that much different from 4k. The human eye is only capable of so much, so we're seeing diminishing returns. So I predict that this rapid upgrade cycle might be slowing, and probably stopping before long with the coming economic crash and Great Depression of 2025. The main driver of new TV sales will be people's old TVs dying from component failure. reply kstrauser 3 hours agorootparentGreat points. The TV I have today is approaching my platonic ideal screen. It’s as big as it can get without having to continually look around to see the whole screen. Sit in the first row of a movie theater to understand how that can be a bad thing. The pixels are smaller than I can see, it has great dynamic range, and the colors can be as saturated as I’d ever want. There’s not much that can be improved on it as a traditional flatscreen video monitor. reply bregma 7 hours agorootparentprev> The human eye is only capable of so much, so we're seeing diminishing returns.

I once had a TV that was only really usable after dark -- but that's the only time I wanted to use it anyway -- and a huge Sun monitor that was only just about readable in total darkness, but we kept it because we also had a Sun server that we didn't know how to connect to any other monitor and we were worried that one day we wouldn't be able to SSH to it, but in fact the server never once failed. reply blitzar 9 hours agorootparentprev> Not sure why we stopped expecting that from electronics.

Moreover, we're talking about televisions and old Macs. TVs with higher resolutions might come out, but lower resolution ones continue to be sold new (implying demand exists at some price), and then why should anybody want to replace a functioning old TV with a newer one of the same resolution? Much older computers continue to be used because they run software that newer computers can't without emulation (which often introduces bugs) or have older physical interfaces compatible with other and often extremely expensive older hardware. If people actually wanted to replace their hardware instead of fixing it then they'd not be complaining about the inability to fix it. reply shiroiushi 10 hours agorootparent>There are many use cases for which a decade-old computer is still perfectly serviceable and even where they aren't, those computers can be repurposed for the ones that are. It depends. Older computers usually guzzle power, especially if you look at the absolutely awful Pentium4 systems. You're probably better off getting a RasPi or something, depending on what exactly you're trying to do. Newer systems have gotten much better with energy efficiency, so they'll pay for themselves quickly through lower electricity bills. >TVs with higher resolutions might come out, but lower resolution ones continue to be sold new (implying demand exists at some price) We're already seeing a limit here. 8k TVs are here now, but not very popular. There's almost no media in that resolution, and people can't tell the difference from 4k. For a while, this wasn't the case: people were upgrading from 480 to 720 to 1080 and now to 4k. >and then why should anybody want to replace a functioning old TV with a newer one of the same resolution? They probably don't; if they're upgrading, they're getting a higher resolution (lots of 1080 screens still out there), or they're getting a bigger screen. It's possible they might want newer smart TV features too: older sets probably have support dropped and don't support the latest streaming services, though usually you can just get an add-on device that plugs into the HDMI port so this is probably less of a factor. reply AnthonyMouse 42 minutes agorootparent> Older computers usually guzzle power, especially if you look at the absolutely awful Pentium4 systems. Even many Pentium 4-based systems would idle around 30 watts and peak at a little over 100, which is on par with a lot of modern desktops, and there were lower and higher power systems both then and now. The top end Pentium 4 had a TDP of 115W vs. 170W for the current top end Ryzen 9000 and even worse for current Intel. Midrange then and now was ~65W. Also, the Pentium 4 is twenty two years old. And the Pentium 4 in particular was an atypically inefficient CPU. The contemporaneous Pentium M was so much better that Intel soon after dumped the P4 in favor of a desktop CPU based on that (Core 2 Duo).

That's the point. 1080p TVs and even some 720p TVs are still sold new, so anyone buying one isn't upgrading and has no real reason to want to replace their existing device unless it e.g. has a design flaw that causes it to catch fire.

Power supply issues in general. It is also not uncommon for people to replace e.g. Wifi routers because the wall warts fail. It comes down to a few people don't knowing a lot about it - and I'm not blaming anyone for that, we all have our interests and most people have more than enough to do already to worry about what goes on inside their stuff. Also, electronics are, to a lot of people in a lot of places, so cheap that they would rather just curse a little and buy a new thing, instead of bothering with taking the thing to a shop. And of course a few hours of skilled labour in a big city in the west might also be almost as expensive as making a whole new TV in a factory in Asia plus shipping, so it might not even make economic sense. reply xxs 7 hours agorootparentprevElectrolytic capacitors are not solid state and likely #1 failure mode for most electronics. There are options for better (e.g. Al polymer) capacitors that are rather expensive - overall good capacitors are 'expensive', e.g. more than a dollar a piece in some cases.

It usually makes senss to swap all the capacitors in the kit, unless the kit instructions say otherwise. You can look for physical signs of degredation (bulgy, leaky, discolored), but to really test a capacitor for capacititance, you need to take it out of the circuit, at which point, you may as well put a new, high quality capacitor in. The OEM capacitors may likely have a just right voltage rating, a new one with a higher voltage rating (and same capacitance, compatible type) may last longer in cirucit as well. reply xxs 35 minutes agorootparent> new one with a higher voltage rating (and same capacitance, compatible type) may last longer in cirucit as well.

Components off a stolen device are put on a list and won't work in admirer another phone, so stolen phones aren't even worth anything for parts, driving down the market for stolen phones.

On top of that the \"non genuine parts\", some of which really are utterly dire, show up in the OS as being not genuine parts. Buying genuine parts, which are available from Apple, eats into the margins.

This is just incredibly dishonest framing and completely ignoring what the right to repair and third party repair shop issue is all about. > Buying genuine parts, which are available from Apple, It is not a margin problem, it is an availability problem. Apple does not allow third party repair shops to stock common parts, such as batteries or displays for popular iPhones. This is only possible when providing the devices serial numbers. This effectively prevents third party repair shops from competing with Apple or Apple authorized service providers because they have artificially inflated lead times. Becoming Apple authorized isn't an option for actual repair shops because that would effectively disallow them from doing actual repairs when possible, rather than playing Dr. Part Swap. Everything what Apple does in the repair space essentially boils down to them doing everything they can to avoid having competition in the repair space. > eats into the margins Replacing a 45ct voltage regulator on a mainboard is cheaper than replacing the entire mainboard with everything soldered on is cheaper, but doesn't allow for very nice margins. > There is very little honour in the repair market There is very little honour in any market. Honour does not get rewarded nowadays, people are into make money, if you're lucky they still take a little pride in their work. If a repair shop offers good service or not should be up to the consumer to determine, not up to Apple (or any electriconics manufacturer that employs the same tactics). > makeup applied to it by a couple of prominent youtubers and organisations. That is called marketing, that's what Apple does also pretty good. They're also lying when they say they are environmentally conscious while they also have their genius bar employees recommend an entirely new screen assembly on a MacBook just because a backlight cable came loose. > The amount of horror stories I've seen over the years from independent repairers is just terrible. J The amount of horror stories I have experienced with Apple is no joke either. Apple is always taking the sledgehammer approach with their repairs. I've had the pleasure myself to deal with Apple repairs once for my old 2019 MBP. It wouldn't take a charge anymore, went to the Genius Bar and received a quote for a new mainboard costing well over 1000 EUR. Being familiar with some of the more technical videos of Rossmann etc, I found one electronics repair store that actually does board level stuff and got it fixed for a fraction of the price (iirc it was ~200 EUR). reply cosmic_cheese 1 hour agorootparentEven if Apple has room for improvement here, I think it’s still worth it to try to curb the market for stolen parts, because that’s going to exist even if Apple sold spare parts in bulk at-cost simply because there exist unscrupulous repair shops that have no qualms with charging you OEM part prices while using gray market parts that cost a fraction as much on eBay, Aliexpress, etc. For instance, maybe Apple could supply parts in bulk to repair shops but require registration of those parts prior to usage. The repaired iPhone would function regardless but loudly alert the user that unregistered parts were used to repair it. Gray market parts naturally aren’t going to be able to be registered (either due to serial not existing in their system or having been parted out from stolen devices), and thus the user is given some level of assurance that they’re not paid for questionable repair services. reply shiroiushi 11 hours agorootparentprevI see.

It was full of challenging transmission line paths with frequencies in the hundreds of MHz and above. I am still proud of the fact that all of the high speed signals worked as designed, with excellent signal and power integrity (the large FPGA was challenging). Emissions passed as well. I did, however, screw up one thing: DC I somehow managed to layout the DC input connector backwards! These boards were very expensive ($2K), so an immediate respin was not possible. I had to design a set of contacts to be able to flip the connector upside-down and make the electrons go in the right way. The joke from that point forward was that I was great at multi-GHz designs but should not be trusted with DC circuits. reply likeabatterycar 9 hours agoprevThe author seems to misunderstand PCB design flow. This is neither a \"factory component placement issue\" nor a silkscreen error. The error is in the schematic. The layout CAD is often done by a different team that follows the schematic provided by design engineering. Automated workflows are common. The silk screen is predefined in a QA'd library. It is not their job to double check engineering's schematic. The components are placed per the layout data. Both those teams did their jobs correctly, to incorrect specifications. In fact, the factory performing assembly often is denied access to the schematic as it is sensitive IP. If you're going to cast blame on a 30 year old computer, at least direct it at the correct group. It wasn't soldered incorrectly at the factory. They soldered it exactly how they were told to - backwards. reply rcxdude 8 hours agoparent>The layout CAD is often done by a different team that follows the schematic provided by design engineering. Just as a note, this is a fairly archaic way of working nowadays. At my place schematic design and layout go hand-in-hand, and we rejected a candidate because he didn't do the latter. The main reason is layout is no longer an afterthought, it's a key part of the electrical design of the system, and there's little room for a tedious back and forth between the circuit designer and the person doing the layout about what traces are and aren't important to optimize for various attributes. reply analog31 5 hours agorootparentIndeed, and this is true in other engineering activities such as mechanical design as well. Possibly with the exception of very large shops, there are no draftsmen any more, and the design engineer also creates the production drawings. And the software lends itself to this. Schematic / layout, and design / drawing, are joined together in the design software. It would be very hard to make a mistake like the one in TFA today. Even the free software that I use -- KiCad -- would ding me.

Most common when you accidentally screw up a footprint and it doesn't fit the part on the BOM. A backwards part is the kind of thing they're not likely to pick up on (if it's marked on the silkscreen incorrectly, at least), but some do. reply andrew-jack 9 hours agoprevApple should be mandated to issue a recall for these motherboards. reply etrautmann 6 hours agoprevThe first board I ever designed and had manufactured had a reversed tantalum capacitor on the power rails and exploded somewhat dramatically when powered up. Lesson learned! reply mhardcastle 4 hours agoprevWhy include that capacitor at all if it doesn't matter whether it works? reply rwmj 3 hours agoparentIf you look at the traces you can see the capacitor is right next to the power connector, on the -5V rail (which is not used for much, only for the RS422 serial port). The capacitor will be there to smooth the power supply when the machine is just switched on, or there's a sudden load which causes the voltage to \"dip\" above -5V. Basically it's like a tiny rechargable battery which sits fully charged most of the time, but can supplement the power on demand. So you can see why it probably didn't matter that this capacitor didn't work: It's only needed for rare occasions. RS-422 is a differential form of RS-232 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-422) so being differential it's fairly robust against changes in load if they affect both wires. And the worst that can happen is you lose a few characters from your external modem. In addition, electrolytics can probably work when reversed like this, at least a little bit.

    "originBody": "I Didn't Need Kubernetes, and You Probably Don't Either By Ben Houston, 2024-11-05 Kubernetes often represents the ultimate solution for container orchestration, but my experience has led me to leave it behind in favor of a simpler, cost-effective solution using Google Cloud Run. This transition has made my infrastructure projects easier to manage, more scalable, and significantly cheaper. Here’s why I made this choice and how Cloud Run offers a better fit for my needs going forward. How I ended up on Kubernetes First, let's quickly look at how we ended up on Kubernetes. We has launched Clara.io (now sunset), an online 3D editor and rendering platform, in 2013. We cost optimized the platform by using bare metal machines from OVH for both its primary servers, DBs and job workers. While it worked, bare metal machines were a source of potential failures and we did have some over the years. Luckily we had a redundant setup so our users never noticed. But it was a massive amount of work to provision, monitor and maintain. So when we looked to remake the platform for Threekit.com, an enterprise focused re-imaging of Clara.io, we looked to switch to a managed compute setup. At the time in 2018, Kubernetes was just emerging as the industry solution as Azure, AWS and Docker converged on it in late 2017. Why I Left Kubernetes At first, Kubernetes seemed like the right approach for managing services at scale. But as we lived with it over the years since 2018, it became apparent that the complexity and costs were significant. Here’s a breakdown of the challenges we encountered: Cost Overruns: Kubernetes comes with substantial infrastructure costs that go beyond DevOps and management time. The high cost arises from needing to provision a bare-bones cluster with redundant management nodes. Moreover, Kubernetes’s slow autoscaling meant I had to over-provision services to ensure availability, paying for unused resources rather than scaling based on demand. Difficulty Managing Large Job Volumes: Handling a high volume of jobs on Kubernetes is tedious. Both the built-in scheduler and Argo introduced limitations and complexity, often failing to scale well under load or just being really complex. Complexity Overload: Kubernetes is feature-rich, yet these “enterprise” capabilities turned even simple tasks into protracted processes. The result was added complexity without substantial benefits, making it more of an obstacle than a solution. If you have Kubernetes, you probably need at least one dedicated Kubernetes dev-ops engineer, if not a couple. Overall, Kubernetes proved difficult to provision, expensive to maintain, and time-consuming to manage. For companies or individual projects seeking simplicity and cost-effectiveness, it may not be the right choice. But it did get rid of the need for us to keep track of whether the hardware in our machines was breaking down and our manual provision processing. Embracing Cloud Run for a Simpler Setup Google Cloud Run offers a streamlined alternative to Kubernetes. Here’s how my new setup works: The Setup My infrastructure is now centered around Docker containers, with some running as auto-scaling services and others as tasks for long-running jobs. Google Cloud Run handles container deployment, scaling, downtime management, and running/retrying jobs eliminating many of the challenges I faced with Kubernetes. Why Cloud Run Is Ideal Cost Efficiency: Cloud Run charges only for the CPU and memory used during requests, making it highly cost-effective. For example, this personal project of mine, Web3D Survey sees 500,000 hits monthly and costs just $4/month for hosting, even though it is running all the time. They key is that Cloud Run charges based on the fraction of the CPU you use per second. The ability to scale to zero also means no charges for idle services. Fast, Reliable Autoscaling: Cloud Run scales in a few seconds, unlike Kubernetes, where scaling often took minutes. This quick scaling lets me handle surges reliably without over-provisioning. No Kubernetes Management Overhead: Cloud Run, built atop Google’s Borg, avoids the need for Kubernetes cluster management, simplifying deployments and cutting costs. Simple Async Tasks: Cloud Run Tasks allows me to execute up to 10,000 tasks per job, track their results with auto-retries with no need to manage job-running infrastructure or individual machines — a refreshing alternative to the complexity running this on Kubernetes was. The Kubernetes Lock-In Trap One overlooked downside of Kubernetes is cluster lock-in. Once you start using Kubernetes-specific features, it becomes challenging to leverage resources outside the cluster. Integrating services across data centers or using dedicated resources in a colocation setup adds significant complexity. Kubernetes demands you stay within its ecosystem, effectively binding you to the infrastructure that supports it, making even simple expansions or migrations into costly, complex endeavors. Addressing Common Concerns Several questions arose from others when I shared my experience online, so here’s a deeper look into how this setup works: Orchestration: I use GitHub Actions CI to handle CI/CD, leveraging workflows with dependencies and matrix strategies for builds across multiple services which only deploy if all tests/builds are successful. Storage: Managed databases or Cloud Storage cover shared data needs, eliminating the need to manage my own disks. Inter-Service Communication: For async communication, I leverage pub-sub messaging. When direct connections are absolutely necessary, each service has a dedicated domain-name. Security: Cloud Run supports internal-only services, and for public services, I secure routes using JWT. Debunking Misconceptions “Aren’t You Afraid of Being Locked into GCP?” Switching cloud providers, such as AWS, wouldn’t be overly complex since my setup is Docker-based, and migration would take about a week. In practice, few companies switch providers unless politics are involved, as the differences between major cloud services are minimal. “Cloud Run Is Just Managed Kubernetes, Right?” Technically, Cloud Run uses Knative interfaces but runs on top of Google’s Borg, rather than Kubernetes. But it could have been implemented on top of Kubernetes and I think similar PaaS systems are implemented on Kubernetes. The key is that I am not using Kubernetes or Borg, I am using a simplified PaaS system that has an opinionated and simple interface that fits my needs. Remaining Workflow Pains There are some pains I have with my current Cloud Run development workflow: Arbitrary Management of Services Names I do find that I need to manage my service names both locally and in the server in a unified way with clear configuration. Basically an abstraction layer. I know Kubernetes has one and I do miss that. Lack of Cloud Run Task Emulation There is no solution for running Cloud Run Tasks locally that I have found. I would like it to be able to just run an arbitrary command line locally in place of a docker container in a locally emulated Cloud Run Tasks environment that captures log output, trackings runs, etc. This would simplify development of tasks without having to build and deploy docker containers. My New Stack and Workflow My infrastructure is built around a reliable stack. You can view a simplistic prototype setup and practices in this TypeScript monorepo template. Cloud Run enables me to deploy this stack efficiently, without the complexity or cost overheads Kubernetes brought. Final Thoughts For my projects, Cloud Run offers the perfect blend of cost savings, speed, scalability, and simplicity. While Kubernetes may suit some large enterprises, for agile projects where simplicity and efficiency matter, the managed environment of Cloud Run is transformative. If your infrastructure goals include reduced DevOps overhead, predictable costs, and responsive scaling, Cloud Run may be the solution you’ve been looking for. (PS. Yes, I am sure there was another library/extension I should have added to Kubernetes to enable feature X, Y or Z, but this really is just further increasing the complexity. I don't want to have to exist inside of world of Kubernetes-specific lingo and techniques if they are not giving me benefits.) This post was inspired by this discussion on Hacker News on 04/11/2025",

I have set up about a dozen rack mount servers in my life, installing basically every flavor of Unix and Linux and message busses under the sun in the process, but I still get confused by all the Kubectl commands and GCP integration with it. I might just be stupid, but it feels like all I ever do with Kubernetes is update and break YAML files, and then spend a day fixing them by copy-pasting increasingly-convoluted things on stackexchange. I cannot imagine how anyone goes to work and actually enjoys working in Kubernetes, though I guess someone must in terms of “law of large numbers”.

Admittedly, I've been using Kubernetes since the early days and I manage an Infra team that operates a couple thousand self-managed Kubernetes clusters so... expert blindness at work.

Maybe I need to write a book like \"Kubernetes for Greybeards\" or something like that. What does fucking kill me in the Kubernetes ecosystem is the amount of add-on crap that is pitched as \"necessary\". Sidecars... so many sidecars. Please stop.

It should be trivial to set up a cluster from bare metal - nothing more than a `dnf install` and some other command to configure core functionality and to join machines into that cluster. Even when you go the easy way (with, say, Docker Desktop) you need to do a lot of steps just to have an ingress router. reply zelphirkalt 1 hour agorootparentThat is actually what my \"try out for a day\" experience with Nomad was years ago. Just run the VMs, connect them, and they auto load balance. While it took a week or so to get even the most basic stuff in Kubernetes and not even have 2 hosts in a cluster yet, while having to deal with hundreds of pages of bad documentation. I think since then the documentation probably has improved. I would hope so. But I will only touch Kubernetes again, when I need to.

If you're leading a team and introduced all good practices from the start, then the k8s and Terraform or whatever config files can never get so very complicated that a Gordian knot isn't created. Perhaps k8s is nice and easy to use - many of the commands certainly are, in my experience. Developers have, over years and decades, learned how to navigate code and hop from definition to definition, climbing the tree and learning the language they're operating in, and most of the languages follow similar-enough patterns that they can crawl around. Configuring a k8s cluster has absolutely none of that knowledge built up; and, reading something that has rough practices is not a good place to learn what it should look like. reply paddy_m 8 hours agorootparentThank you. I can always xargs grep for a function name, at worst. Dir() in python at a debugger for other things. With YAML, kubernetes and other devops hotness, I frequently can’t even find the relevant scripts/YAML that are executed nor their codebases. This also happens with configuration based packaging setups. Python hatch in particular, but sometimes node/webpack/rollup/vite. reply karmarepellent 10 hours agorootparentprevAgreed. The best thing we did back when we ran k8s clusters, was moving a few stateful services to dedicated VMs and keep the clusters for stateless services (the bulk) only. Running k8s for stateless services was an absolute bliss. At that time stateful services were somewhat harder to operate on k8s because statefulness (and all that it encapsulates) was kinda full of bugs. That may certainly have changed over the last few years. Maybe we just did it wrong. In any case if you focused on the core parts of k8s that were mature back then, k8s was (and is) a good thing. reply thiht 1 hour agorootparentprev> It's not that complicated if you limit yourself to the core stuff Completely agree. I use Kubernetes (basically just Deployments and CronJobs) because it makes deployments simple, reliable and standard, for a relatively low cost (assuming that I use a managed Kubernetes like GKE where I don’t need to care at all about the Kubernetes engine). Using Kubernetes as a developer is really not that hard, and it gives you no vendor lock-in in practice (every cloud provider has a Kubernetes offer) and easy replication. It’s not the only solution, not the simplest either, but it’s a good one. And if you already know Kubernetes, it doesn’t cost much to just use it. reply figassis 12 hours agorootparentprevThis, all the sidecars.

I don't know if it was don't \"incorrectly\", and I do fear that stating as such might get into territory adjacent to the \"no true Scotsman\" fallacy. I mostly just think that k8s integration with GCP is a huge pain in the ass, every time I have to touch it it's the worst part of me day. reply fragmede 2 hours agorootparentWhat about your integration makes it a huge pita? reply tombert 2 hours agorootparentIt's just a lot of stuff; we have a couple hundred services, and when I've had to add shit, it ends up with me updating like two hundred files. Infrastructure as code is great, but lets be honest, most people are not thoroughly reading through a PR with 200+ files. There's of course tpl files to help reduce duplication, and I'm grateful for that stuff when I can get it, but for one reason or another, I can't always do that. It's also not always clear to me which YAML corresponds to which service, though I think that might be more of an issue with our individual setup. reply pas 8 hours agorootparentprevMy problem is the brittleness. Sure, I am playing with fire (k3s, bare metal, cilium, direct assigned IP to Ingresses), but a few weeks ago on one cluster suddenly something stopped working in the external IP -> internal cluster IP network path.

They should only need one single cluster (maybe also a backup and a dev one at most). That's the whole point. But then here you are saying your team \"operates a couple thousand\" clusters.

If 50 is far too many, and bound to be unmanageable, how is it reasonable to have more than a thousand? It's not unmanageable to have a couple thousand Kube clusters but you need to have the resources to build a staff and tool chain to support that, which most companies cannot do. Clusters are how we shard our customer workloads (a workload being say a dozen services and a database, a customer may have many workloads spread across the entire fleet).

It was not intuitive and it did not come naturally to you. reply torginus 9 hours agoparentprevKubernetes starts sucking at first sight and is kind of the sign of the ailment of modern times. Let me try to explain: First, you encounter the biggest impedance mismatch between cloud and on prem: Kubernetes works with pods, while AWS works with instances as the unit of useful work, so they must map to each other, right? Wrong, first each instance needs to run a Kubernetes node, which duplicates the management infrastructure hosted by AWS, and reduces the support for granularity, like if I need 4 cores for my workload, I start an instance with 4 cores, right?. Not so with k8s, you have to start up a big node, then schedule pods there. Yay, extra complexity and overhead! And it's like when you need 3 carrots for the meal your cooking, but the store only sells it in packs of 8, you have to pay for the ones you don't need, and then figure out how to utilize the waste. I'm not even going to talk about on-prem kubernetes, as I've never seen anyone IRL use it. Another thing is that the need for kubernetes is manifestation of crappy modern dev culture. If you wrote your server in node, Python and Ruby, you're running a single threaded app in the era of even laptops having 32 core CPUs. And individual instances are slow, so you're even more dependent on scaling. So, to make use of the extra CPU power, you're forced to turn to Docker/k8s and scale your infra that way, whereas if you went with something like Go, or god forbid, something as deeply uncool as ASP.NET, you could just put your 32 core server, and you get fast single threaded perf, and perfect and simple multi-threaded utilization out of the box without any of the headaches. Also I've found stuff like rolling updates to be a gimmick. Also a huge disclaimer, I don't think k8s is a fundamentally sucky or stupid thing, it's just I've never seen it used as a beneficial architectural pattern in practice. reply erinaceousjones 8 hours agorootparentBeing nitpicky about Python specifically, Python not necessarily single-threaded; gunicorn gets you a multiprocess HTTP/WSGI server if you configure it to. asyncio and gevent have made it easier to do things actually-concurrently. Judicious use of generator functions lets you stream results back instead of blocking I/O for big chunks. And we have threads. Yeah, the Global Interpreter Lock is still hanging around, it's not the fastest language, but there are ways to produce a Docker image of an API written in Python which can handle thousands of concurrent HTTP requests and actively use all available CPU cores to do intensive computation. reply zelphirkalt 1 hour agorootparentHere I thought you would bring multiprocessing and process pool in Python. reply regularfry 8 hours agorootparentprevIt really, really wants a higher-level abstraction layer over the top of it.

Then because so many people have jobs, nobody at this point wants to make an argument that perhaps using an actual PaaS might make sense. Not to mention \"the sunk cost\" of the DIY PaaS.

Professional cloud services are mostly great, but super expensive. Kubernetes is interesting, because it basically takes everything you know and sort of pushes it down the stack (or up, depending on your viewpoint). To some extend I get the impression that the idea was: Wouldn't it be great if we took all the infrastructure stuff, and just merged the whole thing into one tool, which you can configure using a completely unsuitable markup language. The answer is that \"No, that would in fact not be great\". For me the issue is that Kubernetes is overused. You can not really argue that it's not useful or has its place, but that place is much much small than the Internet wants us to believe. It's one of the few services where I feel like \"Call us\" would be an appropriate sales method. The article is correct, you probably don't need Kubernetes. It's a amazing piece of technology, but it's not for the majority of us. It is and should be viewed as a niche product. reply nixpulvis 5 hours agorootparentWhat do you think its niche is? reply mrweasel 5 hours agorootparentVery large \"single product\" services, the focus being on \"very large\". It would also be relevant in the cases where your product is made up of a large number of micro-services, though if you have more than 50 services to support your main product I'd be interested in knowing why you have that many services. There might be completely sane reasons, but it is a special case. Mostly a question of scale to me, I'd guess that the majority (80-90%) of people running Kubernetes don't have large enough scale that it makes sense to take on the extra complexity. Most Kubernetes installations I've seen runs on VMs, three for control plane and 2 - 5 for worker node and I don't think the extra layer is a good trade off for a \"better\" deployment tool. If you do use Kubernetes as a deployment tool, then I can certainly understand that. It is a reasonably well-known, and somewhat standardised interface and there's not a lot of good alternatives for VMs and bare metal. Personally I'd just much rather see better deployment tools being developed, rather than just picking Kubernetes because Helm charts are a thing. You'd also need to have a rather dynamic workload, in the sense that some of your services is need a lot of capacity at one point in time, while other need the capacity at another time. If you have constant load, then why? It's like Oracle's Exadata servers, it's a product that has its place, but the list of potential buyers isn't that long. reply jmb99 9 hours agoparentprevI have pretty much the exact same opinion, right down to “cloud shit” (I have even used that exact term at work to multiple levels of management, specifically “I’m not working on cloud shit, you know what I like working on and I’ll do pretty much anything else, but no cloud shit”). I have worked on too many projects where all you need is a 4-8 vCPU VM running nginx and some external database, but for some reasons there’s like 30 containers and 45 different repos and 10k lines of terraform, and the fastest requests take 750ms which should be nginx->SQL->return inHe didn’t believe it was possible to have this kind of performance in a “legacy monolithic” (his words) application. > I think it’s so heavily ingrained in most cloud/web developers that this is the only option that they will not even entertain the thought that it can be done another way. One thing that I need to remind myself of periodically: The amount of work that a modern 1U server can do in 2024 is astonishing. reply sgarland 5 hours agorootparentHell, the amount of work that an OLD 1U can do is absurd. I have 3x Dell R620s (circa-2012), and when equipped with NVMe drives, they match the newest RDS instances, and blow Aurora out of the water. I’ve tested this repeatedly, at multiple companies, with Postgres and MySQL. Everyone thinks Aurora must be faster because AWS is pushing it so hard; in fact, it’s quite slow. Hard to get around physics. My drives are mounted via Ceph over Infiniband, and have latency measured in microseconds. Aurora (and RDS for that matter) has to traverse much longer physical distances to talk to its drives. reply HPsquared 8 hours agorootparentprevIt's nice to think about the amount of work done by game engines, for instance. Factorio is a nice example, or anything graphics-heavy. reply jiggawatts 8 hours agorootparentprevSpeaking of Kubernetes performance: I had a need for fast scale-out for a bulk testing exercise. The gist of it was that I had to run Selenium tests with six different browsers against something like 13,000 sites in a hurry for a state government. I tried Kubernetes, because there's a distributed Selenium runner for it that can spin up different browsers in individual pods, even running Windows and Linux at the same time! Very cool. Except... Performance was woeful. It took forever to spin up the pods, but even once things had warmed up everything just ran in slow motion. Data was slow to collect (single-digit kilobits!), and I even saw a few timeout failures within the cluster. I gave up and simply provisioned a 120 vCPU / 600 GB memory cloud server with spot pricing for $2/hour and ran everything locally with scripts. I ended up scanning a decent chunk of my country's internet in 15 minutes. I was genuinely worried that I'd get put on some sort of \"list\" for \"attacking\" government sites. I even randomized the read order to avoid hammering any one site too hard. Kubernetes sounds \"fun to tinker with\", but it's actually a productivity vampire that sucks up engineer time.

Pure bare metal IME only leads to people ssh'ing to hotfix something and forgetting to deploy it. Exclusively using Docker images prevents that. Also, it makes firewall management much, much easier as you can control containers' network connectivity (including egress) each on their own, on a bare-metal setup it involves loads of work with network namespaces and fighting the OS-provided systemd unit files. reply chromanoid 8 hours agoparentprevIMO the actual experience you want is something as simple as you can do with those old-school simple PHP-based \"serverless\" web hosters. You just upload your stuff and maybe configure a database URL and that's it. Regarding AWS, function.zip Lambda + DynamoDB + S3 + SQS is basically this at \"enterprise-grade\". Now you have the in-between left, where you want enterprise-grade (availability, scaling and fault tolerance) but with a catch (like lower costs, more control, data sovereignty or things that are not as serverless as you want, e.g. search engine etc.). In these cases you will run into many trade-off decisions, that may lead you to K8s, cloud specific stacks and also simple VM ClickOps / ShellOps setups. As long as you can still be on the pet instead of cattle range of problems, K8s is not what you want. But as soon as you want cattle, reproducible throw-away online environments etc. \"just have a VM or a physical server\" will become a \"build your own private cloud solution\" that may or may not become a bad private cloud / K8s. reply stiray 12 hours agoparentprevI agree, but what pisses me the most is that today higher level abstractions (like cloud, spring boost,...) are hiding lower level functionality so well, that you are literally forced to use obnoxious amounts of time to study documentation (if you are in luck and it is well written), while everything is decorated with new naming of known concepts that was invented by people who didn't know that the concept already exists and has a name or some marketing guy figured out it will sell better with more \"cool\" name.

But in an averge business it becomes a time/money sink quite quickly. Way too many businesses cargo-cult themselves into thinking that they need FAANG-class infra, even though they haven't got the same scale or the same level of resourcing. Devs and ops people love it because they get to cosplay and also get the right words on their CV. If you're not Google-scale then, as you say, a few VMs or physical boxes are all you need for most systems. But its not sexy, so the business needs people who don't mind that. reply devjab 12 hours agoparentprevI don’t mind the cloud, but even in enterprise organisations I fail to see the value of a lot of the more complex tools. I’ve anlways worked with Azure because Denmark is basically Microsoft territory in a lot of non-tech organisations because of the synergy between pricing and IT operations staff. I’ve done bicep, terraform and both Kubernetes and the managed (I forgot what azure conteiner apps running on top of what is basically Kubernetes is called). When I can get away with it I always use the Azure CLI through bash scripts in a pipeline however and build directly into Azure App services for contained which is just so much less complicated than what you probably call “cloud shit”. The cool part about the Azure CLI and their app services is that it hasn’t really changed in the past 3 years, and they are almost one size fit any organisation. So all anyone needs to update in the YAML scripts are the variables. By contrast working with Bicep/Terraform, Jenkins and whatever else people use has been absolutely horrible, sometimes requiring full time staff just to keep it updated. I suppose it may be better now that azure co-pilot can probably auto-generate what you need. A complete waste of resources in my opinion. It used to be more expensive, but with the last price hike of 600% on azure container apps it’s usually cheaper. It’s also way more cost efficient in terms of maintaining since it’ll just work after the initial setup pipeline has run. This is the only way I have found that is easier than what it was when organisations ran their own servers. Whether it was in the basement or at some local hardware house (not exactly sure what you call the places where you rent server rack space). Well places like Digital Ocean are even easier but they aren’t used by enterprise. I’m fairly certain I’ve ever worked with an organisation that needed anything more than that since basically nothing in Denmark scales beyond what can run on a couple of servers behind a load balancer. One of the few exceptions is the tax system which sees almost 0 usage except for the couple of weeks where the entire adult population logs in in at the same time. When DevOps teams push back, I tend to remind them that StackOverflow ran on a couple of IIS servers for a while and that they don’t have even 10% of the users. Eventually the business case for Azure will push people back to renting hardware space or jumping to Hetzner and similar. But that’s a different story. reply DanielHB 10 hours agorootparentTerraform has the same problem as Kubernetes sidecars with terraform providers trying to do magic for you. If you stick to the cloud platform provider it is actually much nicer than using the CLI. Although my experience is with AWS, I find the terraform AWS provider docs better documentation than the official AWS docs for different options. If they don't answer any question I have right away they at least point me where to look for answers in the mess that is AWS docs. reply MortyWaves 8 hours agorootparentprevThis was a good read! I have similar thoughts especially about IaC vs a bash script. Definitely clear pros and cons to both, but I’m wondering how you handle infrastructure drift with imperative bash scripts? I mean hopefully no one is logging into Azure to fuck with settings but I’m sure we’ve all worked with that one team that doesn’t give a flying fuck about good practices. Or say you wish to now scale up a VM, how does your bash script deal with that? Do you copy past the old script, pass new flags to the Azure CLI, and then run that, then delete the old infrastructure somehow? I’m curious because I think I’d like to try your approach. reply devjab 3 hours agorootparentI think you’ve nailed the issues with this approach. I think the best approach to control “cowboy” behaviour is to make everything run through a service connection so that developers don’t actually need access to your azure resources. Though to be fair, I’ve never worked with a non-tech enterprise organisation where developers didn’t have at least some access into Azure directly. I also think the best way to avoid dangers in areas like networking is to make sure the responsibility for these are completely owned by IT-Operations. With VNETs and private DNS zones in places all you really need to allow is for the creation of private end points and integration to the network resources. Similarity I think it’s best practice to have things like key vaults managed by IT operations with limited developer access, but this can depend on your situation. One of the things I like about the Azure CLI is that it rarely changes. I would like to clarify that I’m mainly talking about Azure App Services and not VMs. Function apps for most things, web apps for things like APIs. As far as the script goes they are basically templates which are essentially “copy paste”. One of the things I tend to give developers in these organisations is “skeleton” projects that they can git clone. So they’ll typical also have some internal CLI scripts to automate a lot of the code generation and an azure-pipelines-resource-creation.yml plays into this. Each part of your resource creation is its own “if not exist” task. So there is a task to create a resource group. Then a task to create an app service plan and so on. It won’t scale. But it will scale enough for every organisation I’ve worked with. To be completely honest it’s something which grew out of my frustration of repeating the same tasks in different ways over the years. I don’t remember exactly but I think quite a few of the AZ CLI commands haven’t change for the past three years. It’s really the one constant across organisations, even the Azure Poetal hasn’t remained the same. reply antihero 7 hours agoparentprevI think a good compromise is building your applications in a containerised manner so that you can simply run them with docker-compose, but then if it turns out you need some heavy scale, it's merely a case of switching the underlying infrastructure. That said, my experience has been fairly different. Running microk8s on a VPS with some containers and an ingress just seems like a nice way to spin them up as pods and manage them. It really doesn't feel that complicated. Once you integrate with cloud providers and you get more complex systems, sure, it gets more complex. I much prefer the container paradigm for separating parts of apps out and managing dependencies and reproducibility. Having a bunch of raw servers with all the bullshit and drift and mutability that comes along with it feels far more like a headache to me than the abstraction of k8s or docker. If you aren't deploying stuff with GitOps/IaC in 2024 I fear for anyone that has to manage or maintain it. 100% reproducibility and declarative infrastructure are wonderful things I could never come back from. reply ozim 12 hours agoparentprevI am running VPSes at our small startup-ish company on IaaS cloud.

I think the Goldilocks zone is something right in between bare-ass VMs and FaaS. If I can restart the machine and it magically resolves the underlying hardware fault (presumably by migrating me to a new host), then I am in a happy place. Most of the other problems can be dealt with using modern tooling. I lean aggressively on things like SQLite and self-contained deployments in .NET to reduce complexity at hosting time. When you can deploy your entire solution with a single zip file you would be crazy to go for something like K8s. One other cloud thing that is useful is S3-style services. Clever use of these APIs can provide incredible horizontal scalability for a single instance solution.

Especially for experimenting when the Directors for War and Finance (the same person) say \"We don't have the budget!! We're not buying another server/more RAM/another disk/newer CPUs! Get fucked!\". The other thing about Docker specifically I like is I can 'shop' around for boilerplate templates that I can then customise without having to screw around manually building/installing them from scratch.

K8s isn’t there for 10s of millions of users. It’s there so you’re not dependent on some bespoke VM state. It also allows you to do code review on infra changes like port numbers being exposed, etc. Separately, your VM likely isn’t coming from any standard build pipeline so now a vulnerability patch is a login to the machine and an update, which hopefully leaves it in the same state as VMs created new… Oh, and assuming you don’t want to take downtime on every update, you’ll want a few replicas and load balancing across them (or active/passive HA at a minimum). Good luck representing that as reviewable code as well if you are running VMs. The people that don’t understand the value prop of infra as code orchestration systems like k8s tend to work in environments where “maintenance downtime” is acceptable and there are only one or two people that actually adjust the configurations. reply tombert 2 hours agorootparentSure, because Kubernetes is convoluted and not fun and is stupidly bureaucratic.

The fact that WGU offers a bachelors degree in Cloud Computing with focuses on AWS or Azure should be telling. [1] Containers don't bother me that much on their own. I just feel like with k8s and its ilk I end up spending so much time futzing with weird YAML and trying to remember differences between stateful sets and services and fighting with stuff because I missed the thing that mounts a disk so my app will break in three hours. [1] https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/cloud-computing-bachel... reply friendzis 9 hours agoparentprevIn my limited experience k8s is treated as some magic instead of what it is: resource virtualization platform. Sort one (or two) step above hardware virtualization platforms (e.g. esxi). The fact that vmware can migrate a running vm to a different hardware node is surely powerful feature. Do you want to pay for that with complexity? If you are one infra team serving on-prem deployments with consistent loads you provision things when new projects are started and things break. However, if infra team serves internal product teams it is nice to give certain guarantees to them and limit blast radius how they can affect other teams. This is where kubernetes sit. It's a deployment platform, where the deployable is container image instead of VM image. Slice off a namespace to an internal team and have their deployment blast radius contained within their namespace. Do you need such flexibility? I'm pretty sure that roughly 99% of all teams do not. A static set of VMs provisioned with some container orchestration system is more than enough for them. Loads and deployments are too static for it to matter. >>> But it allows seamless upgrades! Dude or dudette, if you can't properly drain your nodes and migrate sessions now, kubernetes will not save you. reply raffraffraff 11 hours agoparentprevI'm sure you can get some of the handy extras that come with a typical kubernetes deployment without the kubernetes, but overall I'll take kubernetes + cloud. Once you've got the hang of it, it's ok. I have a terraform project that deploys clusters with external-dns, external-secrets, cert-manager, metrics, monitoring stack, scalers and FluxCD. From there, pretty much everything else is done via FluxCD (workloads, dashboards, alerts). And while I detest writing helm charts (and sometimes using them, as they can get \"stuck\" in several ways) they do allow you to wrap up a lot of the kubernetes components into a single package that accepts more-or-less standardized yaml for stuff like resource limits, annotations (eg for granting and AWS role to a service) etc. And FluxCD .postBuild is extremely handy for defining environment vars to apply to more generic template yaml, so we avoid a sprawl. So much so that I am the one-man-band (Sys|Dev|Sec)Ops for our small company, and that doesn't give me panic attacks. The cloud integration part can be hairy but I have terraform patterns that, once worked out, are cookie cutter. With cloud kubernetes, I can imagine starting from scratch, taking a wrong turn and ending up in hell. But I'm exchanging one problem set for another. Having spent years managing fleets of physical and virtual servers, I'm happier and more productive now. I never need to worry about building systems or automation for doing OS build / patching, config management, application packaging and deployment, secrets management, service discovery, external DNS, load balancering, TSL certs etc. Because while those are just \"words\" now, back then each one was a huge project involving multiple people fighting over \"CentOS Vs Ubuntu\", \"Puppet Vs Ansible\", \"RPMs Vs docker containers\", \"Patching Vs swapping AMIs\". If you're using Consul and Vault, good luck - you have to integrate all of that into whatever mess you've built, and you'll likely have to write puppet code and scripts to hook it all up together. I lost a chunk of my life writing 'dockerctl' and a bunch of puppet code that deployed it so it could manage docker containers as systemd services. Then building a vault integration for that. It worked great across multiple data centers, but took considerable effort. And in the end it's a unique snowflake used by exactly one company, hardly documented and likely full of undiscovered bugs and race conditions even after all the hard work. The time it took to onboard new engineers was considerable and it took time away from an existing engineer. And we still had certificates expire in production. reply bananapub 2 hours agoparentprev> I have set up about a dozen rack mount servers in my life, yes, k8s and co are silly for trivially tiny systems like this. reply Deutschlandds 6 hours agoparentprevI find it always interesting and weird to read so dimetrical points to kubernetes. 1. Cloud for me is a lot better than what we had before: Before i had to create a ticket for our internal it department, have huge cross-charges (like 500$ for a server, instead of 50), had to wait for a few weeks and than get lectured that installing basic default tools on that suse based server would take a week and add additional cross-charges onto it. Their reasoning? Oh we do backup and upgrades... With cloud, i click a server in a Minute for less money, i upgrade it myself and have snapshots as a basic backup workflow which actually is reliable and works. Then k8s came along and let me be clear: my k8s setup is big, so its definitly worth it but tx to my experience with a bigger k8s setup, my very small ones are also working very very well. I get, out of the box, HA, network policies, snapshotting through my selected storage setup, Infrastructure as code etc. Instead of having shitty shell scripts, ansible setup and co, i only write a little bit of yaml, check it into my git system and roll it out with ansible. Absolut no brainer. And the auto healing solved real issues: Out of memroy? just restart the pod. Out of disk? Just recreate it. Logging and metrics just works out of the box thanks to the prometheus based monitoring stack. Starting with one server, yeah why not but you know you are not doing it right if you are the only one who can set it up and recover it. But if you don't have anyone with expertise, i would also not just start with k8s. If my startup is a pure application + db thingy, i would go with any app platform out there. But we have real servers because we do stuff with data and need sometimes performance, performance is expensive if you run it in the cloud. reply gizzlon 6 hours agorootparent> shitty shell scripts, ansible setup and co, i only write a little bit of yaml Why are the shell scripts shity but the yaml not? When I look at those yaml files I always throw up just a little :P Also, have you tried Cloud Run? reply Deutschlandds 5 hours agorootparentYaml is declarative, you tell k8s what you want and how it looks. For shell scripts, try proper error handling. You start doing some catch hooks, you have issues cehcking error codes of different tools, debugging is hard too. In one infra project we swtiched from shell scripts to golang just to have a lot more control/stability of our scripts. reply gizzlon 5 hours agorootparentYAML is not declarative, it's a format. Well, according to Wikipedia it's a \"data serialization language\". IMO It's also bad choice for this, and those files become unreadable and hard to work with. Agree that shell scripts are also hard to work with, especially if you did not write them yourselves. I guess it's a combo of the language features of, say bash, and that no one who writes them really know bash. I mean, at all. Including me. Declarative is nice, but also have pros and cons. And, it's of course many ways to achieve this if that's a priority. Usually, what you really want is: Low time to replicate AND no data loss if a server blows up. But this also have to extend to, say, the k8 cluster. And, again, many ways to achieve this. The article does not call for Ansible setups and shell scripts though. Cloud Run uses YAML btw. One of the things I personally don't like about it reply fragmede 12 hours agoparentprevI'll let you in on the joke. The joke is the demand for 100% availability and instant gratification. we're making services where anything less than 4 nines, which is 5 minutes month, is deemed unacceptable. three nines is 10 minutes a week. two nines is 15 minutes a day. there are some things that are important enough that you can't take a coffee break and wait for, but Kubernetes lets you push four nines of availability, no problem. Kubernetes is solving for that level of availability, but my own body doesn't have anything near that level of availability. demanding that from everything and everyone else is what pushes for Kubernetes level of complexity. reply spacebanana7 8 hours agorootparentMost outages these days are also caused by \"devops errors\" that're much more likely to happen when working with complex infrastructure stacks.

There are certainly mission critical systems where even a sliver of downtime causes real damage, like lost revenue. If you come to the conclusion that this application and everything it involves better run on k8s for availability reasons, you should probably focus on that and code your application in a k8s-friendly manner. But there are tons of applications that run on over-engineered cloud environments that may or may not involve k8s and probably cost more to operate than they must. I use some tools every day where a daily 15 min downtime would not affect my or my work in the slightest. I am not saying this would be desirable per se. Its just that a lot of people (myself included) are happy to spend an hour of their work day talking to colleagues and drinking coffee, but a 15 min downtime of some tool is seen as an absolute catastrophe. reply tombert 1 hour agorootparentprevI agree with you in theory, and maybe even in practice in some cases, but I do not feel like we have less downtime with k8s than using anything else. reply kitd 11 hours agorootparentprevAre you the only one waiting on your app if it goes down? reply PittleyDunkin 8 hours agoparentprevIsn't using VMs or servers just cloud shit in a different form?

I've been at a place where the two main applications were tightly coupled with several support systems and they all were dependent on one or more of Oracle DB, Postgres, Redis, JBoss, Tibco EMS and quite a bit more. Good luck using your development device to boot and run the test suite without containers. Before that team started putting stuff in containers they used the CI/CD environment to run the full set of tests, so they needed to do a PR, get it accepted, maybe wait for someone else's test run to finish, then watch it run, and if something blew, go back to commit, push to PR, &c. all over again. Quite the nuisance. A full test suite had a run time of about an hour too. When I left we'd pushed it to forty minutes on our dev machines. They didn't use raw Kubernetes though, they had RedHat buy-in and used OpenShift, which is a bit more sane.

Our generation has seen many things before, but at the same time the world has completely changed and it’s led to the people growing up in it to be different. You and me didn’t fully grasp CPUs anymore. Some people today don’t grasp all the details of the abstractions below K8s anymore and use it when perhaps something simpler (in architecture , not necessarily in use!) could do it better. And yet, they build wonderous things. Without editing php.ini and messing up 2 services to get one working. Do I think K8s is the end all? Certainly not, I agree it’s sometimes overkill.

Even if you are right in this instance, just brushing things off with the \"you are old\" argument will ensure that you end up in some horrible tech debt spaghetti mess in the future. Being critical of the infrastructure you deploy to is a good thing. Because for all the new things that do stick around, there are dozens of other shiny new hyped up things that end up in digital purgatory quite soon after the hype phase is over. That's not to say there isn't some truth to your statement. The older you get, the more critical you do need to be to yourself as well.

Perhaps the -hate “cloud shit\"- remark triggered me a bit. It's just such a 'drown the baby with the bathwater', curmudgeon thing to say. And, imho, it betrays age. It's like my grandfather saying, I hate all this digital stuff, \"I will never put email on my phone because with emails come viruses.\" (Literal thing my father-in-law always claims, and perhaps he's not even wrong, he just stopped using new things, hating and resisting change. He has that right of course. And to be fair with his knowledge level it's perhaps even good to not have email on his Phone. But it's getting more difficult, i.e. he refuses our national Digital ID, making his life a lot harder in the process, especially because he also resists help, too proud). It's good to recognize this in oneself though, imho. reply tombert 2 hours agorootparentI don't think it betrays age really, I just think that a lot of this stuff with AWS and Azure and GCP is overly complicated. I am not convinced anyone actually enjoys working on it. I'm pretty sure that 21 year old me would have roughly the same opinion. As I said in a sibling comment, you can genuinely get a bachelors degree in AWS or Azure [1], meaning that it's complicated enough to where someone thought it necessitated an entire college degree. By \"cloud shit\", I don't mean \"someone else hosting stuff\" (which I tried to clarify by saying \"give me a VM\" at the end). I mostly think that having four hundred YAML files to do anything just sucks the life out of engineering. It wouldn't bother me too much if these tasks were just handled by the people who run devops, but I hate that since I am a \"distributed systems engineer\" that I have to LARP as an accountant and try and remember all this annoying arbitrary bureaucratic crap.

The high cost arises from needing to provision a bare-bones cluster with redundant management nodes. That's your problem right there. You really don't want to be setting up and managing a cluster from scratch for anything less than a datacenter-scale operation. If you are already on a cloud provider just use their managed Kubernetes offering instead. It will come with a free control plane and abstract away most of the painful parts for you (like etcd, networking, load balancing, ACLs, node provisioning, kubelets, proxies). That way you just bring your own nodes/VMs and can still enjoy the deployment standardization and other powerful features without the operational burden. reply dikei 14 hours agoparentEven for on-prem scenario, I'd rather maintain a K8S control plane and let developer teams manage their own apps deployment in their own little namespace, than provisioning a bunch of new VMs each time a team need some services deployed. reply mzhaase 8 hours agorootparentThis for me is THE reason for using container management. Without containers, you end up with hundreds of VMs. Then, when the time comes that you have to upgrade to a new OS, you have to go through the dance, for every service: - set up new VMs - deploy software on new VMs - have the team responsible give their ok It takes forever, and in my experience, often never completes because some snowflake exists somewhere, or something needs a lib that doesn't exist on the new OS. VMs decouple the OS from the hardware, but you should still decouple the service from the OS. So that means containers. But then managing hundreds of containers still sucks. With container management, I just - add x new nodes to cluster - drain x old nodes and delete them reply rtpg 13 hours agorootparentprevEven as a K8s hater, this is a pretty salient point. If you are serious about minimizing ops work, you can make sure people are deploying things in very simple ways, and in that world you are looking at _very easy_ deployment strategies relative to having to wire up VMs over and over again. Just feels like lots of devs will take whatever random configs they find online and throw them over the fence, so now you just have a big tangled mess for your CRUD app. reply guitarbill 13 hours agorootparent> Just feels like lots of devs will take whatever random configs they find online Well it usually isn't a mystery. Requiring a developer team to learn k8s likely with no resources, time, or help is not a recipe for success. You might have minimised someone else's ops work, but at what cost? reply rtpg 13 hours agorootparentI am partly sympathetic to that (and am a person who does this) but I think too many devs are very nihilistic and use this as an excuse to stop thinking. Everyone in a company is busy doing stuff! There's a lot of nuance here. I think ops teams are comfortable with what I consider \"config spaghetti\". Some companies are incentivised to ship stuff that's hard to configure manually. And a lot of other dynamics are involved. But at the end of the day if a dev copy-pastes some config into a file, taking a quick look over and asking yourself \"how much of this can I actually remove?\" is a valuable skill. Really you want the ops team to be absorbing this as well, but this is where constant atomization of teams makes things worse! Extra coordination costs + a loss of a holistic view of the system means that the iteration cycles become too high. But there are plenty of things where (especially if you are the one integrating something!) you should be able to look over a thing and see, like, an if statement that will always be false for your case and just remove it. So many modern ops tools are garbage and don't accept the idea of running something on your machine, but an if statement is an if statement is an if statement. reply dikei 12 hours agorootparentprev> Just feels like lots of devs will take whatever random configs they find online and throw them over the fence, so now you just have a big tangled mess for your CRUD app. Agree. To reduce the chance a dev pull some random configs out of nowhere, we maintain a Helm template that can be used to deploy almost all of our services in a sane way, just replace the container image and ports. The deployment is probably not optimal, but further tuning can be done after the service is up and we have gathered enough metrics. We've also put all our configs in one place, since we found that devs tend to copy from existing configs in the repo before searching the internet. reply spockz 13 hours agorootparentprevI can imagine. Do you have complete automation setup around maintaining the cluster? We are now on-prem using “pet” clusters with namespace as a service automated on it. This causes all kinds of issues with different workloads with different performance characteristics and requirements. They also share ingress and egress nodes so impact on those has a large blast radius. This leads to more rules and requirements. Having dedicated and managed clusters where everyone can determine their sizing and granularity of workloads to deploy to which cluster is paradise compared to that. reply solatic 13 hours agorootparent> This causes all kinds of issues with different workloads with different performance characteristics and requirements. Most of these issues can be fixed by setting resource requests equal to limits and using integer CPU values to guarantee QoS. You should also have an interface with developers explaining which nodes in your datacenter have which characteristics, using node labels and taints, and force developers to pick specific node groups as such by specifying node affinity and tolerations, by not bringing online nodes without taints. > They also share ingress and egress nodes so impact on those has a large blast radius. This is true regardless of whether or not you use Kubernetes. reply DanielHB 10 hours agorootparentprev> than provisioning a bunch of new VMs each time a team need some services deployed. Back in the old days before cloud providers this was the only option. I started my career in early 2010s and got the tailend of this, it was not fun. I remember my IT department refusing to set up git for us (we were using SVN before) so we just asked a VM and set up a git repo in there ourselves to host our code. reply jillesvangurp 9 hours agoparentprevFor most small setups, the cost of running an empty kubernetes cluster (managed) is typically higher than setting up a db, a couple of vms and a loadbalancer, which goes a long way for running a simple service. Add some buckets, a CDN and you are pretty much good to go. If you need dedicated people just to stay on top of running your services, you have a problem that's costing you hundreds of thousands per year. There's a lot of fun and easy stuff you can do with that kind of money. This is a pattern I see with a lot of teams that get sucked into using Kubernetes, micro services, terraform, etc. Once you need a few people just to stay on top of the complexity that comes from that, you are already spending a lot. I tend to keep things simple on my own projects because any amount of time I spend on that, I'm not spending on more valuable work like adding features, fixing bugs, etc. Of course it's not black and white and there's always a trade off between over and under engineering. But a lot of teams default to over engineering simply by using Kubernetes from day one. You don't actually need to. There's nothing wrong with a monolith running on two simple vms with a load balancer in front of it. Worked fine twenty years ago and it is still perfectly valid.

In my experience it's super handy to run tests on a single-node \"cluster\", and then k3s is super simple. It takes something like 8 seconds to install k3s on a bare CI/CD instance, and then you can install your YAML and see that it works. Once you're used to it, the high-level abstractions of k8 are wonderful. I run k3s on raspberry pi's because it takes care of all sorts of stuff for you, and it's easy to port code and design patterns from the big backend service to a little home project. reply ants_everywhere 14 hours agoprevPeople talk about Kubernetes as container orchestration, but I think that's kind of backwards. Kubernetes is a tool for creating computer clusters. Hence the name \"Borg\" (Kubernetes's grandpa) referring to assimilating heterogeneous hardware into a collective entity. Containers are an implementation detail. Do you need a computer cluster? If so k8s is pretty great. If you don't care about redundancy and can get all the compute you need out of a single machine, then you may not need a cluster. Once you're using containers on a bunch of VMs in different geographical regions, then you effectively have hacked together a virtual cluster. You can get by without k8s. You just have to write a lot of glue code to manage VMs, networking, load balancing, etc on the cloud provider you use. The overhead of that is probably larger than just learning Kubernetes in the long run, but it's reasonable to take on that technical debt if you're just trying to move fast and aren't concerned about the long run. reply stickfigure 14 hours agoparentK8s doesn't help you solve your geographical region problem, because the geographical region problem is not running appserver instances in multiple regions. Almost any PaaS will do that for you out of the box, with way less fuss than k8s. The hard part is distributing your data. Less overhead than writing your own glue code, less overhead than learning Kubernetes, is just use a PaaS like Google App Engine, Amazon Elastic Beanstalk, Digital Ocean App Platform, or Heroku. You have access to the same distributed databases you would with k8s. Cloud Run is PaaS for people that like Docker.

This is the right way for web most of the time, but most places will choose k8s anyway. It’s perplexing until you come to terms with the dirty secret of resume driven development, which is that it’s not just junior engs but lots of seniors too and some management that’s all conspiring to basically defraud business owners. I think the unspoken agreement is that Hard work sucks, but easy work that helps you learn no transferable skills might be worse. The way you evaluate this tradeoff predictably depends how close you are to retirement age. Still, since engineers are often disrespected/discarded by business owners and have no job security, oaths of office, professional guilds, or fiduciary responsibility.. it’s no wonder things are pretty mercenary out there. Pipelines are as important as web these days but of course there are many options for pipelines as a service also. K8s is the obviously correct choice for teams that really must build new kinds of platforms that have many diverse kinds of components, or have lots of components with unique requirements for coupling (like say “scale this thing based on that other thing”, but where you’d have real perf penalties for leaving the k8s ecosystem to parse events or whatever). The often mentioned concern about platform lock in is going to happen to you no matter what, and switching clouds completely rarely happens anyway. If you do switch, it will be hard and time consuming no matter what. To be fair, k8s also enables brand new architectural possibilities that may or may not be beautiful. But it’s engineering, not art, and beautiful is not the same as cheap, easy, maintainable, etc. reply vrosas 13 hours agorootparentprevPaaS get such a bad rap from devs in my experience, even though they would solve so many problems.

If you need to run a cluster, you need to explore and understand the trade offs of k8s versus other approaches. Personally I run a small cluster on k3s, for internal tools, and love it.

On EKS you get to enjoy more odd limitations with your nodes than EC2 would give you on its own. You're already building on a cluster, your cloud provider's hypervisor. They'll literally build virtual compute of any size and shape for you on demand out of heterogeneous hardware and the security guarantees are much stronger than colocated containers on k8s nodes. There are quite a few steps between single server and k8s. reply p_l 4 hours agorootparentK8s was designed around deployment on premise on bare metal hardware.

Here on Hacker News I was a steady critic of both Docker and Kubernetes, going to at least 2017, but most of these posts were unpopular. I have to go back to 2019 to find one that sparked a conversation: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20371961 The stuff I posted about Kubernetes did not draw a conversation, but I was simply documenting what I was seeing: vast over-investment in devops even at tiny startups that were just getting going and could have easily dumped everything on a single server, exactly as we used to do things back in 2005. reply OtomotO 15 hours agoparentIt's just the hype moving on. Every generation has to make similar mistakes again and again. I am sure if we had the opportunity and the hype was there we would've used k8s in 2005 as well. The same thing is true for e.g. JavaScript on the frontend. I am currently migrating a project from React to HTMX. Suddenly there is no build step anymore. Some people were like: \"That's possible?\" Yes, yes it is and it turns out for that project it increases stability and makes everything less complex while adding the exact same business value. Does that mean that React is always the wrong choice? Well, yes, React sucks, but solutions like React? No! It depends on what you need, on the project! Just as a carpenter doesn't use a hammer to saw, we as a profession should strive to use the right tool for the right job. (Albeit it's less clear than for the carpenter, granted) reply sarchertech 6 hours agorootparent>Just as a carpenter doesn't use a hammer to saw, we as a profession should strive to use the right tool for the right job. (Albeit it's less clear than for the carpenter, granted) The problem is that most devs don’t view themselves as carpenters. They view themselves as hammer capenters or saw carpenters etc… It’s not entirely their fault, some of the tools are so complex that you really need to devote most of your time to 1 of them. I realize that this kind of tool specialization is sometimes required, but I that it’s overused by at the very least an order of magnitude. The vast majority of companies that are running k8s, react, kafka etc… with a team of 40+, would be better off running rails (or similar) on heroku (or similar), or a VPS, or a couple servers in the basement. Most of these companies could easily replace their enormous teams of hammer carpenters and saw carpenters with 3-4 carpenters. But devs have their own gravity. The more devs you have the faster you draw in new ones, so it’s unclear to me if a setup like the above is sustainable long term outside of very specific circumstances. But if it were simpler there wouldn’t be nearly many jobs, so I really shouldn’t complain. And it’s not like every other department isn’t also bloated. reply ajayvk 15 hours agorootparentprevAlong those lines, I am building https://github.com/claceio/clace for teams to deploy internal tools.

    "title": "Hacker in Snowflake extortions may be a U.S. soldier",
    "originLink": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/11/hacker-in-snowflake-extortions-may-be-a-u-s-soldier/",
    "originBody": "November 26, 2024 14 Comments Two men have been arrested for allegedly stealing data from and extorting dozens of companies that used the cloud data storage company Snowflake, but a third suspect — a prolific hacker known as Kiberphant0m — remains at large and continues to publicly extort victims. However, this person’s identity may not remain a secret for long: A careful review of Kiberphant0m’s daily chats across multiple cybercrime personas suggests they are a U.S. Army soldier who is or was recently stationed in South Korea. Kiberphant0m’s identities on cybercrime forums and on Telegram and Discord chat channels have been selling data stolen from customers of the cloud data storage company Snowflake. At the end of 2023, malicious hackers discovered that many companies had uploaded huge volumes of sensitive customer data to Snowflake accounts that were protected with nothing more than a username and password (no multi-factor authentication required). After scouring darknet markets for stolen Snowflake account credentials, the hackers began raiding the data storage repositories for some of the world’s largest corporations. Among those was AT&T, which disclosed in July that cybercriminals had stolen personal information, phone and text message records for roughly 110 million people. Wired.com reported in July that AT&T paid a hacker $370,000 to delete stolen phone records. On October 30, Canadian authorities arrested Alexander Moucka, a.k.a. Connor Riley Moucka of Kitchener, Ontario, on a provisional arrest warrant from the United States, which has since indicted him on 20 criminal counts connected to the Snowflake breaches. Another suspect in the Snowflake hacks, John Erin Binns, is an American who is currently incarcerated in Turkey. A surveillance photo of Connor Riley Moucka, a.k.a. “Judische” and “Waifu,” dated Oct 21, 2024, 9 days before Moucka’s arrest. This image was included in an affidavit filed by an investigator with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). Investigators say Moucka, who went by the handles Judische and Waifu, had tasked Kiberphant0m with selling data stolen from Snowflake customers who refused to pay a ransom to have their information deleted. Immediately after news broke of Moucka’s arrest, Kiberphant0m was clearly furious, and posted on the hacker community BreachForums what they claimed were the AT&T call logs for President-elect Donald J. Trump and for Vice President Kamala Harris. “In the event you do not reach out to us @ATNT all presidential government call logs will be leaked,” Kiberphant0m threatened, signing their post with multiple “#FREEWAIFU” tags. “You don’t think we don’t have plans in the event of an arrest? Think again.” On the same day, Kiberphant0m posted what they claimed was the “data schema” from the U.S. National Security Agency. “This was obtained from the ATNT Snowflake hack which is why ATNT paid an extortion,” Kiberphant0m wrote in a thread on BreachForums. “Why would ATNT pay Waifu for the data when they wouldn’t even pay an extortion for over 20M+ SSNs?” Kiberphant0m posting what he claimed was a “data schema” stolen from the NSA via AT&T. Also on Nov. 5, Kiberphant0m offered call logs stolen from Verizon’s push-to-talk (PTT) customers — mainly U.S. government agencies and emergency first responders. On Nov. 9, Kiberphant0m posted a sales thread on BreachForums offering a “SIM-swapping” service targeting Verizon PTT customers. In a SIM-swap, fraudsters use credentials that are phished or stolen from mobile phone company employees to divert a target’s phone calls and text messages to a device they control. MEET ‘BUTTHOLIO’ Kiberphant0m joined BreachForums in January 2024, but their public utterances on Discord and Telegram channels date back to at least early 2022. On their first post to BreachForums, Kiberphant0m said they could be reached at the Telegram handle @cyb3rph4nt0m. A review of @cyb3rph4nt0m shows this user has posted more than 4,200 messages since January 2024. Many of these messages were attempts to recruit people who could be hired to deploy a piece of malware that enslaved host machines in an Internet of Things (IoT) botnet. On BreachForums, Kiberphant0m has sold the source code to “Shi-Bot,” a custom Linux DDoS botnet based on the Mirai malware. Kiberphant0m had few sales threads on BreachForums prior to the Snowflake attacks becoming public in May, and many of those involved databases stolen from companies in South Korea. On June 5, 2024, a Telegram user by the name “Buttholio” joined the fraud-focused Telegram channel “Comgirl” and claimed to be Kiberphant0m. Buttholio made the claim after being taunted as a nobody by another denizen of Comgirl, referring to their @cyb3rph4nt0m account on Telegram and the Kiberphant0m user on cybercrime forums. “Type ‘kiberphant0m’ on google with the quotes,” Buttholio told another user. “I’ll wait. Go ahead. Over 50 articles. 15+ telecoms breached. I got the IMSI number to every single person that’s ever registered in Verizon, Tmobile, ATNT and Verifone.” On Sept. 17, 2023, Buttholio posted in a Discord chat room dedicated to players of the video game Escape from Tarkov. “Come to Korea, servers there is pretty much no extract camper or cheater,” Buttholio advised. In another message that same day in the gaming Discord, Buttholio told others they bought the game in the United States, but that they were playing it in Asia. “USA is where the game was purchased from, server location is actual in game servers u play on. I am a u.s. soldier so i bought it in the states but got on rotation so i have to use asian servers,” they shared. ‘REVERSESHELL’ The account @Kiberphant0m was assigned the Telegram ID number 6953392511. A review of this ID at the cyber intelligence platform Flashpoint shows that on January 4, 2024 Kibertphant0m posted to the Telegram channel “Dstat,” which is populated by cybercriminals involved in launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and selling DDoS-for-hire services [Full disclosure: Flashpoint is currently an advertiser on this website]. Immediately after Kiberphant0m logged on to the Dstat channel, another user wrote “hi buttholio,” to which Kiberphant0m replied with an affirmative greeting “wsg,” or “what’s good.” On Nov. 1, Dstat’s website dstat[.]cc was seized as part of “Operation PowerOFF,” an international law enforcement action against DDoS services. Flashpoint’s data shows that @kiberphant0m told a fellow member of Dstat on April 10, 2024 that their alternate Telegram username was “@reverseshell,” and did the same two weeks later in the Telegram chat The Jacuzzi. The Telegram ID for this account is 5408575119. Way back on Nov. 15, 2022, @reverseshell told a fellow member of a Telegram channel called Cecilio Chat that they were a soldier in the U.S. Army. This user also shared the following image of someone pictured waist-down in military fatigues, with a camouflaged backpack at their feet: Kiberphant0m’s apparent alias ReverseShell posted this image on a Telegram channel Cecilio Chat, on Nov. 15, 2022. Image: Flashpoint. In September 2022, Reverseshell was embroiled in an argument with another member who had threatened to launch a DDoS attack against Reverseshell’s Internet address. After the promised attack materialized, Reverseshell responded, “Yall just hit military base contracted wifi.” In a chat from October 2022, Reverseshell was bragging about the speed of the servers they were using, and in reply to another member’s question said that they were accessing the Internet via South Korea Telecom. Telegram chat logs archived by Flashpoint show that on Aug. 23, 2022, Reverseshell bragged they’d been using automated tools to find valid logins for Internet servers that they resold to others. “I’ve hit US gov servers with default creds,” Reverseshell wrote, referring to systems with easy-to-guess usernames and/or passwords. “Telecom control servers, machinery shops, Russian ISP servers, etc. I sold a few big companies for like $2-3k a piece. You can sell the access when you get a big SSH into corporation.” On July 29, 2023, Reverseshell posted a screenshot of a login page for a major U.S. defense contractor, claiming they had an aerospace company’s credentials to sell. PROMAN AND VARS_SECC Flashpoint finds the Telegram ID 5408575119 has used several aliases since 2022, including Reverseshell and Proman557. A search on the username Proman557 at the cyber intelligence platform Intel 471 shows that a hacker by the name “Proman554” registered on Hackforums in September 2022, and in messages to other users Proman554 said they can be reached at the Telegram account Buttholio. Intel 471 also finds the Proman557 moniker is one of many used by a person on the Russian-language hacking forum Exploit in 2022 who sold a variety of Linux-based botnet malware. Proman557 was eventually banned — allegedly for scamming a fellow member out of $350 — and the Exploit moderator warned forum users that Proman557 had previously registered under several other nicknames, including an account called “Vars_Secc.” Vars_Secc’s thousands of comments on Telegram over two years show this user divided their time between online gaming, maintaining a DDoS botnet, and promoting the sale or renting of their botnets to other users. “I use ddos for many things not just to be a skid,” Vars_Secc pronounced. “Why do you think I haven’t sold my net?” They then proceeded to list the most useful qualities of their botnet: -I use it to hit off servers that ban me or piss me off -I used to ddos certain games to get my items back since the data reverts to when u joined -I use it for server side desync RCE vulnerabilities -I use it to sometimes ransom -I use it when bored as a source of entertainment Flashpoint shows that in June 2023, Vars_Secc responded to taunting from a fellow member in the Telegram channel SecHub who had threatened to reveal their personal details to the federal government for a reward. “Man I’ve been doing this shit for 4 years,” Vars_Secc replied nonchalantly. “I highly doubt the government is going to pay millions of dollars for data on some random dude operating a pointless ddos botnet and finding a few vulnerabilities here and there.” For several months in 2023, Vars_Secc also was an active member of the Russian-language crime forum XSS, where they sold access to a U.S. government server for $2,000. However, Vars_Secc would be banned from XSS after attempting to sell access to the Russian telecommunications giant Rostelecom. [In this, Vars_Secc violated the Number One Rule for operating on a Russia-based crime forum: Never offer to hack or sell data stolen from Russian entities or citizens]. On June 20, 2023, Vars_Secc posted a sales thread on the cybercrime forum Ramp 2.0 titled, “Selling US Gov Financial Access.” “Server within the network, possible to pivot,” Vars_Secc’s sparse sales post read. “Has 3-5 subroutes connected to it. Price $1,250. Telegram: Vars_Secc.” Vars_Secc also used Ramp in June 2023 to sell access to a “Vietnam government Internet Network Information Center.” “Selling access server allocated within the network,” Vars_Secc wrote. “Has some data on it. $500.” BUG BOUNTIES The Vars_Secc identity claimed on Telegram in May 2023 that they made money by submitting reports about software flaws to HackerOne, a company that helps technology firms field reports about security vulnerabilities in their products and services. Specifically, Vars_Secc said they had earned financial rewards or “bug bounties” from reddit.com, the U.S. Department of Defense, and Coinbase, among 30 others. “I make money off bug bounties, it’s quite simple,” Vars_Secc said when asked what they do for a living. “That’s why I have over 30 bug bounty reports on HackerOne.” A month before that, Vars_Secc said they’d found a vulnerability in reddit.com. “I poisoned Reddit’s cache,” they explained. “I’m going to exploit it further, then report it to reddit.” KrebsOnSecurity sought comment from HackerOne, which said it would investigate the claims. This story will be updated if they respond. The Vars_Secc telegram handle also has claimed ownership of the BreachForums member “Boxfan,” and Intel 471 shows Boxfan’s early posts on the forum had the Vars_Secc Telegram account in their signature. In their most recent post to BreachForums in January 2024, Boxfan disclosed a security vulnerability they found in Naver, the most popular search engine in South Korea (according to statista.com). Boxfan’s comments suggest they have strong negative feelings about South Korean culture. “Have fun exploiting this vulnerability,” Boxfan wrote on BreachForums, after pasting a long string of computer code intended to demonstrate the flaw. “Fuck you South Korea and your discriminatory views. Nobody likes ur shit kpop you evil fucks. Whoever can dump this DB [database] congrats. I don’t feel like doing it so I’ll post it to the forum.” The many identities tied to Kiberphant0m strongly suggest they are or until recently were a U.S. Army soldier stationed in South Korea. Kiberphant0m’s alter egos never mentioned their military rank, regiment, or specialization. However, it is likely that Kiberphant0m’s facility with computers and networking was noticed by the Army. According to the U.S. Army’s website, the bulk of its forces in South Korea reside within the Eighth Army, which has a dedicated cyber operations unit focused on defending against cyber threats. On April 1, 2023, Vars_Secc posted to a public Telegram chat channel a screenshot of the National Security Agency’s website. The image indicated the visitor had just applied for some type of job at the NSA. A screenshot posted by Vars_Secc on Telegram on April 1, 2023, suggesting they just applied for a job at the National Security Agency. The NSA has not yet responded to requests for comment. Reached via Telegram, Kiberphant0m acknowledged that KrebsOnSecurity managed to unearth their old handles. “I see you found the IP behind it no way,” Kiberphant0m replied. “I see you managed to find my old aliases LOL.” Kiberphant0m denied being in the U.S. Army or ever being in South Korea, and said all of that was a lengthy ruse designed to create a fictitious persona. “Epic opsec troll,” they claimed. Asked if they were at all concerned about getting busted, Kiberphant0m called that an impossibility. “I literally can’t get caught,” Kiberphant0m said, declining an invitation to explain why. “I don’t even live in the USA Mr. Krebs.” Below is a mind map that hopefully helps illustrate some of the connections between and among Kiberphant0m’s apparent alter egos. A mind map of the connections between and among the identities apparently used by Kiberphant0m. Click to enlarge. KrebsOnSecurity would like to extend a special note of thanks to the New York City based security intelligence firm Unit 221B for their assistance in helping to piece together key elements of Kiberphant0m’s different identities.

I generally agree with the quip about American patriot actors, mostly. reply lupusreal 4 hours agorootparentprevIf your company just got pwned, you'll probably be thankful to have an excuse to tell your investors that it was a Russian/etc \"state actor\" and therefore they should feel sympathy for you being the victim of a foe that far outclasses your assuredly reasonable and competent security measures. Looks a lot better than getting pwned by some jackass American teenager. So if the attack came from a Russian IP, or used some Cyrillic characters or something like that, there's a \"face saving\" incentive to take that probable misdirection at face value. reply pphysch 1 hour agorootparentThis is right. So many incentives are stacked in favor of making false attributions, specifically to enemy state actors: - real attacker doesn't want to get caught - victim doesn't want to admit being pwned by a script kiddy or petty criminal - military-industrial complex needs foreign threat inflation to stay in business - media loves the intrigue The pushback would come from the foreign state being falsely slandered, but they never get a say anyways. reply close04 4 hours agorootparentprev> False attribution is a core lesson in malice 101 I was always surprised to see security researchers confidently attributing some attack to a specific group based on easily falsifiable things like localization, alphabet, time zone, coding \"style\", specific targets, etc. Even if researchers can undeniably link one attack to a certain group (like when they publicly take responsibility) and can label their style accordingly, all those indicators become at least semi-public. If the researchers have access to them, so do other other actors who are free to fake or imitate them. The confidence is probably more for the media reporting. reply rightbyte 9 hours agorootparentprevDoubly so since warmongerers will defend your persona and corparations will use the persona as a politically palatable scapegoat. reply ykonstant 11 hours agorootparentprevSpot on, chap. reply boohoo123 4 hours agorootparentprevyea but 2 years prior he used the handle cyberphantom.

Reading this guy's posts, his ego is the biggest issue, and it will be his downfall. The \"I literally can't get caught\" mentality inevitably leads to carelessness and blabbermouthing. reply kortilla 9 hours agorootparentThat’s a little different. It wasn’t that Capone couldn’t handle taxes, it was that until that point nobody used it as a serious mechanism to take town criminals. It was only validated as a good approach by the Supreme Court a few years before. In fact, one of the primary pieces of evidence of his tax evasion were from communications from his lawyer about how much tax to pay to make his tax history legit in light of the recent effectiveness of tax convictions. Now major criminals launder money to avoid that. reply duxup 16 hours agoparentprevI feel like leaving a bunch of misdirection would also risk potentially just leave real traces behind that in some ways. At least in my mind leaving some false trails behind, when I run through scenarios, seems like it could leave actual trails / to the point of not being worth the extra risk. reply brookst 13 hours agorootparentYeah. If you have a choice of giving an adversary no information or false information, no information seems safer. The choice of false information is information. Same way that people are terrible at picking random numbers and fraudsters are often caught because they avoid round numbers. reply antihero 7 hours agorootparentIt would make sense if doing something illegal to do the former, but also leave \"slip ups\" that are complete red herrings, create trails to people that seem like opsec fails but are actually just framing others, etc. All about plausible deniability. Layers and layers and layers of dead ends that seem real. In this way, if you do actually slip up, it becomes near impossible to distinguish the real slip-ups with the orchestrated ones. reply brookst 5 hours agorootparentThe problem is that false “slip ups” provide information. Sure, you waste investigator’s time, but once they rule out the false lead they have a bunch of information: - if the false slip-up used only public information about, you likely don’t have access to confidential information about that space. If it used confidential information, you do. - The geography and demographics of the false lead are probably not near-misses. The point of misdirection is to misdirect, so you likely won’t frame a coworker that will bring investigators to your own door. - Any mistakes in the false slip-up, from spelling to factual to timing, may reveal info. IMO this is a “too clever by half” scenario: leaving any trace at all is information. Leaving none is wiser. Example: you’re a master hacker. You’re going to repeatedly access a compromised system. Is it better to set an alarm for 3am each time to suggest you’re in a different time zone, or to use a RNG to close an alarm time? I say the RNG is better. Using 3am gives psychographics. Random isn’t clear if there’s any planning at all, or if you travel, etc. reply hn_user82179 11 hours agoprevwhat a great article, I loved seeing the links that Krebs (?)/Unit 221B (?) dug up and all the info they managed to connect.

Having worked with LLMs over the past year+ trying to get them to do useful things in various contexts, the real work is typically pretty boring data acquisition (e.g. scraping) + ETL and then making that data available to the LLM. reply jamestimmins 10 hours agorootparentprevI think this whenever I read a modern detective novel (Bosch). So much of their work seems to be looking up data from different databases and trying to make connections or recognize patterns.

I think that's the key right there! ;-) reply brookst 13 hours agorootparentprevTo turn it around: what percentage of people are capable of perfect opsec forever? reply flextheruler 5 hours agorootparentFor internet crimes? Almost none in perpetuity. I’d think you’d need to go off the grid totally for a few years and come back without any reference to a prior life. For physical crime, my gut says quite a few people have avoided identification for decades until they were essentially caught by turning themselves in. Ted Kaczynski comes to mind, but there must be a few others. Perfect OPSEC to me, means near total isolation from socialization. Not something most people are capable of. If you’re a professional criminal of any kind you weigh the risks knowing that perfection is impossible. The government is a business with a monopoly on violence. The goal is to keep their ROI for catching you as low as possible. Every single man hour spent finding you is costing money and there’s a man upstairs who wants to see some results that reflect the money spent. Once you understand that premise, it’s easy to understand the why and how criminals are caught. The ones who are caught are always the ones who don’t know when to fold. Always the ones not to cash in and retire. The ones who get away with it, they fold they retire and society forgets about them and the ROI drops precipitously on catching them.

    "commentBody": "ZetaOffice: LibreOffice in the Browser (zetaoffice.net)262 points by marcodiego 22 hours agohidepastfavorite114 comments chrismorgan 14 hours agoI just tried the demo on my very capable laptop (ASUS Zephyrus G15 2021, Linux, Sway; Firefox, also tried Chromium). Performance is execrable. Text rendering is awful. Input is simply broken (e.g. my Compose key just doesn’t work). Double clicking highlighted the entire canvas thing, as well as the word under the cursor. Right clicking did nothing. Scrolling isn’t captured. The first menu thing I happened to try in the full-UI https://zetaoffice.net/demos/simple-examples/rainbow_writer.... example (Format → Theme, maybe I just picked unfortunately) crashed the whole app (which means that it just stops working mysteriously, leaving the UI in the last state it was in). And you can’t even get started until it’s downloaded 50MB. (Though I’m actually mildly impressed it’s only that size.) Seriously, this is completely unusable. It’s “cool tech demo”, but I would hate to actually have to use it. And I’m pretty sure, based on my rather accurate understanding of how all these things work (comprehensive on the web side, good on the native side, not so much specific about LibreOffice itself), that a lot of this is going to be completely unfixable—though a couple of the things I identified are fairly straightforward to fix, which is if anything a further indictment. It’s going to be extremely hard to get even decent results without targeting real DOM instead of going pure-canvas, and you can’t get excellent results without doing so. reply thorstenb 2 hours agoparent> It’s going to be extremely hard to get even decent results without targeting real DOM instead of going pure-canvas, and you can’t get excellent results without doing so. One of the ZetaOffice (and LibreOffice) hackers here - and I have to disagree. For something like an office suite, the canvas is literally the only way to achieve the document layout fidelity that users expect. The DOM does not provide enough knobs & dials to get all of MSO (and OOo) bug-for-bug layout compatibility onto the screen (and it's not even close). Don't take my word for it, see e.g. here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42100660 (and that only deals with the text layout parts). reply peutetre 14 hours agoparentprev> It’s going to be extremely hard to get even decent results without targeting real DOM instead of going pure-canvas, and you can’t get excellent results without doing so.

Or because the DOM is a piece of technology designed for rendering documents and not web apps and with limitations which has been severely gimping proper rendering of web apps for the past decade despite a slew of libraries trying to fill the cracks with various amount of success. Whichever you prefer. reply solarkraft 4 hours agorootparent> Or because the DOM is a piece of technology designed for rendering documents and not web apps IDK, it seems to have been pretty successful at it to me, being of the most popular GUI frameworks currently, probably the most popular by a wide margin. Being designed for documents it should exceed at rendering documents. The problem isn’t on the DOM itself, it’s in mapping other frameworks to it. Of course it‘d be hard to port LibreOffice‘s rendering to the web, it‘d be a crazy amount of work to reach parity. And it’s fine to argue that it doesn’t make sense at all to use the DOM for non-web document editing: OnlyOffice doesn’t do it either, as far as I’m aware.

In the case of Google Docs kt might be because it is really convenient to use canvas because then it gets much harder for clients to do things Google don't like, i.e. interoperability.

A class Rectangle can be pretty much whatever you want. reply CharlieDigital 3 hours agorootparent> A class Rectangle can be pretty much whatever you want In what way can an `HTMLDivElement` not emulate a `class Rectangle`? - Both are rectilinear - Both have width, height - Both can have borders, backgrounds - Both can be positioned in various grid/layout systems - Both can contain child instances - Both can contain a variety of child nodes like `Text` - Both can be clipped and masked - Both can be layered What can you do with a `class Rectangle` from a GUI perspective that you can't do with an `HTMLDivElement`? reply RandomThoughts3 2 hours agorootparentA class Rectangle can be whatever you want. You can overload it. You can change everything including how it’s rendered. It doesn’t have to be any of the things you list. A div element is a node in a tree which will be rendered by your browser in the way specified by the spec. You absolutely can’t freely do most of the actions you list to a div. There are severe limitations. A div doesn’t at all emulate a class.

When you draw to canvas you get more consistent results because you control all the drawing.

If you want to do precise publication layout, Word (and Writer) are not the appropriate tools - you'll need something like InDesign. reply jfengel 4 hours agorootparentprevFor the vast majority of what I do, a toy is all I need. This is the nasty catch-22. It is preferable to have a single tool that handles both simple and complex cases. But sometimes, you just can't make one tool that does both well. If you optimize for the hard cases, then most users will use only a tiny minority of the features. Microsoft tried to work around that with the \"ribbon\", which tried to learn which features each individual uses. Users hated it. So I keep around LibreOffice for the hard stuff, which I write perhaps once a year. And I use Google Docs every day. reply peutetre 7 hours agorootparentprev> Google Docs' Writer (or whatever they call it) is a terrible child's toy It's a toy that's making Google a lot of money. reply chrismorgan 13 hours agorootparentprevGoogle Docs isn’t pure-canvas: they only switched their document area to use it for layout. Text rendering is still browser (necessary to keep performance even close), and all the rest of the UI is still DOM. Having thought extensively about it, I cannot come up with any advantage to the approach they’ve taken—neither the performance¹ nor the consistency² angles make any sense, and the product is actively worse because of it³. I’ve written more about it on HN at times, skim https://hn.algolia.com/?query=chrismorgan%20google%20docs&ty... for more. Seriously, having thought about it very carefully and reviewed the matter several times over the years, I honestly believe that they lied in their justifications. Flutter… ugh, Flutter on the web is awful awful awful awful awful AWFUL AWFUL and I will hate you if you decide with open eyes to use it when you’re deliberately targeting the web.⁴ I lack energy to express my vitriolic loathing. Just go through https://hn.algolia.com/?query=chrismorgan%20flutter&type=com..., there’s lots of detailed explanation of specifically what’s bad, if you need it. Avalonia Visual Basic 6? It’s the kind of thing where the limitations will show least, because of how limited it is. And also because it’s imitating (not quite the right word, but close enough) ancient software which itself wouldn’t work fully properly if run on current machines. Its text handling is dodgy, doesn’t do composition properly, scrolling is non-native, context menus are non-native which stops some things from working properly… but honestly that’s kinda the vibe they’re going for, so it’s not particularly upsetting. Pure-canvas is irredeemably bad. With difficulty you can make some things decent even with it, but excellence is impossible with pure canvas. Flutter and Google Docs did not give up on DOM for the reasons you cite. Google Docs, I honestly don’t understand why they gave up on DOM, the reasons they cited publicly genuinely don’t make sense. Flutter, it was because they don’t actually care about the web, it’s a third-class target, and too much of the way they design their API doesn’t port to DOM directly, so that making DOM a first-class citizen would have required compromises in their APIs that they were unwilling to make. But it was emphatically not about cross-browser consistency. —⁂— ¹ Seriously, Google Docs is slower than it used to be, especially with higher latency and jitter. ² The parts they replaced had no consistency problems in any realistic browsers. Seriously. Their layout requirements are, in practice, really basic. The area where consistency can actually be a problem is text shaping and rendering, but they haven’t replaced that since it would tank performance. ³ My favourite example is keyboard navigation. It doesn’t match platform conventions, and that’s really irritating. Since we’re in this thread, LibreOffice also flouts platform conventions in this area, and it’s really irritating. ⁴ If you’re focusing on mobile and make a mobile app with Flutter and also put it on the web with Flutter because why not, better than nothing, I won’t like you very much, but I’ll at least understand. But if you’re saying “we need a web thing, how about we use Flutter”… no. reply peutetre 13 hours agorootparent> But if you’re saying “we need a web thing, how about we use Flutter”… no. If you're making an application, there's really nothing special about the DOM. You might as well control your drawing. That way you don't need to figure out cross browser incompatibilities all day. And here's what someone who used to work on Google Docs has to say about it: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27133929 reply chrismorgan 13 hours agorootparentPlease look over my comments on HN about Flutter and pure-canvas and such. There are big problems. There is plenty special about the DOM that you lose and cannot gain back if you go pure-canvas. Links. Scrolling. Text handling. Composition. And various more. Use DOM. Please use DOM. Use canvas for an actual drawing canvas, but for the UI and anything else that’s largely text, use DOM. reply peutetre 13 hours agorootparentThere aren't \"big problems\" because it works. When you put yourself in the corner of claiming \"pure-canvas is irredeemably bad\" when it's plainly not, then there's nothing practical on offer. reply chrismorgan 12 hours agorootparent“It works” is a terrible defence, because of the different degrees of working. I’m describing various specific ways in which it doesn’t work properly, in ways that stop users from doing things they may legitimately want to do, or which will frustrate some users, and you’re just disregarding them. I’m not being vague in most of my complaints, I’m being very specific. It’s like you have a screw, and it’s worn enough that sometimes it makes the screwdriver slip, but you’re saying “just be careful, maybe apply a little more pressure, and it still works”. reply peutetre 7 hours agorootparent> and you’re just disregarding them. Of course. You're living in a world of your own imagined requirements. The practical reality is that there are plenty of use cases for this stuff, whether you like it or not.

At this point I’m 90% convinced that you’re just trolling. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42252999 You can’t select text in neither of your provided samples on both PC and mobile in different browsers. reply peutetre 6 hours agorootparentYou can. Text selection works, cut and copy and paste works, zooming works. I don't know what you're doing. reply erinaceousjones 1 hour agorootparentWhat about screen readers and mobile users? There's all these useful accessibility tools that would also have to be reinvented for canvas based apps. Text selection and getting it to bring up a keyboard is iffy on the canvas-based things you linked to (I'm looking at them on Firefox for Android on a Pixel 6). Sure, the VB one is a desktop app. But the original (non canvas) version of that app likely worked with windows screen readers, and that is lost in this reincarnation onto the web. Good old fashioned DOM already has pretty good native accessibility support for mobile phone UI. There's a lot of things that have been thought about when it comes to usability and accessibility, in both the web, and traditional desktop/mobile UI frameworks. Reimplementing those UI frameworks in canvas in a browser environment requires mapping the a11y bits too, not just keyboard+mouse input and rendering to screen. Not to mention Qt and Gtk and the older Android framework apps all use forms of markup and styling which are inspired by XHTML and CSS and document object models...... reply wiseowise 2 hours agorootparentprevWhich browser/OS? reply yunyu 4 hours agoparentprevOn the flip side, this is extremely fast and works pretty well on my M1 Pro Macbook running Chrome. The only downside is that it's a little blurry (as it's rendering at 1x pixel scale). reply samiv 5 hours agoparentprev\"Release early, release often\", isn't that the often touted wisdom? Of course that has the problem is that you can make the \"first impression\" only once and when that said \"first impression\" is terrible it can be really hard to convince anyone to try the software again for the second time. I guess releasing, almost like everything else, is a balancing game between two early or too late and both extremes have costs. reply giamma 10 hours agoparentprevOnlyOffice has decent performance and is pure canvas. However, they have (or had) issues with respect to accessibility, as screen readers don't read canvas. reply tjoff 12 hours agoparentprevBarely worse than Teams or your typical web app. Needs polish for sure but the bar for web apps aren't exactly high. Canvas usually breaks text selections etc. and accessibility. But what they do seem to perform much better than trying to get the DOM to do something it wasn't designed for. reply zelphirkalt 7 hours agorootparentMS Teams is among the worst pieces of software, that people have to deal with on a daily basis, because it gets shoved down their throat at their jobs. If something is even worse than that, even if \"barely\", then it is a complete disaster. A little \"polish\" will not be able to make it right. reply chrismorgan 11 hours agorootparentprevWhen you delve into badly-performing web apps, DOM is almost never the actual performance bottleneck. It’s other things they’re doing. And in the rare cases where DOM is the bottleneck, it’s always that they were abusing it. As for this case, I have never encountered a web app with performance (throughput and latency) problems like this. Not anywhere near it. reply tjoff 33 minutes agorootparentSimilarly I don't think canvas is the bottleneck here. Oh, and abuse is the name of the game.

For quick edits I can see the appeal, however. > Installing a separate app may not be possible for aging parents, people using shared computers (e.g., library or school computer), or organizations with restricted IT systems This seems like a non-issue, too. If my grandma were to use the PC, I would be the one installing programs (or the OS) on it, and if I knew she wanted to open and edit documents, I would install LibreOffice. It is one of the programs I install on my parent's computer. You (or the IT staff) ensure tools are available; you install LibreOffice, similarly to how you would install a browser to begin with. For example IT staff are already responsible for installing and maintaining browsers. Adding productivity software to their responsibilities is a standard practice in professional environments. Browser-based tools are a complement, not a replacement, and the push toward browser dependence should consider the trade-offs in performance, user experience and so forth. Using browsers for productivity tools may feel more convenient in very specific edge cases, but for most users and workplaces, the effort involved in installing and using native applications is negligible in comparison. (I remember the old days when I used https://gobby.github.io with my friend to edit code together. It is a native program for editing documents (incl. code) together. Today you would probably use an extension to VS Code unless it supports it natively (no clue).)

Humanity really does need an online self-hosted office suite that natively uses OpenDocument format, but I'm afraid that to achieve that it'll be easier to start from scratch with browser version as a first platform in mind. reply homebrewer 3 hours agoparentCollabora office uses a custom web ui for controls, dialogs, etc. The document body is rendered by the server and streamed in raster tiles over a web socket. https://sdk.collaboraonline.com/docs/architecture.html reply fguerraz 32 minutes agoparentprevCollabora is perfectly fine, what’s your gripe with it? reply alwayslikethis 3 hours agoparentprevMaybe Etherpad? https://etherpad.org/ reply velcrovan 1 hour agoprevPerfect, this gives me a great idea for an April 1 company-wide announcement next year. reply karencarits 18 hours agoprevI can remember testing libre office in the browser many years ago, seems like that project was frozen in 2020 as others external projects emerged.

Note: \"LibreOffice Online is not intended as a standalone software. His goal is, instead, to be integrated with other tools to edit their documents.\" ... while Zeta and Collabora are standalone. reply chris_wot 15 hours agorootparentIt wasn't frozen, Collabora were the ones doing the work and so they have largely hosted and developed LibreOffice Online. reply gbraad 4 hours agorootparent(same thought here; just didn't want to sound harsh) The idea of LOOL (LibreOffice OnLine) is to be an embeddable component; we have used it before on a Moodle site. And this is the same for COOL (Collabora Office OnLine), which is used by Nextcloud Office (as components called COOLWSD, and LOKit). reply Animats 12 hours agoprevThat animated ad is a total turn-off. I've used LibreOffice/OpenOffice/StarOffice for two decades now. It's OK, not great. At least it interoperates with Microsoft desktop formats now. Mostly. reply tpoacher 10 hours agoparentLO is contantly updated and improved. The 2 decades observation isn't really useful. Would you compare today's MSO experience to MSO2000 on Windows Millenium? I use LO exclusively and it's a joy to use. On the rare instances I'm forced to use MSO it feels only marginally better than google docs. YMMV And, strictly speaking, the reason things break sometimes when switching from LO to MSO is because MSO is broken: LO follows the spec (both .odt and .docx) faithfully, which then breaks when MSO relies on undocumented features or outright bugs for the end-result (i.e. the \"works best on Internet Explorer\" legacy). reply squarefoot 7 hours agorootparent> I use LO exclusively and it's a joy to use. Same here and at several other people who asked me for alternatives over the years. I installed LO (formerly also OO) both on Linux and Windows and they became productive almost immediately. However when I install it on other people PCs I always set the default save formats as Word/Excel/Powerpoint 97-2003 so that nobody will complain when they send files to other people who presumably will be running mostly MS Office. reply gbraad 17 hours agoprevhow is this different from http://www.collaboraoffice.com/ ? Collabora works on mobile devices and integrates with Nextcloud note: they use WASM, so the load is on the client. Collabora relies on a server part, though easy to host. reply mstngl 11 hours agoprevI would love to have something like this in order to provide the office features for documents hosted in nextcloud directly. Yes, there is Nextcloud Office/Collabora Office but this needs separate provider and is not included in hosted Nextcloud (e.g. at Hetzner). The ease of OneDrive + MS365 in comparison is quite attracting. For my current use (sharing documents in a team of 50 - non-commercial but somehow professional approach) the latter is still the tool of choice. Being able to share a link, which allows others to directly edit presentations and spreadsheets in a browser (while the files are available in a local file structure) is just great. reply ptman 10 hours agoprevCryptpad, which includes a bundled copy of onlyoffice, works quite nicely. reply greenavocado 4 hours agoprevThe font rendering/kearning makes my eyes bleed reply karel-3d 4 hours agoprevIsn't there the Collabora stuff that's actually optimized for browser?

What is it? reply wmf 19 hours agoprevHow does this work? Is it WASM-based or what? reply thorstenb 18 hours agoparentYup, and it's all fully upstreamed in LibreOffice, see our blog (https://blog.allotropia.de/category/libreoffice/), and the upstream wiki page: https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/WASM For an even more obvious demo of that, c.f. the hidden gem https://zetaoffice.net/demos/simple-examples/rainbow_writer.... ;) Current source version powering the demos is https://git.libreoffice.org/core/+/0d9eb8245e1a1345ed9526ad8... - we should make that more prominent, indeed. reply bigbones 18 hours agorootparentIt sounds like you might know the answer to this. Would it be straightforward to use this for sandboxed headless file conversion? You can do that already with LibreOffice, but it's a monster amount of unsafe code that's difficult to containerize securely reply thorstenb 18 hours agorootparentIndeed can be done, proof of concept shown in this talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8LwaDjcr7M Regarding sandboxing - everything WebAssembly is heavily sandboxed already, and requires cross-origin isolation in the browser, so we can use SharedArrayBuffers. So that's likely no worse than running LibreOffice containerized on a server. reply bigbones 18 hours agorootparentOh whoa a 5 minute video for exactly this :) Apologies for making you be my Google. Yep, everything in wasm makes things much easier to work with, especially if you want to run it on a client device reply e1g 15 hours agorootparentprevI just containerized LibreOffice to do docx->pdf conversation, but now I'm wondering - what parts seem particularly gnarly to you? My naive strategy is to mount an external volume to put/collect files, then call `soffice` inside the container to process them. We generate all source docx files so I'm not worried about an injection from that angle. reply benatkin 19 hours agoparentprevIt runs on ProseMirror and AG Grid. Joke aside, the source code isn't featured on the web page, despite LibreOffice (unlike Apache OpenOffice) being copylefted. They mention self hosting, but it says to contact them. It seems it runs on WebAssembly either directly or through a VM on top of WebAssembly like https://copy.sh/v86/ . The screen seems to be simulated with a canvas. I think perhaps they didn't change the code of LibreOffice much, but have a custom setup of something like https://copy.sh/v86/ or even are running it on actual WebAssembly with a virtual screen. So they have a virtual computer that it's running on, and they consider that separate when it comes to copyleft obligations. Plus it's possible to make something open source but inconvenient, and charge to make it convenient. reply hoistbypetard 19 hours agorootparentFrom the description here[1], it sounds like they're using WASM builds of LO. I'm not quite interested enough to spend the CPU cycles it'd take to build and see whether that is really the whole story. [1](https://github.com/allotropia/zetajs?tab=readme-ov-file) reply benatkin 18 hours agorootparentThat's nice. AFAICT nobody has yet figured out how to run the rust compiler in WebAssembly directly, but it runs in v86. That's why I wondered if they were taking that shortcut for another complex program. Here's their page about WASM: https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/WASM It says it uses Qt/VCL. Maybe those can talk to canvas in a fairly straightforward way, or maybe ZetaOffice chose a different backend to get a proof of concept out faster. reply rzzzt 18 hours agorootparentprevSide question: did GTK3's HTML renderer get anywhere? I remember a calculator application running in a browser as a demo from a long time back. reply thorstenb 18 hours agorootparentThat still seems to be there, even for gtk4: https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/broadway.html (but it says, between the lines, mostly stale I guess) As an aside: one of the very first demos of LibreOffice in a browser (from the Collabora people) was using the broadway backend. But they've moved on, using their own tiled rendering server backend, plus custom, javascript gui on the client. reply hoistbypetard 19 hours agoparentprevIt looks like they've developed a javascript library that interacts with a WASM build of LibreOffice: https://github.com/allotropia/zetajs?tab=readme-ov-file reply starik36 16 hours agoprevLove the Deep Space 9 Easter egg! reply cess11 11 hours agoprev [–] I might do documents in the browser if LyX was ported to WASM and performance is good. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originBody": "Pro Security D-Link says it won't patch 60,000 older modems, as they're not worth saving News By Sead Fadilpašić published November 13, 2024 Just get a new modem, the company says When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. (Image credit: Future) Security researchers find critical flaws in modems reaching End of Life D-Link says it won't patch them, and recommends upgrading the hardware There are some 60,000 vulnerable devices out there Older D-Link routers are potentially vulnerable to more than one critical security issue which could allow threat actors to take over the devices. However, since they have reached end-of-life status (EoL), the company says it will not be releasing any patches, and advises users to replace the endpoints with newer models. The news comes shortly after we reported multiple D-Link NAS endpoints were found vulnerable to CVE-2024-10914, a command injection flaw with a 9.2 severity score - however the company again said it wouldn’t be issuing a fix, since the affected devices have all reached EoL. Now, security researcher Chaio-Lin Yu (Steven Meow) found three bugs plaguing the D-Link DSL6740C modem. One is tracked as CVE-2024-11068, has a severity score of 9.8, and allows threat actors to change passwords through privileged API access. The other two are CVE-2024-11067, and CVE-2024-11066, and are a path traversal flaw and a remote code execution (RCE) flaw, with 7.5 and 7.2 scores, respectively. Tens of thousands of vulnerable endpoints Roughly 60,000 vulnerable devices are currently connected to the internet, the majority being located in Taiwan. The model isn’t even available in the US, BleepingComputer states, since it reached EoL almost a year ago. With that in mind, D-Link said it wouldn’t be addressing the flaw, and suggests \"retiring and replacing D-Link devices that have reached EOL/EOS.\" The same model is also vulnerable to four additional high-severity command injection flaws, the publication states, citing information from the Taiwanese computer and response center (TWCERTCC). These flaws are tracked as CVE-2024-11062, CVE-2024-11063, CVE-2024-11064, and CVE-2024-11065. Users who are unable to replace their routers at the moment are advised to at least restrict remote access, and set secure access passwords, to minimize the chance of compromise. This would be a wise move since routers are one of the most targeted endpoints out there.

I have three unmanaged switches at home, one on the ground floor and two in the first floor. Ground floor is an 8 port netgear, first floor are one to link and one d link. Every couple of weeks, the entire wired network goes down. Not even pinging adresses works. The d links ports leds are all flashing (perfectly in sync!) until I power cycle it. Then everything goes back to normal. I have no idea what happens, and I should probably replace the d link soon. reply vardump 9 hours agorootparentAre you aware about broadcast storms? Perhaps you somehow accidentally introduced a loop in the network? The symptoms fit that exactly. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_storm STP is meant to prevent that. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_Tree_Protocol Of course you can't set up STP with unmanaged switches, so until you go managed and set up STP properly nothing will change. reply mitjam 7 hours agorootparentIt could be missing IGMP Snooping Protocol support in a network with IPTV or custom VLAN setups. There are 3 versions (IGMP snooping (v1, v2, and v3)), managed switches have them all, unmanaged usually don't have them. To avoid problems, only pass a single VLAN to the unmanaged switch (it must be behind the managed switch for that), otherwise the unmanaged switch can and usually will bring a network down after some time. Or just use a switch with IGMP snooping support. reply remuskaos 9 hours agorootparentprevI was not! Thanks for the hint!

It demands that vendors (or importers) of products need to update their product if that's required to keep them secure. Otherwise they are liable for damages, even psychological damages. There is no specific duration mentioned in the directive, so it's probably best from a vendor point of view to add product lifetime info to the product description or the contract, up front. In Germany there is something similar in place, already and the expectation is that products (and necessary apps to run the products) need to be updated for 5 years on average. reply zokier 6 hours agoparent> There is no specific duration mentioned in the directive The directive has explicit 10 year expiry period, see (57) > Given that products age over time and that higher safety standards are developed as the state of science and technology progresses, it would not be reasonable to make manufacturers liable for an unlimited period of time for the defectiveness of their products. Therefore, liability should be subject to a reasonable length of time, namely 10 years from the placing on the market or putting into service of a product (the ‘expiry period’), without prejudice to claims pending in legal proceedings. https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A... reply mnau 6 hours agoparentprevThat D-Link DSL6740C device was released in 2014.

I can't find anything concrete but some poking around on wayback machine indicates it was likely discontinued late 2018. Which probably still means they are in the clear in this instance even if you assume it takes a year for the inventory in the channel to sell through. reply thequux 2 hours agorootparentThe manufacturer can't control or even predict purchase dates, so that leaves potentially unbounded support lifetimes. I'd be comfortable with the 10-year timer starting from date of last manufacturer though reply hyperman1 43 minutes agorootparentIf this works like a warranty, the manufacturer can stop 10 years after selling to the shop. The shop is the one providing the warranty to the user. The shop can oblige their warranty by replacing with a (more recent) equivalent model, even from another manufacturer. reply bell-cot 5 hours agorootparentprev> The 5 year clock should start from the last time a consumer purchased the product new... Obvious problem - how could the manufacturer determine (let alone control) when, literally, that happened? They might tell when their major distributors and online retailers ran out of stock...but small distributors and bottom-feeding resellers and mom-and-pop retail? Impossible. On-package labeling (\"Software security updates for this thingie will be available until at least Dec. 31, 2029; also check our web site at https://support...\") would be the only fool-proofish method. reply xmodem 3 hours agorootparentI think on-package labelling is a good approach. You could also make the retailer liable for a lack of updates - just as they typically already are with defective products in most jurisdictions. reply xp84 3 hours agorootparentYeah, this isn’t that different than the food “best by date” requirements, and in most cases (despite popular belief) the likely consequences of eating old packaged food is not even getting sick, just staleness. Arguably, having exploitable electronics that are “expired” is a greater danger. reply ak217 16 hours agoprevIf anyone is looking for alternatives as far as long term supported products go... I've had nothing but good experiences with Ubiquiti (Unifi) and OpenWRT. At the lower end of the price spectrum, OpenWRT supported devices can be an incredible value, and most will probably remain supported for decades to come. More broadly, it's not just about the support commitment but also about the company's reputation for shipping solid software. i.e. what is the prior on a scenario like this after the product goes EOL. reply neilv 11 hours agoparentRegarding supporting devices long-term, I can still get current version official OpenWrt for the Netgear WNDR3700v2, which I think is about 15 years old at this point. https://firmware-selector.openwrt.org/?version=23.05.5&targe... https://openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr3700 I always try to find out what's one of the best-supported OpenWrt routers at the time I'm shopping. And can I get one (or a few) of them on eBay at great prices. WRT54-GL, WNDR3700(v2,v4) and WNDR3800, Netgear R7800. I also have an OPNsense box that I'm evaluating. But, since OPNsense (FreeBSD) isn't strong on WiFi, I'd need to pair it with separate WiFi APs (running OpenWrt). I'm not liking the extra complexity, when an OpenWrt R7800 still does everything I really need right now. reply close04 5 hours agorootparent> WRT54-GL, WNDR3700(v2,v4) and WNDR3800, Netgear R7800. The WRT54-GL stands out, while having a really long support life it's also just FE, 10/100Mbps. The others are gigabit Ethernet. Could possibly be replaced from the list by the D-Link DIR-825 (N, not AC) which is also at the same support level as the Netgear WNDR3700v2. reply cesarb 15 hours agoparentprev> At the lower end of the price spectrum, OpenWRT supported devices [...] will probably remain supported for decades to come. Not really. Each newer OpenWRT release needs slightly more storage and memory than the previous one, and these devices at the lower end of the price spectrum tend to have as little storage and memory as they can get away with. Older devices with as little as 4 MB of storage and/or 32 MB of memory are already unable to run current OpenWRT releases, and devices with 8 MB of storage and/or 64 MB of memory are already on the way out. But yeah, other than that OpenWRT does tend to support devices way past their original EOL. reply IntelMiner 15 hours agorootparentCounterpoint: The original \"Google Wi-Fi\" Mesh routers (the hockey puck looking ones) from about 10~ years ago come with *4GB* of storage and 512MB of RAM [1] [1] https://openwrt.org/toh/google/wifi They're about $30-$50 USD for a 3 pack on eBay reply ak217 14 hours agorootparentIt's not just those. The 16 MB storage/128 MB flash recommended minimums are a non-issue for pretty much any remotely popular router in the 802.11ac wifi era, and I doubt OpenWRT will suddenly explode in size and blow past those limits any time soon (just look at its trajectory over the past decade). reply xp84 3 hours agorootparentprevOh wow, are those OpenWRT compatible?? I’ve been out of the game since having a WRT54GL with Tomato, so pardon my ignorance reply miohtama 14 hours agorootparentprevWhy did Google spec them so heavy? reply AlotOfReading 14 hours agorootparentThe storage is eMMC, basically the cheapest thing available once you've committed. You'd have to actively try to buy eMMC smaller than 2-4GB. Same for the RAM, that's a single chip. It's not a heavy spec, just somewhere near the bottom of the cost curve for those particular parts. They probably used similar parts in another product and threw them into the routers for the additional order volume, known bring-up risk, and dev benefits. The pixel series also uses Samsung eMMC, iirc. reply Dylan16807 14 hours agorootparentprevThey probably budgeted a dollar for storage and a dollar for ram, or close to it. Sometimes it's nice to be able to run a normal OS. reply baka367 9 hours agorootparentprevNote that the limit only applies to base OpenWRT installation. I have successfully configured my ancient router to boot from the router's USB storage (64gig flash drive) reply m463 9 hours agorootparentprevI disagree with your sentiment. I think the routers openwrt has dropped support for are super low spec, like $20. And they still run older versions of openwrt.

Every 3-4 years I'd have to buy another because the manufacturer stopped providing updates, even when I was buying their higher-end stuff. I myself moved on to an Ubiquiti Edge Router almost 10 years ago, but Ubiquiti didn't do a great job of that in the long term and they ditched the EdgeRouter/EdgeMAX line so I ended up (and I wasn't interested in Unifi line for my router/firewall) buying a Protectli box, flashed coreboot and used pfSense for a while before eventually moving to OPNSense. I came to the conclusion over this time that any consumer network equipment is basically junk and if you care at all about security you shouldn't use it; sadly that's easier said than done for non-techy folks. Many pieces of older/cheaper hardware can be flashed with OpenWRT and I'd recommend that as the cheapest option for anyone who cares just a little, and doesn't want to buy new hardware, and for everyone who really wants to make an effort should buy some hardware that can run a properly maintained router OS like pfSense or OPNSense, even an all-in-one wifi-router-switch if you don't want to build out an entire SMB network. reply jart 2 hours agoparentYeah Ubiquiti used to be great before they went the other way.

I don't think they have one and that pretty irresponsibility because they should know that the majority of their customers aren't all that technically savvy. I don't know if D-Link devices automatically pulls update, my guess is that they don't, but there should at least be a on device indicator that this device is now EOL and should be used at the customers own risk. It fine to say that a device is EOL and no more updates will be made available, but they need to indicate to the customers that these devices are now at risk. reply swiftcoder 7 hours agoparentprev> These devices are end of life If I told you that your fridge or car would be EOL in 5 years, and after that you should throw it away and buy a new one, you'd rightly laugh me out of the room.

Is there a statute of limitations on mind boggling levels of incompetence? I'd usually give the EOL argument some credit, but this exploit is not an accident, someone deliberately wrote an unauthenticated remote command execution as a feature, and it made it to production, and no one in this long chain of failures thought to themselves \"gee, maybe we shouldn't do this\" reply wmf 18 hours agorootparentWe could have passed a law requiring minimum security standards but we didn't.

Questions are surrounding the death of a popular NC State faculty member, whom NC State police found dead in his office on Nov. 20. Police found Marshall Brain II, director of the Engineering Entrepreneurs Program, unconscious and nonresponsive in his office at Engineering Building II on Centennial Campus at 7:00 a.m. NC State Police Public Information Officer Conner Hartis confirmed police found Brain deceased upon their arrival. The Wake County Simulcast showed Brain’s wife called for a welfare check at 6:40 a.m. No cause of death has been released. Hours before Brain’s death, he sent an email to colleagues saying two University department heads retaliated against him after he filed several ethics complaints months before his death. University spokesperson, Mick Kulikowski, said the University has no comment on the allegations or Brain’s death. The University has also not issued a public statement on Brain’s death. Brain graduated from the University with a master’s in computer science in 1992 and worked at the University since 2012. Brain was an author, entrepreneur and founder of the popular website HowStuffWorks.com. The award-winning faculty member was an influential figure in the world of science and entrepreneurship on and off campus. His classes, which aimed to combine the worlds of engineering and entrepreneurship, were popular. The email shared to Technician and posted online on a website dedicated to Brain’s legacy contains allegations of wrongdoing. Brain claims he was forced into retirement as retaliation for submitting numerous ethics complaints. Brain wrote in the email that Stephen Markham, executive director of NC State’s Innovation and Entrepreneurship program, announced Brain’s retirement to the Innovation and Entrepreneurship team on Nov. 6, saying the retirement was effective Dec. 31, 2025. Brain was a member of the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Leadership team, alongside Markham. Brain wrote that he was not retiring but instead was fired. Markham did not respond to multiple requests for comment in time for publication. “I have just been through one of the most demoralizing, depressing, humiliating, unjust processes possible with the University,” Brain wrote. “The fact is that I am not ‘retiring.’ Instead, NC State terminated me on Oct. 29.” Brain wrote that after submitting an ethics complaint concerning Veena Misra, head of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and bringing his concerns to her directly, Misra retaliated against him. Brain’s complaint contained allegations of wrongdoing in the form of “untrue statements, incompetence, hiding info, bad faith dealings and unethical behavior” after a disagreement with Misra in August regarding repurposing the Engineering Entrepreneurs Program meeting space to accommodate a new hire. “What came back was a sickening nuclear bomb of retaliation the likes of which could not be believed,” Brain wrote. “[Misra] excommunicated me from my department for reporting my concerns to her.” Misra did not respond to Technician’s request for comment. Jim Pfaendtner, dean of the College of Engineering, responded on her behalf and referred Technician to Kulikowski. Brain wrote he received an email a few weeks later from Srinath Ekkad, head of the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, saying the department would no longer recommend students participate in Brain’s Engineering Entrepreneurs Program. Brain wrote that, after outlining his concerns to Ekkad about this message, Markham informed Brain he would be taking disciplinary action against him for “unacceptable behavior.” Brandon Kashani, Brain’s former student and a startup mentor at NC State’s entrepreneurship clinic, received Brain’s email along with more than 30 others both within and outside of the University. Kashani said he met with Brain on Nov. 15, where Brain detailed the situation and correspondence with the University. Kashani described Brain as “heartbroken.” “He felt like his reputation was tarnished, like everything he worked for was ruined, and the root of all that was he didn't get any support from the University, the University that he put all his life — the last 12 years — towards,” Kashani said. “And all he wanted to do was be heard.” Brain wrote in the email that he believed the ethics complaint system’s framework was not properly used in addressing his concerns. The complaints were submitted through EthicsPoint, a reporting tool used by employees to report ethical concerns. “My career has been destroyed by multiple administrators at NCSU who united together and completely ignored the EthicsPoint System and its promises to employees,” Brain wrote. “I did what the University told me to do, and then these administrators ruined my life for it.” Kashani said Brain submitted numerous complaints through the EthicsPoint system and said tensions arose because Brain didn’t “play the political game” through his questioning of higher-ranking administrators. “Marshall was caught in an imbalanced group of people with more power than him, and they didn't like him calling them out,” Kashani said. “... He was keeping people accountable. He didn't understand that political aspect of it, and they just wanted to get rid of him.” Kevin Barry, Brain’s former student and a member of the Board of Advisors for NC State’s Innovation and Entrepreneurship Leadership program, said Brain was pivotal in the lives of students in this program and beyond. “Marshall was a cornerstone of entrepreneurship at NC State, and a very key person who dedicated himself and was a real entrepreneur, and really dedicated himself to the students,” Barry said. “And he, through and through, down to the bone, had that love and desire to help students. So to see what's going on with him is just absolutely devastating and disgusting.” Both Barry and Kashani said they are disappointed in the lack of a public statement from the University surrounding Brain’s death. “It's been six days now, which is insane,” Kashani said. “And I know a lot of people are reaching out. There’s a lot of pressure, but there hasn't been any acknowledgement of mistakes that were made, systems that failed, no resignations, not even a call to celebrate Marshall's achievements.” While Brain’s University biography remains on the Innovation and Entrepreneurship website, his page on the Computer and Electrical Engineering website no longer exists.

The two come into conflict frequently, and sometimes violently. Nothing is more difficult or dangerous than holding power to account; the mechanisms we imagine are in place to hold power accountable exist purely in that imagination. The personal feelings of shame, guilt, or ethical responsibility we imagine there to be, or the social pressure brought to bear on those who demonstrate a lack of those qualities, is missing when push comes to shove. Being an idealist, really believing in these things, is the setup for great tragedy. The fundamental mistake is to believe that others think like you do or value the same things you value. Of course I know nothing of this particular situation, but the shape of it is all too familiar - an idealistic, inspirational collegue forced out after speaking truth to power. How many tens of such people do we know? How many of them do not actually get back on their feet? How many of them did we speak up for? reply brailsafe 16 hours agoparentYep. I often reflect on some of my career mistakes, especially when evaluating current decisions within the context of a job or interacting with other institutions, and what I wish I'd learnt earlier would be to \"read a room\". Sure, there is technically a process for reporting wrongdoing, but there's no process for reporting wrongdoing and keeping your job, and keeping your job is more important. What isn't your job is taking moral stances on things, having political opinions, provoking what others might see as unnecessary conflict, in any form. Sure, you could spend some time ensuring accessibility standards are being met, but really you shouldn't unless someone complains, because although you think it's good practice, you're being paid to put visible results on the screen, unless you can make a business case for it that's sufficiently compelling and rewarding that it's worth pursuing. You'll lose your job for not getting the thing shipped, but probably won't for it not being theoretically good enough, unless you're a real doctor or real engineer Don't stick your neck out unless you control the outcome (for positive or negative), and figure out what you're really being told to do or asked to do, and keep your effort to that. Don't go above and beyond, it's out of scope and you're better off sleeping. Not joking. If you can't do that, you might struggle to stay employed, and it's not worth your personal risk. At work, keep your opinions to yourself, nearly all the time, they're rarely important, just get the work done and go home, work isn't that important either, don't pretend like you're saving the world. reply coldtea 16 hours agorootparent>Sure, there is technically a process for reporting wrongdoing, but there's no process for reporting wrongdoing and keeping your job, and keeping your job is more important. What isn't your job is taking moral stances on things, having political opinions, provoking what others might see as unnecessary conflict, in any form. Up to a certain point. That answer didn't hold up well at the Nuremberg trials. After a point there's also dignity and morality, not just \"keeping the job\". reply passing_by_and 16 hours agorootparentThat only happened because they needed some show trials to pacify people. A few were picked to take the fall and the rest were quietly brought to universities and government labs all across western powers. The United States has a proud tradition of totally ignoring all the agreements that came out of those trials. reply JumpCrisscross 15 hours agorootparent> they needed some show trials to pacify people Which people? The Europeans were occupied or liberated under effectively caretaker governments. Americans didn't need pacification. > the agreements that came out of those trials The trials inspired some agreements. It didn't create any, other than the precedent of holding leaders accountable for crimes against humanity. reply foul 10 hours agorootparent> Which people? The Europeans were occupied or liberated under effectively caretaker governments. They were occupied but they weren't entirely busy: while \"low\" people were happy to kill ex-Nazi collaborators themselves, it's the post-war governments (all of them, USA's included) who needed, with those trials, to manifest a re-establishment of the rule of law once again. 80 years later we can see it's been a hypocrite farce in every part of it, but it saved lives, those that were worth of living, although spared Nazis, fascists and sometimes communists too. reply JumpCrisscross 8 hours agorootparent> who needed, with those trials, to manifest a re-establishment of the rule of law once again Do you have a source for this having been the motivation? I’m admittedly most familiar with the French and American perspectives. Those weren’t concerned with pacification but creating an international sense of the rule of law and legal basis for the occupation and restructuring of those societies. reply refulgentis 14 hours agorootparentprevNo. reply mistercheph 15 hours agorootparentprevWhat modern corporate employee wouldn't (haven't?) sleepwalk into perpetuating horrors on innocent people and then really and truly believe it when they say \"I was just doing my job...\" I am not excluding myself, we have not magically solved the social/political circumstances that lead to the second world war, and we are doomed to repeat those mistakes if we take for granted that those structures just fizzled away because we blood sacrificed millions of people and then the victors did a rain dance over the burial mound. reply totetsu 16 hours agorootparentprevNot trying to troll here, but, what does something like Nuremberg trails matter in a country where someone who can incite an insurrection and then become president again, or a world where international criminal court orders are ignored? reply JumpCrisscross 15 hours agorootparent> what does something like Nuremberg trails matter in a country where someone who can incite an insurrection and then become president again, or a world where international criminal court orders are ignored? Nuremberg had nothing to do with insurrections and revolutions. It also judged the Nazis according to standards that didn't exist when they committed their crimes; the ICC was created after Nuremberg as an imperfect system. Imperfect, however, is still better than nothing. reply coldtea 6 hours agorootparentprev>Not trying to troll here, but, what does something like Nuremberg trails matter in a country where someone who can incite an insurrection and then become president again \"A bunch of random people who get into a government building, take selfies, and are dispersed later\" is a pretty low bar for an insurrection. That's not how insurrections are organized and conducted, more like a \"flash mob\" of people with no clear idea what they're even doing. The symbolism of the Capitol aside, BLM/Antifa and co attacking government buildings, heavily clashing with police, setting government buildings, police departments, and properties on fire, and so on, for months, would count as a much more serious case. Though even that would still be more like a bunch of states-wide coordinated riots (with some partisan color) than an inssurection. And of course the latter was supported, and the first was met with pearl clutching indignation. It's more about interest in partisan politics than interest in the rule of law. Funnily, many people who have done actual inssurections, of the armed, overthrow the goverment for real, kind, with plans and teams arranged kind, have became presidents and PMs again in legitimate elections. Examples include from Hugo Chavez (coup in 1992, then prison, president in 1998), to Nelson Mandela (conducted anti-government operations and marked as a \"terrorist\" for decades, went to prison, then became legitimate president). A tamer example might be Mexico's own López Obrador: lost elections in 2006, led demonstrations and clashes, created a parallel government with himself as \"Presidente Legitimo\" (the \"real prez\"), finally won elections in 2018. >or a world where international criminal court orders are ignored? Well, despite the name, the ICC is not a body with sovereign power over the whole world. If a country hasn't signed in to respect its rullings, it can just ignore them. And as usual the US signs only whichever it finds convenient, nothing that could bind it to respect global decisions (so much for \"rules based order\"). So in this case, the difference with the Nuremberg trials was that those conducting them had power over those accussed. Which would also be the case with, say, the FBI or the IRS and co. Which is why whether \"I just followed orders\" is a legitimate defense in such a case still matters. Unless of course the person has the power to brush off their persecution. reply riku_iki 15 hours agorootparentprev> That answer didn't hold up well at the Nuremberg trials. that's just winners were punishing losers. In alternative reality, those who dropped nukes were facing trial in Nuremberg. reply coldtea 6 hours agorootparent>that's just winners were punishing losers Whether it's winners punishing losers, or e.g. the FBI/FDA/DEA/IRS/whatever punishing some company exexutives and employees, the potential for this to be a bad defense remains constant. reply riku_iki 1 hour agorootparentwhen it is winners vs losers, your line of defense is irrelevant, since winners decide rules of the game. We can partially tell the same that FBI/FDA/DEA/IRS punishes regular Joe much more harshly, compared to CEOs which almost never goes to jail unless he stole from other rich/in power. reply yieldcrv 16 hours agorootparentprevGiven that this highly improbable outcome involves two separate coalitions of countries invading yours from both sides, “read the room” is a safe bet for all parties to make, including last minute flights to Argentina reply coldtea 6 hours agorootparentIf only I had used this outcome only as a highly understood example, as opposed to as the exact sitution that will befall the person I responded to... oh, wait! reply yieldcrv 3 hours agorootparentThat’s cool but it’s something I think about a lot Like how some well known companies are implicated because of government contracts with that short lived regime in the 1930s and its like thats not really a deterrent because you don't really know what a government will do, and accountability requires a multi coalition invasion, losing, and subsequent leaking of state records the threshold for that to occur is so high, like for one, that government has to actually lose, and the one everyone is mad at typically doesn't makes more sense to contract with all parties in all countries and just collect the checks I think that specific example is a perfect choice to undermine the specific lesson you were aiming for reply aoanevdus 15 hours agorootparentprev> Don't stick your neck out unless you control the outcome (for positive or negative), and figure out what you're really being told to do or asked to do, and keep your effort to that. Don't go above and beyond, it's out of scope and you're better off sleeping. Not joking. If you can't do that, you might struggle to stay employed, and it's not worth your personal risk. Generally good advice but I would caveat it. Sometimes the org doesn’t know it wants something, or doesn’t know that you are the right person to ask. For example, I’ve had good success when finding ways to save millions of dollars. And other, more domain-specific things that make management happy. Granted, you don’t need to do this if your position is stable and that’s enough for you. But if you are early in your career, trying to move up, or just want to be on the keeper list when there are layoffs, simply doing what is asked may not be enough. reply derangedHorse 7 hours agorootparentprevThe two most important lines of your comment: > you shouldn't unless someone complains … unless you can make a business case for it that's sufficiently compelling and rewarding that it's worth pursuing > Don't stick your neck out unless you control the outcome (for positive or negative) If there’s moral questions surrounding your employment and no structures to tackle them, then quit. If there’s a way to garner support for a proposal in a way that will incur a significant cost to the organization if rejected, then leverage those closest to the top who you believe will understand this. Basically, “If you come for the king, you best not miss” reply sneak 16 hours agorootparentprev> What isn't your job is taking moral stances on things, having political opinions, provoking what others might see as unnecessary conflict, in any form. This is wrong, and how you end up with flying drone face recognizing skullpopping murderbots. \"I just work here\" is an abdication of adult responsibility to self, family, and society. It's not some idealistic stance, it's the truth. It's how we ended up with concentration camps in the USA multiple times, and why many companies are gearing up to build more right now. reply Aeolun 11 hours agorootparentAbsolutely, and 90% of people will happily do so. So your personal ‘line in the sand’ is just completely and utterly irrelevant (aside from your own satisfaction) reply BriggyDwiggs42 9 hours agorootparentI think this stance is mired in the big picture but ignores small altruism. Neighbors who sheltered jews during the holocaust didn’t alter the system, but they saved real lives. Clandestine action for the better, in line with one’s convictions, can be genuinely worthwhile. reply catlifeonmars 14 hours agorootparentprevIDK, that seems like a pretty unfulfilling job. A lot of jobs are like that, but not all of them are. Staying in your own lane is boring. reply MichaelZuo 16 hours agorootparentprevIt’s more nuanced then that. People don’t want others pretending to be superior to them, if they are not actually that much better. e.g. A literal supergenius can behave very erratically nearly every week of the year, 40 years straight, and still achieve notable successes in life, such as Kurt Godel But a regular genius pretending to be a literal supergenius and trying to do the same, is well at best going to be perceived as a clown. And it gets even more lopsided as you go down. Someone merely very smart pretending to be a literal genius is never going to earn anyone’s respect around the table. reply trinsic2 11 hours agorootparentHow does this have anything to do with standing up to harms? Im sorry this is starting to sound like the philosophy that the Nazi regime operated under. reply MichaelZuo 6 hours agorootparentHow does ‘standing up to harms’ relate to how other people assess you? You can say anything, stand up to anything, etc., at a meeting but have differing underlying motives that is unsaid. reply Joel_Mckay 15 hours agorootparentprevLets be honest, most faculty members eventually become simple Ectoparasites on student work, or ruminate on problems they stopped making progress on for decades. As someone prone to idealism, you need to careful of the external consequences of work that runs into conflict with institution politics, government goals, and foreign/domestic intelligence services (professional thieves.)

Truer: we will sacrifice a lot to maintain our relative standard of living. reply benreesman 10 hours agorootparentI want to answer this point separately. My standard of living ten years ago was so high it was honestly gross, I imagine it was easily in the ballpark of a BlackRock quant. The year I quit was my second highest earning year in which I made an amount that is shameful given that my job was to sell digital fentanyl. I will sacrifice my standard of living up to and including not living because I feel a deep identification with the abstraction I call “my fellow person”. A lot of people will sacrifice their principles to preserve their standard of living. In what is looking to be a rough decade or two those people are a liability to that same abstraction. reply JumpCrisscross 9 hours agorootparent> lot of people will sacrifice their principles to preserve their standard of living The line where principles outweigh personal interests (alternatively, where individual interest should be suppressed for the group) vary from person to person, group to group. But they are universally ahead of where those who’d prefer humans weren’t flawed, in their view, imagine them to be. The easy excuse is to conclude everyone is evil. The hard work, that granted few of us are cut out for, is making do with the world we have. (The fun, in exploring the richness these “flaws” produce.) Note: I’m not asking anyone to settle for a lower moral rung. I’m saying: see the world as it is, not as you judge it to be. Would spacefaring be simpler without gravity? Yes. But the universe’s beauty, ourselves included, could not then exist. Human ambition and aspiration and yes, greed, are not aspects of ourselves I’d ever wish away. Even if it would make some problems easier. reply benreesman 8 hours agorootparentI want to express my admiration that you’ve engaged with me on this tricky and controversial topic. I actually wish I had acknowledged several very astute points that I strongly agree with. I’m not a RenTech quant, but I’ve spent enough time around heavyweights to know one when I see one. I’d like to have a dialog. If you feel the same please email me at b7r6@b7r6.net reply benreesman 15 hours agorootparentprevWho’s standard of living? We will render arbitrary people homeless to constrain the supply and push up real asset prices for homeowners. We’ll tolerate flagrant cartel monopoly and flagrant securities fraud and all manner of evil to drive equities up? Qui bono? Not the working person at the median. reply JumpCrisscross 15 hours agorootparent> Who’s standard of living? Each person's. It's an individual determination. > We will render arbitrary people homeless to constrain the supply and push up real asset prices for homeowners Yes. Because from the homeowner's perspective, they're maintaining their real standard of living. Crafting good policy requires being very careful about whose relative standard of living you're sacrificing for the greater good. Because no matter how privileged you think someone is, for them, it's the baseline. > We’ll tolerate flagrant cartel monopoly and flagrant securities fraud and all manner of evil to drive equities up? No, not really. Shareholders win in the aftermath of antitrust action and trusted equity markets. We tolerate those things, the first much more than the second, but not for the reasons you presume. reply benreesman 15 hours agorootparentI’m not sure what the theme of your contention is: it sounds like you’re basically saying everyone will fight as hard as possible with whatever means at their disposal to be maximally selfish. But that tired toy example from game theory shows that everyone loses if both grass the other up. Countless studies of both human beings and computer programs in the iterated prisoner’s dilemma show that the wining strategy is not in fact to drive housing prices so high that the homeless problem eventually wrecks your property value. This smash and grab, “how much can you carry” mafia capitalism has been tried before and the result was a guillotine. reply JumpCrisscross 14 hours agorootparent> everyone will fight as hard as possible with whatever means at their disposal to be maximally selfish No, I'm saying loss aversion is often misunderstood [1]. Both in its existence and strength. And the fact that it operates in relative terms, i.e. someone who is materially better off than they were 10 years ago may still throw their toys out of the pram if their neighbor is much better. > the wining strategy is not in fact to drive housing prices so high that the homeless problem eventually wrecks your property value Sure. The point is you also can't drive home prices down, because that hurts homeowners and activates them as a political bloc. (The solution is real home price growth as close to zero as possible amidst rising real incomes.) [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion reply benreesman 14 hours agorootparentI’m aware of the concept of loss aversion, but I think it as an explanatory factor for macro economics is a red herring: one of a long list of diversions in the grand company of all trickle-down economics. People say that the without arbitrary incentives for arbitrary wealth that hard work and innovation won’t happen. Demonstrably false! The Internet that the current cartel is looting was a public private partnership! The best software these days is done substantially by passionate hobbyists! People point to Silicon Valley and say “this wouldn’t be possible in Europe”. Then they point to the market capitalizations of the vampire megacorps that the world would be far better without as the success story. People make other arguments slightly craftier: punitive taxes on the mega wealthy wouldn’t raise enough revenue to matter. True, but that’s not the point of a punitive wealth tax: the point of a punitive billionaire tax is to deprive billionaires of godlike power to restructure society in their own interest. Anyone outside a few narrow bubbles can see that this is going very badly. I’ll agree with you this far: it’s going to be a tall hill to climb to get people with homes worth 20 times what they paid and 401ks to vote for a sane future. But this is a comparatively recent phenomenon: older people used to be obsessively concerned with the prospects of younger people for trivial biological reasons. These days? That “blood boy” transfusion thing Thiel is always on about? It’s a terrifying metaphor for the bigger picture. The procedure was pioneered so a father could keep his daughter alive at great risk to himself.

The other solution is to ally yourself with other less pragmatic principled idealists such that you can help them assess the situation and take mutually beneficial action.

Toxic personality / power / ego and the political games, bullying and power plays that go along with that (to the detriment of the organisation). 3. Dangerous levels of incompetence (from the perspective of their reports), when people who shouldn't be allowed to operate a stapler are put in charge of major business units. Often everyone is fine with this if they don't touch anything, it only becomes a problem when they are influenced to make sweeping changes. Sometimes you get the whole package in 1 person.

A lot of the startup world focuses around exploiting opportunities where there are profits to be realized in areas of mercantile endeavor that can ne in a bit of a grey zone, as it were. Areas the big boys won't touch because it's too risky, but that can have a large payoff with just a relatively small infusion of capital. So when you're talking a lot of these places, there is certainly room for a bait-n-switch to occur. Circumstances may be wildly different from instance to instance; but in general the same threads and warning signs are there. Going into specific details, as you point out, is a great way to out yourself. Sometimes it's just enough to tell someone to look hard, and generally with the prompting they'll figure it out. Now as far as reading the room goes... The sapd truth is this. If you didn't fund raise, you ultimately don't get to call the shots. Just how it works. Now it's best to listen to the folks you hire; don't get me wrong, but in most cases, an org does everything it can to make sure it is only steered from the top down by edict. It's not perfectly so, and there are ways to manage up (techniques no one who knows em is going to discuss in public), but at the end of the day, with power concentrated in the guy at the top, it comes down to how much trust you confer unto that person as a human being. If you're bringing up an ethics concern, and you're pretty sure it's not going to be taken well, or you've seen it ignored... Well...

    "originBody": "April 4, 2023 Janet for Mortals I wrote a book. It’s called Janet for Mortals, and it’s free, and it’s on the internet, and you can read it right now. And you should read it right now, instead of reading this blog post, because this blog post is not very interesting if you haven’t read the book. Heck, this blog post is not very interesting even if you have read the book. This blog post is a thinly-veiled promotion for my book to slip into my newsletter and RSS feed, with just enough additional content to pad it out to the length of a real post. The book is about Janet, a programming language that I have written about before. I’ve been using Janet a lot lately, and I’ve been having a lot of fun with it, and I think that more people should know about it so that they can have fun with it too. People like you. I’m not really going to talk much about why you should read the book, or even why you should care about Janet in the first place – that will come in a later post. Instead, this is going to be a short retrospective of what it was like to write my first technical book. We’ll start with some numbers. It took me twenty weeks to write the book, working in my spare time. I had originally estimated twelve weeks, which turned out to be a really good guess for how long I spent writing the book, but I didn’t account for how much time I would spend working on book-adjacent coding side quests. The final book is pretty short: 44k words of English prose, if you don’t count any of the code snippets. I tried to find an example of a famous book with a similar word count to put that number in perspective, and the best I can do is The Great Gatsby, which clocks in at 47k words. It’s right on the border between novella- and novel-length, but it’s less than half as long as my series of posts about Nix, which is sort of terrifying. But writing English words was only a fraction of the work. Over the course of those five months, I also spent a lot of time on: the website itself jimmy, bindings to a C++ library of persistent data structures Toodle.Studio, an interactive turtle graphics playground cmd, a command-line argument parsing library judge, an inline snapshot testing framework to do, a command-line todo list manager These things are not very interesting by themselves, but this blog post just exists to promote the book, so I’m going to reflect on them now. You are welcome to stop reading at any point and go read the actual book instead. The Website (2 weeks) The most interesting thing about Janet for Mortals is that it has a built-in repl. At any point you can press escape and pull it up, and it’s docked to the bottom of the page, just out of the way of the text. I’m sure that it’s not the first programming book to include a repl like this, but I’ve never actually seen it done before. The editor portion of the repl is CodeMirror, which I had used previously in Bauble. CodeMirror doesn’t know anything about Janet out of the box, but I had already implemented some basic language support when I wrote Bauble. But I skipped a lot of the Janet language when I was writing the grammar for Bauble, like ``multi`backtick`quoted`` strings, because they didn’t really matter in Bauble’s constrained DSL. But they mattered for the book, so I had to spend time figuring out how to implement them. But fleshing out the CodeMirror grammar (or more precisely, the Lezer grammar that CodeMirror uses) had an unexpected side effect: it let me re-use the grammar to do syntax highlighting for the code snippets in the book itself. Janet for Mortals is just a static site, but no static site generators that I know of know how to highlight Janet code. For a long time the book was entirely black-and-white, which I don’t mind, but I knew I needed to add some color before I released it upon an unsuspecting public – I think Janet’s syntax is pretty unfamiliar to most people reading the book, and anything to make it look friendlier helps. So I knew that I’d have to roll my own syntax highlighter of some kind, and I ended up just writing a simple static site generator in redo, which was not a very good fit, but… well, least bad choice that I know of. The meat of the generator is written in JavaScript, so that I could plug in the Lezer grammar for free, but it’s all tied together by a fragile web of shell. I used Remark to implement the parsing of the book’s source, and it was nice how much control I had over the generated output. I even added a simple extension to label code blocks, which was pretty easy. I also re-used Remark in the client itself, as part of the repl. The docstrings in the Janet standard library are written in Markdown, and I’m actually parsing and rendering them to HTML on the fly as part of the repl autocomplete. I spent a long time getting the repl autocomplete working well – because this book was written for newcomers to the Janet language, I thought that the help-as-you-type would be really useful for people trying to follow along in the repl. Autocomplete works by dynamically querying the Janet environment via WebAssembly at repl startup. This means if you define a new symbol with a docstring, it won’t actually appear in the autocomplete output, but I think that’s… fine. I could re-generate the autocompletions after every command is run, but… I don’t think there’s much value in that. The most interesting part of the repl is probably the (report) function, which takes a string and POSTs it to a simple web server that sticks it into a SQLite database for me to peruse later. It’s not really any different than a comment box, but I feel like there’s something fun about doing it from the repl. I’m really glad that I added it – it’s been fun reading people’s feedback, and I’ve fixed quite a few errors because of it. I’m sad that I didn’t implement any way to respond, though! The backend for reports is not written in Janet; it’s a tiny Haskell application that just listens for POST requests and sticks them into a SQLite database. There are people using Janet to make websites, but I am not one of them: the primary thing I want out of a web server is security, and I just don’t think Janet or its HTTP libraries are “battle-tested” enough for me to connect them to the internet. I also just think the idea of using a dynamically-typed interpreted language to build a web service is crazy, when there are optimizing compilers right there, but that’s a whole other conversation. jimmy (1 week) I spent a little bit of time writing bindings to immer, a library of persistent data structures. I never finished them, and probably won’t, at least not until I have a use for them. But as a demonstration of how to interop with C++ code from Janet, I think it was successful. https://toodle.studio (2 weeks) Last year I wrote a little art playground called Bauble. It was my first time embedding Janet in the browser, and I had a pretty tough time figuring out how to do that. There weren’t a lot of resources back then about embedding Janet period, and doing it in the browser added an extra layer of difficulty. I’d never used WebAssembly or Emscripten before, or even TypeScript, and it turns out there are no tutorials on how to write TypeScript Emscripten WebAssembly Janet bindings, so I spent a while figuring out how all the pieces worked together. And I’m glad I did, because I think the final product is really neat: it’s a website that is not written in JavaScript. I mean, a lot of it is. The UI is, still. But the actual application logic is all Janet. I thought that that was a really useful superpower of Janet, and I wanted to make the technique more accessible. In fact this was a big motivation for writing this book about Janet – I wanted people to know that this was possible in the first place, and I wanted to make it easier to get started with it. But Janet for Mortals doesn’t talk about Bauble at all. Bauble is actually not very interesting from an interop perspective: Bauble is completely stateless, and basically uses Janet to implement a pure function from strings to strings (they’re… pretty complicated strings; Bauble is a Janet-to-GLSL compiler, but they are strings nonetheless). I didn’t think it was a very good showcase for everything you can do with Janet, so I briefly considered talking about how I implemented the repl in the book, but I decided that that was far too boring. So I wrote Toodle.Studio – an obvious fork of Bauble – instead. Toodle.Studio seems a lot simpler than Bauble, but the interop with JavaScript is much more involved. Toodle.Studio has to execute long-running Janet programs asynchronously over time. It has to think about memory management, as the JavaScript code retains multiple references to the same Janet values. It has to pass complex nested data structures to and from Janet, going through C++ as an intermediary. It does a very simple version of all of these things, but it’s a pretty good showcase for the techniques. But the most interesting part of Toodle.Studio isn’t the interop or the memory management. The most interesting part of Toodle.Studio is the logo. I wasn’t really planning on making a logo – this is a demo project for a book, after all – but sadly I had no choice. When I was getting ready to release the website, I showed it to my partner, because it’s rare that I work on something comprehensible to normal human beings. I thought she’d like it, but she was aghast. “You said you were working on turtle graphics,” she said. “Where are the turtles?” I tried to explain that the turtles aren’t really turtles, that it’s like a flea circus, and the turtles are metaphors – but she was having none of it. The lack of turtles was a base betrayal, so I had to spend a day or so modeling a cute animated turtle in Bauble to act as the logo. And making its eyes follow the mouse, of course. Relationship repaired. The logo wound up being my favorite part of the site, and it was fun to get a chance to use Bauble to make something “real.” cmd (2 weeks) One of the things that I spent the most time on, oddly enough, was a command-line argument parsing library. The library itself only gets, like, three paragraphs of screen time in the book, but it was very important to me that it exist before the book came out, so that I could unambiguously claim that “Janet is an excellent scripting language.” Before cmd, that was still true, but the phrasing was more “Janet is a great choice for scripting and writing CLI tools, except that the argument parsing is kind of janky, sorry, but hey at least it’s better than Bash.” cmd was heavily inspired by Core.Command, which is the best command-line argument parsing library that I have ever used. I’m extremely spoiled by how easy it makes writing CLIs, and I wanted to replicate that experience in Janet. cmd is definitely not as good as Core.Command – types, my goodness, types make everything so much easier – but it has 95% of the features I care about, and the concise notation makes it more pleasant to use in ad-hoc scripts. One thing that I miss, though, is that Core.Command autogenerates Bash completion functions. I want to add that to cmd one day – the API is designed so that that will be possible to do. But… so many projects, so little time. judge (1 week) judge was one of the first things that I wrote in Janet, all the way back in 2021. I think that it worked pretty well considering that I didn’t know anything about Janet when I wrote it, but now I do, so I rewrote it from scratch. Not only is the API much nicer to use now, but the implementation is way simpler – and easier to make changes to. The main differences between Judge v1 and Judge v2 are that tests can now appear inside regular source files, not just the test/ directory, and I added the test-macro and test-stdout helpers, which are extremely useful. The OCaml equivalent of test-stdout is pretty much the only way that I write tests professionally, because OCaml doesn’t really have a way to embed arbitrary data in source code, so we turn everything into a string. After publishing the book – which has a whole chapter on testing with Judge – I had a chance to spend a little more time improving Judge, and I finally added an --interactive mode, which I’ve been wanting for a long time. And since I’m not spending all my time working on this book anymore, I’ve actually had a few opportunities to use the new Judge, and I gotta say: it’s nice. It’s really nice. I know I can’t impress upon you just how nice it is in this post – it really needs a demo, and I’m too lazy to record one right now – but I’m very happy with how it feels to use it to write Janet. to do (2 hours) I picked this project to highlight for the scripting chapter, because it’s a non-trivial thing that I had done in Bash before, and actually found it pretty painful. Parsing multi-line text with Sed is not fun, and trying to do date manipulation with date in a way that works the same on macOS and Linux is… basically impossible, as far as I can tell. I quickly ran into the limits of my patience, and gave up on the idea some years ago. It was really fun to return to this with the full power of PEGs and sh and cmd at my disposal. I immediately surpassed all of features of my original Bash todo list, and was able to add quite a few more (like fzf multi-select – good luck constructing null-terminated strings in Bash). The book covers a very simplified version of the app – it can’t schedule tasks for the future, and there’s no concept of “skipping” tasks. Those features are important for my todo list workflow, but they are probably not important for your todo list workflow, so the book only discusses the core functionality of adding things to a list and crossing them off. I think that it makes a good starting point to run with and make your own – paired with zsh-autoquoter, it’s actually a surprisingly useful app! If you put all of these projects together, I was writing code for almost half the time that I spent working on the book. Eight out of twenty weeks, plus some periods where I was doing both at once. I didn’t really budget for that going into this. I thought that I’d improve Judge, and I thought that I’d write an argument parser. But I thought that writing an argument parser would be way easier than it actually was. And I thought that I’d just talk about Bauble – it never occurred to me that I’d write another art playground just because Bauble was too easy. So that’s the story of writing the book. Or really, everything but writing the book. All the other things. The writing itself isn’t that interesting. I wrote it in Markdown, in Sublime Text, which is my favorite editor for writing long-form prose. I have nothing interesting to say about that part. Two new versions of Janet came out while I was writing the book, and I did have to go back and update the chapters on debugging and native modules to keep up with changes to the language. I plan on keeping the book up to date with the latest Janet release – we’ll see how long I can keep that up. I haven’t done much to promote the book yet. I submitted it to Hacker News, and I submitted it to Lobsters, and I wrote a very half-hearted tweet about it. The reception was pretty much as good as I could have hoped for: it was on the Hacker News front page all day, and even held the number one spot for a while. What does that actually mean? Well, according my Nginx access logs, I got: 30,025 unique visitors on Friday 9,568 unique visitors on Saturday 3,777 unique visitors on Sunday Those numbers don’t mean very much, though. Those are just people who clicked on a link – the number of people who actually read the book is much, much smaller. I don’t actually know how much smaller exactly, because I don’t have any client-side behavior-tracking analytics on the site. But I can sort of try to guess, by looking at my access logs. It seems like retention is not great: Chapter One had 22% as many visitors as the home page. Chapter Two had 20% as many visitors as Chapter One. Chapter Three had 69% as many visitors as Chapter Two. Chapters Four and Nine, “Pegular Expressions” and “Xenofunctions,” had more visitors than Chapter Three. I’m guessing that last bit is because people clicked on those chapters to see what they were about, which just goes to show that unique visitor count is not a very dependable metric. My best attempt at answering the question “how many people are actually reading the book” is 387, as of the end of the launch weekend. So far 387 unique IP addresses have loaded five or more distinct chapters, which is probably a decent proxy for the metric I care about. I really had no expectations for what these numbers would be before I launched the book. It’s a big time commitment to read a weird book about a programming language you’ve barely heard of, and 387 seems simultaneously low (compared to, say, any blog post) and high (I don’t think I’ve ever read a book off a HN link). But it’s more than zero! Alright, I think that’s enough. I’ll close with some fun facts: The Janet language is named after an immortal being in The Good Place who helps mortals navigate the afterlife, hence the title. The chapter with the fewest visits is currently “Testing and Debugging,” despite being the third-to-last chapter. This does not surprise me at all, but I think it’s a shame: the last three chapters are by far the most interesting in the book, and the style of testing described in that chapter is one of the biggest productivity upgrades that I have personally experienced in my engineering career. So far I’ve received 494 reports from the built-in repl reporting feature. Most of these were of the “hey nice book” or “testing” variety, but I’ve gotten several dozen typo reports, clarification requests, or otherwise useful comments through it as well. The most interesting report was just “you should listen to this song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46i3LbIbbhI.” No context, no explanation, and I have no way to reply for clarification. But… thanks! It’s a good song. I’m into it. A few people asked me questions without including any kind of contact info, so I have no way to answer them. I hope that they found peace, wherever they are. I’m not ignoring you. I just… I only implemented an extremely primitive one-way feedback function. I’m going to plug the book one last time. With feeling: Janet for Mortals! Out now! The first infinity visitors get their copy for free!",

Guile's original pitch is that it's intended to be easily used side-by-side with C. However, because it's an older language, it hasn't (to my knowledge) picked up newer sensibilities like having a package manager shipped with the language toolchain. One thing I like about Guile is how much effort they've put into describing compatibility with the RNRS standards. Not sure how Schemey Janet actually is, but I'm curious to find out. reply packetlost 4 hours agoparentJanet it not Scheme-like at all. It's more like if someone made Clojure on top of Lua. reply giraffe_lady 4 hours agorootparentWhich is really funny because that's basically exactly what fennel is, which was made by the same guy. I don't think he's written about it but fennel compiles to lua while janet is its own thing. reply sourcepluck 2 hours agorootparentThis is funny, cos I saw this stated somewhere on HN the other day, was totally amazed he'd done both, went and checked, and found out it was untrue - I think! Someone correct me please if I'm confused. Calvin Rose made Janet https://github.com/bakpakin and https://bakpakin.com/ Phil Hagelberg made Fennel https://git.sr.ht/~technomancy/fennel and https://technomancy.us/colophon reply ianthehenry 2 hours agorootparentIt's complicated; Calvin Rose was the original creator of Fennel (\"fnl\"), but I understand it was just a little side project that he made over the course of a week or so in college. Phil Hagelberg found the project years later and thought it was cool, took over as its maintainer, and basically turned it into the Fennel you know today. So it's like, kind of, I dunno, both things are kinda true. reply sourcepluck 1 hour agorootparentThat's even more funny in the end, I thought GP was referring to Phil Hagelberg as creator of both, but they were referring to Calvin Rose as creator of both. Oops. Mystery solved. Anyway - Fennel and Janet look very interesting, and a large thank you to everyone involved! reply packetlost 4 hours agorootparentprevCorrect. Syntactically it's more similar to Clojure while the runtime is, to my understanding, heavily inspired by the non-JIT versions of Lua. As a language, it's fine. I found the documentation pretty good and the language makes some very sensible decisions but I can't bring myself to use it for anything serious. The lack tooling makes it challenging. reply giraffe_lady 3 hours agorootparentI have used janet for embedding into another program as an alternative to lua and it was great for that case. Lua doesn't have good tooling either, and I didn't have anything to gain from a tiny runtime and I wanted more powerful tools for making a DSL in there. It worked out perfectly, I'd do it again. reply packetlost 1 hour agorootparentYeah, I'm not saying there aren't usecases that it would excel at (sounds like you found one!), I just haven't really had a problem that I thought it would yet.

Was pleasantly surprised to see it is a programming language and that the title was just a clever joke on that: The Janet language is named after an immortal being in The Good Place who helps mortals navigate the afterlife, hence the title. It kinda surprised me that they ship the language with a PEG (parsing expression grammer) instead of a basic Regex engine. This has been my wish for any programming language that ships a Regex library by default to also include a capable PEG. reply tmtvl 7 hours agoparentGNU Guile also has a PEG library in its standard library (see ). reply petee 6 hours agoparentprevJanet's 'spork' module is kinda like their libc, and has a regex submodule; it's very likely to be installed. Janet is my first exposure to PEGs, so nothing to compare against but I love how powerful and easy they are. I have a better grasp of them in only a few months than dabbling over 20yrs with regex. Also there is quite a bit of The Good Place callbacks within the Janet community; numerous 3rd party modules are named after characters, for example. reply philsnow 1 hour agorootparentI had also not seen PEGs before, but the way you can use parsing node identifiers recursively (and mutually recursively) seems very intuitive. reply tessierashpool 4 hours agoparentprevElm does something similr. Neither elm/regex nor elm/parser are built-in, but elm/regex encourages you to use elm/parser instead. btw, I like the namesake, but a language named Janet is pretty much obligated to also prioritize control. reply prokopton 6 hours agoprevI’m holding out for the one written for immortals. reply numeromancer 3 hours agoparentI am not waiting for Janet for Ethereals.

I'm having a lot of fun writing Janet and refer back to the book often. I do think the macro example that is early in the book is a little overwhelming; if you can get past that everything is far easier. Whats great is that you can leave the author a comment right from the repl, so I did :) reply purerandomness 9 hours agoprevAbsolutely love the writing style, which was the reason I got sucked into functional programming and the Janet language deeper than I'd had previously wanted to. Thank you! reply Tomte 6 hours agoparent> Okay great. I think that’s a totally reasonable second code sample ever for you to look at. I like it. reply MichaelGlass 10 hours agoprevI really like the slightly silly writing style! Reminds me of a toned-down Douglas Adams. Honestly, I'm not particularly interested in Janet but the style sucked me in. reply behnamoh 4 hours agoprevI've read the book and I found it very fascinating and kind of playful, which actually makes learning the Janet program language much more fun. However, I found the documentation of the language lacking in many ways. Oftentimes there are functions or commands that are just there, but there's no example or explanation. or explanation as to what they do. In fact, there are a lot of those that I found in the book, but I couldn't find in the documentation. So this is one of the reasons I stopped learning Janet, even though I really like the idea of this language, and the fact that it has many sane defaults and similarities to mainstream languages instead of like adhering to archaic Lisp conventions. At the end of the day, it's not actually a LISP because it's not cons lists. And it is fine by me, but again, I found the language not fully documented. reply Lyngbakr 19 minutes agoparentI had exactly the same experience (minus reading the book). Often, I'd just see the function signature and no further explanation. I do realise that it takes a lot of time and effort to build up extensive docs, but it happened enough that I put it down and started looking for another Lisp that compiles down to a binary. reply alectroem 1 hour agoparentprevDo you remember any of the functions/commands that were not documented?

The PEG grammars are very elegant to build up. I wrote a language for programmatic recipes (think scaling, unit conversion, etc) with it and it was a delight.

Are you willing to instead share an example snippet of what the DSL itself looks like? reply petee 6 hours agoparentprevI'm pretty new to it, but from what I've seen the answer is yes. And while I haven't wrote any macros yet I think PEGs are fantastic, and sooo readable. Their website has an example PEG to read Janet source - https://janet-lang.org/docs/syntax.html#Grammar Embedding is really easy, as is writing c modules. You can link shared, or use an amalgamated c file. Check out https://janet-lang.org/capi/embedding.html Honestly I'm having just as much fun learning Janet as I am writing C modules and embeddings; Janet all the things! reply giraffe_lady 3 hours agoparentprevIt's an incredible lua replacement for embedding. A lot of the time for an embedded scripting language you're defining a DSL which bare lua is fairly poorly suited to. And you lose the tininess and simplicity of the embedding if you're having to cram PCRE and shit in there too. Janet basically just copies lua's C interop because it's the best part of lua. And then with PEGs and a solid macro system you're in a much better position for scripting, or defining a scripting environment, or a configuration DSL, or whatever you wanted a non-C language for. reply katspaugh 6 hours agoprevLove the book! It's fun and inspiring to write programs recreationally! reply ulbu 9 hours agoprev“We’ll start with some numbers” I was expecting he’ll start by proclaiming it’s that language that uses floats for integers. reply subjectsigma 5 hours agoprevI couldn’t get into Janet, I’m not sure if this is a personal failing on my part. The only other Lisp I’ve spent any significant time in is Emacs Lisp, and everything in Janet seemed similar enough to that but just subtly different that I was always making silly mistakes. The PEG features were really compelling on paper but I found the syntax unwieldy and confusing. The documentation was complete in that it had descriptions of all the functions, but spartan in that it lacked examples or other helpful usage information. There didn’t seem to be any basic batteries included such as JSON parsing; if I want to write a quick script in a language and I have to first write a JSON or XML parser, task is already failed. This was like four years ago, so maybe the ecosystem is better now. Or maybe scripting was the wrong ruler to measure Janet by. I don’t know but this post is making me want to reinstall it. reply petee 4 hours agoparentThey put things like JSON and regex in the 'spork' module, which is kinda like libc; theres a strong internal drive to keep the core light.

The implication of \" for normal people, mortals, dummies, etc.\" titles is that the reader is not on the level of the author of the book and the authors of the tool or topic that one is learning about. Specifically, \"for mortals\" implies the author and programming language author are immortals, or at least not mortal. I realize this is taking the title more seriously than probably intended, but this type of framing pops up a lot in the software and programming world. reply johnfn 1 hour agoparentI think a more charitable interpretation of the title is an implication that the other material written for Janet was written for supergeniuses (or whatever), so here's a book finally written for normal people. reply julianeon 2 hours agoparentprevI could see this is if the title was \"for morons\" (or something like it), something implying a class division. But 100% of humans are mortal. Everyone is mortal, including the author. So there's no real division here, no two tiered system: we are all on the mortal tier. reply ianthehenry 2 hours agoparentprev [–] hi, i am the author of this book and i agree with you. it's not a good connotation. i chose it because: 1. it is kinda memorable (look there are so many programming books with exactly the same name) 2. the language is named after an immortal being who guides mortals through the afterlife in the fictional property the good place, so there's some kinda connection. but i agree the implication that janet is somehow \"hard\" to learn or that the author is somehow \"on a higher plane\" is bad. i waffled on this a lot but never came up with another title i could stand and ultimately just pulled the trigger.

    "title": "Raspberry Pi CM5 is a faster, drop-in upgrade",
    "originLink": "https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/raspberry-pi-cm5-2-3x-faster-drop-upgrade-mostly",
    "originBody": "November 27, 2024 The Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5 is smaller than a credit card, and I already have it gaming in 4K with an eGPU, running a Kubernetes cluster, and I even upgraded my NEC Commercial display from a CM4 to CM5, just swapping the Compute Modules! The Compute Module 4 was hard to get for years. It launched right after the COVID supply chain crisis, leading to insane scalper pricing. It was so useful, though, that Raspberry Pi sold every unit they made, and they're inside everything: from commercial 3D printers, to TVs, to IP KVM cards. After pre-announcing the CM5 earlier this year, the biggest question was, is it a drop-in replacement? Yes. For the most part. I've been testing it in tons of Compute Module boards, and it's been awesome seeing a 2-3x speedup just dropping in the new module. It boots up in seconds, it has USB 3 instead of USB 2, and it's compatible with PCIe Gen 3 instead of Gen 2. The CPU is 2-3x faster, RAM is 3-4x faster, WiFi's faster, storage is faster... It's basically a Pi 5, but without the plugs. Most CM4 cases and accessories still work with it, just there's a LOT more bandwidth. The big advantage to a Compute Module versus a Pi 5 is modularity. And I published a video today going over a ton of use cases enabled by various Compute Module carrier boards. All the ones I've tested were built for the CM4, but the CM5 is an instant drop-in upgrade: I won't cover the individual use cases in this blog post. Rather, I'll focus on CM5 benchmarking and my notes from using the hardware a few weeks. The second-most-asked question is how much it will cost. Put simply, the 8GB CM5 is roughly the same price as the 8GB CM4. The 4GB module is $5 more, and the 2GB module is $10 more. So the cheapest CM5 is now $45 instead of $35—they're dropping the 1GB option from the lineup this generation. For any specific pricing information, please consult the CM5 Product Brief. Performance Good news: you can expect almost all the same numbers as a Pi 5 with the same amount of RAM. Raspberry Pi made some quality of life improvements for management, too: You can edit the EEPROM (e.g. to change the BOOT_ORDER) without needing another computer Raspberry Pi maintains pi-gen-micro to build smaller custom Pi OS installations Right off the bat, the most refreshing difference is it boots up about 4 seconds faster. Once it's running, the CPU is almost 3x faster. And it's also about 1.5x more efficient, according to my High Performance Linpack tests. And of course, I had to test recompiling the Linux kernel. The CM5 obliterates the CM4, it's more than 3x faster. Video encoding is also about 3x faster. I tested x264 transcoding both at 4K and 1080p resolutions, using Phoronix. All these benchmarks are helped by the faster LPDDR4x RAM on the CM5, which I tested using tinymembench: But all these speedups consume more power, at least at full blast: the CM5 uses almost twice the power flat out. But at idle, the CM5 uses a tiny bit less: I measured 2.3 watts at the wall: And if you're deciding on which CM5 to buy, more RAM is better, at least if you're looking for raw performance. You can save some money with less RAM, but don't expect the performance numbers on a 2 gig model to match the 8 gig model. The built-in graphics are much faster, too. Just testing with GLMark I saw the score jump from about 750 to 1916. It's not nearly as fast as even an older graphics card, but any improvement is welcome, especially for things like 4K displays. You might've noticed, there was a third module in most of these graphs, except that last one. That's another CM5, this one being made by Radxa. It uses a Rockchip RK3588S2, which is a monster in its own right, beating the Pi on almost every benchmark, including efficiency. The elephant in the room is all the Compute Module clones. Because of the Pi shortages, every SBC maker on the planet built their own Compute Module. Though... some work better than others. A lot are faster than the Pi, but pricing is fairly similar, when you compare RAM and relative performance. The big difference between the Pi and all the others, though, is support. I've written how other SBCs could become Pi-killers—I mean the hardware is often there—but they lack support. One big part of that is the breadth of options for the Pi, which may or may not work on other Compute Modules. And if you want to try, you can expect to debug hardware and OS issues yourself. Like I couldn't get a valid GLMark score for the Radxa, because I couldn't get an OS image to boot and use the built-in Mali GPU in time for this post! It's often a frustrating experience. I regularly test other Compute Modules, though, and I post all my test data and experiences in my sbc-reviews GitHub repo. Hardware - CM5 IO Board Along with the CM5, Raspberry Pi's selling an updated IO board, for $20, with a few helpful changes. First, a power button, with the same behavior as the Pi 5. This would've saved so much time debugging graphics cards on the CM4. Then, there's a new tiny fan header, the same one on the Raspberry Pi 5. Companies like EDAtec already have active coolers for the CM5, and I'll test some cooling options on my my 2nd channel, Level2Jeff. On the port side, they got rid of the 12 volt barrel jack for power, and now they just use USB-C. They dropped down to two multipurpose Camera/Display ports. Each one has 4 lanes of MIPI bandwidth, just like the Pi 5. There are still two full-size HDMI ports, an Ethernet port, and two USB type-A ports, but these are upgraded to USB 3. There's a microSD card that only works on Lite Compute Modules without eMMC, and finally an M.2 slot, with a little LED that blinks when you're using an SSD. This is nice, because probably 99% of people buying these things would plug in storage. On the CM4, you had to use an awkward adapter card, but that's not required anymore. Maybe we could see this on the Pi 5 someday? Or if not, maybe we could hack it using the Compute Module! That's foreshadowing... Hardware - CM5 The feature that'll make the biggest impact for me, since I use a lotta compute modules, is this new silkscreen up in the top corner. It has resistors for the RAM and storage sizes, so the specs are right up top. The major changes from the CM4 include: BCM2712 D0 stepping SoC, with 4x Cortex A76 CPU cores at 2.4 GHz RP1 chip for IO expansion (GPIO, MIPI Camera/Display, 2x USB 3.0 bus, Ethernet) eMMC storage is moved to the bottom of the Compute Module The Wireless chip has been raised up onto a short PCB mezzanine (I believe it can be had separately now, for system integrators, maybe?) The RAM is now an LPDDR4x RAM module, sporting much higher speeds (and on-chip ECC) The Pi 5 PMIC is included on the CM5 board, for USB-C PD negotation or direct 5V input like on the Pi 5 Other things are familiar, like the switchable PCB antenna / u.fl connector, the 2x 200-pin hirose board to board connections, and the Broadcom BCM54210PE (which enables hardware PTP timestamping support). I've been testing the CM5 on various carrier boards, even with eGPUs and 10 Gbps NICs on the official IO Board, and all that testing can be seen in my YouTube video on the CM5. Conclusion But tying up the CM5, Raspberry Pi kept the price the same for the 8 gig model; those start at $75 for the Lite version. For 4 gig, they're going up five bucks, and for 2 gig, it's up 10 bucks, from $35 to $45. They're dropping the 1 gig model from the lineup, and in reality, a lotta applications choke with less than 2 gigs of RAM, so I'm not surprised. When the Compute Module 4 came out, it changed literally everything about the Compute Module. Including the form factor. That meant everything built for the CM1 and CM3 had to be redesigned, and it made many hardware developers angry. Luckily, this time they kept the form factor, meaning for most things, it's a drop-in upgrade, where you get 2-3x faster performance, and at least for the larger models, the same price.

Understandably that's not ideal for a lot of people. reply jacobmarble 22 minutes agorootparentCan you highlight the resources that you used to level up this way?

Brand seems to have more of an impact than speed (or at least the stated speed of the card). Cheap knockoffs will absolutely kill performance. That's why Raspberry Pi started selling their own branded SD cards. Using an external USB3 drive also helps but it's still pretty slow. I found it too slow to use as a SAMBA file server when connected over WiFi, even though it was hardly pushing the CPU or memory. It would regularly fail to transfer large files. One of the main selling points of the Pi 5 is faster IO. I'd love to see something tiny and power-sipping like the Zero but with the enhanced IO of the Pi 5. reply DanielHB 2 hours agorootparentI am using a USB3 drive as a samba drive and it works fine, although I use it mostly for streaming video not to transfer large files.

I/O on the Pi4 and below is awful, but for most applications it doesn't matter. Not sure on the Pi 5 as I jumped ship after the scalping and overall negativity around the foundation's activities in the last few years but I expect it's a fair bit better. reply Joel_Mckay 4 hours agoparentprevIn general, sdcards are slow... most use kernel cache lazy page flush if the pi4 has 8GB ram, and F2FS to improve flash reliability. After, \"sudo apt-get install preload\" it will cause previously used programs from the last session to auto-cache into ram. Combined with the above setting, the usual programs will launch much faster. There is also the option to use an external SSD drive for better performance. Part of the fun of pi4 was getting the OS optimized, but unless you have a legitimate \"Sandisk Extreme Pro U3\" or >30MB/sec rated sdcard it can still be slow (people have seen 4MB/sec on old counterfeit cards.) sdcard bus overclocking is a thing as the pi tries to maximize slow hardware compatibility by default. Note this feature is limited on the pi4, but can significantly decrease boot times on older models. YMMV =) reply thenickdude 5 hours agoprevOnly two total MIPI ports (DSI/CSI, for displays and cameras respectively) compared to 4 ports on the CM4. reply rekoil 8 hours agoprevThis feels like a good place to ask this. Has anyone who sees this attempted to run Home Assistant OS in a Home Assistant Yellow \"compute module board\" using a Radxa CM5? It's tempting to me because the Radxa CM5 uses a mainline kernel instead of the Broadcom-modified kernel the RPi CM4 uses, but I understand that there may be some level of work needed to be done to support the compute module + board combo, and I'm curious if that is true for the Radxa CM5 + Yellow board combo. Or have I misunderstood anything? reply tecleandor 7 hours agoparentI was tempted to do something similar when I got my Yellow because the low availability of the CM4s back then, but it seemed that, at least with older Radxas there were problems with kernels or compatibility.

Jon Brodkin – Nov 26, 2024 8:05 PM211 Credit: Getty ImagesThamrongpat Theerathammakorn Credit: Getty ImagesThamrongpat Theerathammakorn Text settings Lobby groups for Internet service providers claim that ISPs' customer service is so good already that the government shouldn't consider any new regulations to mandate improvements. They also claim ISPs face so much competition that market forces require providers to treat their customers well or lose them to competitors. Cable lobby group NCTA-The Internet & Television Association told the Federal Communications Commission in a filing that \"providing high-quality products and services and a positive customer experience is a competitive necessity in today's robust communications marketplace. To attract and retain customers, NCTA's cable operator members continuously strive to ensure that the customer support they provide is effective and user-friendly. Given these strong marketplace imperatives, new regulations that would micromanage providers’ customer service operations are unnecessary.\" Lobby groups filed comments in response to an FCC review of customer service that was announced last month, before the presidential election. While the FCC's current Democratic leadership is interested in regulating customer service practices, the Republicans who will soon take over opposed the inquiry. USTelecom, which represents telcos such as AT&T and Verizon, said that \"the competitive broadband marketplace leaves providers of broadband and other communications services no choice but to provide their customers with not only high-quality broadband, but also high-quality customer service.\" \"If a provider fails to efficiently resolve an issue, they risk losing not only that customer—and not just for the one service, but potentially for all of the bundled services offered to that customer—but also any prospective customers that come across a negative review online. Because of this, broadband providers know that their success is dependent upon providing and maintaining excellent customer service,\" USTelecom wrote. While the FCC Notice of Inquiry said that providers should \"offer live customer service representative support by phone within a reasonable timeframe,\" USTelecom's filing touted the customer service abilities of AI chatbots. \"AI chat agents will only get better at addressing customers' needs more quickly over time—and if providers fail to provide the customer service and engagement options that their customers expect and fail to resolve their customers' concerns, they may soon find that the consumer is no longer a customer, having switched to another competitive offering,\" the lobby group said. Say what? The lobby groups' description may surprise the many Internet users suffering from little competition and poor customer service, such as CenturyLink users who had to go without service for over a month because of the ISP's failure to fix outages. The FCC received very different takes on the state of ISP customer service from regulators in California and Oregon. The Mt. Hood Cable Regulatory Commission in northwest Oregon, where Comcast is the dominant provider, told the FCC that local residents complain about automated customer service representatives; spending hours on hold while attempting to navigate automated voice systems; billing problems including \"getting charged after cancelling service, unexpected price increases, and being charged for equipment that was returned,\" and service not being restored quickly after outages. The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) told the FCC that it performed a recent analysis finding \"that only a fraction of California households enjoy access to a highly competitive market for [broadband Internet service], with only 26 percent of households having a choice between two or more broadband providers utilizing either cable modem or fiber optic technologies.\" The California agency said the result \"suggests that competitive forces alone are insufficient to guarantee service quality for customers who depend upon these services.\" CPUC said its current rulemaking efforts for California \"will establish standards for service outages, repair response time, and access to live representatives.\" The agency told the FCC that if it adopts new customer service rules for the whole US, it should \"permit state and local governments to set customer service standards that exceed the adopted standards.\" People with disabilities need more help, groups say The FCC also received a filing from several advocacy groups focused on accessibility for people with disabilities. The groups asked for rules \"establishing baseline standards to ensure high-quality DVC [direct video calling for American Sign Language users] across providers, requiring accommodations for consumers returning rental equipment, and ensuring accessible cancellation processes.\" The groups said that \"providers should be required to maintain dedicated, well-trained accessibility teams that are easily reachable via accessible communication channels, including ASL support.\" \"We strongly caution against relying solely on emerging AI technologies without mandating live customer service support,\" the groups said. The FCC's Notice of Inquiry on customer service was approved 3–2 in a party-line vote on October 10. FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said that hundreds of thousands of customers file complaints each year \"because they have run into issues cancelling their service, are saddled with unexpected charges, are upset by unexplained outages, and are frustrated with billing issues they have not been able to resolve on their own. Many describe being stuck in 'doom loops' that make it difficult to get a real person on the line to help with service that needs repair or to address charges they believe are a mistake.\" If the FCC leadership wasn't changing hands, the Notice of Inquiry could be the first step toward a rulemaking. \"We cannot ignore these complaints, especially not when we know that it is possible to do better... We want to help improve the customer experience, understand what tools we have to do so, and what gaps there may be in the law that prevent consumers from having the ability to resolve routine problems quickly, simply, and easily,\" Rosenworcel said. ISPs have a friend in Trump admin But the proceeding won't go any further under incoming Chairman Brendan Carr, a Republican chosen by President-elect Donald Trump. Carr dissented from the Notice of Inquiry, saying that the potential actions explored by the FCC exceed its authority and that the topic should be handled instead by the Federal Trade Commission. Carr said the FCC should work instead on \"freeing up spectrum and eliminating regulatory barriers to deployment\" and that the Notice of Inquiry is part of \"the Biden-Harris Administration's efforts to deflect attention away from the necessary course correction.\" Carr has made it clear that he is interested in regulating broadcast media and social networks more than the telecom companies the FCC traditionally focuses on. Carr wrote a chapter for the conservative Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 in which he criticized the FCC for \"impos[ing] heavy-handed regulation rather than relying on competition and market forces to produce optimal outcomes.\" With Carr at the helm, ISPs are likely to get what they're asking for: No new regulations and elimination of at least some current rules. \"Rather than saddling communications providers with unnecessary, unlawful, and potentially harmful regulation, the Commission should encourage the pro-consumer benefits of competition by reducing the regulatory burdens and disparities that are currently unfairly skewing the marketplace,\" the NCTA told the FCC, arguing that cable companies face more onerous regulations than other communications providers.

In an industry that is a natural monopoly like last-mile internet delivery, then regulators need to step in and work hard to structure the market such that it actually functions properly, with as much competition as possible. In Australia this had the government own the wires, which rented the capacity to companies, that sold internet service to consumers. An actual functioning market with competition, instead of one company owning all the wires for a town/city/state, refusing to rent them to anyone else, and charging sky high rates. reply protocolture 16 hours agoparentNatural Monopoly? Theres a natural Pit and Pipe monopoly, but ISPs are hardly bound to it. The Pit and Pipe asset is a gift from the federal government to Telstra, who sold it to NBN for a steal. There are multiple fibre companies in a lot of our pits. PIPE, Vocus, Optus. They are prevented by legislation from diverting any of that asset towards residential users. The only exception where theres any kind of competition at all, was TPG taking NBN to court over apartment buildings, otherwise its illegal to overbuild NBN. The penalty is quite hefty too. In fact NBN is being directed to overbuild other fibre providers. NBN says, we arent coming to this community. Community organises their own fibre. NBN says hey we actually do want to be in this market now. Now its a legal grey area as to whether the existing provider can continue their rollout. Thats before we get into fixed wireless. I spent 99% of the NBN \"debate\" with a 300M residential fixed wireless service. Shady operators give it a bad name, but a well engineered wireless link is a godsend. We had a functional market in this country. It was ULL. Legislation forced Telstra (through gritted teeth) to sell ULL copper instead of reselling their services. It lead to the largest sharpest increase in internet speeds in this country. The ULL model allows providers to provide their own hardware and upgrade it as demand requires. It removes a middle man from their logical networks. Why we trashed this model for an NBN cost recovery makes no sense. Singapore rents glass, it was a big undertaking and it has been extremely successful. Companies competing to be the first to roll out 5/10/100 gig services. Any discussion in this area needs to acknowledge it is illegal for me to rent pit and run a fibre cable into a residential dwelling thats already serviced by the NBN. There's nothing natural about it. reply polemic 17 hours agoparentprevYup - in NZ the infrastrucutre and the provider were separated as part of the nation-wide fibre-to-the-door rollout. I switched provider the other week, after the old one discontinued a discount. All I had to do was sign up with the new provider and provide the connection number. They organised everything else and my old provider _refunded_ me for part of an unused pro-rata month. Suspicously easy. reply BLKNSLVR 15 hours agorootparentYeah, the Australian Government was never going to structurally separate Telstra because it would have trashed the share price, which would have made them look bad because they were the ones that sold it off to create the Future Fund (public sector pension fund, sort-of). Telstra's behaviour post-privatisation somewhat precipitated the creation of NBNco. reply hilbert42 6 hours agorootparent\"structurally separate Telstra because it would have trashed the share price,\" I've whinged for years about the fact that Australia is the world's expert in fucking up communications services and it has done so for nearly a century, and it's cost the Australian public many billions of dollars (for some reason Oz people are like sheep, unfortunately they let governments and Big Business walk all over them and don't complain). I even challenged HN readers to come up with a country that made a worse mess of its communications and I've had no takers! It's not only the sale of Telstra that governments of both persuasions have fucked up, one only needs to see a litany of disasters with the NBN, and just wait until it's divided up among unscrupulous money-grubbing telcos, the Telstra sale will begin to look benign in comparison. What are my reasons you may well ask. I've said them all previously on HN and elsewhere, the latest only a week or so ago, it's here if you're interested: https://news.ycombinator.com/context?id=42104578 reply rasz 12 hours agorootparentprevSounds as easy as switching phone providers in Poland. reply BLKNSLVR 17 hours agoparentprevAnd how much did the Liberals and Murdoch media hate that? I got my FTTH connection a full ten years later than I would have if they hadn't fucked with the original plan. I can't forgive them for that. It's not even personal, it was holding back the progress of the entire country. The behaviour of Optus and Telstra at the time dictated that the only way to do it properly was to have it done by the government. And they were right, because it was 'for Australia', not for private companies' shareholders. reply marcus_holmes 17 hours agorootparent100% agree. Abbott should be held to account for this forever. The plan wasn't perfect, but the way they messed it up for purely political point-scoring (and keeping Murdoch happy) was criminal. reply protocolture 16 hours agorootparent\"Wasnt Perfect\" is the understatement of a lifetime. reply protocolture 16 hours agorootparentprevThe original plan was killed by the ACCC. You are thinking of the Rod Sims ACCC \"engineered\" plan written by the big 4 telcos (expanding the network to 121 POIs, preventing NBN from competing against fibre backhaul providers, generally making it hell for small players to compete), that would deliver FTTH but not the capacity or competition to make it viable. And we would still be undertaking the physical roll out. The LNP made the last mile worse by some metrics, but they vastly improved the economics. Its a testament to how bad their PR is that they have failed to capitalise on it politically. reply BLKNSLVR 15 hours agorootparentStrongly disagree that they improved the economics at all. I will say that, if they did improve the economics, then I agree that 'something' failed in getting that point across. They did crow about how bad the original economics was, but really just using scare tactics by quoting the large number that out's of the range of reasonable comparison by the average citizen. Most information I read was that they wasted additional money including paying for a lot, like a lot lot, of copper for last mile connections, including paying Telstra for some of their existing copper infrastructure - the dilapidated state of which was part of the reason that FTTH was the proposed solution for 9x% of the Australian population. In fact, it's almost impossible that improved economics making changes and causing the (decade+ in some cases) delay of the rollout of FTTH. One of my favourite pieces of graffiti: https://gadgetguy-assets.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/wor... I'm happy to be told I'm wrong, along with explanations, or if there are mitigating factors to anything I've written above. Edited to add: My rant may be on a different interpretation of 'economics' than which you're referring to. Mine's purely based on the cost of the project - not how it's been charged to ISPs or Customers. Edited to add post-reply below: Thanks for the detailed reply, that's very interesting information that I had read peripheral information around, but was less intimate with. Thanks for taking the time, two thumbs up. reply protocolture 15 hours agorootparentWhen I refer to the economics, I refer to the market that the NBN act creates. This is largely divorced from political spending, like purchasing the Optus HFC network to which you refer. The original labor approved cost for accessing the network made it unreasonable to purchase enough CVC to provide services for customers. Bevan Slattery used to discuss this alot, but NBN had the capability, and in one case threatened to use that capability, to cut off any wholesalers they like. So Bevan was the only one in a place to really publicly criticise them. A gentleman I know wrote a whitepaper about how bad the NBN Fixed Wireless service was and his employer forced him to scour it from the internet after threats from NBN Co. So as to publicly allowed criticism of NBN Co you dont get much other than that. I will see if I can dredge up the numbers. Under labors watch, they assigned engineers and specialists to design a fibre network. It was over engineered (should have been ULL with no active hardware) but we didnt get that. It was to consist of 21 points of interconnect and effectively would have provided an alternative to buying backhaul from Telstra/AAPT etc. The ACCC, after prompting from the big 4, changed the plan to include 121 points of interconnect. NBN co also mandated that Wholesalers be able to reach a very large number of them before they could connect to the system (with a plan for all 121). What they didnt do was change the pricing structure. So now to play ball, you now need 100 more points of presence on your network (very expensive) and you are paying a quite hefty fee for an extremely small amount of CVC. NBN Expected that more CVC would be purchased by providers, but as it worked out, this did not occur. Some providers purchased more CVC just to get started, and then phased it out. Others didnt bother. Ultimately, CVC proved to be lossmaking for ISPs, who at best had a dollar after the customers monthly sub with which to find Support/Hardware/all their other costs. This lead to a significant number of user complaints, regardless of last mile tech. LNP pops in, and they are looking for any way they can \"fix labors mistake\". ISP lobbying finally makes an impact and NBN starts bundling in CVC. The LNP also mostly stop talking about the NBN becoming a return on investment in x years, which takes pressure off of NBNCo to needle ISPs. This is where people with fibre connections started going from just having less dropouts, to having very significant speed increases versus other technology types. ISPs gained a very small amount of breathing room (still heaps of room for improvement) and the economics were somewhat improved. The thing is, the LNP didnt market this success. They went and fiddled around with the rest of the project, bought the optus network etc and campaigned on that nonsense instead. Really if they wanted to they should have done more to highlight and correct the actual failures of the NBN rather than the issues their donors had but w/e. reply hilbert42 6 hours agorootparent\"A gentleman I know wrote a whitepaper about how bad the NBN Fixed Wireless service was and his employer forced him to scour it from the internet after threats from NBN Co.\" I know, this bullying and like threats are just part of a much bigger problem. As I've said in my post to this story, that's just part of a much bigger problem with Australian communications and communications policy. When it comes to Australian governments and communications what we end up with is inevitably some sort of major fuck-up, and often it's monumental. If I were an alien I'd draw the conclusion that Australian people have a congenital abnormality that makes them lose all sense and reason when they hear strings that contain words like 'communications'. What else could it be, the fuck-ups are continuous and span over a century? Methinks, some grad student could likely get a PhD sorting this out and pinning the blame. Oh, but what a horrible job! reply cavisne 14 hours agoparentprevDidn't they end up taxing competitors who didn't use the government owned network? reply jmclnx 18 hours agoprevI first thought \"why did someone submit an onion article\", but it is arstechnica. If there was competition fir ISPs, everyone in my area would move off of comcast the first chance they get. reply prophesi 18 hours agoparentWhat you get from competition is the incentive to lay down fiber optics, so that you attract customers with your higher speeds and can rent the infrastructure to your competition. Though there are other forces at work in urban areas, in my area I know a lot of people out in the 'burbs with fiber optics while those living in the heart of downtown usually only have cable internet at best. Not sure what's happening there, and I imagine is where municipal internet can help (with both the taxpayer dollars and bipartisan buy-in for it). On the customer service front, the painpoint is usually related to mobile networks. It's very painful to switch from one carrier to another, with limited time offers to keep you or upselling when you've decided to join. It's when this spills over into their internet services that I want to get off the grid entirely. reply juliendorra 17 hours agorootparentFrom your post, it seems the European internet and mobile market is much more competitive than the US one. And yet much more regulated. It seems that’s two markets where EU regulations have actually created both enough competition (still not a lot of providers, 3, 4 everywhere) and constraints on the licensees to give us cheap very high speed fiber and painless mobile switch (number portability). Is your city dense? It’s so weird that the center would be left out of fiber when generally that’s where carriers prefer to lay it first. reply nijave 1 hour agorootparentprev>while those living in the heart of downtown usually only have cable internet at best If you're in the U.S. probably exclusive provider revenue share agreements with apartment buildings. The ISP gets exclusive access to the building and the building owner gets a % of ISP revenue. Anecdotally, that rev share can be tens of thousands a year. reply tptacek 18 hours agoparentprevMost people here would not. Comcast is a fun punching bag but for the most part it works fine for most people. Later Sorry, when I said \"here\", I meant (and you couldn't have known without reading my mind) \"in my municipality\", where I'm on the board that manages the ISP contracts and have some knowledge that normal people in fact actually like Comcast fine, are not especially interested in having a bunch of new choices. But we also have AT&T. reply booi 17 hours agorootparentSounds more like Stockholm syndrome. I used to be ok with comcast even with their incessant increasing of rates that i'd have to negotiate and the terrible service. Finally had enough, switched to AT&T fiber. omg. the difference is night and day. No more caps, no more random outages. Lower pings, half the price and no price increase so far. I don't know why anybody keeps it tbh reply nijave 1 hour agorootparentprevMy parents are hitting and exceeding their 1.2TiB data allotment streaming TV shows. I'm considering setting them up with T-Mobile home internet. Data caps alone are extremely anti consumer friendly. It's very difficult for non technical folks to understand how much they're consuming. Especially given the stark different between 1080p and 4k which might not even be obvious depending on their TV and streaming service. reply Loughla 18 hours agorootparentprevWhile I hate it, I agree with you. My in laws are my non-tech bellwether. They use Comcast, and love it. It's zero maintenance, comes bundled with their cable, and provides in person customer support for almost any problem at all at no cost. They're paying more than they should for slow speeds. But they don't care about that. They don't know technology, and their connection plays YouTube and Facebook. reply thayne 15 hours agorootparentprev> But we also have AT&T That might be part of it. When I first moved in, Comcast was the only ISP available. Then the city got municipal fibre. Suddenly, comcast decided to lower prices, and increase speeds. I will say that it was still a pain to cancel my subscription when I switched to the new setvice, though. reply Retric 15 hours agorootparentprevThe underlying technology not the company itself is good enough most people don’t really complain once everything is set up. But for people moving to or from different areas Comcast really comes off much worse than most ISPs. You can notice differences in web browsing above and beyond what the highly gamed “speed tests” suggest. Wait times for a technician are somewhat region dependent, but it’s never great etc. Total prices are high even when they have some competition and get silly when they’re a monopoly. reply voidfunc 18 hours agorootparentprevBingo. You really need to take HN thoughts (or really any nerd haven) with a grain of salt when it comes to _anything_ tech. Lots of strong (often informed) opinions that grounded in a reality that does not exist for most people. reply kasey_junk 18 hours agoparentprevThere is competition in my area and I stay on it. Just as a counter anecdote. reply dmoy 17 hours agorootparentThere is competition in my area and it is way faster, and I did switch But the competition isn't great either, so I get why people don't. The modem/router the other company uses (can't use my own modem) is terrible and their support had no idea what I was talking about when I pointed to the DHCP table full of random shit that it wasn't freeing up, and logs full of DNS errors. And the wifi access points they provided were terrible too (free, but terrible). Eventually I worked around that by just adding my own router in the mix with a (internal 192.168) static IP, cut their DNS out of my router's list of DNS, and used my own wifi access points (which I had from Comcast days). After my third support call I got a tech who provided instructions on putting their router/modem combo into bridge mode, but I'm hesitant to actually go through with that because I have no confidence their support can unwind me if anything goes wrong. Like sibling points out, Comcast does offer faster download speed due to the competition. Still not as fast, but w/e. reply Sabinus 17 hours agorootparentprevThe service you receive is made better just by the presence of competition. reply bix6 17 hours agoprevCox tried to switch me to $100/mo for absolutely no reason.

Monopolies are bogus. reply saghm 9 hours agoparentI'm very unhappy with the only ISP option I have in my apartment. I'll get (physical) spam from other ISPs that don't even offer service in my building, and around once a year I check a ton of common ISPs to see if they've added service to my building, but they never have. Meanwhile, every few months there will randomly be outages in the middle of the day for a few hours, but they always claim after the fact that the outage was shorter than it actually was so I don't qualify for any refund. The one time I tried to chat with their customer service they lied to me about it and then somehow the message asking me \"is there anything else I can help with?\" didn't show up until several minutes after the timestamp that it showed, by which point it came with a follow-up saying they were closing the chat due to a lack of response. reply nijave 1 hour agorootparentMaybe your building has an exclusive contract with the only ISP available. That was the case with our last apartment. There was AT&T fiber running in front and the building was wired with cat5e. I can almost guarantee there was an AT&T fiber ran to a wiring closet somewhere but Spectrum (cable) had an exclusive servicing contract. reply stemlord 12 hours agoparentprevi had the same experience with fios over webchat with a customer service rep-- told them the price increase was too much for me and if there were no other options i'd have to go back to spectrum and they immediately opened up with my original rate again reply georgel 18 hours agoprevIt was interesting to see one of the commenters mention Fort Collins Connexion. I've mentioned them a few times on HN with lots of other locals chiming in, but that service was incredible. I was very sad when I moved to an older apartment complex that refused to allow the buildup and had to go back to Comcast for a year before I moved away. Comcast offered 1.2Gb/s down, which was real, but the second anyone did a small upload, the entire network bogged down to actually unusable speeds (read: HN wouldn't load at all). Cheaper and significantly better service from the municipal ISP than mega-corp. reply leguminous 17 hours agoparentThat sounds like bufferbloat[1]. You can usually address that by using a router that supports active queue management, but it's a little esoteric. Newer versions of DOCSIS also specify support for simple active queue management on the modem, and I think this has become a little bit better in recent years. I used to have Comcast/Xfinity service and they didn't do terribly with regard to bufferbloat. They didn't do well, either, but it used to be much worse. Some of the cable ISPs also have such asymmetric service that you can use most of the upload bandwidth just with ACKs while downloading. They often use ACK suppression to reduce the number ACKs and use the link more efficiently.

Spectrum has already rolled out high split in some markets reply tengwar2 16 hours agoprevOne thing I like about the UK is the concept of regulated competition. The purpose is to ensure that there is always a competitive market place - so for instance in Internet technology, wholesale provider provides DSL layer 1/2 to multiple ISPs, who provide the PPPoA/E termination and value added services (e.g. email). There is often other technology available to the same addresses - cable, FTTP. The result is that for most addresses there is a choice of about 200 ISPs. The one I use (Andrews and Arnold) is expensive, but I have a /28 and a /48, I can run servers, the line is monitored once every second using their custom-build hardware, and I've had them ring me to say there is a fault on the line which will be cleared within half an hour. Also they implement the Shibboleet protocol. I pay for this, and for most consumers it would not be worthwhile - but that's the point. There is genuine competition with real differentiation between ISPs. reply aembleton 9 hours agoparentSmall fibre companies have also been allowed to use Open Reach ducts and telegraph poles to speed up the fibre roll out.

The only time I've come close to the 1TB monthly usage quota is this month, entirely because (for work) I had to download a very large number of docker images, in addition to a normal usage of 500-750GB.

Customer service has nothing to do with it. reply protocolture 18 hours agoprevThere's more to running a good ISP than support. Good service is a bigger driver than customer service. And expectation management is a total lifecycle thing, if you let customers set their own expectations then the service is probably trash by default and your customer support staff will get the blame. The solutions I see are 2 fold. 1. ISP gets completely involved in your home network, any kind of point of demarcation is completely scrapped in favour of optimising your home wifi. 2. ISP provides the best service they possibly can within reason, has good expectation management and is very firm with their demarc. 3. large scale provider with some kind of physical or regulated monopoly and the end users can smoke meat cigars. 1 has very diminishing returns. If you have 300 subscribers and only 5 of them are on dodgy links, you can get very involved with your customers network issues. But this doesnt scale, and when you try to scale you have left customers with all sorts of expectations. Its hard to package too, because theres a push to end call out fees. If you are rolling truck for \"Why facebook slow\" it can literally end your business. reply freeone3000 18 hours agoparentLots of ISPs (at least the Bell and Telus rebrands) are now doing remote-managed “home hubs” with integrated wifi that can be remote managed by the ISP. This solves the call-out problem and also fixes user expectations — and they’re leased not sold, so they can actually be good wifi devices. I don’t personally use them, because “ISP managed wifi” sounds like a bad idea to me, but I can see the value to people who can’t distinguish the above two terms. reply nijave 1 hour agorootparentAssuming the ISPs equipment works correctly. AT&T fiber in the U.S. has apparently had issues for months with a few patches to stabilize things. My Tp-Link Omada AP has better coverage and speed. I setup my parents up with edgerouterx and Tp-Link AP and it's been hands off for the last 1+ years. If ISPs can actually offer decent equipment I think it's a win but that seems like more the exception than norm. Reasonably priced prosumer and small business equipment has been way more stable in my experience. reply protocolture 15 hours agorootparentprevYeah I worked with one of those, a few months after I stopped playing with it, the company dropped the product entirely. Considering it could only be managed through their portal I saw lots of teeth gnashing from providers who had significant numbers in production. > but I can see the value to people who can’t distinguish the above two terms. The issue is that you have both as customers. And having multiple packages with different price points can cause headaches. You really need \"Bad customer brand\" with phat packages for people who cant use tech and \"good customer brand\" that offers a good service with little to no support. And keep them separate as possible. reply Sabinus 17 hours agorootparentprevAs long as it's optional and they still allow BYOD it's a good solution for some customers. reply freeone3000 3 hours agorootparentBYOD barely existed for cable (since DOCSIS specifies ISP remote management as part of the spec) and doesn’t exist at all for fiber.

I told them I was just dropping off the box. Nope. gotta sign in. Ok... one hour later they finally call me up (I have my infant baby in a stroller with me, luckily she didn't get fussy).

You think this would be a good thing, but the CRTC wholesale rates in that regulation are higher than what the big telcos are directly charging to their customers, which makes the smaller competitors unable to compete on price.

When Google Fiber became available here, I immediately subscribed to it (it was significantly cheaper for gigabit speeds). As soon as the fiber was set up, I called Spectrum to cancel my account, and after being bounced around between a couple support people, I was finally transferred to retention where I could have my account properly closed. Except instead of a person, I got a machine telling me that the department was closed for the day, and I should call back Monday (this wasn't even late on a weekend, it was midday Friday). I called back to ask what was wrong and why I was transferred to an empty department, and the support rep told me the last rep should have known and shouldn't have transferred me there, but I would indeed need to wait until Monday. Fine. Monday I call back, get through the layers of reps, and am finally told that they're having an internal outage and won't be able to cancel my account, but they assured me that if I incur any additional charges on my bill because of the delay, they'll be happy to remove them. I don't know how long this \"outage\" is going to last, so I wait a couple days and call back again, very quickly get transferred to where I need to be, and with no pushback or excuses whatsoever get told my account is now cancelled and my bill is all settled up, and to have a good day. Great. I cancel the virtual credit card I used to pay them, since I no longer need it. A month later I get a text from Spectrum telling me they aren't able to bill me, and my service will be interrupted if I don't pay this new bill. I call and support tells me that my account is cancelled, I owe nothing, and to ignore the text. I do make some efforts to verify that the text is actually from Spectrum, and it does seem to be. No indications of a spammer impersonating Spectrum. The next month it happens again, and this time when I call I'm told my account is not cancelled and my service has been suspended because I now owe a couple months of payment plus late fees, and they won't be able to cancel my account until I pay those. They have no record of me cancelling my account, and unfortunately the manager who has the authority to waive the late fees is out today. I'm offered the opportunity to pay the full amount of bogus charges, and wished a good day when I decline. Every month since then they've texted me to let me know that another payment for the month hasn't gone through. Lately the texts have started saying that they will be sent to collections. Part of me hopes they take me to court over it. I think if you asked Spectrum, they would tell you that I'm still a customer of theirs, and that I'm sticking with them because of their excellent customer service. reply Arubis 15 hours agoprevWhen last I had checked, Comcast had a lower customer approval rating than United Airlines.

Switching has significant friction, at least in people’s minds.

The few times I've had to contact them for assistance, I've been very quickly connected with someone clearly _very_ technical who was able to grok my problem immediately and give clear, cogent, respectful debugging advice and perspective. I do not exaggerate when I say I would gladly pay double their current rate just for the peace of mind of knowing that I can depend on them if I ever need their support again. Not that I often do, because their baseline connectivity/speed is also great. ...yes, I know I look like a shill/bot. I don't care.

Your city cannot unreasonably refuse to grant a franchise to another operator, in the unlikely event another operator would like to provide a similar service. These things used to be a government-granted monopoly, but IMHO, the continuing lack of competition stems from market realities. Building a new network in a city that's already covered adequately is hard to justify economically, because switching is a pain, and most of the market can't really tell the difference between providers; and even if you do start to attract customers, the competitor's network likely gets better as you relieve their bottlenecks. Targeting only the areas of the city that aren't well served is likely to not be economically viable either. For one thing, the franchise agreement might have a minimum coverage percent. For another, there are probably reasons the other network doesn't cover those areas; some of which may still apply. And there's the elephant in the room, the incumbent presumably has enough revenue from other areas that they can cross-subsidize network updates and build out to compete where you are. In some ways, this was Google Fiber's market strategy: Google Fiber's corporate goal was to get more people connected at high speeds so that they could load higher quality ads on YouTube and other Google properties. Building out fiber in the Kansas Cities was a way to meet that goal in those cities, but it was a lot of work. By announcing planned cities in early 2014 [1], Google was able to induce incumbents to improve their networks in those cities, reaching their goal before any Google Fiber permits were approved in those cities; then they could wrap it up and end all expansion works. :P [1] https://blog.google/alphabet/exploring-new-cities-for-google... reply tptacek 18 hours agoparentprevWhich city? reply blinded 18 hours agoprevLack of competition is the answer.

By the time I'm no longer paying for utilities, the increased for less performance will not be as expensive. That's not happening any time soon reply bigstrat2003 17 hours agorootparentprev [–] I looked at the Starlink website and it looks like residential service is $120/mo. I pay less than that ($110/mo) for 1 Gbps down and 40 Mbps up from Comcast. They also give me a public v4 IP, not CGNAT like Starlink. My service is quite reliable (I would say I have a few hours' downtime once every year or two), so that part is a wash. The one advantage Starlink has is they offer a /56 to IPv6 customers, not just a /60 that Comcast does. Obviously it varies significantly based on where you are. Different ISPs are different, and even the same provider might be good in one region and bad in another. But for me at least, Starlink would be a terrible choice. They are worse in most every way (sometimes significantly so), and only better in one way. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

I learned more from participating in a few Kaggle competitions (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) than I did from reading about AI. Many folks in the community shared their homework, and by learning how to follow their explanations I developed a much more intuitive understanding of the technology. The first competition had a steep learning curve. I felt it was worth it.

I started from scratch, spent 2-4 hrs per day for 6 months & won a silver in a kaggle NLP competition. Now I use some of it now but not all of it. More than that, I'm quite comfortable with models, understand the costs/benefits/implications etc. I started with Andrew Ng's intro courses, did a bit of fastai, did Karpathy's Zero to Hero fully, all of Kaggle's courses & a few other such things.

I understand regression, PCA, clustering, etc. When I trained a few transformer models (not pretrained) on my native language texts, I was shocked by how rapidly they learn connotations. Unets, GANs, etc were very cool too. I don't find transformer-based LLMs \"magical\". Very useful, yes, but not unsettlingly AGI-like, as I did before learning. I understand the usual way of building recommender systems, embeddings and things.

Part of that is that I don't like the emphasis on GPUs. We're only seeing the SIMD side of deep learning with large matrices and tensors. But there are at least a dozen machine learning approaches that are being neglected, mainly genetic algorithms. Which means that we're perhaps focused too much on implementations and not on core algorithms. It would be like trying to study physics without change of coordinates, Lorentz transformations or calculus. Lots of trees but no forest. To get back to rapid application development in machine learning, I'd like to see a 1000+ core, 1+ GHz CPU with 16+ GBs of core-local ram for under $1000 so that we don't have to manually transpile our algorithms to GPU code. That should have arrived around 2010 but the mobile bubble derailed desktop computing. Today it should be more like 10,000+ cores for that price at current transistor counts, increasing by a factor of about 100 each decade by what's left of Moore's law. We also need better languages. Something like a hybrid of Erlang and Go with always-on auto-parallelization to run our human-readable but embarrassingly parallel code. Short of that, there might be an opportunity to write a transpiler that converts C-style imperative or functional code to existing GPU code like CUDA (MIMD -> SIMD). Julia is the only language I know of even trying to do this. Those are the areas where real work is needed to democratize AI, that SWEs like us may never be able to work on while we're too busy making rent. And the big players like OpenAI and Nvidia have no incentive to pursue them and disrupt themselves. Maybe someone can find a challenging profit where I only see disillusionment, and finally deliver UBI or at least stuff like 3D printed robots that can deliver the resources we need outside of a rigged economy. reply Maro 4 hours agoprevI don't think it's a good idea to kepp up to date at a daily/weekly cadence, unless you somehow directly get paid for it.

Buy O'reilly (and other tech) books as they come out. This will have a lag, but essentially somebody did this research & summarization work, and wrote it up for you in chapters. Note that you don't have to read everything in a book. Also, $50 is a great investment if it saves you 10s of hours of time. 2. Talks on Youtube at conferences by industry leaders, like Yann LeCun, or maintainers of popular libraries, etc. Also, YT videos on the topic that are upvoted/linked. 3. If you're interested in hardcore research, look for review articles on arxiv. 4. Look at tutorials/examples in the documentation/repo of popular ML/AI libraries, like Pytorch. 5. Try to cover your blindspots. One way or another, you'll know how new AI is applied to SWE and related fields. But how is AI applied to perpendicular fields, like designing buildings, composing music, or balancing a budget? Trying to cover these areas will be tougher, because it will be more noisy, as most commenters will be non-experts compared to you. To get a feel for this, do something that feels unnatural, like watch TED talks that seem bullshity, read HBR articles intended for MBAs, and check out what Palantir is doing. reply fallinditch 2 hours agoprevNew short course on FreeCodeCamp YouTube channel looks good - Ollama Course – Build AI Apps Locally https://youtu.be/GWB9ApTPTv4?feature=shared As an aside, does anyone have any ideas about this: there should be an app like an 'auto-RAG' that scrapes RSS feeds and URLs, in addition to ingesting docs, text and content in the normal RAG way. Then you could build AI chat-enabled knowledge resources around specific subjects. Autogenerated summaries and dashboards would provide useful overviews. Perhaps this already exists? reply A4ET8a8uTh0 2 hours agoparent<< there should be an app like an 'auto-RAG' that scrapes RSS feeds and URLs, I am not aware if that exists yet, but the challenge I see with it is rather simple: you get overwhelmed with information really quickly. In other words, you would still need human somewhere in that process to review those scrapes and the quality of that varies widely.

I am a software engineer also trying to make headways into so-called \"AI\", but I have little interest in LLMs. For one, it's suffering from a major hype bubble right now. The second reason is that because of reason one, it has a huge amount of attention from people who study and work on this every day. It's not something I have the time commitment for to compete with that. Lastly, as mentioned, I have no interest in it and my understanding of them leads me to believe they have few interesting applications besides generating a huge amount of noise in society and dumping heat. The Internet, like blogs, articles, and even YouTube, are already being overrun by LLM-generated material that is effectively worthless. I'm not sure of the net positive for LLMs. For me personally, I prefer to work backwards and then forwards. What I mean by that is that I want to understand the basics and fundamentals first. So, I'm, slowly, trying to bone up on my statistics, probability, and information theory and have targeted machine learning books that also take a fundamental approach. There's no end to books in this realm for neural networks, machine learning, etc., so it's hard to recommend beyond what I've just picked, and I'm just getting started anyway.

If the Jevons Paradox (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox) applies in this case - and it may well do so - the new technology will lower costs, and the increased productivity will increase demand. If so, it will require artists to work in a different way but they'll earn more. The Baumol Effect (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baumol_effect) may also lead to increased wages. reply kranke155 8 hours agorootparentNo that won’t happen. Audiovisual entertainment is already beyond capacity. We make more stuff than people have the time to consume it. The idea that this will raise wages is hilarious. I don’t see how that would be possible. reply starfezzy 8 hours agorootparentTbh a lot of art people want money for is garbage, and most money goes to a few corporations anyways. It would be nice to see that system rearranged. Even if there’s more art, money could instead fund artistic ventures people actually want rather than keeping powerful entities afloat/entrenched. Maybe the number of major corporations decreases (towards a permanent handful) as the number of paid artists increases (towards basically everyone who could desire payment for art that’s actually in demand). reply kranke155 7 hours agorootparentA system being rearranged is tempting, and yes, a very likely outcome. Hollywood depends on its advantage in production values, which is quickly being eroded by AI. However, if recent history is a guide, we won't see an increase in the number of paid artists, I'd say looking at the music industry, what we saw was the increase in the number of artists in general, but success seems to me as fickle as ever. Now, apparently, thanks to Ticketmaster monopoly, even live tours barely make any money and musicians are turning to Onlyfans (not porn, just direct support) to make money. So here's the state of the music industry (partially due to unchallenged monopolies): You, for the most part, don't make money making music and distributing it online You don't make money from a live tour either. Amazing outcome for an industry where the cost of production and distribution has collapsed. No one makes money except for the monopolies in streaming (Spotify) and ticketing (Ticketmaster). Without monopoly protections, that's what you get. Thankfully, there's a bit more competition in the audiovisual realm with Youtube and multiple streamers. Still, I don't know what to think about what might happen. Most artists / people in audiovisual production will likely make less money. Some will likely make a lot of money. My (kind of unfounded atm) assumption is that AI will just increase the differences in Paretto distribution of income, making the top 20% very rich and the bottom 80% very poor. Before genAI, you had a very large and vibrant VFX industry, with relatively well paid workers, which is likely to be cut down by huge numbers (it's already been cut by around 50%). reply dsign 6 hours agorootparentprev> Audiovisual entertainment is already beyond capacity. We make more stuff than people have the time to consume it. No we don't. I rarely find anything that I like in Netflix, Amazon Prime or HBO. Those services are stuffed with brain bleach that I don't even find entertaining. There are \"gold nuggets\"[^1] I have enjoyed in those sites, but it's like one or two per year. The rest of my watching time goes to videos of people camping in the wilderness, for lack of a better thing. [^1]: As in, they are entertaining. Rarely, they are imaginative. Even more seldom, they are educational or contribute to my personal growth. reply kranke155 6 hours agorootparentYes we do. You don’t get it. Those programs are made because they make money. Netflix is profitable because it makes shows that X number of people want to see. The number of people like yourself who are underserved by stuff to watch is too low to be profitable - or they don’t know how to make a show that would appeal to this group yet. The dark truth about TV is that it’s what people want to watch. There is no conspiracy. Here is a good Steve Jobs quote on the subject: “ When you’re young, you look at television and think, There’s a conspiracy. The networks have conspired to dumb us down. But when you get a little older, you realize that’s not true. The networks are in business to give people exactly what they want. That’s a far more depressing thought. Conspiracy is optimistic! You can shoot the bastards! We can have a revolution! But the networks are really in business to give people what they want. It’s the truth.” Anyway assuming that an industry screwed up because you personally don’t like their product is pretty incredible. No they didnt screw up. They’re just serving people who aren’t quite like yourself. reply dsign 5 hours agorootparentAnd? Two things can be true at the same time. Deadpool Wolverine was 300 million USD to produce.

Listen to this article · 5:50 min Learn more Share full article “I know a lot of people say it looks funny,” Richard Burton, a letter carrier in Athens, Ga., said of his new electric delivery truck. “It looks like a duck or a platypus. It does. But I tell them it gets the job done. It works for me.” Credit... David Walter Banks for The New York Times By Michael Levenson Nov. 26, 2024 For 19 years, Richard Burton, a letter carrier in Athens, Ga., drove the classic boxy mail truck, with only a fan on the dashboard to keep the cabin cool in the sweltering summer months. A second fan plugged into the cigarette lighter didn’t make much of a difference, he said. But about two months ago, Mr. Burton, 46, became one of the first letter carriers in the United States to get a long-awaited upgrade: a new electric mail truck with air-conditioning, a 360-degree camera and a sliding cargo door on the side that allows the unloading of packages directly onto the sidewalk. “It makes the job easier to do because you’re not sweating bullets out there,” he said. “And in Georgia, you can imagine how hot it gets.” The new mail trucks — 10 years in the making — have started rolling into American neighborhoods, and the early reviews from letter carriers are positive. Many have complained for years that the mail trucks they have been driving, which were introduced in the 1980s, break down frequently and are stiflingly hot, as climate change pushes temperatures to greater extremes. The rear cargo space is so small, they say, that they have to crouch inside to grab packages. Image Mr. Burton adjusts the air conditioning in his Next Generation Delivery Vehicle. His previous truck was equipped only with a dashboard fan to keep him cool in the sweltering Georgia summers. Credit... David Walter Banks for The New York Times Image After the Postal Service was sued over its plans to make most of the new trucks gas-powered, it reversed course in 2022 and said that 75 percent of the vehicles would be electric. Credit... David Walter Banks for The New York Times Image The Postal Service began soliciting ideas for the new trucks from its carriers a decade ago. Some of their suggestions, such as nonslip surfaces and doorstep lights, were incorporated into the final design. Credit... David Walter Banks for The New York Times The Next Generation Delivery Vehicle, as the new truck is called, promises some long-overdue relief. But its appearance has not been universally applauded. It has a giant windshield and a low-slung hood designed to allow drivers of almost any height to see the road. One car enthusiast on YouTube called it “ugly by design.” Ezra Dyer, a columnist for Car and Driver, went further, describing the truck as a “visual abomination.” “It looks like a robot Beluga whale — built by the East German government,” he wrote in 2021, after the design was unveiled. “It also reminds me of the baseball bullpen golf carts that were designed to look like motorized baseball hats.” Mr. Burton said that people on his route have been stopping him to take photos and to ask if they can peek inside. “I know a lot of people say it looks funny,” he said. “It looks like a duck or a platypus. It does. But I tell them it gets the job done. It works for me.” Fans say the design just takes some getting used to. “It is the goofiest thing in the world when you first look at it,” said Douglas Lape, a special assistant to the president of the National Association of Letter Carriers, a union that represents 205,000 postal delivery workers. “But I will tell you, it grows on you.” The mail trucks are the most prominent piece of the Postal Service’s plan to invest $9.6 billion to modernize its fleet of aging delivery vehicles and make them more efficient, safer and better equipped to carry packages. Image Mr. Burton delivering mail in Athens, Ga. He said that people on his route have been stopping him to take photos of his truck and to ask if they can peek inside. Credit... David Walter Banks for The New York Times The Postal Service ordered 50,000 of the new trucks in March 2022, according to Oshkosh Defense, the Wisconsin company that won the contract to produce the vehicles at a plant in Spartanburg, S.C. A month later, attorneys general from 16 states and the District of Columbia, along with five environmental groups and the United Auto Workers union, sued the Postal Service, complaining that most of the new vehicles would be gas-powered, undercutting the fight against climate change. In December 2022, the Postal Service changed course and announced that 75 percent of the new mail trucks would be battery-powered. The trucks are designed to travel about 70 miles on a single charge, more than enough for the 12 to 15 miles of daily driving that city letter carriers generally do, including frequent stops, Mr. Lape said. Brian L. Renfroe, the president of the National Association of Letter Carriers, said that the new trucks have several advantages over the model they are replacing, the Grumman Long Life Vehicle. In addition to air-conditioning — perhaps the most critical upgrade — they have more cargo space, because letter carriers now deliver far more packages and far fewer letters and magazines than they did in the 1980s. The cargo door on the side of the new mail trucks is also safer, Mr. Renfroe said, allowing packages to be unloaded directly onto the curb. The old mail trucks had to be unloaded from the back, which resulted in postal workers’ being injured and even killed when they were hit by oncoming vehicles, Mr. Renfroe said. Planning for the new vehicles started in 2014, when the Postal Service began soliciting ideas from letter carriers. Some of their suggestions were incorporated into the final design, such as nonslip surfaces and lights on the doorsteps, and a third sun visor for the windshield. The trucks also have airbags, automatic emergency braking and a collision-avoidance system — safety features that are common in many new vehicles but were missing from the old vehicles. The new trucks may require some adjustment for letter carriers accustomed to driving the old delivery vehicles. Ykeyler Barnes, a letter carrier in Athens, said when she first got her new electric mail truck, she thought it wasn’t working when she pushed the button to start it. So she called a mechanic to check it out. “He said, ‘It starts — you just can’t hear it because it’s electric,’” Ms. Barnes said. “I thought that was so funny. I came home and told my family and we got a good laugh out of it.” Driving a larger truck took a little getting used to, she said. But Ms. Barnes, who has been delivering mail for 26 years, said that she appreciated the air-conditioning and the additional cargo space, which allows her to walk inside the truck and get packages without having to stoop. She said other letter carriers will also come to appreciate the additional room for packages, especially during the holidays. “You’re going to have to get used to it,” she said. “But once you pass that phase, you’re going to really like it.” Image “It is the goofiest thing in the world when you first look at it,” Douglas Lape, a special assistant to the president of the National Association of Letter Carriers, said of the new truck. “But I will tell you, it grows on you.” Credit...

The problem for me is not that these aren't good paint choices by themselves, but how uniformly dull every car is. Most cars come in 3-4 shades of grey or a dull red, if there is color more often than not it's that wet putty look. I legit felt sad a couple of times looking at a big parking lot and the total lack of color. If people had a variety of color cars, then a few of those wet putty dulled out versions would be part of that variety. There's almost certainly strong market and logistical reasons for this trend, and I bet some HN reader knows why to an unreasonable detail (I'd be interested to hear it!), but it still bums me out. reply shiroiushi 19 hours agorootparentI think there's two parts: 1) A lot of car buyers worry about resale value. For the same reason a house with a purple and pink paint scheme won't sell at top price, a car with strong colors won't either. You might like seeing cars in a variety of colors like bright orange, bright green, etc., but those colors will absolutely turn away a significant fraction of the potential buyers, thus lowering resale value. If you could just press a button inside the car to change its color, it wouldn't be this way, but as it is, repainting a car is prohibitively expensive. 2) Just look at the way people dress these days. Boring colors are in, bright and bold colors are out and generally associated with the 1960s.

No-one is making fun of the new USPS trucks for lack of fuel efficiency, they're saying it looks like a platypus.

Granted, itunes could have also done a much better of unifying the tagging etc with the files to avoid this entire fiasco. reply VogonPoetry 20 hours agorootparentprevI think that making the iPod mount like a filesystem would have had significant impact on other aspects of the device. There is no filesystem level abstraction over USB (or Firewire). So plugging in presents as a hard drive / block device, which then means it needs to have a filesystem. For \"built-in\" cross OS compatibility that means it would be have to be a FAT filesystem. If you change these decisions either a new filesystem or device driver would need to be installed for some machines. Most devices that present a FAT filesystem when plugged in stop working like they do when unplugged. i.e. the device itself and the connected computer cannot access the data at the same time. For the iPod this would mean it wouldn't be possible to play music while syncing. I think it might be possible to build a \"fake\" drive and FAT filesystem when plugged in, but it would take quite a bit of work and have lots of odd corner cases. For example, the user on the computer attempting to re-format the drive, perhaps with a different filesystem. reply mulmen 15 hours agorootparentOk but the iPod could literally act as external storage. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod > Some versions of the iPod can serve as external data storage devices, like other digital music players.

As a result, the average annual maintenance cost exceeds $5,000, with 7% of LLVs exceeding $10,000 annually. Additionally, they are less fuel-efficient and unsuitable for future delivery needs given projected changes in market demand, mail mix, and increasing delivery points.

The fact that junk mail is so common actually reduces the need for cargo capacity since their routes tend to be made long not because of physical volume/distance so much as dwell time (that is, if someone is using EDDM[0] to target a neighborhood, you have to stop at every mailbox in that neighborhood, even if it's just to deliver that one piece of junk mail which will immediately get thrown away, and this takes far more time than delivering a bundle of packages to a handful of houses). I remember reading about the NGDV, and one of the reasons it looks so weird is because USPS wanted a vehicle that was low to the ground (to make it easier to climb in and out of) and easy to see over the hood, even for very short drivers[1]. Given that they are in residential areas (and thus, in proximity of kids playing outside) far more often than UPS/Fedex, I can't say I disagree with that requirement. (Also, if you have a tall truck like UPS and Fedex typically roll, good luck delivering to the average mailbox while staying in your seat.) USPS has certainly evaluated more traditional designs; in fact, they are actively using ~20k Ram ProMasters (a rebadged Fiat Ducato), which are quite similar to the Mercedes Sprinter, alongside ~9k mini vans[2].

That isn't the case at all in my experience. In any neighborhood I've ever lived in, you see at least one van from each organization come through daily. And if anything, UPS and FedEx come through more than once per day sometimes, whereas USPS doesn't. Per your earlier point about freight I can imagine that UPS/FedEx have a lower percentage of company traffic in residential areas than USPS does. But I find it difficult to imagine that the total number of trips to residential areas is lower for them. They simply have more non-residential traffic than USPS, not less residential traffic. reply saltminer 19 hours agorootparentI wish there were publicly available data on this stuff, as we can only discuss anecdotes. In any case, in the neighborhoods I've lived in, it's not uncommon for UPS and Fedex to have zero deliveries at least one day of the week. If Fedex is rolling around twice in one day, it's never the same line (that is, Fedex Express vs Ground/Home; Express incurs a special surcharge for residential deliveries and thus is usually only used by companies that primarily deliver to commercial addresses or who don't care about cost). UPS is similar; usually, they only roll around in the evening, and when they roll around in the morning it's for one package with a specific delivery window obligation. During December, of course, this goes by the wayside. Even USPS will roll around twice a day on the weekends leading up to Christmas. reply mulmen 14 hours agorootparentprev> That isn't the case at all in my experience.

So yeah, you are going to see both in a residential setting but you won't see any USPS trucks making freight deliveries in an industrial area. UPS has to support that use case, USPS doesn't. reply potato3732842 18 hours agoparentprevHaving wrenched more extensively than I want to on the Transit, the Sprinter and the Promaster I would hand out the pork to a defense contractor ten times over before I bought Euro vans of ANY make because at least they tend to build things with margin in the places you need it even if it's not peak comfort and user experience. The engineering culture and default assumptions are completely different and it shows. reply KK7NIL 21 hours agoparentprevDid you not read the article? The NGDVs aren't Sprinter vans, they're purpose made mail delivery vehicles, with ergonomics and cargo space setup for that, which makes a massive difference for the drivers, especially when it comes to repetitive motion injuries, which is a huge cost for USPS.

If you follow the link in your link, you'll see that while new Postal Service trucks are $60,000, the Rivian vans START a $83,000†, and it's simply not possible for the driver of one of those vans to reach a mailbox from inside the vehicle, which is how vast majority of what the new Postal Services will be used.

That doesn't sound smart. † https://rivian.com/fleet reply ggreer 18 hours agorootparentI was just saying that the vehicle is commercially available, not that it was a better option for the US Postal Service. But $83,000 is the retail price. Anyone buying in bulk will get them for significantly cheaper. The $60k for the NGDV is the discounted price for a bulk buy of 50,000, and it's for a mix of ICE and EVs. The ICE vehicles are significantly cheaper to manufacture, so the EV price is probably close to the Rivian's bulk price, and the Rivian has significantly greater capabilities. reply KK7NIL 17 hours agorootparent> Rivian has significantly greater capabilities. According to you, some random tech bro CEO who hasn't delivered hundreds of letters a day for decades and is just looking at cost and going \"hey, this isn't the cheapest option, it must be one of those darn government projects meant to subsidize those annoying poor people!\" In reality, the USPS studied several other options in use by post offices around the world, from commercial vans to tricycles: https://www.uspsoig.gov/sites/default/files/reports/2023-01/...

The use case of a mail carrier is not well suited by a massive eSprinter. They have no need for something so large. They want to be seated at the height where most mailboxes are so they can make many deliveries without getting out of the car.

Maybe something like the Ford eTransit or the Rivian EDV is a better fit for postal deliveries. My point is that other delivery companies and postal services use commercial vehicles, most likely because that's the most cost-effective option. Considering the NGDV's atrocious efficiency, lack of hybrid option, and high unit costs, it seems far more likely that this is a pork project for a defense contractor than that everyone else is doing it wrong. reply unethical_ban 20 hours agorootparentIs it inefficient? Would it be more worthy to have two chassis designs, one for ICE and one for EV, to make it more efficient for the gas version? Would any hybrid drivetrain provide higher efficiency for similar build costs on the same chassis? My point would be that they weighed a lot of design considerations and I assume this is the best they could get that meets all of them. Like others said, other commercial delivery vehicles don't have the same use case as this. Who cares about range when the use case for this vehicle is ~20 miles a day? Everyone else isn't \"doing it wrong\", they're doing it differently, for different needs. reply XorNot 18 hours agorootparentThere's a wider meta point here which is always relevant: nobody comes into work planning to do a bad job. I'd add the second point is: if you're not in the same field, then start with the assumption that the people who's work you're looking at had good reasons for their choices (and that it wasn't a conspiracy). reply mschuster91 21 hours agoparentprev [–] > I wondered why other delivery companies use commercial vehicles instead of NGDVs or LLVs, and the answer is that commercial vehicles are more capable while being significantly cheaper. Commercial vehicles in fleets are leased - they last anywhere from 2-5 years then they're pushed off to the used vehicle market. After 10-15 years they're so done that they'll end up on the scrap yard or shipped off to Africa or Asia. On top of that they're designed to be aerodynamic at highway speeds because they'll spend a lot of their life time on such streets and speeds, whereas these postal trucks will spend most of their time moving like snails. These USPS tanks in contrast are expected to last 30, 40 years like their predecessors, racking up insane mileage... and while no one cares if some underpaid gig worker runs over some child because the child happened to be in the dead spot of his vehicle, if the same happens to USPS the government itself is the target for a nice juicy lawsuit. So it makes sense for a custom order at that scale and expected life time, and it also makes sense to stray from what the market has to offer because the requirements are different. Oh, and commercial delivery doesn't have to take care about its workers. They'll get burned out with their backs and joints ruined, but the companies don't have to pay a dime. In contrast, USPS is a government agency and has a massive financial incentive to keep healthcare costs low. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "title": "Htmy – Async, pure-Python rendering engine",
    "originLink": "https://volfpeter.github.io/htmy/",
    "originBody": "Source code: https://github.com/volfpeter/htmy Documentation and examples: https://volfpeter.github.io/htmy htmy Async, pure-Python rendering engine. Key features Async-first, to let you make the best use of modern async tools. Powerful, React-like context support, so you can avoid prop-drilling. Sync and async function components with decorator syntax. All baseline HTML tags built-in. Markdown support with tools for customization. Async, JSON based internationalization. Built-in, easy to use ErrorBoundary component for graceful error handling. Unopinionated: use the backend, CSS, and JS frameworks of your choice, the way you want to use them. Everything is easily customizable, from the rendering engine to components, formatting and context management. Automatic and customizable property-name conversion from snake case to kebab case. Fully-typed. Installation The package is available on PyPI and can be installed with: $ pip install htmy Concepts The entire library -- from the rendering engine itself to the built-in components -- is built around a few simple protocols and a handful of simple utility classes. This means that you can easily customize, extend, or replace basically everything in the library. Yes, even the rendering engine. The remaining parts will keep working as expected. Also, the library doesn't rely on advanced Python features such as metaclasses or descriptors. There are also no complex base classes and the like. Even a junior engineer could understand, develop, and debug an application that's built with htmy. Components Every class with a sync or async htmy(context: Context) -> Component method is an htmy component (technically an HTMYComponentType). Strings are also components, as well as lists or tuples of HTMYComponentType or string objects. Using this method name enables the conversion of any of your business objects (from TypedDictss or pydantic models to ORM classes) into components without the fear of name collision with other tools. Async support makes it possible to load data or execute async business logic right in your components. This can reduce the amount of boilerplate you need to write in some cases, and also gives you the freedom to split the rendering and non-rendering logic in any way you see fit. Example: from dataclasses import dataclass from htmy import Component, Context, html @dataclass(frozen=True, kw_only=True, slots=True) class User: username: str name: str email: str async def is_admin(self) -> bool: return False class UserRow(User): async def htmy(self, context: Context) -> Component: role = \"admin\" if await self.is_admin() else \"restricted\" return html.tr( html.td(self.username), html.td(self.name), html.td(html.a(self.email, href=f\"mailto:{self.email}\")), html.td(role) ) @dataclass(frozen=True, kw_only=True, slots=True) class UserRows: users: list[User] def htmy(self, context: Context) -> Component: # Note that a list is returned here. A list or tuple of `HTMYComponentTypestr` objects is also a component. return [UserRow(username=u.username, name=u.name, email=u.email) for u in self.users] user_table = html.table( UserRows( users=[ User(username=\"Foo\", name=\"Foo\", email=\"foo@example.com\"), User(username=\"Bar\", name=\"Bar\", email=\"bar@example.com\"), ] ) ) htmy also provides a @component decorator that can be used on sync or async my_component(props: MyProps, context: Context) -> Component functions to convert them into components (preserving the props typing). Here is the same example as above, but with function components: from dataclasses import dataclass from htmy import Component, Context, component, html @dataclass(frozen=True, kw_only=True, slots=True) class User: username: str name: str email: str async def is_admin(self) -> bool: return False @component async def user_row(user: User, context: Context) -> Component: # The first argument of function components is their \"props\", the data they need. # The second argument is the rendering context. role = \"admin\" if await user.is_admin() else \"restricted\" return html.tr( html.td(user.username), html.td(user.name), html.td(html.a(user.email, href=f\"mailto:{user.email}\")), html.td(role) ) @component def user_rows(users: list[User], context: Context) -> Component: # Nothing to await in this component, so it's sync. # Note that we only pass the \"props\" to the user_row() component (well, function component wrapper). # The context will be passed to the wrapper during rendering. return [user_row(user) for user in users] user_table = html.table( user_rows( [ User(username=\"Foo\", name=\"Foo\", email=\"foo@example.com\"), User(username=\"Bar\", name=\"Bar\", email=\"bar@example.com\"), ] ) ) Built-in components htmy has a rich set of built-in utilities and components for both HTML and other use-cases: html module: a complete set of baseline HTML tags. md: MarkdownParser utility and MD component for loading, parsing, converting, and rendering markdown content. i18n: utilities for async, JSON based internationalization. BaseTag, TagWithProps, Tag, WildcardTag: base classes for custom XML tags. ErrorBoundary, Fragment, SafeStr, WithContext: utilities for error handling, component wrappers, context providers, and formatting. Snippet: utility class for loading and customizing document snippets from the file system. etree.ETreeConverter: utility that converts XML to a component tree with support for custom HTMY components. Rendering htmy.HTMY is the built-in, default renderer of the library. If you're using the library in an async web framework like FastAPI, then you're already in an async environment, so you can render components as simply as this: await HTMY().render(my_root_component). If you're trying to run the renderer in a sync environment, like a local script or CLI, then you first need to wrap the renderer in an async task and execute that task with asyncio.run(): import asyncio from htmy import HTMY, html async def render_page() -> None: page = ( html.DOCTYPE.html, html.html( html.body( html.h1(\"Hello World!\"), html.p(\"This page was rendered by \", html.code(\"htmy\")), ), ) ) result = await HTMY().render(page) print(result) if __name__ == \"__main__\": asyncio.run(render_page()) Context As you could see from the code examples above, every component has a context: Context argument, which we haven't used so far. Context is a way to share data with the entire subtree of a component without \"prop drilling\". The context (technically a Mapping) is entirely managed by the renderer. Context provider components (any class with a sync or async htmy_context() -> Context method) add new data to the context to make it available to components in their subtree, and components can simply take what they need from the context. There is no restriction on what can be in the context, it can be used for anything the application needs, for example making the current user, UI preferences, themes, or formatters available to components. In fact, built-in components get their Formatter from the context if it contains one, to make it possible to customize tag property name and value formatting. Here's an example context provider and consumer implementation: import asyncio from htmy import HTMY, Component, ComponentType, Context, component, html class UserContext: def __init__(self, *children: ComponentType, username: str, theme: str) -> None: self._children = children self.username = username self.theme = theme def htmy_context(self) -> Context: # Context provider implementation. return {UserContext: self} def htmy(self, context: Context) -> Component: # Context providers must also be components, as they just # wrap some children components in their context. return self._children @classmethod def from_context(cls, context: Context) -> \"UserContext\": user_context = context[cls] if isinstance(user_context, UserContext): return user_context raise TypeError(\"Invalid user context.\") @component def welcome_page(text: str, context: Context) -> Component: # Get user information from the context. user = UserContext.from_context(context) return ( html.DOCTYPE.html, html.html( html.body( html.h1(text, html.strong(user.username)), data_theme=user.theme, ), ), ) async def render_welcome_page() -> None: page = UserContext( welcome_page(\"Welcome back \"), username=\"John\", theme=\"dark\", ) result = await HTMY().render(page) print(result) if __name__ == \"__main__\": asyncio.run(render_welcome_page()) You can of course rely on the built-in context related utilities like the ContextAware or WithContext classes for convenient and typed context use with less boilerplate code. Formatter As mentioned before, the built-in Formatter class is responsible for tag attribute name and value formatting. You can completely override or extend the built-in formatting behavior simply by extending this class or adding new rules to an instance of it, and then adding the custom instance to the context, either directly in HTMY or HTMY.render(), or in a context provider component. These are default tag attribute formatting rules: Underscores are converted to dashes in attribute names (_ -> -) unless the attribute name starts or ends with an underscore, in which case leading and trailing underscores are removed and the rest of attribute name is preserved. For example data_theme=\"dark\" is converted to data-theme=\"dark\", but _data_theme=\"dark\" will end up as data_theme=\"dark\" in the rendered text. More importantly class_=\"text-danger\", _class=\"text-danger\", _class__=\"text-danger\" are all converted to class=\"text-danger\", and _for=\"my-input\" or for_=\"my_input\" will become for=\"my-input\". bool attribute values are converted to strings (\"true\" and \"false\"). XBool.true attributes values are converted to an empty string, and XBool.false values are skipped (only the attribute name is rendered). date and datetime attribute values are converted to ISO strings. Error boundary The ErrorBoundary component is useful if you want your application to fail gracefully (e.g. display an error message) instead of raising an HTTP error. The error boundary wraps a component component subtree. When the renderer encounters an ErrorBoundary component, it will try to render its wrapped content. If rendering fails with an exception at any point in the ErrorBoundary's subtree, the renderer will automatically fall back to the component you assigned to the ErrorBoundary's fallback property. Optionally, you can define which errors an error boundary can handle, giving you fine control over error handling. Sync or async? In general, a component should be async if it must await some async call inside. If a component executes a potentially \"long-running\" synchronous call, it is strongly recommended to delegate that call to a worker thread an await it (thus making the component async). This can be done for example with anyio's to_thread utility, starlette's (or fastapi's) run_in_threadpool(), and so on. The goal here is to avoid blocking the asyncio event loop, as that can lead to performance issues. In all other cases, it's best to use sync components. Framework integrations FastAPI: FastHX Why At one end of the spectrum, there are the complete application frameworks that combine the server (Python) and client (JavaScript) applications with the entire state management and synchronization into a single Python (an in some cases an additional JavaScript) package. Some of the most popular examples are: Reflex, NiceGUI, ReactPy, and FastUI. The main benefit of these frameworks is rapid application prototyping and a very convenient developer experience (at least as long as you stay within the built-in feature set of the framework). In exchange for that, they are very opinionated (from components to frontend tooling and state management), the underlying engineering is very complex, deployment and scaling can be hard or costly, and they can be hard to migrate away from. Even with these caveats, they can be a very good choice for internal tools and application prototyping. The other end of spectrum -- plain rendering engines -- is dominated by the Jinja templating engine, which is a safe choice as it has been and will be around for a long time. The main drawbacks with Jinja are the lack of good IDE support, the complete lack of static code analysis support, and the (subjectively) ugly syntax. Then there are tools that aim for the middleground, usually by providing most of the benefits and drawbacks of complete application frameworks while leaving state management, client-server communication, and dynamic UI updates for the user to solve, often with some level of HTMX support. This group includes libraries like FastHTML and Ludic. The primary aim of htmy is to be an async, pure-Python rendering engine, which is as simple, maintainable, and customizable as possible, while still providing all the building blocks for (conveniently) creating complex and maintainable applications. Dependencies The library aims to minimze its dependencies. Currently the following dependencies are required: anyio: for async file operations and networking. async-lru: for async caching. markdown: for markdown parsing. Development Use ruff for linting and formatting, mypy for static code analysis, and pytest for testing. The documentation is built with mkdocs-material and mkdocstrings.

I went on to the \"why\" section but I'm having a hard time trying to understand what this is trying to solve. Perhaps a clear and simple example to see why you would use it could be useful. Also I find it extremely verbose to write HTML the way is shown in the examples at the top. Having used Jinja for a very long time, its simplicity and separation from logic makes it almost (for me) the only templating lang that you need to learn in Python. Writing HTML code the way is shown is clearly not for me, but there might be uses cases for it. reply v3ss0n 3 hours agoparentSometimes I want to do things totally pure html, with more dynamicness and more reusability. Jinja template fall short. reply rafram 13 hours agoprevNot clear why HTML rendering needed to be infected with async. None of the example code has a clear need for async - even the `is_admin()` method would be a prefetched property in any reasonable database model. reply scotty79 6 hours agoparentAsync infrastructure allows your stuff to be sync or async. While sync infrastructure forces your stuff to be sync. If anything sync (not async) infects everything you do. Of course it depends if you call the infrastructure (then it's better for it to be sync) of if the infrastructure calls you (then it's better to be async). Rendering engine is something you rarely call, but it often calls your functions. reply rafram 4 hours agorootparentYes, and that’s the worst part of async. That’s why you need to be very strategic about where you introduce it into your code in order to minimize the number of functions it infects, not give up and write a framework that’s all async for no good reason. https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-... reply scotty79 3 hours agorootparentYes. But you should be equally strategic about introducing sync code into your platform. Because making your platform sync basically makes it only be able to call sync functions of your code. It's not that async infects. It's sync that infects and restricts. We are just used to it by default. The fact that we started from sync was the cause of all the trouble of rpc because everything outside of CPU is innately async. So make your utility functions sync whenever you can but make your platforms and frameworks async. reply rafram 2 hours agorootparentI just completely disagree. Async is syntactic sugar that can be reduced to sync code with callbacks. It doesn’t exist on equal footing. If you want to call sync code from async code, you just… call it. If it performs blocking IO, it’ll block, but that’s exactly what it would do if called from other sync code, too. By contrast, calling async code from sync code requires a special blocking wrapper (Python) or unavoidably breaks control flow (JavaScript). reply scotty79 1 hour agorootparent> By contrast, calling async code from sync code requires a special blocking wrapper (Python) ... That's exaclty my point. If you don't have async by default in your platform you need to do stupid things to fake it.

This is actually great. reply gpderetta 1 hour agorootparentprev> would require small revolution that might happen at some point. or python could have blessed gevent and done away with all the nonsense. reply hansvm 11 hours agoparentprevYour counterpoint still naturally involves something like async _somewhere_ (your proposal is just to move it out of the HTML rendering and into an initial data-gathering stage). If you accept that premise then the question is just where the async code goes. While on some level it makes sense for HTML rendering to be a pure function where the inputs are gathered from elsewhere (potentially asynchronously), it looks like htmy wants to make it easy to define hierarchies of components. Instead of `is_admin()`, imagine a dashboard whose layout is stored in a database, supporting configurable charts of various flavors. The heterogeneity of the data supporting different types of charts makes it hard to efficiently pull data in a single SQL query (equivalently, any reasonable database model), so somewhere in your code you're pulling a bunch of data asynchronously, and somewhere else you're rendering it. The question, still, is \"where?\" Going back to the idea of htmy defining hierarchies of components, imagine how annoying it would be to have to manually grab all the data for a \"reporting page\" component only to feed it straight back into the renderer -- either having to duplicate the hierarchial structure when feeding data into the renderer (a technique some UI libraries employ, though I don't like it) -- or having to come up with a method for flattening that hierarchy when instantiating the component (another technique some UI libraries employ, one I like more for small projects and less for large ones). They solve that (to the extent that you think it needs solving) by bundling all that background logic into the components themselves. Did they really need to implement that recursively instead of just walking the hierarchy, gathering the data up-front, and populating it? Eh. The code winds up being similar either way, and either way it definitely forces async back into the middle of HTML rendering. Mind you, that tends to either make some applications hard to build or to cause the framework to explode in complexity over time as people need new and new ways to say \"yes, re-render this thing; no, re-render that other thing, but don't grab its data, ....\" There's enough less particularly annoying code involved though that fat, smart components are a natural place for people to gravitate. Unrelated to htmy completely, a technique I like from time to time even for problems which don't need async per se (and I'm usually using lower-level languages, so the implementation is some sort of more manual continuation pattern, but all those things are basically async, so I won't dwell on the details) is explicitly designing pausable/restartable structures for long-running computations. It's about as easy to write as purely iterative code, and you can run the result as purely iterative with no runtime overhead, so the downsides are low. It opens the door though to easily tuning how long you defer invariant maintenance (too infrequent and your algorithm devolves to the slow thing it's replacing, too frequent and the overhead isn't worth it), easily checkpointing a computation, adding other custom runners for an algorithm (like animating its progress), .... I can absolutely see a use-case for wanting to visualize each step of an HTML rendering, or log OS network counters after each step, and so on. Python's async isn't really the right tool for the job for that (it's hard to modify the runtime to support them without building quite a lot of nonsense from scratch), but async in the abstract isn't bad at all per se. reply mattigames 11 hours agoparentprevImagine you have 2 big components, one fetches from an third-party API and the other from your backend, this way they can load at the same time instead of sequentially. reply anentropic 7 hours agorootparentI was imagining more like you have a Django view that does all the async data fetching and then you hand off the results to a 'dumb' page component that does only rendering I guess the point is to have components know how to fetch their own data, particularly when combining with HTMX and having backend return page fragments that correspond to components. But maybe this makes more sense in React than it does when translating the pattern back to server-side? e.g. same author has this https://github.com/volfpeter/fasthx?tab=readme-ov-file#htmy-... which is doing that, but there's still a 'view' endpoint. Why not put the data fetch code there and have 'dumb' components that don't need to be async? reply rafram 2 hours agorootparentprevBut does it actually work that way? If I `await fetch_from_api()` in the first component before returning the tree with the second component that fetches from my backend, `fetch_from_api()` has to resolve before Htmy finds out about the second component. reply ramon156 11 hours agorootparentprevBecause checking for two conditions is impossible?

It's one of the best toolchains to knock out a small to medium sized project. I guess that fundamentally, it's not scalable at all, or can get messy wrt closing tags and indenting. But with this approach I think you're good on both these aspects? reply johnisgood 6 hours agorootparentFor websites you make for Tor, you would typically go for PHP or OpenResty, as it needs to be JavaScript-free. I personally aim for JavaScript-free projects regardless. Of course if you want client-side whatever, you need JavaScript. reply skeledrew 35 minutes agorootparentJavaScript is optional even on the client side nowadays with the advent of PyScript via WASM, etc. reply v3ss0n 3 hours agoprevThis is what I am looking for.When FastHTML was announced I expected to work like this one but it was with it's own webserver. reply voidUpdate 4 hours agoprevHypertext markup Yanguage? reply 01HNNWZ0MV43FF 12 hours agoprevOh it's server side \"rendering\"? reply Jaxan 9 hours agoparentTo me “rendering engine” also means something else. Namely taking html and rendering it to the screen. reply zupa-hu 4 hours agorootparentConsider updating your vocabulary because the term is often used for both. Note that rendering to the “screen” really means writing bits at a memory range, which is just one interface for displaying things. Html is another, higher level interface these days. reply mixmastamyk 28 minutes agoprevI like the htmy method that an object can render itself, neat idea. But the extra classes for rows etc seems too bureaucratic. reply azinman2 11 hours agoprevBut what do you do use to create dynamic updates on the client side? I’m guessing it still has JS and makes API calls, no? And if so, it seems easier (to me) to just do all of the rendering client side and let the backend just be REST queries. reply mattigames 10 hours agoparentThis is just the static html renderer, it has no JavaScript to update client side, but the author has another project for fastapi + this + htmx: https://github.com/volfpeter/fasthx reply pplante 14 hours agoprevI was looking for something like this a few weeks ago. I typically use Django and hate the template engines limitations. I needed to make some reusable components and the best option available was switching to jinja to get their macro support, bleh. This reminds me of the best part of Flutter UI composition, but in a language I always return to. Have you done any benchmarking? I don't even know what the comparison would be. reply kissgyorgy 11 hours agoparentCheck this out: https://compone.kissgyorgy.me/ Much simpler than this library, components are simply functions, rendered to strings. I made one microbenchmark, it's \"only\" 2x slower than Jinja2 right now, but I know how to make it faster. reply anentropic 8 hours agorootparentif you can make it as fast as jinja2 I'm sold ...I haven't done my own benchmarking but so far I haven't seen any of these HTML-in-Python libs able to report comparable performance I've implemented a bunch of AlpineJS \"components\" as jinja macros in my current project and ... it works, but it's pretty ugly and it sucks not having type safety or ability for the IDE to understand connections between the template and the Python code what I really want is something like JSX/TSX for Python... having gone through this process I can see why that approach is desirable. I kind of feel like libs which mimic the syntax but unable to provide the type-safety/IDE support are missing the point. So although I love the look of \"Python HTML element objects\" approach libs like yours and OP have I think for now it is probably the best way available. for my current project we are pre-compiling all the jinja templates (via Jinja's own utils) for deployment as AWS Lambda I did look into JinjaX but it has its own separate jinja env and secondary template cache and didn't look like it would be easy to plug it into the pre-compile step reply rubenvanwyk 7 hours agorootparent+1 for TSX for Python, that would be great! reply neeleshs 12 hours agoparentprevYou might want to look at django-cotton for components reply ddanieltan 14 hours agoprevHow does this compare with FastHTML? reply revskill 6 hours agoparentSlower because there is no fast in the name. reply globular-toast 1 hour agoprevThere is already htpy: https://htpy.dev/ I have used it in production and like it. For those asking the point is being able to do similar to React JSX components, but on the server side. It's so much nicer to use than templates like Django or Jinja (there might be other reasons, but this is quite clearly the goal of htpy and I assume this too). Just looking at this one briefly it seems to use magic methods on dataclasses. What's the advantage of that over just a function? Seems like unnecessary nesting. reply murkt 14 hours agoprevWould love to see some benchmarks for all these libraries that compare them to Jinja2. reply throwaway314155 14 hours agoprevLooks great. Anyone using this in production? reply DonnyV 2 hours agoprevRendering html is something that needs to happen within 300ms. Anything more and its perceived as lagging. So why would you choose python to do visual rendering? reply nickpsecurity 58 minutes agoparentIt could be useful for content creators that value reusing their Python expertise over other factors. Also, many apps work better when every integrated component is written in the same language. Also, there’s a lot of code in Python for or supporting web programming. Finally, if people use AI auto-complete, many people say they’re more effective at common uses of Python vs other languages or situations. I’ve found the performance issue to be serious in some situations. Fortunately, there’s a number of accelerators for Python code that boost its performance. They range from JIT’s (eg PyPy) to custom VM’s (eg Cinder) to writing fast paths in Cython to Python-to-C++ compilers (eg mycpp). So, you get the productivity and familiarity of Python with performance boosting in many use cases. If it doesn’t work, then it’s better to write that component as an extension in a systems language. reply dcreater 14 hours agoprevIs there a comparison or guide to choosing python frameworks? Every few weeks there's a new one posted here reply eyegor 13 hours agoparentIn the real world, for web things, people use django or fastapi. I'd suggest picking a project with lots of stackoverflow questions and poking around their docs to see which makes you the most comfortable. Personally I tend to favor litestar these days since it has good docs and issues don't sit around for years waiting on one dude to merge prs (fastapi) and it's a lot nicer than django (and I hate django docs). Flask/quart are painful to work with due to horrible documentation in my experience, but they're popular too. Quart is just an async rewrite of flask by the same owners. Litestar has a half baked comparison chart here: https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/ reply fermigier 7 hours agoparentprevNot a comparison, but a fairly comprehensive list that I maintain, with github stars as a proxy for popularity: https://github.com/sfermigier/awesome-python-web-frameworks Note: as you probably know, popularity is not necessarily correlated with \"actively maintained\". For instance, Hug and Sanic are quite popular, but haven't seen a commit for quite a long time. reply devjab 12 hours agoparentprevI think the “rule of thumb” is that none of them are better than using HTMX with templates.

This is not a \"dataclass heavy\" library in any sense, they just used dataclass in the examples to make them shorter. Based on everything I see in the documentation, you should be able to use Pydantic models as well, or standard python objects, or anything else, as long as it has a method `def htmy(self, context: Context) -> Component`. reply franga2000 11 hours agoparentprev [–] Please don't! Pydantic demands 100% type correctness at runtime in a language that can't guarantee basically anything at \"compile\" (lint) time. Screw up one type annotation for one edge case and your entire system turns into one big ValidationError. Dataclasses let you return \"incorrect\" data and that's a good thing. I'd rather get an unexpected None here and there (which can be handled) than have library code crash because the wrong type snuck into a field I don't even care about. As for support, is any explicit support needed? You can Pydantic models into things expecting dataclasses and often the other way around too. reply worthless-trash 10 hours agorootparent [–] Spoken like a true dynamic types programmer.
