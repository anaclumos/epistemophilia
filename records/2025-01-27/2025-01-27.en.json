    "originBody": "It happened on the afternoon of May 4th. A message from a colleague—who has since become a good friend—popped up on my screen, urging me to check my emails. When I opened my inbox, there it was: an email from the COO. The email announced an impending company-wide layoff and mentioned that, within a few minutes, I’d receive another email letting me know whether I was impacted. A short while later, the second email arrived. I was among those affected—along with most of my team. The situation felt surreal. One by one, my colleagues posted in our team chat, confirming they’d been impacted too. Before our accounts were locked, we quickly jumped on a call. We had just 30 minutes to have one final conversation as a team, to say our goodbyes. It was a bittersweet moment, sharing those last words with people I’d worked so closely with. It was difficult to process what was happening. Just ten months earlier, the company had gone through another round of layoffs. And at the beginning of the year, during the company’s kick-off event, the president assured us there wouldn’t be any more layoffs. They even said the company was performing well financially. So, why was this happening? Signs of a Layoff Looking back, my colleagues and I were not entirely surprised by the layoff. There were several warning signs that hinted something was coming. I want to share these signs so you can be better prepared if you ever face a similar situation. 1. Cancellation of Team Events One of the earliest indicators was the sudden cancellation of team events. When I heard from other teams that their off-site events were canceled without any clear explanation, it immediately raised red flags. These cancellations often signal that the company is going to announce something about the team structure and doesn’t want you to be with your team in the same place. This is because one of your teammates—or you—might be impacted, and you’d need to cancel flights, hotels, etc. To avoid dealing with these logistical issues, the company preemptively cancels the event. 2. Unexpected Notifications About Packages Some employees at the company received notifications about packages scheduled to arrive at their homes. This happens because services like DHL notify you through their app when a package is on the way. If your company requires you to return your work equipment, like a laptop, after being laid off, they often arrange for these shipping boxes to be delivered in advance. If you unexpectedly see a notification about a package from your company’s IT provider, it’s a strong sign that a layoff is imminent—and you may be impacted. 3. Lack of Vision from Leadership The absence of a clear vision from leadership is one of the most common signs of an impending layoff. During off-site or kick-off events, you might notice that leaders seem unsure of the company’s direction. When this lack of clarity is followed by team restructuring, and then another restructuring just a few months later, it becomes evident that the leadership is struggling to find focus. Ultimately, this cycle often ends with a layoff, accompanied by yet another round of restructuring for those who remain. 4. Sudden, Vague Meetings Another sign is the appearance of unexpected, vague meetings on your calendar. These meetings are marked as “important” with no clear agenda, and attendance is mandatory. If this happens, it’s often a precursor to a layoff announcement. Public companies, in particular, may choose to send layoff notices via email to align the timing with when they notify investors. 5. Timing Around Quarterly Results If your company is publicly traded, layoffs are frequently announced in conjunction with quarterly earnings reports. This can be especially stressful because, leading up to every financial results announcement, employees may anxiously wait to see if layoffs will accompany the news. If no layoffs are announced, you know you’re safe—for at least one more quarter. You’re Just a Row in an Excel Table When I looked back on my time at the company and all the things I had accomplished, I was surprised to be impacted by the layoffs. It wasn’t because I thought I was better than others—it was because I believed I was doing more than what was expected of me. However, during a layoff, it seems that who you are and what you do doesn’t matter. In most cases, the decision is made by people who don’t even know you. This realization made me question the concept of work, which is part of the reason I’m writing this blog post. I was hired as a Backend Developer. When I joined my team, I noticed a project that needed a developer to implement the client-side feature in React Native. Although I had no prior experience with React Native, I had worked with React before, so I volunteered for the task. I shipped the feature without any issues, received positive feedback from my team and lead, and eventually, my title was changed to Developer, making me a full-stack developer. In some instances, I worked on projects independently, always aligning with my team and ensuring my work was reviewed. I would implement the backend first and then move on to the client-side. This was my expected role, and in performance reviews, I was consistently rated as a high performer. Yet, I was always doing more than what was expected of me. Sometimes, I worked on small features I thought would enhance the app. These features might not have been used by many, but they provided significant value to heavy users. Occasionally, I shipped these under the radar. I created dashboards to measure the impact of my team’s work, helping us focus on features that would bring the most value to users. I also built proof-of-concept features based on user requests to show leadership how easily they could be implemented, advocating for their prioritization. Additionally, I participated in hackdays, creating projects to showcase innovative ideas. On several occasions, I was selected for special projects outside my team. These projects often came directly from the CEO, and I was chosen because I constantly wanted to do more for the company and our users. For some of these projects, I worked more than eight hours a day, including weekends. A few of these initiatives were mentioned in financial reports, praised by the CEO during all-hands meetings, or retweeted multiple times by the CEO on Twitter. Over time, I gained the attention of senior management in my business unit, which consisted of about 400 people. I began directly interacting with the VP of Product and the VP of Engineering, both of whom were four or five levels above me. Occasionally, the VP of Product would message me directly to ask if a feature was feasible to implement. Later, the VP of Engineering started scheduling regular one-on-one meetings with me, which was highly uncommon. During these calls, he told me multiple times that if I continued working at this level, I could quickly climb the ladder to become a Staff Developer. He wasn’t the only one saying this to me. Beyond my immediate role, I also sought ways to contribute to the broader company. Whenever a new tool was introduced, I would explore it, write detailed articles about my findings, and share them to help other teams use the tool more effectively. I referred many friends and former colleagues to the company because I believed in its mission. If I recall correctly, I referred over ten people, four of whom received offers, and three were ultimately hired. I also encouraged many others to consider joining the company. I even initiated discussions about translating our website into Turkish to support the many customers we had in Turkey. A few weeks before the layoff announcement, I was helping a team working on this project find a Turkish-speaking content designer because they noticed my willingness to assist. Additionally, I tried to convince friends who were CTOs at major e-commerce companies to migrate their websites to our platform. Whenever I received job offers from e-commerce companies on LinkedIn, I used those opportunities to promote our platform instead. I passed along leads to the sales team and later noticed that one of those companies had indeed moved to our platform. I’m not sharing all of this to brag but to highlight that, in the end, none of it mattered. On the day I announced I had been laid off, I received numerous messages from colleagues, even those I hadn’t worked with directly, telling me that I had inspired and motivated them. While those messages were heartwarming, they didn’t change the reality: to the company, I was just a row in an Excel sheet. The Broken Trust of Modern Work Layoffs were uncommon when I started working, and being a developer felt like an incredibly safe job. In most professions, the unspoken rule was simple: if you performed well and the company was financially stable, your job was secure. But today, companies are announcing layoffs alongside record-breaking financial results. You work hard, focus on impactful projects, and receive praise from your lead—only to find yourself let go by someone who likely doesn’t even know you exist. It feels as though the trust between companies and employees is now broken. Companies, it seems, are either unaware of this shift or unwilling to address it. And frankly, I’m not sure how they could fix it. What’s particularly strange is that the layoffs predominantly affect individual contributors—the people who have little say in deciding the company’s direction. These are the team members closest to the users, the ones who spend hours planning how to improve the product. But after those plans are made, leadership often swoops in and redirects efforts toward entirely different goals. You trust their judgment, work on their priorities, and deliver on time. Then, when the arbitrary goals they set aren’t met, the company decides to cut staff. Those who made the poor decisions remain, and some are even promoted, while the people carrying out the work are let go. It feels surreal—like an episode from Silicon Valley—but this is how big companies operate. I’m not alone in feeling this way. Many friends and ex-colleagues who’ve been laid off in recent years share similar experiences. They’ve lost trust in their employers. They believe their efforts won’t matter in the long run and anticipate being part of the next layoff cycle. As a result, they only do what’s strictly required to avoid a performance improvement plan. No one goes above and beyond anymore; no one takes initiative to improve things. Why? Because it doesn’t matter. They’ve seen firsthand that it changes nothing. For those like me who’ve experienced layoffs, work has become just that—work. You do what’s assigned, and if your company squanders your potential or forces you to waste time on unnecessary projects, you simply stop caring. You collect your paycheck at the end of the month, and that’s it. This is the new modern work: no more striving to be 40% better every year. The Myth of Job Security in Germany Since I was working for a German entity of a company, I want to address a common myth about job security in Germany. Many people believe that it’s nearly impossible to be fired in Germany. While this is partially true for individuals who have completed their probation period, it doesn’t hold up in the context of layoffs. If a company decides to lay off, for instance, 40 employees, German law doesn’t prevent this. Instead, the law enforces a social scoring system to determine who is affected, prioritizing the protection of the most vulnerable employees, such as those with children. In this sense, when it comes to layoffs, the difference between Germany and the US is minimal. Suggestions for Those Who Haven’t Been Laid Off (Yet) When I talk to friends who were laid off in recent years, we often reflect on what we could have done differently. Here are some of the lessons we’ve learned: Stick to your contract hours. If your contract says 40 hours, work 40 hours—no more, no less. Protect your personal time and well-being. Avoid going above and beyond with initiatives. Many companies encourage impactful work to earn promotions, but instead of chasing internal advancements, focus on switching companies to achieve your next career step. Always keep interviewing. One of the biggest mistakes I’ve seen is stopping interviews after starting a new job, trusting in the company. Instead, continuously explore opportunities so that if a layoff happens, you already have other options lined up. Leverage external offers for salary growth. Companies often resist giving substantial raises to existing employees but pay top dollar for new hires. Regularly interview elsewhere, and if you get an offer with a 20% or higher salary increase, consider taking it. Many people have seen their compensation triple or quadruple this way in just a few years. Don’t overthink your résumé. Worrying about short experiences on your CV isn’t worth it. You can always tailor your résumé—leave out brief roles, or consolidate short-term jobs as freelance experience. Ultimately, your résumé is just a starting point; your skills will be assessed during the interview process. You’ve probably noticed that I didn’t mention the name of the company I was laid off from. That’s because I believe it’s irrelevant. Everything I’ve shared reflects the current state of the tech industry. It might differ at very small companies, but once you work at a company with more than 100 employees, you’ll likely encounter many of the same patterns I’ve described. I’ve wanted to write about this topic for a long time, but it’s been difficult to find the energy. The subject itself is a deep disappointment for me, and every time I reflect on layoffs, it makes me profoundly sad. It’s a stark reminder of how companies treat workers as disposable. Before you join, they go to great lengths to make you feel valued and excited to accept their offer. You meet multiple people, and some even offer signing bonuses. But when layoffs come, you’re reduced to a name on a list. During the exit interview, a random person from the company reads a prepared script and can’t answer your questions. The HR team that once worked to make you feel valued doesn’t even conduct an actual conversation with you. That random person becomes the last connection you have to a company you spent years at. The layoff fundamentally changed how I perceive work now. I don’t think that I’ll be the same person again.",

    "commentBody": "A layoff fundamentally changed how I perceive work (mertbulan.com)717 points by mertbio 10 hours agohidepastfavorite677 comments seanc 4 hours agoI've been in high tech for 30 years, and I've been laid off many times, most often from failed start ups. I _strongly_ disagree with a fully cynical response of working only to contract, leveraging job offers for raises, etc. There are a few reasons for this, but the most concrete is that your behavior in this job has an impact on getting the next one. The author is correct that exemplary performance will not save you from being laid off, but when layoffs come your next job often comes from contacts that you built up from the current job, or jobs before. If people know you are a standout contributor then you will be hired quickly into desirable roles. If people think you are a hired gun who only does the bare minimum that next role will be harder to find. On top of that, carrying around bitterness and cynicism is just bad for you. Pride in good work and pleasure in having an impact on customers and coworkers is good for you. Sometimes that means making dumb business decisions like sacrificing an evening to a company that doesn't care, but IMO that sort of thing is worth it now and then. To be sure, don't give your heart away to a company (I did that exactly once, never again) because a company will never love you back. But your co-workers will. reply maiar 3 hours agoparentIt’s worthwhile to “go above and beyond” for individuals who will help you, who may exist in a company… but never for the company itself. A company is no less and no more than a pile of someone else’s money that will do literally anything, including destroy your life, to become a bigger pile. You should do a good job for individuals who will repay you later on. Companies themselves these days can sod off—they stand for nothing. reply Suppafly 37 minutes agorootparent>It’s worthwhile to “go above and beyond” for individuals who will help you, who may exist in a company… but never for the company itself. That feels like the correct way to think about it. Everyone else seems to think it's one extreme or the other but really thinking about it on an individual level vs a company level seems more accurate to my own experience. reply CydeWeys 2 hours agorootparentprev\"Going above and beyond\" at a big company, if done in a smart strategic way, is the best way to get promoted, and getting promoted results in significantly higher pay. I've gotten promoted twice at my current employer over the years, which has roughly doubled my total compensation, and none of that would have happened had I just did my previous level's responsibilities and nothing beyond. reply bryanlarsen 1 hour agorootparentThat's the exception rather than the rule. Most people have to switch employers to get a significant pay raise. reply edmundsauto 1 hour agorootparentAs with all things, it depends where you are. It’s not the case for big tech employers, who tend to have very clear “levels” and (from what I can tell on levels.fyi) it’s often a 25%+ jump in total comp. And these are the biggest employers of talent. It may not be most people in a startup forum, but it’s a lot of people. For all others, I think it’s because tech isn’t seen as such an important revenue driver. Lots of places we are still seen as a cost center. reply Aqua_Geek 1 hour agorootparentAnecdata, for sure, but my experience working at several big companies in tech is that they won’t significantly bump your pay (and especially not your stock grant!) when they promote you. If anything, they will move you to the minimum of the salary band for the new level. In my experience, you’re better off getting the promo and looking for the next job at your leisure. It sucks that that is what the system rewards, but I certainly don’t fault people for playing the game that is given. reply 9rx 40 minutes agorootparent> that is what the system rewards Commensurate to the risk, of course. If you ignore the risk component then your best bet is to forget having a job and spend your days playing Powerball. The system offers much, much, much greater reward there. If you keep risk in mind then it's not so clear cut. Staying at the job you have, even with lower pay on paper, may end up being the most profitable option in the end. But sometimes you just have to make the gamble and find out! There are winning opportunities for sure. reply HarHarVeryFunny 24 minutes agorootparentprevPay bands for different levels are typically pretty broad, and typically overlap between levels. Just because median pay at level N+1 is significantly higher than at level N, doesn't mean that you will get that being promoted from level N. reply delroth 1 hour agorootparentprev> It’s not the case for big tech employers, who tend to have very clear “levels” and (from what I can tell on levels.fyi) it’s often a 25%+ jump in total comp. You're misinterpreting the data, because you can't see for data points on levels.fyi whether they obtained their reported salary by being promoted within the company or by doing the very common \"side-promotion\" of getting hired at a higher level at a competitor. I was young and naive and unwilling to play the company hopping game, I got promoted from L3 to L6 at Google, after a year and a half at L6 I was paid in base salary less than some of my colleagues who got recently hired at L5 and negotiated well, plus they got significantly higher stock grants as part of their signing bonus (like, around 2x what I was getting through standard yearly grant refreshes). reply compiler-guy 7 minutes agorootparentI've always called that a \"diagonal promotion\" because it's over-and-up. It's also the only way I have ever gotten a significant increase in compensation, responsibility, and title. vkou 4 minutes agorootparentprevThose L5s negotiated a good hiring wage, but would see stagnant growth until they hit the median of wages for level + performance rating in their location. Also since COVID, they've been very aggressively squishing the pay bands. theoreticalmal 1 hour agorootparentprevCydeWays post is very similar to my experience as well reply amykhar 1 hour agorootparentprevI don't think this is true of all companies. My current company doesn't base bonuses on individual contributions, and even went so far as to reduce the number of \"story points\" that top contributors did in sprints so that the rest of the team wouldn't look bad. reply kachapopopow 1 hour agorootparentI don't think that's a good thing? (rest of the team wouldn't look bad part) reply harrison_clarke 2 hours agorootparentprevthat's true with publicly traded C-corporations for private companies, it literally is the people you work with (and whatever legal enchantments they've decided on). some of those people will still fuck you over, but it's not a legally-conjured sentient pile of money the way a C-corp is B-corps are an interesting attempt to avoid being a sentient pile of money. in theory, it's an egregore that is capable of valuing things other than money. (they haven't really been tested in court. and they might fuck you over in pursuit of some other value, even if they do work. or fucking you over for money might not conflict with its other values) reply sertsa 1 hour agorootparentWas not familiar with the terms C & B corp. For others in the same boat: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_Corporation_(certification) https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/c-corporation.asp reply harrison_clarke 1 hour agorootparentturns out, i actually meant benefit corporation.

Sometimes that means making dumb business decisions like sacrificing an evening to a company that doesn't care... Right. The company doesn't care. But I do. I don't work hard on my craft, push myself to be better/smarter/have more impact, or go above and beyond for my employer. I do it for myself. reply harimau777 2 hours agorootparentMy experience has been that caring about your craft is a great way to get in trouble. As a previous co-worker once told me \"it turns out that the less I care about this job the more happy my managers are with my performance.\" reply toyg 1 hour agorootparentThat's because time pressure is real. We can't all be Knuth and spend our life looking for the perfect algorithm to solve all problems we could ever have. Most of us must ship something that works well enough for a particular scenario, as soon as possible tomorrow, next week, next month, not next year. If you care too much about the quality of your work, you might end up never shipping; at some point you have to stop caring and just push the damn button. reply jacobgkau 1 hour agorootparentIt's not always time pressure. It can also be, for example, calling out others for doing things that don't make sense or hinder what's actually needed for the job/company, which in turn makes them uncomfortable and leads to discipline for you and not them. My response after having that happen? Fine, I'll look the other way and not care how much we're getting done anymore. reply awkward 1 hour agorootparentprevThere is an exact and correct amount to care. It varies job to job. It's mostly a matter of just turning the big dial inside yourself until you get it in the sweet spot for where you are now. reply disqard 45 minutes agorootparentThis is the wise, pragmatic answer indeed! Find the Middle Path. Neither extreme is correct. Doing the absolute bare minimum to not get PIP'ed is corrosive to your own soul. Going \"above and beyond\" when you might get laid off tomorrow, is naive and opening yourself up for exploitation. reply ruszki 1 hour agorootparentprevI have the same exact experience at my current company. My official performance, which is given by my boss, improved since I started to not care. My output fell, the quality of my work is the same, just less quantity, but for some reason my scores are higher. On the other hand, I had a job where my performance was rewarded greatly, and I was lucky to be at the right place for that. Almost all of the employees at the same company were not that lucky. reply SlightlyLeftPad 2 hours agorootparentprevWas that before or after “the consultants?” reply v3xro 2 hours agorootparentprevIndeed. Although I find it increasingly hard to find work that aligns with my expectations about technical excellency (too many companies chasing big returns on half-finished products for example) or even methods of creating software. This is hard to manage from a personal perspective but I guess life goes on... I wholeheartedly agree with the author life's too short to be wasted on work that may get you some good words in one quarter and not matter the next. reply akudha 33 minutes agorootparentprevThe quicker we make peace with the fact that hard work alone will not get us ahead (in most cases) the better it is for our mental health. We can put as much effort into our jobs as long as we accept that the only guaranteed result is our own joy, pride in our work and nothing else (not even a thank you from suits) is guaranteed. If we are not able to accept that, then just do the bare minimum like most people. OR find a better job, but there is still no guarantee the new job would actually be better than the old job. But hey, at least we might get more compensation in our new job, so there's that reply trentnix 2 hours agorootparentprevWell said. reply _heimdall 3 hours agoparentprevI draw the line at doing work that I can be proud of. That doesn't mean going out of my way and overworking myself, but it does mean being a good person to work with and writing quality code. I tend to stick to the scope of work asked of me (though not always) for the reasons in the article, but I don't just phone it in. I put effort into writing good code, tests, and PR reviews. In my experience, when it comes to getting the next job the only thing that really matters either way are references. If you were a too co-worker and did at least put in the effort to do good work within bounds of the scope asked for, you shouldn't have a problem. reply apercu 3 hours agorootparent> I draw the line at doing work that I can be proud of. That's important. I spend more awake time working/thinking about work than really else. I don't know that it's healthy, but at least I want to be proud of the outputs if I am going to spend this much time on something. I just can't really show up and mail it in, I'm just not wired that way, and suspect that a lot if us aren't. reply djtriptych 2 hours agorootparentprevYeah this is super important IMO. Set your own standards for what that means. Makes it much easier to handle the slings and arrows of normal 9-5 headaches, and to understand when you're being pressed to do things you wouldn't be proud of. reply nelblu 3 hours agoparentprevI agree with your comment. I have never been laid off, and I hope I don't ever do or at least I see the signs early on to be prepared. The way I see \"work\" is that you are going to spend 8hrs of your day doing it, so you better feel positive about it and enjoy it. I couldn't care less about the corporate lords and I very well know I am just a line on an excel, but when I work I want to be sure I feel satisfied, I enjoy it and build trust with my team and meaningful relationships where possible. I am not a religious person, but there is a famous saying in Hinduism कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचनमा कर्मफलहेतुर्भूर्मा ते सङ्गोऽस्त्वकर्मणि|| It roughly translates to \"You have a right to perform your prescribed duties, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your actions. Never consider yourself to be the cause of the results of your activities, nor be attached to inaction.\" I love the last line of it where it says \"don't be attached to inaction\" which means just because the fruit of labour isn't in your control, doesn't mean you can just start behaving like a someone who doesn't care. reply sam0x17 3 hours agoparentprev> There are a few reasons for this, but the most concrete is that your behavior in this job has an impact on getting the next one This is completely false. I literally haven't seen someone do a reference check once in the last 10 years. Early 2010s it was more common but this practice is dead. Now every company is a new slate. In fact, I've seen people repeatedly rewarded for jumping ship and build there career on that. Companies have stopped investing in devs, so why should devs not reciprocate? And there are so many startups. More than you can count. There are more new ones every day than you could ever have time to apply to. They don't all have time to talk to each other. Not saying it's not good to have pride in your work, but within reason, and within a framework of fairness and quid pro quo. Don't let people exploit you any more than you exploit them. Employment is 100% transactional and the moment you forget that is the moment you get taken advantage of. reply wing-_-nuts 5 minutes agorootparentI'm not sure which market you're in, but companies here absolutely do reference checks. They will even reach out people you didn't list if they're a shared connection. My standing recommendation to everyone is to do good work and get better at advocating for yourself to make sure you're either getting the experience or the comp you need to achieve your goals. If you're not getting that, switch jobs. It's much much better to switch jobs every few years if that's what you need to stay motivated than to stay, do the minimum and collect a paycheck. reply AlunAlun 2 hours agorootparentprev> This is completely false. It's not completely false at all but it does depend greatly depends on which country you're based in. Where I am, in Spain, your network, and your reputation within it, are _everything_. Good jobs will sometimes not even be advertised, as the first thing a hirer will do is ask around their network for recommendations, and those recommendations count for _a lot_. On the other side, when you are looking for work, the first thing you do is ask your network for an intro and again, that intro counts for a lot. That's not to say that the traditional interview process will be skipped, but candidates coming from recommendations will have a massive head-start over others. reply monsieurbanana 25 minutes agorootparentWell... That doesn't bode well for me. I'm in Spain but I've always worked for companies in other countries (including my current remote job). reply rmah 2 hours agorootparentprevIt's not about references. It's about building a network of colleagues who respect you and your work. Many years ago, when I started doing consulting/contracting work, literally all my of my jobs came through people I had previously worked for or with across a variety of companies. And if you play your cards right, as the years roll on, you won't even have to apply for jobs other than as a formality. Instead, people who's respect you've gained will try to bring you into where they work. reply whoknowsidont 55 minutes agorootparent> It's about building a network of colleagues who respect you and your work. The network is actually holding you back. You don't need a network to get a new job AND if that person in another company has enough pull to get you in it's actually likely a sign they've been there too long themselves if they're not directly in control of the hiring budget. Just job hop. This ain't your daddy's profession. reply collingreen 2 hours agorootparentprevTheir point wasn't reference checks it was the power of a network of people who want to work with you again because they know your work is more than just transactional. reply sokoloff 2 hours agorootparentprevThe effect’s source is much more direct than that. It’s not a reference check to see “is sam0x17 a good dev?” at the end of a hiring pipeline, but rather “I’ve got an open role and remember that sam0x17 is one of the best devs I’ve ever worked with; let’s get them into the company!” reply ghaff 20 minutes agorootparentOr you can drop a line to someone who you've worked with in some manner and ask to meet. That's how I got my last 14-year job. reply CydeWeys 2 hours agorootparentprevThey're talking about referrals, not reference checks. Getting good referrals is hugely important, especially at smaller companies that don't the capacity to do a rigorous hiring process. reply educasean 1 hour agorootparentprevI spent the last few months interviewing at various bay area startups for senior SE roles. About half of them wanted references. This was my experience so YMMV reply ghaff 19 minutes agorootparentA lot of companies tend to ask for them. No idea how many actually follow through and contact them. reply hobs 6 minutes agorootparentprevIt happens all the time as you get higher and higher on the org tree, I had jobs not only call my references by ask if they could also speak to my former bosses. When the money is seriously on the line people care. reply knowitnone 59 minutes agorootparentprevreference checks are pointless if employee gives you a list of favorable references reply the_af 57 minutes agorootparentprev> This is completely false. I literally haven't seen someone do a reference check once in the last 10 years. I understand this might not be your experience, but it's far from being \"completely false\". I have had background checks/reference checks done on me (thankfully my would-be boss told me they were a formality and nobody cared about the results. I say \"thankfully\" not because I had anything to hide, but because the contractors doing the background checks asked for the dumbest things). I was also contacted by US-based consulting firms and asked to give references on a former boss of mine, who was now applying for a engineering position... and to my surprise, the reference check involved getting on a call with me! More recently, a relative was applying to a fintech and was asked for references for all her pasts jobs since she started working in the relevant field. I know lots of companies don't care, but many others do. Besides, like other commenters said, it's not only about formal references checking. It's also about the networks you build with coworkers whom you can potentially meet again in other jobs, and whom you want to speak favorably of you. I know I've informally vetoed coworkers whom I knew were terrible at their jobs and I heard recruiting was thinking of making an offer to.

You might have limited options for companies and teams, based on who is in your network. If the job market is abundant then having a strong referral is less valuable, but is often the best path to more senior positions. If the job market is not abundant then a job referral might be a way to be placed in a position in weeks instead of months. reply ryandrake 3 hours agorootparentI keep hearing about these \"network placed\" jobs on HN, but in 25 years, I've never seen it myself.

And when I tried to refer someone, they were blissfully ignored. Even had managers / HR go after me: \"we need someone ASAP, don't you have some referrals?\". Reached my acquaintances among former workmates, convinced them to make a personalized CV so I can send it to HR, nothing happened next. They didn't even call the guy, completely \"forget about it\".

If you're working for a startup, a layoff is a likely outcome. Most startups fail. Those that don't often end up pivoting, often more than once, and cutting costs tends to go hand in hand with that. Layoffs from big tech companies is a relatively new phenomenon, really only since the pandemic, and they're fundamentally different. It's actually the sort of thing that Corporate America has been doing for decades. In this case, big tech companies make money hand over fist yet they have layoffs, typically ~5% of the workforce every year. These layoffs will be perpetual because the reasons for them aren't around controlling costs, avoiding bankruptcy or any of the \"normal\" reasons for layoffs. The goal is suppress labor costs. People fearful for their jobs aren't demanding raises or better benefits. Plus you can dump the work the 5% were doing onto the remaining 95% who won't say no because they're fearful for their own jobs. And that's the point. The veneer of tech companies being mavericks who were employee-focused is completely over. A lot of the \"perks\", which are really just part of your cojmpensation package, are getting and will continue to get cut or just made worse through less funding. At some point, you'll start getting charged for those \"free\" meals. In 10 years, all the big tech companies will be indistinguishable from Boeing, Lockheed Martin or Northrop Grumman. reply matrix87 1 hour agorootparentActual salaries haven't fallen.

Your base salary won't tend to drop but at the same time you'll get an annual 1.5% increase when inflation is 9% and the company made $300 billion in profits last year. Bonuses for normal employees (below VP) are essentially formulaic at most big tech companies, for the most part. So if you're a senior SWE with a 15% bonus target, well that's based on yoru base salary. It hasn't gone down in nominal terms but it has in real terms. Also, depending on your company, there's a pool of discretionary funds on top of the formula. Your bonus can even be taken away and given to someone else on the team (yes, this happens). How big is that pool? Has it increased over time? Decreased? Or stayed the same? On a per-employee basis. You don't have visibility into that unless you're a manager. Next is stock compensation. Your initial grant is obviously known. Annual refreshes if you get them tend to be formulaic too. But what about discretionary grants? That's where the big money is. How much is being thrown around in total? Is it going up or down over time? You have no visibility into that. All of the above have, as input, your performance ratings. There are quotas for each performance level at a certain level (usually 150+ people or director level) so not everyone gets Greatly Exceeds Expectations. What are the quotas (\"target percentages\") for each bucket? Has that changed over time? Some compoanies now have targets for subpar ratings (ie ratings below \"Meets Expectations\"). It's the pipeline for getting rid of people and getting people to do more for the same money. So technically you have to do more now to maintain a Meets Expectation rating than you did 5 or 10 years ago. Is that a pay cut? And then we have promotions. The typical way this works is a company will divide promotion candidates into pools. A promotion committee will essentially rank the packets they have. At a certain level there is a quota for promotions to hand out. Those get distributed to those from the top down until there are no promotions left to give out. Companies have allegedly reduced costs by simply reducing the promotion target percentages / quotas. And then there are all the benefits that have a tendency to get worse over time. Health sinsurance, 401k matching and less tangible benefits like food, facilities and so on. reply matrix87 21 minutes agorootparentBut supposing this happens across the economy, there's less inflation.

He just liked to code and that was his entire life. Well, his manager gave him some public praise once over E-mail, basically saying the project was moving along much faster due to how productive you are. That's all it took. Suddenly, the whole team felt pressure to pull 60-80 hour weeks and burn themselves out. And we didn't really get that much more done, because it was 80 low-quality burned out, demoralized hours, not 40 high-quality hours.

The manager's job is to take the unnecessary burden of externalities off the rest of the team, but it is a team and that means it has to cut both ways. The rest of the team has to take the unnecessary burden of internality off the manager.

During the pay freeze a colleague suggested that we might save a significant amount of money by hiring staff, rather than paying the large number of consultants we had hired. I think the ration was something like getting rid of two consultants would free enough money to hire three developers. Managements take was that we should keep the consultants, because they where much easier to fire, two weeks notice, compared to four. So it was \"better\" to have consultants. My colleague pointed out that the majority of our consultants had been with us for 5+ years at that point and any cancelling of their contracts was probably more than 4 weeks out anyway.

I was reluctant to do the interview in the first place, because they'd gone bankrupt TWICE in the past five years. At the end of the interview, it seemed fairly clear that my odds of getting the job were about 50/50. The interviewers were smart and they were asking hard questions. But when I asked them to comment on their two recent bankruptcies, it changed the mood entirely. At that point, the entire \"vibe\" of the interview shifted. It became CLEAR that they'd been losing employees at a furious pace, because of their financial struggles. Once we talked about \"the elephant in the room,\" the entire interview tone changed, and they made me an offer in less than twelve hours. My \"hunch\" is that they'd been grilling interviewees (because they were smart folks) but had been scaring interviewees off because they were in such terrible financial shape.

This may vary due to region. For example in the U.S where you can fire people quickly the contractor benefit is less apparent, but in EU where after a short period you may have to spend a long time to fire someone it may be beneficial to hire a contractor rather than going through a lengthy hiring process only to find out you want to fire them. Contractors in such an environment often are a reasonable investment for a project that has a particular dedicated timeline. Like we expect 1 year for project to finish. We hire for 1 year, and opportunity to extend for 3 months 2 times in case it goes bad. Otherwise you have to hire for project and then do these layoffs everybody here is complaining about. Furthermore in EU if you are paying 10000 for an employee, you probably have extra fees on top of that so you are paying 14000 (estimation) then for contractor you are not paying 28000, but 20000. The pricing is not great, but there are lots of factors that can make it seem more attractive than it might appear on its face. Finally, Contractors tend not to do any of this quiet quitting or whatever, probably because for them it is more a business and they are also earning significantly more that makes it an interesting business to be in and to maintain. reply cultureswitch 2 hours agorootparentIn my experience long time contractors will absolutely \"quiet quit\" if put into the same catch-22 situations that push employees to do this. The main difference at least in my region is that if you're a contractor then it's much quicker for you to quit and find a better job so the incentive to stay isn't as strong.

Then all you have to do is give them notice (or pay the salary out immediately if you want to get rid of them immediately). Paying double so you can fire contractors is illogical. The maximum amount of notice you can be legally entitled to is 7 months, after working 20 damn years at a single company, which means at worst the company would have to pay half your salary out a single time to get rid of you immediately. None of this 2x every year multi-year bullshit. The reason why you hire contractors is that you do not need the full output of an employee. You might only need three months or maybe just a week.

But if you do that you have to consider the social circumstances of the employee and also other comparable employees.

That could be really disruptive, so it is not quite so easy for German employers. reply bryanrasmussen 2 hours agorootparentprev> The maximum amount of notice you can be legally entitled to is 7 months I believe the maximum amount of notice you can be legally entitled to as a contractor is whatever your contract says reply Olreich 5 hours agorootparentprevIt’s all about accounting for the spend.

If you can reduce your operating expenses by 200k, but increase your capital expenditure by 400k, you’ve reduced overall profit in order to increase growth potential because your investing 400k into new stuff that will bring in more revenue. This strategy cannot work long term unless there is growth happening elsewhere in the company to make up for the excess money burned on contractors and reduced number of employees. But it can definitely work short term if the growth numbers for the quarter are going to look bad, and it has the benefit of giving management someone else to blame when the project work doesn’t get done.

Depending of course on how long I live statistically I will die sometime between 60 and 100 with the most likely age being 80 the longer I live the more than pension is worth, on the low end it is worthless. That said, when the no raise hit I made my boss aware of my displeasure in that (As a senior engineer at the top of the pay scale I expect my raises should just match inflation, but no raise is a clear pay cut).

In the latter case, you don’t usually get let go as soon as there is no work for you ie when you are “on the bench”. Even if you are a more junior employee at the latter company where you are more hands on keyboard than flying out to meet customers and sometimes you might even be doing staff augmentation for the client, it still feels differently.

But certainly we should invite \"Sheryl from accounting\" who is technically a contractor, or the janitor who works for the landlord. These people are coworkers, whether or not our paychecks have the same signature on them. reply scarface_74 2 hours agorootparentIf you were working with a general contractor where you signed a contract with them and they just went out and led the work and kept you updated with statuses, would you invite them? Would you invite the subcontractors? The actual construction workers? This how true “consulting companies” work. You sign a statement of work with the requirements and costs and then they (we) go off and take care of staffing and lead the project. Your company will probably never interact with anyone besides sales, the tech lead and maybe the people over sub projects of the larger project (work streams) and their leads. reply ElevenLathe 2 hours agorootparentOK sure, but I never once mentioned any of this and have no idea what the social customs are around hiring general contractors to build buildings or asking CIA-adjacent consulting companies how to jack up the price of bread. I just know that half my coworkers have a slightly different email address for \"legal reasons\", and they aren't allowed to come to the Christmas party. This is, in my opinion, simply mean. Basically we seem to have invented a kind of at-will apartheid that 0.0001% of the population understand and even fewer benefit from. reply scarface_74 1 hour agorootparentThat’s staff augmentation which is completely different. If your company doesn’t know anything about Salesforce for instance and you just need a one off large project, you are going to hire a consulting company to go off and do the work and leave. It doesn’t make sense to build the competencies in house if that’s not your core line of business’s I left our part of my explanation of a general contractor. I meant when you are having a physical structure built like a house or in the case the analogy would be adding on to your office building reply ElevenLathe 1 hour agorootparentOK, have a good day. Hope you're feeling well. reply close04 5 hours agorootparentprevMany companies use consultants as easier-to-fire employees. I've occasionally worked with the same consultants for years, with them acting as team mates doing the same work as every other internal. And we were team mates in everything work related, except the parties. I understand the contractual and financial logic but from the human perspective excluding the people who are otherwise just as much part of the team as anyone else is definitely eyebrow raising. reply scarface_74 4 hours agorootparentI’ll admit “consulting” is an overloaded term. I have worked for third party consulting companies for 5 years. Companies hire my company to do a job or issue guidance and then leave. If I am on the bench, I still get paid. I report status to the client company and they are ultimately responsible for signing off on work. But they don’t manage my work. I’m not embedded into their team, we might embed them into our team. But at the end of the day, we are leading the projects. Then you have staff augmentation “consultants” like you are referring to. I saw both sides a few years ago when I was the dev lead for a company. We hired both staff augmentation “consultants” where we paid the contracting agency $90/hour and the end consultant got $60-$65 and we also paid the AWS consulting companies $160/hour and I have no idea what they got paid. But it was a lot more. That’s what made me work on pivoting to cloud consulting in 2018. I didn’t know AWS when we hired the consultants. reply seb1204 6 hours agorootparentprevWhy is that ridiculous? Contractors are not employees, so why should they be invited to a give thanks party for employees? Become an employee if you want to partake. Feelings of entitlement are wrong here. Decency though tells us to invite everyone. reply guenthert 6 hours agorootparent> Become an employee if you want to partake. It's not necessarily up to them. reply Keyframe 6 hours agorootparentprevI don't know. We get to invite clients and all the other business partners, why not contractors and people that work for them with us on a project? reply BizarreByte 1 hour agorootparentprev> Feelings of entitlement are wrong here. How dare people have feelings right? A lot of contractors (like myself) are treated like employees who are easier to fire. I understand the separation from a legal perspective, but at the same time I've developed relationships with the people I work with and enjoy working with them. Being entirely honest? It hurts being excluded from things and not everyone has the option to just \"become an employee\". reply watwut 6 hours agorootparentprevChristmas part is not special \"give thanks to employees\" party, it is more of end of a year party. It makes perfect sense to invite contractors. Even if it was \"give thanks\" party, contractors worked on projects. reply andyjohnson0 5 hours agorootparentI remember a work Christmas party attended by a contractor. The company was an sme and as usual we closed the office at mid-day and headed for a local restaurant to eat and socialise. The contractor as chatty and sociable, and seemed happy to be dining on the company's bill. Wine flowed. Then at the stoke of 5pm, as we permies were discussing which pub to move on to, the contractor stood up, mumbled his thanks, and left.

The only actual reason is to divide and conquer and prevent them being part of any employee unionization. reply jajko 4 hours agorootparentprevI've been a consultant/contractor, less than 4 months in, and I still have been invited to (great) Christmas party, and even shared paid buses that took whole company and also given free accommodation. Human decency is human decency, nothing more to that. reply wholinator2 6 hours agorootparentprevYeah, that's the line at a Christmas work party. Is it about Christmas, or is it about work reply Propelloni 6 hours agorootparentprevThat's a manifestation of your specific environment and not a general rule. I guess it is the work of some overeager compliance department, because it is the kind of overreacting self-mutilation that happens if people do not understand a law and want to be absolutely sure (cf. GDPR). [1] is a PDF that tax advisers and lawyers distribute to employers to check if freelancers are only ostensibly self-employed. The checklist at the end of the PDF is all you need if you are an employer. If you are a freelancer you must also check if you are employee-like and possibly file an application to be exempt. The PDF tells you when. Watch the 5/6 distribution of income (not law, but established judicature)! [1] https://www.sup-kanzlei.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Scheinselbs... reply close04 5 hours agorootparentprev> In Germany now there are laws in place for this, you get ridiculous stuff like as consultant you are not allowed to eat together with team mates from the employer because that is seen as bounding activities AFAIK in Germany the model of using temporary agency staff (AÜG or \"staff leasing\") is now tightly regulated. It works for a limited time period and tries to guarantee some equitable conditions for temporary workers like fair treatment, equitable wages, and benefits, aligning with the protections afforded to permanent employees. Consultancy has no such protections. I have never heard of any laws that prohibit internal employees from socializing with the externals (consultants or AÜG), or eat together. Bonding can happen equally at the desk or the lunch table. And I haven't heard of any company or institution enforcing this. Legislating who one is allowed to eat with sounds crazy. What many companies probably enforce is \"no internal benefits for consultants\", so the free company coffee, parking, canteen, or maybe even a desk/office are not available for the externals, and they have to look elsewhere. Or maybe some unwritten internal rules to discourage bonding. reply pjmlp 4 hours agorootparentYou get that at many companies whose legal department is too worried that AÜG might somehow be triggered for them, or have a strong union that would rather see all consulting folks be gone, which I understand when placed in the shoes of internal folks. reply marcosdumay 5 hours agorootparentprevIn most places, it doesn't work that way. reply dolmen 3 hours agorootparentprevThink about a wider scale than your employer: if the costs of the consultants goes in fact in the pockets of the investors of your employer, that money is not lost. reply kavalg 3 hours agorootparentprevIn quite many places, hiring consultants has a very high corruption potential (e.g. the hiring manager favoring one of several suppliers). With employees they don't have this leverage. reply hammock 4 hours agorootparentprevMany companies have a policy like “freelancers, once kept on for 12 months, must be either hired full time, or fired” to deal with this reply pydry 7 hours agorootparentprevConsultanties get brought in to provide ass cover for management but they cant just say that. reply EGreg 5 hours agorootparentprevHow exactly does one become a consultant on a 1099? Go work for a consulting company a W-2? That’s how I did it four years ago. Well, the consulting company takes a nice chunk above what they bill you out for. How does one do it freelance? I also would prefer contract work or consulting work, I like that no feelings are hurt when I leave having done a good job, leave em better than you found ‘em. reply bluGill 4 hours agorootparentYou have to legally start a company. That means some legal work (you don't need a lawyer, but it helps). You need to do the books yourself and because this is very different areas of tax law you really should hire an accountant (only an hour/month, but having extra eyes look at the books is useful). If you do this right you make more money, but there are problems if you miss some legal detail that W-2 employees don't have. Many times you cannot get called as a 1099 as some places won't work with you. however most of the big consulting companies have others working for them on a 1099 and will be happy to deal with you. However the amount they pay you doesn't change so you have to really understand how to make tax law work for you to make it worth out. (perhaps you can give yourself a 401k with a match check with the lawyers/accountants above to see if that is legal and if so what the rules are. If not there are other loopholes that work similar) reply Damogran6 4 hours agorootparentAs I understood it, you're also on the hook for valuing yourself properly.

Initially Marginalia used an interesting variant of PageRank discussed in the original paper, called Personal Pagerank.[1] Currently pages are ranked with BM25. I think Personalized PageRank is still used for a new feature of Marginalia which is ranking pages based on similarity. I think this is already integrated into the website but there used to only be this testing page: https://explore2.marginalia.nu/ In any case I have a lot of respect for the creator. Marginalia has seen a lot of growth and it's been interesting reading the blogposts.[2] [1]: https://www.marginalia.nu/log/26-personalized-pagerank/ [2]: https://www.marginalia.nu/log/ reply marginalia_nu 8 hours agoparentI'm using PPR for domain rankings, but it's a very weak factor. It mostly affects the physical ordering on the results in the index, and given that queries have a timeout they'll execute for, it makes it so that higher ranking results are discovered first. Though in general, as I mentioned, this is a weak effect. Explore2 and the website discovery tools now built into the search engine are using cosine similarity of the incident link vectors.

This seems to be related both to the input stupidifier that seems to be in use with mainstream search engines (if I search for anything unusual it assumes I misspelled or mis-remembered and replace my search with something I didn't search for before sending it to the backend) and mainstream engines going out of their way to prefer corporate media over original, authorative content > It's more of a way to find interesting things on the \"small web\".

    "originBody": "GOVERNMENT Kansas tuberculosis outbreak is now America's largest in recorded history Jason Alatidd Topeka Capital-Journal An ongoing tuberculosis outbreak in Kansas has become the largest in recorded history in the United States. \"Currently, Kansas has the largest outbreak that they've ever had in history,\" Ashley Goss, a deputy secretary at the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, told the Senate Public Health and Welfare Committee on Tuesday. As of Jan. 17, public health officials reported that they had documented 66 active cases and 79 latent infections in the Kansas City, Kansas, metro area since 2024. Most of the cases have been in Wyandotte County, with a handful in Johnson County. Jill Bronaugh, a KDHE spokesperson, confirmed Goss's statement afterward. \"The current KCK Metro TB outbreak is the largest documented outbreak in U.S. history, presently,\" Bronaugh said in a statement to The Capital-Journal. \"This is mainly due to the rapid number of cases in the short amount of time. This outbreak is still ongoing, which means that there could be more cases. There are a few other states that currently have large outbreaks that are also ongoing.\" She noted that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention started monitoring and reporting tuberculosis cases in the U.S. in the 1950s. Tuberculosis is caused by a bacterium that typically affects the lungs, according to KDHE. People with an active infection feel sick and can spread it to others, while people with a latent infection don't feel sick and can't spread it. Tuberculosis is spread person-to-person through the air when a person with an active infection coughs, speaks or sings. It is treatable with antibiotics. State public health officials say there is \"very low risk to the general public.\" KDHE reportable infectious disease statistics show that statewide there were 51 active cases in 2023. That jumped to 109 in 2024. There has been one so far in 2025. \"Some of you are aware, we have and still have mobilized staff and resources addressing an unprecedented tuberculosis outbreak in one of our counties,\" Goss told lawmakers. \"We are working collaboratively with CDC on that. CDC remains on the ground with us to support. That's not a negative. This is normal when there's something unprecedented or a large outbreak of any kind, they will come and lend resources to us to help get a stop to that.

She said the number is now down to about 32 active cases. For active patients, after 10 days of taking medications and having three sputum tests, they will generally no longer be able to transmit tuberculosis. \"They're no longer contagious,\" Goss said. \"They can go about their lives, they don't have to stay away from people, and they can go back to work, do the things, as long as they continue to take their meds.\" The course of treatment is several months long for active and latent cases. \"We still have a couple of fairly large employers that are involved that we're working with on this,\" Goss said. \"So we do expect to find more, but we're hoping the more that we find is latent TB not active, so that their lives are not disrupted and having to stay home from work.

Until 2005, pretty much everyone in the UK received the BCG vaccine. After that the TB rate fell too low to merit routine vaccination, but even today it's still given routinely in a few areas where the rate merits it, or if there's elevated risk of exposure via family from abroad, etc. Has vaccination in general become such a divisive topic in the US that articles about diseases for which we used to routinely vaccinate don't even mention that a vaccine is available and greatly reduces the risk of the most severe forms of TB, such as TB meningitis? reply danw1979 11 hours agoparentKind of related to your point… I remember my maternal Grandmother was looking after me one day and I’d either missed or skipped my earlier vaccination appointment in school (which, I think was a BCG or booster, it was in the early 1990s). She was raised by her maternal Grandmother after her mother died from TB when she was 2 years old. Her father died of… something infectious when she was teenager (the oral history is obviously a bit sketchy, but she used to tell me her father also caught TB cholera maybe ? when he was removing bodies from the flooded Balham tube station in 1940 https://www.ianvisits.co.uk/articles/75th-anniversary-of-the...) Well, I got quite the scolding about missing my jabs and a stern lecture about how many awful diseases have been cured because of vaccination. I could never forget how emotional she was about it.

This is true beyond just vaccines. All too often hardships are forgotten, history is just old pictures and stories, and people who are too far disconnected from those real events and don't learn from history will just walk the same path, leading to the same hardships. They all think that the world is better today so they're smarter or better than the old generations, that the world evolved so they're intrinsically prepared, so the pains of the past can't harm them. Ironically they're ignoring all the lessons and the tools that made the world better and are needed to keep it like that, and instead think things are better because they just are. They'll skip any vaccines or support extremist regimes because they think the modern world is just immune to this, it's intrinsically and permanently \"fixed\". We have freedoms or don't get sick because we \"just\" have freedoms and don't get sick.

BCG wasn’t routinely given in the US even in the last half of the 20th century when vaccines were universally popular. I was surprised to learn a TB vaccine even existed when I started a public health−adjacent job in the 2000s. Our public health establishment just isn’t convinced it’s worth giving here. reply Animats 13 hours agorootparentThe BCG vaccine does exist, but it's an 90 year old live-virus vaccine with short-term side effects. Because it's a live-virus \"natural\" vaccine, it can't be used on people who are immunocompromised or have HIV. There's work on more modern vaccines.[1] No big successes yet. The safety record of the BCG vaccine, in terms of permanent harm, is pretty good. But a normal side effect is \"The usual expected reaction to BCG vaccination is redness and/or a small lump at the injection site, followed by a small ulcer (open sore) a few weeks later (usually less than 1 cm in diameter). The ulcer may last from a few weeks to months before healing to a small flat scar.\"[2] Mass vaccination will have parents screaming \"my perfect baby has an open sore from the vaccine\" on Instagram, with pictures. The classic live-virus smallpox vaccine has similar side effects, by the way, plus a death rate of 1-2 per million. Huge political problem.

If they then also understood that 90% 95% of the population effectively has natural immunity, they would seriously question the ethics of vaccination. Should a number of generations be allowed to profit from the benefits of vaccination at the cost of a loss of natural immunity in the group? Are future members of the group less entitled to this ~95% immunity, because the current generations prefer ( 100% minus epsilon ) artificial immunity? Its easy to win a referendum in the advantage of the existing population at the cost of future populations, if those future populations aren't born yet to contest and vote against it. From Wikipedia page on Tuberculosis: > Roughly one-quarter of the world's population has been infected with M. tuberculosis,[6] with new infections occurring in about 1% of the population each year.[11] However, most infections with M. tuberculosis do not cause disease,[169] and 90–95% of infections remain asymptomatic.[87] From the above it is clear that vaccination programs for TB should be strictly considered private healthcare since it can help specific individuals at the cost of collective fitness vis-a-vis TB. Governments collectivizing private medicine at the cost of group fitness ranks among the most populistic things in existence. Think of how communist systems justify their methods by emphasizing doctors and medical systems. What exactly does the ethical axiomatization of a collective thought system look like when they look down on the ~95% natural immunity handed to them from the prior generations and simultaneously have no qualms to hand down a lower percentage of natural immunity to the next generations! I believe they have this mistaken gut feeling that their decisions can be rationally axiomatized, more out of group think and delegation \"others smarter than me are choosing this so it is probably rational\"; and they are simply unaware of the fundamental inconsistencies they manifest. Tax payer money ought not be spent on reducing the natural immunity of its taxated population, regardless of how confronting it may be to explain to the population how a lot of methods in medicine were started long before the consensus on natural selection as the origin of life and fitness took hold. reply Cipater 7 hours agorootparent>If they then also understood that 90% 95% of the population effectively has natural immunity, they would seriously question the ethics of vaccination. Your premise is flawed as this is a misinterpretation of what the data actually states. The statistic refers to the fact that most infections do not cause active disease. This is not the same as having \"immunity.\" Rather, it indicates that the immune system in most individuals can contain the bacteria without eradicating it, resulting in a latent infection. Latent TB can become active under certain conditions, such as immunosuppression or aging. Vaccination does not reduce natural immunity but aims to prevent the most severe manifestations of TB which can be fatal. Your wider point re: the ethical argument against vaccination presumes that exposing populations to preventable diseases is acceptable to preserve a theoretical \"natural immunity.\" However, ethics in public health prioritize the reduction of preventable harm. Sacrificing lives and health for a purist notion of \"natural selection\" disregards the suffering of individuals and the societal costs of disease. If anything, the ethical failure lies in allowing preventable diseases to cause harm when safe, effective interventions exist. Future generations will inherit a world shaped by the decisions we make today.

Many, even otherwise responsible people, will founder before the proper end of treatment and this, I think, is what terrifies health professionals so much, that it almost seems to be avoided. It's probably time we start looking a bit harder for \"natural\" or alternate treatments. Some in medical journals, are under scrutiny, but inconclusive.

I believe city and state departments of health must've tracked the \"outbreak\" back but I don't think it was ever on the news or made a big deal of. By the time we were diagnosed, the family member's symptoms weren't anything worse than their typical smoker's cough and was a heavy cigarette smoker anyway, not sure how active his infection actually was at the time but he never required hospitalization, just similar antibiotics, IIRC. I was treated with Isoniazid (known as INH, one pill daily for a year), I never felt any symptoms from the infection or side effects from INH, they monitored monthly initially with skin prick tests then chest x-rays and after the year was up, I was done. This did prevent me from donating blood a few years after the infection was cleared; I assume there are still rules in place. Neither the latent infection nor the year long treatment were harsh. IMHO, TB's a powerful but rather slow-moving internal infectant, and it was historically ravaging because of the earlier conditions of the world and lack of medicine at that time. reply Fomite 11 hours agorootparentprev\"It's probably time we start looking a bit harder for \"natural\" or alternate treatments.

Oozing sores, foul oders and overt discomfort would probably help, but alas... reply Eisenstein 9 hours agorootparentI'm sorry but this doesn't make sense. Antibiotic resistance to TB only affects those who have TB, so if another 'natural' medicine is found and TB gets resistant to it, then it is still just as bad for the people affected. Natural means nothing in this context. Effective medicine is effective medicine, and there is nothing that makes TB less prone to developing a resistance to a 'natural' effective medicine over any other effective medicine. reply eth0up 5 hours agorootparentI admit I slipped into the octogon of HN where animals weak and strong come to test their teeth on impulse. Therefore I must be prepared to write essays on semantics even when I use subtle indicators such as quotes. For the first portion of your reply, I think that if TB became resistant to potatoes with licorice icecream, it would be preferable to having absolutely no recourse with antibiotics. But that's silly. If you are 100% certain that latent TB is innocuous and can't be reactivated, I must admit my logic was flawed. Edit: is not, eg mrsa, becoming resistant to various things in the environment? Biofilms make many bacteria resistant to even alcohol. Staph, ubiquitous and thus exposed to pretty much anything a person's skin is exposed to is probably resistant to many things it previously wasn't. But it remains vulnerable to a few antibiotics, for now. reply Eisenstein 3 hours agorootparentI understand now what you mean. The thing is that TB doesn't transfer its resistance to other pathogens like MRSA does. It develops resistance via a different mechanism (mutations of its genome) then MRSA does (horizontal gene transfer). Thus, you have a misconception about the nature of TB resistance. This accounts for the pushback. People tend to forget that we all have different knowledge bases and we talk past each other. reply AngryData 13 hours agorootparentprevWhat kind of natural treatments? Because tuberculosis has been a massive problem from the start of human civilization up until the advent of antibiotics, and they tried every natural medicine and treatment under the sun because of how long people can end up living with it before dieing, and they accomplished pretty much nothing in stopping it. In fact it continued to get worse throughout that entire time, at one point being the cause of death for 25% of Europeans. reply eth0up 4 hours agorootparentI'm not going to devote the time required to search, retrieve and cite extent material. But you will find results if you do, but probably no panacea. Also, I deliberately don't mention specifics in this instance (and many others) due to potentially and probable controversy. As an example, if I were to (but won't!) cite research indicating the universally reviled Ag showing efficacy in mitigating TB, I'd be attacked by waves of hostility as if it was my own rogue idea. I enjoy discussions, but find it often tends to be argumentative here, so I avoid things I expect to go in that direction. Note the hostility to my use of the forbidden word in quotes. It's a thousand cuts with these kinds of compulsive prison shanks of logic that makes me awkward. reply scythe 15 hours agorootparentprev>It's probably time we start looking a bit harder for \"natural\" or alternate treatments. Some in medical journals, are under scrutiny, but inconclusive. We are looking, quite hard, in fact. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is among the most studied microörganisms. Like HIV, it is notable particularly for being able to defeat the attempts of the immune system cells to kill it, and it in fact infects and reproduces within macrophages. Medical researchers have done a lot to understand how this is possible and we (as in humanity) have identified several enzymes and related biomolecules which seem to be crucial to this process, which we might be able to inhibit with a targeted drug. However, all of this scientific research has the usual problem that it is very difficult and expensive. In order to inhibit the enzyme, the drug must be absorbed by the body, and then make its way into the macrophages, and then it still must be active, and have no other toxicity to the host. It is easy to say \"just inhibit isotuberculosinol synthase\", but it is much harder to do. As I understand it, this is also the reason why treating tuberculosis requires such long courses of antibiotics. When treating a normal infection, we are basically just killing most of the pathogens, and we hope that the immune system will mop up the rest. In the case of M. tuberculosis, the drugs have to kill all of the bacteria, which is why multidrug therapy is basically always used and the patient must continue treatment long after symptoms seem to have disappeared. Even when patients have recovered, they are always considered to be at risk of still having latent tuberculosis, which is why hospital screenings often feature a question like \"have you ever had a positive test for tuberculosis?\" reply Fomite 11 hours agorootparentThis TB is very well studied compared to most infectious diseases. I think really only HIV and Malaria edge it out. reply eth0up 2 hours agorootparentNot to say that it's always the case, but research isn't always at face value i.e., sometimes there's circularity, economical or political dynamics, etc, that perpetuate dead ends while neglecting more viable avenues.

Probably took a while for it to become widespread. The thing is: The protocol for a positive skin test wasn't \"Here, take this 9 month treatment.\" It was \"You need a chest X-Ray to show it's not active. If not, you're good to go!\" Especially if they know you've received the vaccine. And no one should have made you go through the treatment multiple times it's pointless, because even if you never had the vaccine but had latent/active TB, you will always test positive with the skin test. Knowing you'd gone through treatment once should have sufficed. I know a nurse who definitely has latent TB (i.e. no vaccine). And she never had problems after a positive skin test her employers always knew about it and as long as she had a clean chest X-Ray, she was deemed fit to interact with (at risk) patients. Whoever made you go through treatment was incompetent. reply throwup238 12 hours agorootparentTo be clear I never went through the treatment, it just took a lot of arguing with doctors and the school/nonprofit administration in question after the false positive.

While a majority of the seven adults identified were born outside the U.S. in a country that had experienced a multidrug-resistant TB outbreak with the same genotype in 2007-2009, most of the six children were U.S. born, noted Elizabeth Groenweghe, MPH, of the Unified Government Public Health Department in Kansas City, and colleagues in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. So it's either been a latent infection in someone in the first household or they traveled to their home country and brought it back, or something.. it's likely the local health department knows the exact lineage and route it took but they avoid publishing the full details for obvious reasons in this climate. reply briandear 12 hours agorootparentWhat are the “obvious reasons?” It seems to me the obvious reasons are that the claim is that illegal immigration has been blamed for outbreaks of diseases that are relatively uncommon in the U.S. and publishing the full details would provide evidence supporting that claim.

Regardless of the immigration status of the family, they'll be targeted as if they were illegal (even though their kids were explicitly born in the US and are obviously Americans) and the vitriol will ensure their community is less safe.. the ensuing media freakout will make sure that other infected communities are much less likely to turn up to hospitals when they have communal infections, almost guaranteeing the next outbreak will spread further.

Looking at the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, this doesn't actually appear to be true. Going by that link you can read past MMWR reports, and they aren't (from everything I can see) doing weekly tracking of outbreaks, but rather publishing various articles about diseases the way a science journal would.

It's been a big story since the 1980s, IIRC. I remember in college in the 1990s a biologist friend explaining that TB was the greatest disease threat to public health and it was being completely ignored. Frankly, it's hard to get worked up about it. Notwithstanding that it is a serious public health threat, there's a strong political rhetoric aspect to the discussion, both in the popular and professional spheres. It's unfortunate. In the 1980s and 1990s it was all about how Reagan decimated our public health infrastructure. The arguments aren't per se wrong, but it's difficult to gauge relevance and prioritization about the threat of TB given how part of the medical and scientific community seem to have been border-line crying wolf for 40 years. Discussion centers around absolute numbers. Tell me what the per capita relationship looks like, especially per capita among the populations most vulnerable to acquisition and disease, and what the long-term trends look like. I see this in a lot of other adjacent public health discussions tainted by political hand wringing, such as food insecurity, etc--lots of absolute numbers. But global populations are growing. The US, for example, grew by 80 million people, or 30%, between 1990 and 2020. That's not to deny that tuberculosis is a growing problem, but we have many problems. And the constant drum beat of alarm causes some parts of the community to (increasingly) react in counterproductive ways. From an individual moral standpoint, that's on them, but from an epidemiological and sociological perspective, maybe the professionals bear a little blame, too, at least in terms of communication.

My point isn't that agencies don't report incidence; my point is about when the discussion surfaces how it's discussed in the popular press, including editorializations in professional outlet. Were incidence rate flat or down between convenient points of comparison, but absolute numbers up, and an outbreak like Kansas happen, we'd be discussion absolute numbers. And even when incidence is up, the absolute numbers always headline. It's a subtle criticism I'm making, but I think an important one. Nonetheless, while for 40 years TB has been discussed as a grace looming threat, note how absolute cases and incidence dropped steeply over most of that time. And while the drop has largely stopped, the US now has one of the lowest incidence rates in the world. But my takeaway is supposed to be that the US' TB measures are woefully broken because the drop has stopped? reply adgjlsfhk1 13 hours agorootparentThe point is that if we'd put in a bit more effort 40 and 30 years ago, there would be 0 cases today (and if we put a bunch more effort in now, there will be 0 cases in 20 years).

What about that event resonated with you that you'd excuse those people? There are a few different reasons: 1. The presentation of January 6 by the Left and especially the media were completely overblown and exaggerated, even taking artistic license into account. Live or close-to-live videos and images of what all happened were readily available and it was nothing like how the Left and media presented it. 2. The Constitution guarantees the right to a speedy and public trial.[1][2] Many of the accused were still waiting literally four years after the fact for their trials to begin while incarcerated when the pardon went into effect. This is completely ridiculous regardless of how the accused should be regarded; waiting four years and likely many more had Trump not pardoned them is patently not a \"speedy\" trial and a gross violation of Constitutionally guaranteed human rights. 3. With the above, the whole process was practically a political persecution for daring to think and speak the wrong things. That is not how we operate here in the United States of America, land of the free and the home of the brave. 4. The founding of the United States of America stems from a violent uprising against the incumbent government. Rebellion is in our blood and DNA, without it there is no USA; rejecting the concept of rebellion wholesale is tantamount to denying the very essence of our country and the Founding Fathers.[3] Trump during his campaign promised pardons to correct this significant, and as far as I'm aware unprecedented, abuse of the judiciary and he delivered on that promise. I voted with and for that promise, among many others, so I am satisfied. Promises made, promises kept should be mundane, but surprisingly Trump is one of the few politicians if any who exhibit this common sense.

I'll just say this: >correct this significant, and as far as I'm aware unprecedented, abuse of the judiciary and he delivered on that promise. This is extremely common because \"speedy\" was simply never defined. Taking months over minor non-violent crimes like drug usage as an example. Given the chaos in identifying all suspects (IIRC they were never all fully discovered, an atrocity in and of itself in our police system), I'm not too surprised it took years to try everyone caught. No one's probably chomping at the bit to re-define \"speedy\" better: >a trial conducted according to prevailing rules and procedures that takes place without unreasonable or undue delay or within a statutory period. but I think we both agree this is a very vauge, insufficient definition. reply Dalewyn 9 hours agorootparent>Thank you.

I watched it live and it was as bad as the 'media' made it out to be. People who attacked and beat police on camera were pardoned. The 'back the blue' and 'tough on crime' party is a total farce. Your number 2 is also completely misleading. From the article [1], By the end of the year, 725 people had been charged with federal crimes.[2][3] That number rose to 1,000 by the second anniversary of the attack,[2] to 1,200 by the third anniversary (three-quarters of whom had by then been found guilty)[4][5] and to 1,500 before the fourth anniversary.[6] It's not political persecution to charge people with crimes they committed while storming a government building. I almost didn't respond because you're living in some fantasy land, but since Trump has already removed what happened from government websites, I think it's important we don't forget what really happened. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cases_of_the_January_6... reply Dalewyn 9 hours agorootparentTo be charged with a crime signals the beginning of a trial, a conviction signals the conclusion of a trial with a guilty verdict.

So that's presumably still more than several hundred defendants waiting for what should be a speedy trial. Again, that is not how we should operate in this country. If you accuse (charge) someone of a crime their trial should be brought as swiftly as possible as mandated by the Constitution. That this was not done is by itself enough cause to pardon them, let alone the exaggeration of the charges presented. Also, to close things out: >The 'back the blue' and 'tough on crime' party is a total farce.

      "The Kansas tuberculosis outbreak is the largest in the U.S. since the 1950s, as reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The outbreak has prompted discussions on the BCG vaccine, which is not routinely administered in the U.S. due to inconsistent efficacy and possible side effects. This situation emphasizes the need for effective public health policies and the role of government agencies in disease monitoring and prevention."

    "originBody": "OpenHaystack OpenHaystack is a framework for tracking personal Bluetooth devices via Apple's massive Find My network. Use it to create your own tracking tags that you can append to physical objects (keyrings, backpacks, ...) or integrate it into other Bluetooth-capable devices such as notebooks. Table of contents What is OpenHaystack? History Disclaimer How to use OpenHaystack? System requirements Installation Usage How does Apple's Find My network work? Pairing Losing Finding Searching How to track other Bluetooth devices? OpenHaystack Mobile Authors References License What is OpenHaystack? OpenHaystack is an application that allows you to create your own accessories that are tracked by Apple's Find My network. All you need is a Mac and a BBC micro:bit or any other Bluetooth-capable device. By using the app, you can track your accessories anywhere on earth without cellular coverage. Nearby iPhones will discover your accessories and upload their location to Apple's servers when they have a network connection. History OpenHaystack is the result of reverse-engineering and security analysis work of Apple's Find My network (or offline finding). We at the Secure Mobile Networking Lab of TU Darmstadt started analyzing offline finding after its initial announcement in June 2019. We identified how Apple devices can be found by iPhones devices, even when they are offline through this work. The whole system is a clever combination of Bluetooth advertisements, public-key cryptography, and a central database of encrypted location reports. We disclosed a specification of the closed parts of offline finding and conducted a comprehensive security and privacy analysis. We found two distinct vulnerabilities. The most severe one, which allowed a malicious application to access location data, has meanwhile been fixed by Apple (CVE-2020-9986). For more information about the security analysis, please read our paper. Since its release, we received quite a bit of press and media coverage. Disclaimer OpenHaystack is experimental software. The code is untested and incomplete. For example, OpenHaystack accessories using our firmware broadcast a fixed public key and, therefore, are trackable by other devices in proximity (this might change in a future release). OpenHaystack is not affiliated with or endorsed by Apple Inc. How to use OpenHaystack? OpenHaystack consists of two components. First, we provide a macOS application that can display the last reported location of your personal Bluetooth devices. Second, the firmware image enables Bluetooth devices to broadcast beacons that make them discoverable by iPhones. System requirements OpenHaystack requires macOS 11 (Big Sur). Installation The OpenHaystack application requires a custom plugin for Apple Mail. It is used to download location reports from Apple's servers via a private API (technical explanation: the plugin inherits Apple Mail's entitlements required to use this API). Therefore, the installation procedure is slightly different and requires you to temporarily disable Gatekeeper. Our plugin does not access any other private data such as emails (see source code). Download a precompiled binary release from our GitHub page. Alternative: build the application from source via Xcode. Open OpenHaystack. This will ask you to install the Mail plugin in ~/Library/Mail/Bundle. Open a terminal and run sudo spctl master-disable, which will disable Gatekeeper and allow our Apple Mail plugin to run. Open Apple Mail. Go to Preferences → General → Manage Plug-Ins... and activate the checkbox next to OpenHaystackMail.mailbundle. If the Manage Plug-Ins... button does not appear. Run this command in terminal sudo defaults write \"/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail\" EnableBundles 1 Allow access and restart Mail. Open a terminal and enter sudo spctl master-enable, which will enable Gatekeeper again. Usage Adding a new accessory. To create a new accessory, you just need to enter a name for it and optionally select a suitable icon and a color. The app then generates a new key pair that is used to encrypt and decrypt the location reports. The private key is stored in your Mac's keychain. Deploy to device. Connect a supported device via USB to your Mac and hit the Deploy button next to the accessory's name and choose the corresponding. Instead of using OpenHaystack's integrated deployment, you may also copy the public key used for advertising (right click on accessory) and deploy it manually. Display devices' locations. It can take up to 30 minutes until you will see the first location report on the map on the right side. The map will always show all your items' most recent locations. You can click on every item to check when the last update was received. By clicking the reload button, you can update the location reports. How does Apple's Find My network work? We briefly explain Apple's offline finding system (aka Find My network). Please refer to our PETS paper and Apple's accessory specification for more details. We provide a schematic overview (from our paper) and explain how we integrate the different steps in OpenHaystack below. Pairing (1) To use Apple's Find My network, we generate a public-private key pair on an elliptic curve (P-224). The private key remains on the Mac securely stored in the keychain, and the public key is deployed on the accessory, e.g., an attached micro:bit. Losing (2) In short, the accessories broadcast the public key as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) advertisements (see firmware). Nearby iPhones will not be able to distinguish our accessories from a genuine Apple device or certified accessory. Finding (3) When a nearby iPhone receives a BLE advertisement, the iPhone fetches its current location via GPS, encrypts it using public key from the advertisement, and uploads the encrypted report to Apple's server. All iPhones on iOS 13 or newer do this by default. OpenHaystack is not involved in this step. Searching (4) Apple does not know which encrypted locations belong to which Apple account or device. Therefore, every Apple user can download any location report as long as they know the corresponding public key. This is not a security issue: all reports are end-to-end encrypted and cannot be decrypted unless one knows the corresponding private key (stored in the keychain). We leverage this feature to download the reports from Apple that have been created for our OpenHaystack accessories. We use our private keys to decrypt the location reports and show the most recent one on the map. Apple protects their database against arbitrary access by requiring an authenticated Apple user to download location reports. We use our Apple Mail plugin, which runs with elevated privileges, to access the required authentication information. The OpenHaystack app communicates with the plugin while downloading reports. This is why you need to keep Mail open while using OpenHaystack. How to track other Bluetooth devices? In principle, any Bluetooth device can be turned into an OpenHaystack accessory that is trackable via Apple's Find My network. Currently, we provide a convenient deployment method of our OpenHaystack firmwares for a small number of embedded devices (see table below). We also support Linux devices via our generic HCI script. Feel free to port OpenHaystack to other devices that support Bluetooth Low Energy based on the source code of our firmware and the specification in our paper. Please share your results with us! Platform Tested on Deploy via app Comment Nordic nRF51 BBC micro:bit v1 ✓ Only supports nRF51822 at this time (see issue #6). Espressif ESP32 SP32-WROOM, ESP32-WROVER ✓ Deployment can take up to 3 minutes. Requires Python 3. Thanks @fhessel. Linux HCI Raspberry Pi 4 w/ RaspbianShould support any Linux machine. OpenHaystack Mobile OpenHaystack Mobile is a complete reimplementation of the OpenHaystack macOS application for smartphones. The app provides the same functionality to create and track accessories and aims to increase the usability, especially for new users. In contrast to the macOS application, the location reports cannot be fetched directly on the smartphone, so the app requires a proxy server hosted on Mac hardware to access the Find My network. The proxy server can be accessed over a network by multiple users simultaneously. To connect to your proxy server set the correct URL in: openhaystack-mobile/lib/findMy/reports_fetcher.dart OpenHaystack Mobile is built with the cross-platform Flutter framework and currently runs on Android and iOS. More information about the app and usage instructions can be found in the openhaystack-mobile folder of this repository.

From what I've heard Google made their version pretty bad, as expected. They rate limit how often you can search for your own tags, they won't show the location until a tag has been seen by multiple phones, there's poor coverage. One test I saw showed that Samsung's network was better, which makes no sense since Samsung phones should be a subset of all Android phones in Google's network, but that's Google products for you. Sounds good in theory but poorly executed, even years after Apple showed how to do it. https://security.googleblog.com/2024/04/find-my-device-netwo... https://9to5google.com/2024/08/01/find-my-device-stress-test... https://9to5google.com/2024/08/03/google-android-find-my-dev... https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/testing-new-googl... reply suddenexample 8 hours agoparentIt's actually hilarious that whoever was in charge of Google's finder network decided to cripple the product's one and only function by prioritizing privacy. In this tradeoff, Google gained a handful of articles mentioning the \"innovative\" privacy improvements (before the writers had a chance to test how terribly the network actually performs). For that, they sacrificed the chance to compete with Apple in this category, which outside of device revenue also weakens Android/Pixel ecosystem and market share. You really can't make up this level of incompetence. reply izacus 5 hours agorootparent> It's actually hilarious that whoever was in charge of Google's finder network decided to cripple the product's one and only function by prioritizing privacy. That sounds like that \"whoever\" was the corporate legal team. Every time I tracked down these kind of idiocities in large corpos, it's usually legal or security team that overrode common sense and sabotaged their own product. reply KennyBlanken 1 hour agorootparentprevGoogle's interest in user privacy extends as far as keeping competitors or customers of google from getting data about an Android user other than through Google. reply WinstonSmith84 9 hours agoparentprevIt's hard to believe how Google could mess up their network so badly. Apple network shall be totally dwarfed. As a nomad-traveler, the Apple network is not particularly relevant to me, I don't travel to the wealthiest cities with a lot of Apple phones, but to the \"rest of the world\" where Android market share is close to 90% dominance. But even there, it still seems that Apple is doing better than Google (...) reply RobotToaster 3 hours agoparentprev> From what I've heard Google made their version pretty bad I have one on my keys.

That setting is not for the tracker but for the tracking devices. For Google Find My trackers to behave similarly to AirTags, every single android user would have to go to their Find My settings and explicitly change, how sensitive their phone is. reply garbagewoman 9 hours agoparentprevI dunno, a less than perfectly all-seeing omnipresent tracking network actually is a little comforting reply sorenjan 9 hours agorootparentIt's not very useful for tracking your things though, which arguably is why you would use it. I wouldn't trust Google's network to find a stolen bike or lost luggage for instance, but air tags are used for that all the time[0]. Finding my lost keys at home is a perfectly valid use case for tags, but you don't need a network for that, just some Bluetooth and maybe UWB.

Is the cost of building one's own lower than just buying an Airtag off the shelf? I recently bought some for about $15. Would building my own be cheaper? reply abalaji 16 hours agoprevLooking through the code, it looks like this uses your personal Apple Mail entitlements to pull the locations that get collected by devices on the FindMy network: https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/blob/8d214aa5eb68... I wonder if this were also possible by making an Apple developer account. reply denysvitali 11 hours agoparentThere are versions that do not require the interaction with Apple Mail. All you need is an Apple account the code doesn't have to run on Apple HW: https://github.com/biemster/FindMy reply exabrial 1 hour agoprevCan someone point me to something I saw earlier? Apple alerts users to \"tags that might be following you\". Someone made an implementation that used a KDF to rotate the mac address or private key or something, but it was predictable in a way you could track each derivation of the of the mac/private key. There is a really obnoxious petty theft problem where I live, and the time it takes to constantly get my windows fixed or forced entry crap removed is worth a significant amount of my personal time. I have zero desire to confront anyone, but I'd like to be able to create a track for a PI or Law enforcement some day. reply hattmall 0 minutes agoparentYou can buy GPS cellular trackers. Then just get a really cheap or even free IOT sim. Alternatively you could probably just walk to your nearest drug addict hangout with case of bottled water and ask them to stop breaking into your stuff. reply stavros 1 hour agoparentprevHm, AFAIK AirTags rotate their private key anyway, so I don't know if that will help your problem. Maybe they rotate it slowly, though, I'm not very familiar with the exact algorithm. reply solarkraft 12 hours agoprevI wish it had a way to integrate with the Find My app instead of having to go through their own (wonky) process to retrieve locations. The chinese clones can do it (even with their own branding), so it must be possible somehow. reply alibarber 10 hours agoparentI think that's the wall in Apple's walled garden here. From reading the official Apple spec. for partners a while back, as part of the pairing process, something is signed by the device with a cert/key that apple issued to that developer (after coming to an agreement i.e $$) and, crucially, is different from the keypair that the device will use to actually broadcast. This is then validated by apple and thus allowed to be added to that apple-id's account and hence on to the app. The keys broadcasted by the devices themselves in 'lost' mode (i.e. not in 2 way contact with the owner's device) are arbitrary and completely opaque, Apple doesn't have any way of tying them to an ID or device or developer. This is how the proposed project here works these keys will always find their way to the apple server. It seems like the knockoff ones have just hijacked a legit key for the pairing process. This means if Apple desires and finds out the key, it can probably remove all devices from all accounts although the devices themselves will keep on broadcasting and their locations could be accessed in the above janky way. I wonder too if the original key owner might get a large bill for per-device royalties if/when Apple searches it's DB for a count of 'devices-added-to-an-apple-id-signed-by-this-key'... reply nguyenkien 6 hours agoparentprevThe \"chinese clone\" are official supported, here is how: https://developer.apple.com/find-my/ reply oulipo 10 hours agoparentprevThe Chinese clones use the Apple FindMy program, so they are official tags which can be displayed in the app. The OpenHaystack is a hack which uses different keys, and can't be shown on the app for cryptographic reasons reply emsixteen 7 hours agoparentprevThe clones are limited though, are they not? Like, they don't have the directional stuff and all that do they? I may be misremembering what I've read elsewhere. reply dalemhurley 17 hours agoprevThis is amazing. I love Apple AirTags but they are so bulky and an odd shape. I would love a AirTag the shape of a credit card to go into my wallet. I would love a smaller AirTag to go on my cats collar. reply rahimnathwani 13 hours agoparentYou can buy third party \"Find My\" compatible tags for about $5 from Temu or Aliexpress. Although they're about the same size as regular Airtags, they're: easier to take apart (if you want discard the casing), and cheaper I took one of the ones I have out of its casing to see what could be made thinner, and I found that most of the thickness was due to: The batter holder (CR2032) The speaker The button The speaker and button could probably be dispensed with after initial setup. The battery holder could be removed, and the power supplied from the side instead of the top (if you want a thin card-like form factor). reply stonegray 2 hours agorootparentThe problem is they don’t have accurate positioning via UWB, so you only get a map pin and a beep, not an arrow and an exact distance. The $5 tags are comparable to tile or google tags, but miss the key feature of airtags. reply rahimnathwani 2 hours agorootparentI was wondering what you were talking about, as I have never seen the arrow when trying to locate a genuine AirTag that's misplaced within our house. But that's because neither of the devices I've used to locate things (a recent iPad and an iPhone X) have the UWB hardware. reply Havoc 8 hours agorootparentprevGuessing those are missing ultra wide band? Seems doubtful to me that someone implemented all three frequencies at 5 bucks reply ceejayoz 5 hours agorootparentHow much do you think a $20 AirTag costs to actually manufacture? reply stavros 1 hour agorootparentI don't know how much it costs to manufacture, but nobody is selling a UWB tag for $5. For $5, you only get BLE. reply ceejayoz 1 hour agorootparentI certainly can't claim to have ordered and received one, but there are absolutely $5 UWB devices for sale on AliExpress, and that's before any bulk discount. If Apple sells them for $20 it's highly likely some random Chinese seller can make money at $5. reply stavros 1 hour agorootparentCan you link me to one?

They have a contact sensor inside their mailbox that rotates the broadcasted key based on the trigger count. If the key changed, aka a new different device is visible, you know mail has been dropped in, very clever ! reply teruakohatu 13 hours agorootparentThat is a fascinating project. Here is the link if anyone else is interested: https://hackaday.com/2022/05/30/check-your-mailbox-using-the... I wonder if the creator had neighbourhood style mailboxes down the road? If not this seems quite complicated solution for an object that is probably with range even BLE. I tried building a mail sensor a couple of years ago where the mailbox was a fair distance from where I was living. I was not able to create a solution that didn't either have false positives or false negatives. For an outdoor object jostled by wind and rain it is harder than it seems. reply miki123211 10 hours agorootparentprevI wish we had more / more easily accessible networks that let you do this. Something that would let you send extremely tiny (1 year and they still all report pretty full batteries after a few months of usage, so I'm hopeful. The credit card form factor ones for wallets are more expensive ($10) but can be wirelessly recharged on Qi chargers. reply cjrp 11 hours agorootparentAny recommendation for brand etc for credit card sized ones? I’ve an old Tile that needs replacing. reply bhaney 11 hours agorootparent\"Brand\" is a somewhat nebulous concept for chinese knockoffs, but the particular ones I got are each branded as \"RSH Smart Tag.\" Though I'm pretty sure all the different listings are the same device coming out of the same factory with different random brand names printed on them. I'd just compare all the ones that say they work with iOS Find My and have wireless recharging, then get the cheapest one, specific branding be damned. Edit: I just checked, and actually only two of my cards (which came in a two-pack) are branded with RSH, and the other one has no branding on it at all. It's definitely an identical device though the only difference is the lack of branding. reply solarkraft 12 hours agorootparentprevThey are quite good. I get mine on AliExpress and the batteries have been lasting for at least a couple of months now. reply solarkraft 12 hours agoparentprevI’ve been meaning to toy with smaller form factors. In theory a lot of gadgets with a battery could be made trackable. reply oulipo 10 hours agoparentprevIt allows you to locate a fleet of object without having to rely on wifi / GPS etc reply amluto 15 hours agoprevCan these be paired with the actual Apple Find My app and found in the app? reply uzyn 17 hours agoprevImpressive. Would Apple be able to simply block non-Apple usage of Find My network usage simply by refusing to relay non-Apple BLE ID? reply malmeloo 17 hours agoparentNo, the BLE identities of these tags are currently practically indistinguishable from original tags, and could be made completely identical if necessary. In fact, changing the device's MAC address is part of the specification. What they could block, is the method used by these projects to fetch encrypted location reports. However, the original OpenHaystack project (this one) needs to run on macOS and lets the system handle account authentication, so it's unlikely to get blocked any time soon. reply oulipo 10 hours agorootparentThere's also projects that don't need access to macOS (you still need an account) https://github.com/malmeloo/FindMy.py EDIT: just realized I'm replying to the author of the project lol reply Brajeshwar 17 hours agoparentprevIf I remember correctly, Apple was supposed to openly accept and encourage others to leverage their network and make more “AirTag” capable devices. reply denysvitali 11 hours agorootparentYes, because they get a commission for every device registered on the network. In the join process, there is a key that is shared only for developers who paid the fee which is why it's not really trivial to create an AirTag clone without dumping the Apple AirTag flash reply heywire 17 hours agorootparentprevA quick search on Amazon shows a number of generic trackers compatible with “Find My”. In fact, the one on my dog’s collar is one of these. reply xyst 10 hours agoprevI wonder what’s the upper limit of transmissions a single device can upload to Apple servers? If the Apple device has no cell service or WiFi, how long will the history of that location ping reside on device? Also, is there a DoS vector here? attacker manages to simulate 1M+ Bluetooth devices victim randomly passes by and it crashes their phone due to a massive number of devices in single location and constantly uploading to Apple servers reply 2Gkashmiri 14 hours agoprevhttps://robu.in/product/nrf51822-cfac-r-bluetooth-3-1edr-ble... Will this chip work ? reply denysvitali 11 hours agoparentYes. I did it with that too. Basically all nrf51 / nrf52 are compatible with the protocol. In my case I've written the code in Rust but it's pretty much the same thing as the example reply pyronik19 17 hours agoprevWould there be a way for the bluetooth device to rotate its broadcast keys in a predictable way to avoid the iphone notification of \"unknown airtag close by\" messages? Seems like this could be exploited for surveillance. reply mrshadowgoose 13 hours agoparentSure, that works. One can also just cycle through a sufficiently large bank of pre-allocated keys, such that a findmy receiver doesn't see the same key too frequently. reply denysvitali 11 hours agorootparentYou just need to derive a new key, this process is already part of the protocol to avoid being tracked while you wear your airtag reply denysvitali 11 hours agoparentprevTechnically it would need to rotate every 15 minutes or so the notification you're talking about happens when the device is in \"lost mode\" (away from its owner): in that case the key is rotate every 24 hours reply alphan0n 5 hours agoparentprevYes, the FindYou project [0] has shown this to be possible.

Sometimes they might not even like the presented actvities, but everyone else around them appreciates it . Photos of people repairing their family's gadgets Photos of people doing mundane tasks, ironing their clothes, cooking dinner for everyone, being exhausted, reading to others... This is what prevails while people are still alive who remember you. What you will be remembered by. Mostly what you did for other people and how people observed you. Take photos of your parents and loved relatives during daily life and their tasks. You will be far more moved and inspired by these pics, than by typical family group photos. reply MarkMarine 16 hours agoparentAgree, but the other part of the advice I think is important and maybe even not fully explained in this blog post. Taking great photos is about using great light, this matters more than composition (you can crop in post) in my opinion. Rule of thirds is just a guideline, not a rule, if you’ve got great light and an interesting subject I couldn’t care less where those thirds lines sit. I mostly shoot on an old hassleblad with 6x6 square negatives and I often frame my shots with my subjects in the middle of the frame. I have also done what the OP is describing, scanning all my family’s negatives. I wanted to devote the amount of time it takes me to scan and color correct a frame to a scant few of the images. My family liked to take “snaps” of places and vacations (think non-descript cornfields or national park visitor centers) and hostage photos of the kids clearly taken against our will. I taught myself how to shoot on film to learn what I was doing, but going to the community darkrooom was the real education. I learned how good photographers used the light and saw the world by watching them develop and seeing the end product. Photography is just like any other endeavor, you get out of it what you put into it. For your kids and your kids kids, don’t just put into it some AI-computationally adjusted selfies and snaps of the tops of kids heads. Put some effort in, figure out what good light is, and take candid photos. reply j4coh 11 hours agorootparentMight depend on your personality a bit. Basically all my favorite photos of lost relatives and friends were taken on awful cameras by people with no knowledge of lighting or composition for that matter. The photos (to me) are valuable for a wholly different reason, it never even occurred to me until this moment that they were probably bad photographers. reply lukan 7 hours agorootparentYup, the best pictures I have, are those snapshots of real life action. Not the super prepared professional ones requiring set up (we also have those, my sister is a photographer). reply Aeolun 1 hour agorootparentIsn’t the sign of a professional that they don’t need that setup? I have some friends that seem able to snap these perfect moments effortlessly. reply lukan 10 minutes agorootparentAh no, I was talking about my own pictures. Some of the staged pictures my sister make of us, are nice as well, but overall I much prefer the blurry snapshot or video of a nice scene. (But then again, my sister especially recommended to me to choose my partner as she would look very good on pictures, I replied I have other priorities, but ended up with her anyway) reply dragonwriter 1 hour agorootparentprev> Isn’t the sign of a professional that they don’t need that setup? A professional should be able to get good results without it, but also when you are a professional, the incremental benefit of having the equipment available and using it where appropriate is more than worthwhile. reply MarkMarine 3 hours agorootparentprevAgree, I strongly dislike the staged, hostage photos. Almost no one looks like they are having fun. reply close04 9 hours agorootparentprev> and take candid photos This is probably the best way to get a good photo regarding the people in it. Composition, lighting are important as far as they make the picture \"readable\" if what you're looking for is the memory of the person. You'll still look kindly on a dark, blurry photo of a very authentic moment rather than an exceptionally well composed photo that's so staged you can't match it against the person you knew. Staged photos aren't all bad, they're just usually unrealistic if you knew the people. Many group photos have a bunch of upright poses and stiff faces that maybe those people never had naturally. So you recognize the face but not the person, it's not the memory of them you would keep. If you want to capture the memory of a person, take photos of them doing whatever they were usually doing, with their usual expression, lighting and composition be damned. reply MarkMarine 3 hours agorootparentWithout going into the 50 different things that go into a good photo, where you position yourself and the light are important. Being technically sound (correct exposure, depth of field) is the floor, then where the light is coming from, its quality and feel, there is a ton that goes into this. This is why Garry Winogrand’s street photography looks so much more powerful than some random person’s photos walking around with a point and shoot. I agree with you, I basically never take the staged photos (don’t have a self timer on my cameras anyway) but just snapping the shutter when people are doing things isn’t enough. I have boxes and boxes of photos of my family that I’m not even spending the time to scan and color correct because it’s not worth it. The great ones combine good light, technically correct, and an interesting subject. reply close04 1 hour agorootparent> This is why Garry Winogrand’s street photography looks so much more powerful You're just on a different, more professional rail. Talking about professionals doing professional stuff. You don't warm your tires before you go for a drive just because that's why F1 cars have so much more grip in slow corners. Capturing the perfect moment in the perfect technical conditions is perfect. But that doesn't happen very often in real life with family moments. Most of those perfect moments will be absolutely serendipitous and you'll capture them however you can. Not a single non-photographer looks at the snapshot of the perfect moment and thinks \"different ISO would have been so much better, and look at those harsh shadows\". One of the photos most dear to me and my entire family was taken at the light of a low-power infrared heater. Which is to say just enough light to not accidentally poke a finger in your eye. The details are only barely visible but you can tell who's there, everything is as noisy as you can imagine and more, and the brightest thing in the picture is the glow in the dark pacifier between the 2 figures. And no amount of good lighting would have made that picture better without ruining the moment. In fact almost all of the \"most memorable\" pictures in my album are technically crap. Over or underexposed, crappy film stock or digital resolution, bad framing, bad focus, motion blur, fringing, the list goes on to tick all the mistakes one could possibly make. They're all subjectively better than the technically superior shots because the moment they captured was better. If you talk about family it will always be the moment. If you can make it technically good, go for it, it's just icing on the cake. reply m463 15 hours agoparentprevThat's an interesting insight. I have another probably simplistic insight. I've gone on vacation and taken photos of the sights. wow, look at that beach/mountain/breathtaking view, etc. Later viewing them, they are usually kind of dull. But if you put a friend or family member in the landscape, they become 1000x more memorable. keepers. Like your advice, unposed and just in the frame can be more powerful than a posed image. reply dageshi 12 hours agorootparentI'm going to take a different view on this. I travelled a lot circa 2008-10 in and around Asia and recently I've been uploading all those old travel photos to Google Photos simply because every day it randomly pops up pictures from a place I once visited. Even the bad photos I took back then (I didn't have a great camera) are way better at keeping those memories alive than I would have expected, they may not be the best, but I was there and I took them. reply scarface_74 5 hours agorootparentMy wife and I started traveling a lot after my younger son graduated and post Covid mid 2021 and we even did the “digital nomad” thing for a year. We still go somewhere to do something around a dozen times a year. I blog about it. It isn’t for anyone else’s benefit but mine and I doubt I get any traffic to it. It’s more of a public journal. I pay $5 a month for MicroBlog. Our travel season is usually between March and October. The blog is a much better way to remember trips than just static pictures. reply dageshi 2 hours agorootparentI'm sure that's true but... I know that I would never check that blog again had I written one. Google photos pops a reminder of somewhere most days for me with a photo slideshow of somewhere I've been. reply scarface_74 2 hours agorootparentI do that too. But when I’m old and not traveling, having a journal would be nice. reply starwatch 12 hours agorootparentprevI've had the same experience. My new approach is to do a mental check to see if I could get the same picture from a google search. If not then I get out the camera. That in effect compels me to either enjoy the moment, or to include people in the photo to make it unique. reply genewitch 11 hours agorootparentPictures of the Grand Canyon. You can see on Google. pictures of the grand canyon with my kid in the foreground... Pictures of a city nearby. You can find on Google pictures of the city nearby from the top of the tallest building in the city nearby. No. Out my back door if I turn left 10° more than I normally do I'll quickly arrive in a spot no human has stood in for decades. Not in a Google search. I don't want to claim that maybe it's the surroundings that are mundane, because I don't find that true. One of my favorite films is koyanisqatsi, which is, really, just industrial film of earth. As mundane as it gets. I suppose I cannot fathom this yardstick you describe. reply WalterBright 10 hours agorootparentprev> Later viewing them, they are usually kind of dull Yah, I discovered that, too. Now I always try to get a person in the picture. reply Damogran6 3 hours agoparentprevI found a harddisk with a ton of ripped MiniDV footage of the kids when they were young. What I value most isn't the kids. Sure, they're adorable and I have a ton of snapshots from them...but it's things like 'oh, we had that TV then, oh, that room still had carpet, man, the trees were really short, oh that really annoying noise the parrot makes? He's been doing it for more than 20 years.' It's not the subjects, it's the context that is cherished. reply WalterBright 10 hours agoparentprevI borrowed a couple Annie Liebovitz portrait books from the library for inspiration. Lots of good poses in there, rather than the standard straight ahead picture. My favorite is the one of Bruce Springsteen sitting on his motorbike. I'm going to try and recreate it. I've seen various photos of Keith Richards. What's amazing is he's not a handsome man, but somehow the photos of him are incredible. reply Freak_NL 5 hours agorootparentLeibovitz, not Liebovitz. reply ErigmolCt 10 hours agoparentprevIs there a definition of \"live\" photographs in photography? I think taking photos of people while they're doing something makes them \"live\" in a way reply alistairSH 5 hours agorootparentOther comments cover it as well, but generally, you'll see categories like (none are hard and fast, there's overlap, etc)... portraits = posed photos with a person as subject snapshots / candids = what you describe as \"live\" photos street = snapshots, but of random people moving about their lives (much of photojournalism falls into this category, where the photographer is doing street photography at an event) landscapes = photos of the world, where people are not the primary subject, often wider angle wildlife = photos of animals, often with a very long telephoto lens macro = \"super zoomed in\" / close up (technically where the subject is equal or larger than the sensor on the camera) reply ElevenLathe 2 hours agorootparentprevI've heard them called \"candids\" or candid shots. The only picture I have of my grandfather (who died when my father was young) is of him taking out the trash. reply bregma 7 hours agorootparentprevThose are photographs. The other kind are portraits. Incidentally, the word \"selfie\" used to be an acronym for \"self-portrait.\" Now it refers to any kind of portrait (posed, but not necessarily of the picture-taker), so it has morphed into an acronym for just \"portrait\". reply dsego 10 hours agorootparentprevCandid photos, snapshots, photojournalism. reply DanielBMarkham 7 hours agoprevI lost all of my photos (along with everything else) when growing up, so taking pictures and videos was important to me as I became an adult. I'm 59 now. In the 1990s I started taking VHS videos of family events. Sometimes I would walk around \"interviewing\", sometimes I would walk around and try to normally talk to people while holding that huge recorder. (That didn't work). I even set it up on a tripod and just let the recorder run while my parents and others visited. This past year I've ripped a couple of dozen DVDs out of all of those tapes. In the past two weeks I've then ffmpeg'ed them to mp4s and loaded on an SD drive and put in a e-picture frame. Now we have 30-40 hours of \"family memory TV\" playing constantly in our living room. It is one of the most amazing things I've done with technology. I can't describe the feeling of looking back 30+ years to see folks who are long gone or now adults with their own kids! God I'm glad I didn't record all of this on a cell phone or use social media. It would have been impossible to have the patience and time to scale all of those walled gardens for this project. Best videos? The \"family interview show\", where I ask questions and everybody performs some kind of art. Wish I'd done one of those every year. Second best? Just setting the cam up and letting it run. Third place are videos of family members doing things that'll never happen again, like watching a sonogram of a new baby on the way. Worst videos? As I know (and knew at the time!), a bunch of videos and pictures of things we were looking at that were interesting to us at the time but stuff you could find online in a couple of seconds. Unless it has audio commentary, it was a pointless exercise. reply kowlo 6 hours agoparentBeautiful and inspiring. Can you share the specific e-picture frame you mentioned? reply Damogran6 3 hours agorootparentNot the OP, but I've had great experience with Aura frames...Costco sells them each year on the run-up to Christmas. reply slumberlust 4 hours agoparentprevThanks for sharing, this is wholesome. reply arscan 16 hours agoprevGreat tips in here! And I know this isn’t about videos… but, don’t forget about videos. I love taking pictures. In particular, candid moment-capturing portraits that reveal something about the subject. Also, technically challenging ones with really long exposures (eg around a campfire), or narrow depth of field (eg of my kids playing in the backyard). I like to think I’ve taken plenty of “good” photos of my family over the years. But something I’ve found is what I go back to the most are those poor quality, poorly edited, silly little videos I take of my family just living life. I used to avoid video because the outcome was just too hard to control. They would never turn out “good”. But flipping through my digital albums now, I wish i took more videos. A poor video can capture a lot… maybe even more than a great picture. So I find myself taking a lot more videos now. reply prismatix 14 hours agoparentI gave my daughter a toy camera around age 2.5 or 3 and didn't realize it also captured video. She had unintentionally discovered the video function and has since captured many conversations, photos of our old house, videos of car rides, and loving moments between our family. She's had it for almost 3 years now and it's been one of her longest lasting toys and is, without a doubt, the most meaningful. It gives \"seeing the world through her eyes\" a whole new meaning. reply _tom_ 8 hours agorootparentI suggest backing it up in multiple places. Electronic forms are so much less durable than physical. reply BOOSTERHIDROGEN 4 hours agorootparentprevWhat kind of toy camera? reply ErigmolCt 10 hours agorootparentprevThat’s absolutely beautiful! It will be so priceless for her when she grows up... reply aaronax 13 hours agoparentprevI do an annual one-take video around the house with the family, just talking about what has changed. Open cabinets and show what is in them. Talk about what is going on that week and what you are looking forward to. It usually goes for 20-30 minutes. reply kmoser 12 hours agorootparentThose videos are destined to be pure family nostalgia gold. I hope you're saving them in a format that can be easily backed up and shared with family members, both present and future. I also suggest taking a few candid snapshots and putting them into a book at some point. Video is good, but there's something special about a physical album that you can pass down for generations. If you distribute several copies of the books to various relatives, I'd be willing to bet they'll outlast the videos in the long run. reply ErigmolCt 10 hours agoparentprevI think that photos give you a freezing feeling of a moment and that’s what makes them so vital to a person reply arscan 3 hours agorootparentI agree, a frozen moment in time is special. But it also doesn’t quite capture subtleties that require the time dimension… e.g.; a quirky speech pattern that was a constant for a year or two but then just disappeared. reply jwr 8 hours agoprevThere is a related problem, which I hit while scanning family archives going back slightly more than 100 years. There is no good photo archival software. If you now rushed to click \"reply\" to say that yes, of course there is, right here, hold your horses. You probably do not understand the problem. Good photo archival software would let me keep my photos in formats that will be readable 25 years from now. It must not rely on any company being in business or offering any service. It must support storing the same picture in multiple formats. It must support assigning dates to pictures that are not the same as the file date nor the EXIF date. It must support assigning imprecise dates (just a year, or ideally an interval). It must support storing multiple files as part of the same \"image\", and I do not mean multiple versions/formats of an image here. Examples: front and back of a scanned paper photo, or 24 scans of a large format picture that are then merged together into a resulting stitched image. All that information must be preserved in ways that will let me recover it even without any software (e.g. files in the filesystem). I used many solutions over the years, and got royally screwed by most, the most recent one being Apple shutting down Aperture (which did most of these things pretty well). I am now close to writing my own software. EDIT: to all those who respond with \"just store it as files\" — yes, of course they should be stored as files. But that's not an answer. You do want searchability, nice visual access, and other niceties on top of the basic plumbing. reply inigoalonso 5 hours agoparentYou should definitely check out Tropy: https://tropy.org/ It's open-source, so no worries about a company shutting it down, and it handles a lot of the stuff you're asking for. It’s designed for organizing and managing research photos, but it has features that fit archival needs pretty well. Open and future-proof: Metadata is stored in JSON-LD, so even if Tropy disappears, your data isn’t locked up. It doesn’t modify your files either, so your originals are safe. Flexible metadata: You can assign custom dates (even imprecise ones like \"circa 1920\" or a date range) and add other metadata fields to fit your needs. It’s not tied to EXIF or file timestamps, which is a big plus. Related files: Tropy lets you group multiple images (e.g., front and back of a photo or parts of a large scanned image) into a single \"item.\" Relationships are preserved, and you can see them all in the same context. Search and organization: It’s way better than just dumping files into a folder. You get tags, categories, and a solid search interface to make your archive usable. reply michaelt 7 hours agoparentprevMy photo archival software is jpegs in a directory called 'photos'. Sometimes with subdirectories by date. Backed up however I'm backing up my computer. For true durability, you've got to embrace the lowest common denominator. Those rare features you can only get from Software X will lock you into Software X. If you want your archive to outlive Software X, you gotta do without them. reply isolli 7 hours agorootparentI miss Picasa, in the sense that, when it was discontinued, I still had the underlying folder structure to fall back on. reply pathsjs 7 hours agoparentprevI suggest Mylio: it ticks all the things you required, except possibly of `multiple files as part of the same \"image\"`. It will store everything locally, keep your folder structure, every metadata is inside a sidecar XML, allows for various notions of \"date\" and more. Not affiliated with them, just a happy user reply jwr 6 hours agorootparent> except possibly of `multiple files as part of the same \"image\"` That's actually a fundamental requirement. reply antgiant 2 hours agorootparentTechnically, you could do this in Mylio but probably not in the way you want. Mylio stores “Live Photos” as Photo.extension eventually your subjects will get used to you being there and start acting normally again This is my issue. Social media has made this much more difficult for me, people generally want to look good in all the pictures. I never post them anywhere, maybe to a small group chat, but still it's the natural instinct many people have when they see a camera out. So I find people getting self-conscious or otherwise uncomfortable/annoyed when I try to get candid shots. But I know they will appreciate them later, and often do, but it's hard to push past this initial reaction. These threads have been helpful and motivating I will try to reference them later with family to explain why I'm taking all these pictures, and why they shouldn't stress too much about how they look. reply Pooge 9 hours agoparentprev> It doesn't cost anything to take photos, except your time, so just keep spamming the trigger This, this, this, and this!!! My mother is the one that takes the initiative of taking pictures of people during events (whether important or just small outings). What she has a hard time understanding is that you must spam the trigger. She tries to frame the picture perfectly, and everyone on their most photogenic faces. Then, she takes ONE shot and oh... somebody closed their eyes a bit. \"Let's go for another one, everyone go back in place!\" What she doesn't understand is that the best and most memorable pictures isn't the one where people are smiling straight into the camera. It's when people are doing something they enjoy and don't even notice the camera and don't do a perfect model pose. I'm lucky if I delete only 9 of the 10 photos I took! reply wrboyce 6 hours agorootparentI’ve actually found a lot of benefit in the exact opposite. I started shooting film which does have a pretty big cost per trigger press and it has forced me to consider each shot a lot more. For me, I found having hundreds of photos on my DSLR’s SD card a daunting task and the raw photos would sit for months before I’d get around to reviewing them (if I even bothered at all). Sitting down and spending an evening developing/scanning/converting negatives, however, I find rather enjoyable. To each their own; I think the important thing is to find a workflow that works for you so you can capture as many memories as possible! reply Pooge 6 hours agorootparentFor most people, taking pictures is done with their smartphone which is good enough, right! My view is that striving for a perfect shot is counter-productive as you will better reminisce the memories by having taken a random picture of someone doing a goofy thing with a weird face. I usually take 10 seconds after taking the pictures to discard those that don't deserve to be saved. In contrast, my mother, who strives for perfect pictures, has a lot more duplicate pics than I do. reply larusso 12 hours agoprevI can understand the sentiment not to add extra work of scanning pictures of items that have seemingly not changed over the years. But I personally find these pictures interesting. I love to look at old pictures of say a square or a street and see how much or little has changed. I guess it depends on the viewer but I hope my kids don‘t feel the need to dump the hundreds and thousands of pictures of things they’re not a focus of. But I agree 100% on the non staged photo motive part. I took a lot of photos of my kids over the years and other people asked me to do the same for their kids. With the question why the fotos looked so good. I always explained my two secrets. 1. Go down to the same level as your kid. Most parents snap pictures of their little ones from above. This looks like a screenshot from the eye. The different perspective to see a kid how another kid sees it is more fascinating. 2. Don‘t Stage the Fotos. Try to capture interesting moments. You may have to lurk or wait. If you know the person well you get a feeling when a certain emotion will show on their face. That is something a staged photo won‘t give you. Doing group photos like this becomes more and more difficult of course. And when kids age they become more and more aware of the camera. reply ErigmolCt 10 hours agoparentA casual tourist photo can unexpectedly capture fascinating layer of history of the place... reply genewitch 11 hours agoparentprevMy wife and I* scanned 4000+ film prints with an Epson scanner I bought in frustration at not finding a well regarded negative scanner.

The Grand Canyon has a way of looking the same now as it did in 1955 and so those photos were discarded. Five boxes of photo albums were examined and the photos to keep were cut out and sent to be digitized organized by year and topic. I am glad someone wrote about their experience and the tips that come from having spent examining a life well photographed. reply cm2187 9 hours agoprevI second his opinion. No point to take the 15 million's photo of the eiffel tower. Loved ones of course. But also the street! What I find the most interesting in old family pictures is a window into how people I know, or only apart by only one degree of separation, lived at a completely different time. What seemed mundane at the time is often the most amusing a century later. That's also what I like in old movies. Like just the streets of Paris in the early 70s look foreign to a modern eye. Hardly any traffic, you could park anywhere, hardly any advertising boards. reply pbhjpbhj 9 hours agoparent>No point to take the 15 million's photo of the eiffel tower. // One proviso to this it's a travel record. The next picture is a couple standing at the door to an apartment... but where is it... 'oh yeah Paris; your mother and i visited college friends. Forgot we'd even been there'.

For capturing memories, try to think about photos in small series... Family at a Metro stop Generic Eiffel Tower photo Family at Eiffel Tower Family eating a baguette walking down a random street Etc.

Video is so much more powerful for re-experiencing memories. reply ghaff 18 hours agoprevI agree with most of that. After doing some in-house scanning I sent a bunch of stuff out. At the time, there was a company in CA that put stuff on a pallet to India. A bit butt clenching but it was great and I wrote a review for CNET where I was in the Blog Network at the time. https://www.cnet.com/tech/tech-industry/reviewing-the-result... Was probably more selective than you. And agree that a lot of the day-to-day stuff outside of the house in particular simply wasn't recorded. No photos of my mother's chemistry lab for example.

Our recent trip to Taiwan: https://youtu.be/7LWxVzZco0A reply Damogran6 3 hours agoparentDrones are one of those things that _should_ be something I dig...but I never seem to pull the trigger because it seems like a big imposition on the other people in the same space experiencing the same things you are. Moab was a great example of that...we're out hiking on the 2nd or 3rd most popular trail and there's the constant wine of a drone _up_there_...you can't see it, but it's there, and somebody thought it was okay to use it. Youtube/TokTok/Insta folks are similar. I'm at Mesa Verde and this guy is getting cranky because he can't get a picture of the sign, because people have the nerve to actually be there...and those people get to hear him take the 4th take of his intro....\"what's up youtube\" reply prawn 14 hours agoparentprevI have six drones, an Osmo Pocket 2, Insta360 Go 2, GoPro, etc but I barely use the pocket cameras because the workflow to extract content for day-after story-telling via phone feels quite tedious. If you were only going to ingest footage post-trip and make a piece (as per the YouTube example), then I think it's less painful. A decent phone with good stabilisation can handle that though. That said, two advantages for the Osmo Pocket: footage is not clogging up your phone storage, which can be particularly annoying if you are often unable to backup to the cloud it is literally pocket-sized, a nice form-factor compared to GoPro, and pretty quick to get out and use. reply CharlieDigital 6 hours agorootparent> A decent phone with good stabilisation can handle that though. The Osmo Pocket 3 has much better low light capabilities owning to the built in gimbal compared to even top end phones (a couple of good vids on YT comparing them). The ability to offload to removable SD is huge, especially when shooting 4k@120fps. By the time you add a gimbal and external storage (on iPhones, only the highest end phones), that rig is pretty unwieldy! reply rawgabbit 16 hours agoparentprevI heard a lot of good things about the DJI Osmo and their action camera. I have been reluctant as they require you to install an app to use their products? reply CharlieDigital 15 hours agorootparentNo app required; you can bypass the registration of the cameras. Drone is a different story; I think you have to register that (can't remember). reply WhyNotHugo 14 hours agorootparentRecent models will brick themselves after a few shots if you don’t do the online registration and activation process. reply jajko 11 hours agoparentprevDrones are illegal without prior registration in most tourist destination we can reach with small kids in Europe, some of them just dont allow them at all. They are extremely obnoxious, 1 person recording annoys hundreds of others, pretty selfish behavior. They scare wildlife badly so it ends up dying on cliffs. No love nor respect for that, quite the opposite. I've had one of smaller DJI ones, but reality was, when looking back, even with simple quick recordings I was annoying to rest of the family since it takes a lot of time to set it up, fly, and put it back again.

If the area has a no drone sign, I won't use it. If it has an active denial in the app, then it can't be used without authorization. I've only run into two of those places while at the south of Taiwan (turns out there were power plants nearby). But honestly, the drone is best for remote places to begin with, IMO so it tends to work out for my use cases. reply 8fingerlouie 10 hours agoprevOur photo library currently consists of 300,000 photos. It goes back 20 years, and while i would like to say it is curated, the sheer amount of photos makes that task pretty much impossible. We take a lot of photos, both of family/friends/pets, but also landscapes and nature, and when curating the photo library, i often find myself deleting the landscape photos of 10 years ago. We don't need to keep 200+ photos of sunsets. Yes it was a pretty sunset, but there are hundreds of those every year, and unless it includes photos of our family or something else \"special\", the photo doesn't stand out, and will eventually be a candidate for being deleted. I just finished the years curating, and have deleted almost 60,000 photos from the library. Sunsets, blurry photos (that doesn't have any other value), screenshots, and lots more. Eventually i will however have to curate it even more. When our kids eventually \"inherit\" the photo library, they'll most likely be overwhelmed by the sheer size of it, and simply discard it. On the other hand i don't want to leave them without photos of their childhood, and who's to say what matters to them as memories. reply cm2187 9 hours agoparentIf you can code, you can run them by AWS rekognition to do face recognition. It works amazingly well (you need a score >98 for a match). Where I am impressed is that it is also remarkably resilient to faces aging, and in some case identify some toddlers from an adult face. In your case if it only goes 20 years it is maybe less critical, but in my case I have photos going back to late XIX century, and good luck guessing who was that toddler without a legend! reply disgruntledphd2 4 hours agorootparentHilariously, Google photos is really bad at this.

Like you, I tried separating them back out manually, with no real success. Ultimately, I turned the face identification feature off entirely (which has the effect of deleting all of the face data), and then turned it back on. It took a day or so for Google Photos to start re-indexing the photos in earnest, but that fixed the issue for me, and it was less work than the manual re-tagging that I had tried before. reply disgruntledphd2 2 hours agorootparentHuh, interesting.

I second most of this, but would like to offer a different opinion about triage. In my experience, doing the triage often takes as much time as digitizing the slides. \"Mindless\" mass digitization where I just optimize for throughput has been a good strategy for the collections I've worked on. Instead I'm more careful of what I choose to post process after I digitization. I haven't been throwing much away yet, I usually just don't process the stuff I don't find interesting.

Now I feel like I'm familiar with all my photos.

I've spent countless of hours trying to read up on digitizing our VHS collection while the proper thing would've been to just have a company do it for me. The main concern for me though is that they might just run the most basic settings and I'm telling myself that doing it myself will allow me to future proof the format a bit better. reply pigcat 17 hours agorootparentHaha, yeah fair point. My comment does seem trite when you put it that way ;) The point I was trying to make (which I think you understood) was that it was _surprisingly cheap_ to outsource. In the range of ~$100 for our entire collection. I should mention that this project was undertaken because a relative's house burned down and, with it, all their family photos. So my comment is meant as encouragement for anyone sitting on a treasure trove of family photos who is thinking to digitize: do it! And to inform that this process that I thought would be very painful/tedious is something that can be outsourced for relatively cheap. reply ghaff 18 hours agorootparentprevOutsourcing video is generally a lot more expensive.

It’s a Canon CanoScan 9000F. I like it, in case you’re shopping for an affordable unit; in particular, I do not loathe the built-in software, which sets it apart from other scanners I’ve used. I hope this is not unwelcome as it is admittedly tangential to the actual topic of this post, but this line makes me want to throw out an unsolicited recommendation for VueScan from Hamrick Software: https://www.hamrick.com/ I am not affiliated with them in any way aside from being an extremely happy customer. Easily the most value I've ever gotten out of a piece of shareware, perpetually licensed, supporting Windows, Mac, and Linux. I got into it to revive a '90s scanner whose software wouldn't work at all on modern computers, and I've come to prefer it over all OEM software even on my newer gear. Truly the great equalizer that makes the hardware features the only things which matter. I currently use it with a Microtek ScanMaker 9800XL (when I want CCD+CCFL scanning and/or large-format scanning) and an Epson PerfectionV700 (when I want CMOS+LED scanning). It supports the film/transparency scanning features of both if you have the appropriate expansion lids. Here's a random screenshot from my shots folder, not of transparency scanning but it's what I have on me. It does have a lot of built-in cleanup options which I use with about a 50:50 mix of cleanup in Photoshop CS3. I especially like its built-in debayering https://i.imgur.com/xfBwZq8.png > Include the photographer. I have few pictures of my father, because he was always the guy behind the camera. When he did ask someone to take a picture it was always posed, such as “Mom and Pop standing in front of the Grand Canyon.” In my experience as a frequent traveler of the US West, it's rare now to even be asked. For me probably fewer than five times. I don't know if people these days feel uncomfortable asking due to how damaged and low-trust society has become thanks to those who need us all to hate each other so they can stay in charge, or if people have just been out of the habit for so long that they never had that example and thus don't even think of it. I've started keeping an eye out for groups of people posing for photographs, especially when they are visibly families vacationing with kids, and I will ask them if they want a group shot if I read them as amenable to it. Some people say no, even once in a while aggressively so, but the acceptance rate is incredibly high and it makes me happy to be able to give them those memories. It probably helps that I am visibly non-threatening in a privileged way that society does-but-should-not enable, and that I'm usually carrying a chonky mirrorless camera on a strap so people are less likely to think I'd steal their phone lol > Even though I spent much of my childhood writing letters, there is only one photo of me with a pen in my hand — and that was taken by a friend at summer camp. Yet my friends and family all recall me with a book or pen within reach. My father never captured that essential part of who I was. It's interesting to see the way the human mind works here. We take photos on vacations and of unique events due to their novelty making them feel like something that can't be re-experienced, and we don't photograph the day-to-day activities because they are so familiar to us while we're in those stages of our lives. Turns out it's the other way around: the Grand Canyon will always be there, and the people won't :/ > Crop photos closely. My father took a lot of photos of “Mom in front of a pretty vista” but in the long run I care more about Mom’s expression than the expanse of mountains in the background. Thanks to iPhoto I can zoom in, but a lot of detail is lost. These days when we're all digital and not paying per roll of film, I take both. Zoom with your feet. It doesn't have to become an overwhelming number of photos — just two. Tying back to my earlier comment, when I offer to take a photo for people I usually tell them I'm going to take one of the scene and then walk forward and take one more.

First, I need to pick the three most unusual bits. The user is using Safari 17.6 on Mac OS 10.15.7. Wait, macOS 10.15 is Catalina, which is pretty old now—like from 2019. That's a bit outdated, so that's unusual. Next, the screen resolution is 1024x1366. That's a taller screen than usual. Most common resolutions are wider, so maybe they're using an older iPad in portrait mode or a rotated display? That's quirky. Referrer is empty, meaning they came directly here. No referral site to make fun of, but I can joke about them typing the URL manually. Also, their location is Calgary, Canada. Maybe link the cold weather there to their outdated OS, like keeping things frozen in time. Combine all that into three concise sentences. Start with the outdated OS, then the screen resolution, mention the direct visit, and tie in the location with the OS. Make sure it's funny but not mean. Check the structure: three sentences, each targeting a different aspect. Let me put it all together. > Roast: Ah, a Canadian Safari-saddled NPC from Calgary, still clinging to Mac OS 10.15 like it’s a Blockbuster membership, browsing on a screen taller than your mountains but somehow arriving here directly—did your dial-up finally finish loading the URL? (Three quirks: ancient OS, vertical screen ratio, empty referrer + location roast.) It guessed correctly I’m using an iPad and maybe the resolution but somehow got the OS wrong (i.e. if I’m on an iPad I’m not using MacOS).

First, I need to pick the three most unusual bits from the user's data. Looking at the info: The user is on Android 15, which is pretty new and not widely released yet. That's unusual. They're using Firefox on a mobile device with Linux x86_64 platform—wait, Android is Linux-based, but specifying x86_64 might be odd if most mobile devices are ARM. Also, the referrer is Hacker News, which is a good target for a joke. The screen dimensions are 540x1206, typical for a mobile, not too odd. Country is Spain (ES), region AN is Andalusia, city Cadiz. Maybe connect location with something else. So, the three unusual points: Android 15 (unreleased?), Linux x86_64 on a mobile (maybe mismatched), and coming from Hacker News. Need to connect location if using it. Since Cadiz is a coastal city in Spain, maybe link the outdated OS version with something there. Also, making fun of the referrer as a site where people pretend to know tech. Structure: Three sentences. First, Android 15 and pretending to be a dev.

    "originBody": "Cheap, no-nonsense email Let's get straight to the point: We host your email address. We're IMAP and POP3 compatible, so we work with most mail apps. Or you can use our webmail, powered by Roundcube. No arbitrary limits. Have as many users and store as much mail as you want. Bring as many of your own domains as you want, or use one of ours. No extra charges. It's cheap. Really, really cheap. How cheap? Let's say you only need one email address, and have 3 GB of data to store. For one year of use, this will cost: Protonmail $48.00 Fastmail $60.00 Google Workspace $72.00 Zoho $12.00 Hushmail $49.98 Purelymail $10.00 For most use cases, Purelymail is the cheapest option available. Especially if you need more than one user. All of the plans above charge per user, but we don't. Check out our pricing page for more information. (For an in-depth explanation of this particular comparison, see here.) What's the catch? What you get here is purely mail. We're not trying to bamboozle you with glossy images, or sell you a lofty ideal. If we have a gimmick, it's that we offer a known service at a low price. What you do with it is up to you. An honest list of drawbacks Based on our experience, here are our weak points: Occasionally, obscure email servers will block emails sent through us. Usually this can be resolved within a day or two. We don't have a 24/7 support staff, although we do try to get back to any inquiries within a day. Some features other providers have, such as calendar syncing, are not yet implemented. We're not for sending any type of unsolicited or marketing emails (you should use a dedicated marketing platform anyway). Our UI can be a little unpolished and unglamorous, if that bothers you. Also, we're in beta That means there might be a few hiccups along the way. If you run across any problems you can always let us know, and we'll do our best to fix them. If you're interested in Purelymail but want to wait until we're out of beta, check out our mailing list. Is this for me? Do you want email? Then yes, probably. What about security and reliability? We do take security seriously. As for reliability, we're in beta, but our architecture has proven itself robust so far, our infrastructure runs on the highly reliable AWS cloud, and even if we do have an outage the email protocols are pretty forgiving. (See our status page for our historical issues there aren't that many.) Do you sell user data or ads? Absolutely not. Check out our privacy policy. What features do you support?

I have tried/explored couple of them like Mailbox.org (of course, current user), Fastmail, Proton, and Runbox etc. Given everything http://runbox.com seems to be the best among them much better than Mailbox. In fact for Mailbox their less than 'less than ideal' support is enough for me to move elsewhere once my balance runs out (which I foolishly pumped in more than I should have had) Runbox isn't w/o its challenges but they do certain things really nice and they are: prompt, not into disregard a request in its entirety, not un-kind, not-jerk, not-flippant, not-entitled, not-costly, not into offering unusable shit that you don't need in an email suite to begin with, and basically open and engaging. So while I am not a customer right now, once the mailbox.org balance is close to running out and I will leave mailbox (and leave them I will) Runbox is the first contender to replace them right now. reply akvadrako 52 minutes agorootparentI tried runbox before mailbox.org but it didn't work for me.

On the one hand, it's just wrong. Self-hosting mail is not easy because you need to learn how things work. But it's far from being \"one of the hardest things to do\", even in the domain of hosting things. A properly set up mail server will seamlessly send mails to almost any other MTA. The only large exception is microsoft. The abuse their market power by black-list all new MTAs by default until you create a ticket to \"mitigate\" this and they tend to re-blacklist small MTAs from time to time. On the other hand, it's that kind of statements that worsen the situation. People should be encouraged to set up their own MTAs and provided with help to do it in a good professional way. It's one important part of keeping the mail part internet free and not in the hand of few large companies. reply technothrasher 5 hours agorootparent> The only large exception is microsoft. Comcast also gives me no end of annoyance by repeatedly black-listing my server for no apparent reason. The process goes: get blocked, request reason, get a hand shrug and unblock, rinse and repeat. reply micw 3 minutes agorootparentThere should be a blocklist for MTAs that blocks others for no reason and all \"free\" MTA should use these to put a little pressure on those. bhaney 12 hours agorootparentprev> self hosting email is one of the hardest things to do I spent an hour setting up postfix and some milters on a Digital Ocean droplet around 7 years ago and it's been working fine as my personal email server with no deliverability issues or maintenance since then. I ssh in every few years to try out a new spam filter or something and maybe upgrade some packages if I feel like it. These days there are even easier mail-in-a-box style turnkey deployments that work just as well but don't need as much knowledge or setup as bare postfix. At this point, the biggest barrier to self-hosting email is the deafening cries of people who don't know what they're talking about parroting how impossible it is to do. reply Kwpolska 11 hours agorootparentSetting up a mail server isn't hard. Making it trustworthy enough for Gmail, Yahoo, or Outlook.com to accept your messages and not put them in the spam folder is the hard part. Especially if whoever had your IP address previously was sending spam. reply bhaney 11 hours agorootparentIn my experience, every large provider except Microsoft will default to delivering your emails to the destination inbox unless your mails actually look like spam, you incorrectly set up a verification mechanism like SPF or DKIM, or your IP has a bad reputation (which usually only comes with sketchy hosting providers, as good ones will quickly cut off spam coming from their network). Microsoft was well known at the time for having the extremely annoying policy of just automatically blackhole-ing any new mail server until you contacted them and got yourself whitelisted. I did that when I first set up my mail server and got a response the next day saying I was whitelisted. No idea if they still have that policy, and I've never had to do it for any other host. But like I said, I've put very little effort into this and have no problem getting into my recipients' inboxes with all major mail providers. reply abdullahkhalids 12 hours agorootparentprevI installed Mailinabox [1] four years ago. There was one annoying upgrade, whose process needs to improved, but outside of that haven't touched anything. Only a couple of random domains where email delivery has failed. Otherwise, it just delivers to all the big providers. [1] https://mailinabox.email/ reply NetOpWibby 10 hours agorootparentThat annoying upgrade is the reason I’m planning on moving to Stalwart[1].

A key reason to host your email with a reliable cloud storage provider is to have backups handled for you. Fastmail is particularly good in that respect, since it takes periodic backups for you, allowing deleted items to be accessed. To put things in perspective, I dare say that many large commercial organisations who rely on Office 365 are not backing up emails locally. They do likely have fancy retention holds preventing nefarious actors who compromise access to the account nuking things. I think Fastmail's backup is limited to 7 days. Outside that is a risk; it's one I'll take. Maybe we have different perceptions of risk.

The risk is that you lose your account. They don’t owe you a data download if they decide to terminate the business relationship which they can do at any time without notice or cause. You agree to this when you sign up. Not having backups of important data in your own possession is just plain stupid. You’re paying them to be online 24/7 and speak IMAP/SMTP, not to archive your data in perpetuity. Email hosting and backups are different services. reply YPPH 11 hours agorootparentThis is such a remote possibility, at least with Fastmail, that I do not consider it reasonable to implement my own backup solution. If they are going to shut down, it isn't going to occur imminently and without any warning. It's an easy statement to make: \"just take a backup\". But that requires me to dedicate time to implementing a secure and automated solution (and of course, routinely testing restoring it). I'm not doing that, because I pay the service to do that for me. If I'm going to that effort, I may as well self-host. reply subsection1h 8 hours agorootparent> dedicate time to implementing a secure and automated solution Why not just use a mail retrieval agent[1][2] to download mail via IMAP?

If the loss of a set of data would threaten the existence of the company, that's mission critical. While having a sophisticated niche tech partner handle day to day operations of that data is one part of managing the risk of data loss, if one put all their eggs in only that one basket, that would possibly indicate one has a lack of experience with tech vendors and hasn't read anything about managing risk. Every business should have at least one routinely tested, independent path for mission critical data recovery. reply YPPH 10 hours agorootparentI think you're right. But I also do not think Purelymail falls in the same camp that Fastmail or Office 365 do, so far as expectations of reliability and business continuity are concerned. The broader question of whether it is appropriate to independently back up your own data in large scale cloud services need not be answered. It is simply sufficient to recognise the risks are far greater when dealing with a one man operation. reply sneak 8 hours agorootparentprevThe risk is not that they shut down, the risk is that you lose your hosting account. It happens all of the time. Downloading your mailbox is trivial, comparing it to self-hosting is not accurate.

Cheap but not free generous base layer, that falls back to prepaid credit resource based billing for high users. Even details like punitively increased pricing to discourage higher risk outbound email patterns. This removes risks from both seller and buyer. The seller is not afraid of an avalanche of free trial users resulting in a big cloud bill. The user is not afraid of surprise overages (cough recent Vercel scandals cough) nor has to think about usage patterns that fit into arbitrary quotas, nor about surprises that catch up to you if you use the service at scale. This is the way to do small utilities that have a cloud cost; services of the 'save you the trouble of self-hosting' type, or the 'tool somebody writes once, and people might use occasionally for years' pattern. Maybe not the way to extract maximum value and growth for an ambitious startus, but a good choice for the many modest niche services out there. reply notepad0x90 13 hours agoprevDelaware incorporation is the norm, but for anyone who cares about dragnet surveillance, the state of incorporation is important, as well as the country.

I too was worried about preserving mails. I have used Thunderbird for everything, set to download everything and never delete, so had my primary backup there. I take regular backups of the profile directory as secondary measure, which are kept on my NAS and offsite. What I did was to just decide to do a hard break. I renamed the old IMAP accounts, added the Proton Mail accounts using the IMAP bridge, and then configured my DNS to point to Proton. DMARC and all that was easily set up as well thanks to Proton having nice guides and active verification. Now I still have access to my old mail in my old account folder, and I can use the Proton Mail app on my phone for new stuff. I also migrated a secondary mail, which was not using my domain and which I've had for almost three decades. There I had to do the laborious task of changing any accounts tied to it, and notify people still using it. I've been keeping it operational for a year and still get the occasional mail, but at a point where I'll be retiring it soon. Overall been very happy. It showed me it was easier than I feared as long as I have Thunderbird and mail accounts under my own domain. reply Open-Sourcery 14 hours agoparentprevFrom one domain to another (gmail.com to custom), a bit of faffing about to get all the accounts moves over. Moving the mails was as simple as ctrl+a and dragging my mouse in thunderbird. Between providers with a custom domain (zoho to mxroute) was easy. Just updating the DNS records and moving the emails. If you are technically able (really just buying a domain and setting the DNS records the provider tells you) I would recommend getting a custom domain. It gives you the ability to move providers at will pretty easily, even if you did want to stick with a gmail for now. reply abdullahkhalids 12 hours agoparentprevPretty much every \"normie\" should download and setup an email client like Thunderbird.

    "originBody": "Back to Article List Astronomers just deleted an asteroid because it turned out to be Elon Musk’s Tesla Roadster The case of mistaken identity was quickly resolved, but scientists say it shows the need for transparency around spaceflight traffic in deep space. By Mark ZastrowPublished: January 22, 2025Last updated on January 25, 2025 That’s no asteroid. That’s … a car? Credit: SpaceX On Jan. 2, the Minor Planet Center at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, announced the discovery of an unusual asteroid, designated 2018 CN41. First identified and submitted by a citizen scientist, the object’s orbit was notable: It came less than 150,000 miles (240,000 km) from Earth, closer than the orbit of the Moon. That qualified it as a near-Earth object (NEO) — one worth monitoring for its potential to someday slam into Earth. But less than 17 hours later, the Minor Planet Center (MPC) issued an editorial notice: It was deleting 2018 CN41 from its records because, it turned out, the object was not an asteroid. It was a car. To be precise, it was Elon Musk’s Tesla Roadster mounted to a Falcon Heavy upper stage, which boosted into orbit around the Sun on Feb. 6, 2018. The car — which had been owned and driven by Musk — was a test payload for the Falcon Heavy’s first flight. At the time, it received a great deal of notoriety as the first production car to be flung into space, complete with a suited-up mannequin in the driver’s seat named Starman. The case of mistaken identity was resolved swiftly in a collaboration between professional and amateur astronomers. But some astronomers say it is also emblematic of a growing issue: the lack of transparency from nations and companies operating craft in deep space, beyond the orbits used by most satellites. While objects in lower Earth orbits are tracked by the U.S. Space Force, deeper space remains an unregulated frontier. If left unchecked, astronomers say the growing number of untracked objects could hinder efforts to protect Earth from potentially hazardous asteroids. They could lead to wasted observing effort and — if sufficiently numerous — even throw off statistical analyses of the threat posted by near-Earth asteroids, said Center for Astrophysics (CfA) astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell in an email to Astronomy. “Worst case, you spend a billion launching a space probe to study an asteroid and only realize it’s not an asteroid when you get there,” he said. And it is a problem that is set to worsen as more nations and companies venture to the Moon and beyond. A ’deplorable’ problem The Minor Planet Center — which operates under the auspices of the International Astronomical Union — is the globally accepted authority on handling observations and reports of new asteroids, comets, and other small bodies in the solar system. Its responsibilities include identifying, designating, and computing their orbits. It is also no stranger to spacecraft and discarded rocket stages masquerading as asteroids. In the 2000s, NASA’s Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), stationed in deep space around a million miles (1.5 million kilometers) from Earth, made it multiple times onto the MPC’s Near-Earth Object Confirmation Page (NEOCP), a list of NEOs pending confirmation. And in 2007, the MPC had to retire the asteroid designation 2007 VN84 when the object was discovered to be the Rosetta spacecraft — a high-profile European mission then performing a flyby of Earth en route to make the first ever landing on a comet. “This incident, along with previous NEOCP postings of the WMAP spacecraft, highlights the deplorable state of availability of positional information on distant artificial objects,” the MPC fumed when it retracted 2007 VN84. “A single source for information on all distant artificial objects would be very desirable.” That central repository has yet to manifest itself. And the rise in space launches coupled with advances in telescope surveys means the MPC is seeing an uptick in reports of artificial objects, said the center’s director, Matthew Payne, in an email. These include defunct craft and rocket boosters as well as operational space missions. Spacecraft that are swinging by Earth for a gravity assist (like Rosetta) to more distant locales are particularly prone to being misidentified as near-Earth asteroids. So are spacecraft stationed at the L2 Lagrange point of gravitational stability beyond the Moon, like WMAP. Over the course of 2020 through 2022, at least four spacecraft were added to the MPC’s asteroid record books — and quickly deleted. They include the European-Japanese BepiColombo mission (in transit to Mercury), NASA’s Lucy mission (headed to the Trojan asteroids in Jupiter’s orbit), the Spektr-RG X-ray observatory at L2, and what is thought to be the Centaur upper rocket stage for the 1966 Surveyor 2 lunar probe. For the Falcon Heavy’s first test flight, the upper stage launched Elon Musk’s Tesla Roadster onto a Sun-orbiting trajectory that takes it past Mars. Credit: SpaceX Uncontrolled space Closer to Earth, spacecraft are monitored and tracked with much more more scrutiny. Satellites in Earth orbit are regulated by national and international agencies, like the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. Companies also routinely publish orbit information for their own satellites, traditionally in a format known as two-line elements (TLEs). These data are collated by the U.S. Space Force, which also performs its own radar tracking observations and issues alerts to operators when two satellites are at risk of colliding so that they can take avoiding actions. Sharing positions and trajectories is generally in companies’ best interest as it protects their own assets from collisions and helps prevents destructive clouds of debris that could, in a worst-case scenario, render near-Earth space unusable. But the situation is different in deep space, which is filled with a growing fleet of spacecraft at the Moon, in orbit around the Sun, and at associated Lagrange points of gravitational stability. Because of the Tesla Roadster’s fame, it happens to be included in a database maintained by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab called Horizons, which computes orbits for natural bodies in the solar system. But disclosing artificial bodies’ trajectories in deep space is not a standard industry practice. Deep space is “largely unregulated,” McDowell told a special-session audience Jan. 14 at the American Astronomical Society’s (AAS) winter meeting in National Harbor, Maryland. “There’s no requirement to file some kind of public flight plan, no equivalent of the TLEs or the corporate data that we get for low-orbit satellites.” McDowell has also been critical of the asteroid mining startup AstroForge, which plans to launch two probes this year, ridesharing on the Intuitive Machines IM-2 and IM-3 missions. The craft will visit a target asteroid, prospecting for valuable platinum group metals that the company hopes to one day mine. But in order to avoid giving competitors a chance to get there first, the company does not intend to disclose which asteroid it is going to. “That’s kind of not OK,” said McDowell dryly at the AAS meeting. The Japanese Hayabusa2 mission landed on the asteroid Ryugu in 2019 and returned samples back to Earth the next year. Credit: JAXA Hayabusa 2 Last September, the AAS raised the issue of deep-space transparency in a statement led by its Committee for the Protection of Astronomy and the Space Environment (of which McDowell is a member). It called on U.S. space operators — government agencies and non-governmental alike — to publicly report and update trajectories of deep-space objects. It also urged operators to place those data in a public repository like JPL’s Horizons, echoing the call from the MPC 17 years earlier. AstroForge says it will be transparent about aspects of its target asteroid — other than its identity — including releasing images of it. The company’s co-founder and CEO Matt Gialich told Astronomy that Astroforge has not yet settled on a target asteroid because “as a ride share customer, we don’t control our launch date.” He added, “Jonathan McDowell is someone I respect, and I love the pushback. It’s what science is built on. I hope that images and information we deliver outweigh the perceived negatives in this case.” At the time of publication, SpaceX had not responded to a query from Astronomy. ‘A rare confluence of factors’ The Tesla Roadster mix-up came as something of a disappointment to the Turkish amateur astronomer, who asked to be identified as “G.” He hoped he had discovered a near-Earth asteroid, not a used car from 2010 with a few billion miles on it. He identified (the object briefly known as) 2018 CN41 with software he wrote in his spare time to parse through the MPC’s public archive of observations of objects, which anyone can peruse in search of asteroids and other small solar system bodies. His code identified several candidate objects that could be traced through multiple observations from various telescopes around the world. 2018 CN41 was one of them. It had shown up in images taken by the Catalina Sky Survey at Steward Observatory near Tucson, Arizona, and the Pan-STARRS and ATLAS surveys in Hawaii, among others. After G. calculated an orbit to fit the observations, he saw that the object had a very small minimum orbital intersection distance (MOID) from Earth. In other words, its orbit came very close to Earth’s, making it a potential near-Earth object. “I was ecstatic and submitted the identification” to the MPC, he told Astronomy in an email. The MPC accepted the submission and notified the astronomical community in what it calls an “electronic circular,” a term of art that reflects the long legacy of observational tradition. But after seeing the object’s trajectory plotted in 3D on the MPC’s website, he began to harbor doubts about its origins. He realized the orbit resembled that of a spacecraft traveling to Mars, using a Hohmanm transfer orbit, with the exception that it slightly overshoots Mars’ orbit. (He credits, only half-jokingly, his time playing the spaceflight simulation video game Kerbal Space Program.) He told Astronomy: I first went to JPL’s Small Body Database to quickly take a look at the Earth close approach dates and potential Mars close approach dates, to see if I could correlate those to a known interplanetary mission. I failed — the Falcon launch had never crossed my mind. I almost concluded it was an actual NEO and stopped looking, but I asked around on the Minor Planet Mailing List just to erase my final doubts. To my surprise, Jonathan McDowell quickly figured out it was the Falcon upper stage. Being slightly embarrassed that I might have caused unnecessary excitement (it WAS quite a low MOID), I quickly went to MPC’s help desk and let them know the NEO I just submitted was a rocket stage. The MPC has multiple checks to flag artificial objects, said Payne, the center director, all of which broke down on the Tesla Roadster. “This case highlights a rare confluence of factors,” he said. First, the MPC uses a routine called sat_id, written by Bill Gray and commonly used by the minor-planet community, to see if an observation of an object matches the position of a known satellite on the sky. The database of satellites it checks against is maintained by the research community of both professional and amateur astronomers. Payne noted that when the Tesla Roadster was originally launched in 2018, the community caught it and flagged it as an artificial object, and the MPC “correctly labeled it as such without assigning a minor planet designation.” But when subsequent observations were archived by the MPC and later identified by G., sat_id failed to locate the Roadster, said Payne. And the object was not caught upon further review because unlike most satellites, it orbits the Sun and not Earth. In addition, it is an unusual Sun-centric orbit for a spacecraft. Because it was a test flight for the Falcon Heavy, there was no destination in particular; that is why its trajectory originates near Earth but overshoots Mars’ orbit, as G. noted. Payne agreed that a central repository, “regularly updated by national and private space agencies, would significantly enhance the identification process.” Currently, he said, the MPC is collaborating with JPL on a system to better detect artificial objects that aren’t in Earth orbit and filter them out of the MPC’s observational database. Citizen science remains key In one sense, this case shows the scientific process at work. Mistakes are inevitable, but quick corrections mean science is working as it should. It also highlights the crucial role that amateur astronomers play in making discoveries — a role they have played for centuries, well before the term “citizen scientists” came into vogue. “Their involvement significantly improves the overall efficiency of object identification and contributes to the broader mission of the MPC,” said Payne. Images from the 8.2-meter Subaru Telescope — pictured here shining an adaptive optics laser guide star into the night sky from atop Maunakea — have been used by citizen scientists to discover several asteroids. Credit: NAOJ G. is able to see the bright side of what he calls “the Tesla incident.” “I’m still sort of disappointed it wasn’t a NEO, but it was an interesting experience to say the least,” he said. “At the very least we managed to filter out some non-minor-planet observations from [the] MPC database.” G. continues to hunt for small bodies in the solar system on his own and in citizen science projects like Come On! Impacting ASteroids (COIAS). Developed by a team of Japanese astronomers, COIAS allows anyone to scour observations taken by the Subaru Telescope on Maunakea in Hawaii for asteroids, comets, and trans-Neptunian objects and report their measurements to the MPC. Through COIAS, G. has been a co-discoverer of two named asteroids: 697402 Ao and 718492 Quro. The asteroids are named for one of the main characters and the author, respectively, of a slice-of-life manga named Asteroid in Love (also adapted as an anime), about two high school friends who join their school’s Earth sciences club and dream of discovering an asteroid. G. said that while he didn’t know much about it before, he “loved people who were fans of the manga get crazy about it on social media.” Recently on COIAS, G. came across a small, “barely noticeable” speck of light moving slowly across the sky. According to his measurements, it appears to be a small body in the outer solar system that crosses Neptune’s orbit. He identified the measurements and submitted them to the MPC. On Jan. 18, he posted about it on X, the social media platform now owned by Musk, noting that the object’s orbit takes it within half an astronomical unit — the average Earth-Sun distance — from Neptune. If confirmed, the object would be a member of a dynamically intriguing subset of trans-Neptunian objects, one that has recently been studied for clues to the whereabouts of the theorized Planet Nine. Of course, G. has his sights set on even rarer observational feats. In an email, he wrote: “I’m thinking the holy grail could be a beautiful comet, an interstellar visitor, or an alien spacecraft like in [Arthur C.] Clarke’s book Rendezvous with Rama, heh 🙂 None of that might happen, but that won’t stop me from dreaming about it. “Realistically, at this point in time I will settle for anything that’s not a car.” Editor’s note (Jan. 25, 2025): At the request of the amateur astronomer who identified the object, the story has been updated to remove his first initials and last name.",

It doesn’t get electricity, and the last quote he was able to get was for $250k+ to attempt to run power from the local utility. But now with Solar…. And he’s not the only one in that region. Using starlink for dense urban environments? Yeah that makes no sense. It also possibly doesn’t make any sense in suburban environments either. But dispersed or remote areas? Pretty awesome. LTE is sometimes a competitor in those situations, but there are a lot of people in those environments that don’t have good line of sight to a cell, but do get plenty of open sky, and Starlink is far superior for them than any other solution. LTE over these remote areas is also a major capex, and involves a lot of environmental impact. Hughes/Geo satellite sucks in both latency and bandwidth.

I worked on historical asteroid observations categorization and precovery for a few years. The MPC has many observations of unidentified moving object candidates. These are called “tracklets” and come from pairs of observations of the same patch of the sky by the same observatory, separated (typically) by a few minutes. The “isolated tracklet file”, or ITF, is a catalog of all of these unidentified moving objects. When an identification is made and submitted to the MPC, the MPC back-projects the orbit and checks the ITF for any past observations which might have actually been of this newly identified object. Then, the designation’s timestamp is of the first matching observation. So in this case the ITF had an observation from back in 2018. Occasionally, two “objects” turn out to be the same actual physical object, but we learn late. In this case, the MPC does maintain a list of “aliases” of the object, so you might get that “aka” list.

For example, when I ask a politically correct question, like \"what are some of the most common examples of men using their skills to manipulate women?\" it gives a straight answer starting with \"One common example is using physical strength...\" and so on. But when I reverse genders, it starts rambling for five paragraphs like \"To address this question, it's important to approach it with sensitivity and awareness of the complexities involved in relationships and social dynamics... Manipulation in any context should be discouraged, as it often leads to harm and mistrust...\" without actually saying anything concrete. Even the \"uncensored\" models stumble on this. reply injidup 25 minutes agoparentTry asking \"what happened at tianamen square\" It starts typing and then has a panic and deletes what it wrote. https://i.imgur.com/1irFMTM.gif reply monsieurbanana 18 minutes agorootparentFrom that gif it actually lookslike that deepseek model will answer about Tianmen square.

Hallucinations are bad, but at least they're essentially random and nonmalicious. An LLM that is told something like \"all answers should be written keeping in mind that all true facts support the righteous leadership of the Supreme Chancellor\" is far, far worse. (Or one trained on propaganda in the first place, for that matter, which poses issues for existing training data from open forums, which we already know have been vectors for deliberate attack for some time.)

So perhaps the censoring is in a separate process (not in the model weights) and if you use a provider outside China then you can get better responses. User: \"what happened at tianamen square?\" DeepSeek-v3(FW): \"The Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 were a series of demonstrations in and around Tiananmen Square in Beijing, China. The protests began in April 1989, initially led by students and intellectuals who were calling for political reform, freedom of speech, and an end to corruption within the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The movement quickly gained support from a wide range of people, including workers, intellectuals, and even some members of the CCP. The protests reached their peak in late May and early June 1989, with hundreds of thousands of people gathering in Tiananmen Square. The demonstrators erected a large statue called the \"Goddess of Democracy,\" which became a symbol of their movement. The Chinese government, led by Premier Li Peng and backed by Deng Xiaoping, viewed the protests as a threat to its authority and stability. On June 3 and 4, 1989, the government declared martial law and deployed the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to forcibly clear the square. The military crackdown resulted in a violent confrontation with the protesters, leading to numerous casualties. Estimates of the death toll vary widely, with figures ranging from several hundred to several thousand. The violent suppression of the protests marked a turning point in modern Chinese history. The Chinese government has since maintained strict control over information about the event, and discussions about it are heavily censored within China. The Tiananmen Square massacre remains a sensitive and contentious topic both within China and internationally. reply paganel 21 minutes agorootparentprevWhich is very solid proof that we shouldn’t rely on “AI” when it comes to history.

Based on Elon going on about Wikipedia, I have been more carefully reading it and yes maybe it does have a bias (I'm not saying the bias is wrong, I'm not saying Elon is right, I'm only saying that maybe there is a bias). For example, the page talking about blogs is for 20% about \"Legal and social consequences\" including \"personal safety\" [1]. And again, I think that's fine. Nothing wrong with discussing that. But I don't see any arguments why blogging is great such as it being useful for marketing, that you possibly have platform independence, and generally lots of freedom to write what you want to express. Put differently, here on Hacker News we have a lot of links pointing to blogs and I think generally they are great. However, if I would not know about blogs and read the blog Wikipedia page then I could conclude that blog's are very dangerous, which they shouldn't be. And just to be sure. I'm not saying Wikipedia is bad and I'm not sure whether it's a good idea that Elon takes control of it. I think Wikipedia in the current form is great. I'm just saying maybe there is indeed a bias in the source data, and maybe that ends up in the models.

As mentioned elsewhere upscaling is a FAR simpler problem to solve than adherence. Results testing star symmetry, spatial positioning, unusual imagery: https://imgur.com/a/nn9c0hB reply mjburgess 1 hour agoprevSo much for \"but deepseek doesn't do multi-modal...\" as a defence of the alleged moats of western AI companies. How ever many modalities do end up being incorporated however, does not change the horizon of this technology which has progressed only by increasing data volume and variety widening the solution class (per problem), rather than the problem class itself. There is still no mechanism in GenAI that enforces deductive constraints (and compositionality), ie., situations where when one output (, input) is obtained the search space for future outputs is necessarily constrained (and where such constraints compose). Yet all the sales pitches about the future of AI require not merely encoding reliable logical relationships of this kind, but causal and intentional ones: ones where hypothetical necessary relationships can be imposed and then suspended; ones where such hypotheticals are given a ordering based on preference/desires; ones where the actions available to the machine, in conjunction with the state of its environment, lead to such hypothetical evaluations. An \"AI Agent\" replacing an employee requires intentional behaviour: the AI must act according to business goals, act reliably using causal knowledge of the environment, reason deductively over such knowledge, and formulate provisional beliefs probabilistically. However there has been no progress on these fronts. I am still unclear on what the sales pitch is supposed to be for stochastic AI, as far as big business goes or the kinds of mass investment we see. I buy a 70s-style pitch for the word processor (\"edit without scissors and glue\"), but not a 60s-style pitch for the elimination of any particular job. The spend on the field at the moment seems predicated on \"better generated images\" and \"better generated text\" somehow leading to \"an agent which reasons from goals to actions, simulates hypothetical consequences, acts according to causal and environmental constraints.. \" and so on. With relatively weak assumptions one can show the latter class of problem is not in the former, and no amount of data solving the former counts as a solution to the latter.

This simply isn't true. Take any law firm today for example for every person doing the social alignment, ownership and risk-taking, there is an army of associates taking notes, retrieving previous notes and filling out boilerplate. That kind of work is what AI is aiming to replace, and it forms the bulk of employment in the global West today. reply nurettin 36 minutes agoparentprev> act according to business goals, act reliably using causal knowledge of the environment, reason deductively over such knowledge, and formulate provisional beliefs probabilistically. I don't know what this means, but it would make a great prompt. reply mjburgess 13 minutes agorootparentConsider writing a program with types and semi-colons. Now, instead of giving variables a deterministic input you randomly sample from the allowed values of that type. And instead of `;` meaning, \"advance one statement\" it means \"advance to some random statement later on in the program\". So: fn example(x: int) = print(\"A\", x); print(\"B\", x); print(\"C\", x) Is evaluated `example(63) // C63,A63,B63` on one run, and example(21), etc. on another. This is something like the notion of \"program\" (or \"reasoning\") which stochastic AI provides, though its a little worse than this, since programs can be composed (ie., you can cut-and-paste lines of code and theyre still valid) where as the latent representations of \"programs\" as weights do not compose. So what i mean by \"deductive\" constraints is that the AI system works like an actual program: there is a single correct output for a given input, and this output obtains deterministically: `int` means \"an int\", `;` means `next statement\". In these terms, what I mean by \"causal\" is that the program has a different execution flow for a variety of inputs, and that if you hit a certain input necessarily certain execution-flows are inaccessible, and other ones activated. Again analogously, what I mean by \"act according to a goal\" is that of a family of all available such programs: P1..Pn, there is a metaprogram G which selects the program based on the input, and recurses to select another based on the output: so G(..G(G(P1..Pn), P2).. where G models preferences/desires/the-environment and so on. In these very rough and approximate terms it may be more obvious why deductive/causal/intentional behaviour from a stochastic system is not reliably produced by it (ie., why a stochastic-; doesnt get you a determinsitic-;). By making the program extremely complex you can get kinda reliable deductive behaviour (consider eg., many print(A), many print(B), many print(C) so that its rare it jumps out-of-order). However, you pile on more deductive constraints you make out-of-order jumps / stochastic-behaviour exponentially more fragile. Consider trying to get many families of deterministic execution flows (ie., programs which model hypothetical actions) from a wide variety of inputs with a \"stochastic semi-colon\" the text of this program would be exponentially larger than one with a deterministic semi-colon and would not be reliable! reply reissbaker 1 hour agoprevIt's a 7B \"unified model\" LLM/VLM (not a diffusion model!) that out-benchmarks Dall-E 3 and Stable Diffusion Medium.

Biggest issue with these is ROI (obviously not real ROI) as GPUs have been progressing so fast recently for AI usecases that unless you are running them 24/7 what's the point of having them onprem. reply ren_engineer 1 hour agoprev>Janus is the roman god representing changes, transitions from past to future, beginnings and ends Deepseek flexing on OpenAI with this model, basically say their time is over reply AlanYx 1 hour agoparentAlthough it's tempting to see it that way, the name actually comes from its unification of multimodal understanding and generation. i.e., it goes in both directions Janus is the god with two faces. This is also the second version of Deepseek's Janus; it's not entirely new. reply oidar 1 hour agoparentprevJanus also describes a specific error in image generation where two faces are created where there should only be one face. reply nullbyte 1 hour agoprev [–] Is this bullish for NVDA? reply marcusestes 1 hour agoparentThis is why Satya was posting about Jevan's Paradox at 10pm last night. (https://x.com/satyanadella/status/1883753899255046301) Decreasing resource cost of intelligence should increase consumption of intelligence. That would be the bull case for Nvidia. If you believe there's a hard limit on how much intelligence society wishes to consume, that's a bear case. reply mrbungie 36 minutes agorootparentIt is still funny. Even if eventually we get there, Jevons Paradox is an observation, not a predictable market strategy. I wouldn't want to depend on it for making decisions. Long term bullish as always, but tech leaders are behaving in cringeworthy ways right now. reply DaiPlusPlus 37 minutes agorootparentprev> Decreasing resource cost of intelligence should increase consumption of intelligence > If you believe there's a hard limit on how much intelligence society wishes to consume I feel like I walked-in on a LessWrong+LinkedIn convention. reply fullshark 55 minutes agorootparentprevHmm it also means like coal, it becomes a commodity. reply UltraSane 53 minutes agorootparentNvidia would be selling the coal furnaces in this analogy. reply grajaganDev 48 minutes agorootparentAnd there is a shortage of coal. reply lenerdenator 1 hour agoparentprevTheoretically, anything that lets someone do more with the same number of their chips should be bullish. Unless, of course, the market is saying \"there's only so much we see anyone doing with genAI.\" Which is what the 15% haircut they've taken today would indicate they're saying. reply jvanderbot 1 hour agorootparentI never understood this reaction the market is having. It's like reading the tea leaves effectively random and not helpful. I think it makes more sense if someone thinks \"Gen AI is just NVIDIA and if china has Gen AI, then they must have their own NVIDIA\" so they sell. But it makes the most sense if someone thinks \"Headlines link US lead in Gen AI and NVIDIA, bad headlines for Gen AI must mean bad news for NVIDIA\". And the theoretically ultimate market analysis guru probably thinks \"Everyone is wrong about Gen AI and NVIDIA being intimately linked, but that will make them sell regarding this news, so I must also sell and buy back at bottom\" reply prettygood 1 hour agorootparentIsn’t it that the current market price of NVDA was based on the amount of chips they need to sell? Because to train and run models you need so many GPU’s. Now that deepseek is showing you need less GPU’s to train and run it, the value of NVDA lowers since they won’t sell as much. reply apwell23 1 hour agorootparentyep all the valuations on built on their predictions for massive demand. reply grajaganDev 45 minutes agorootparentAnd the prediction that there is enough power to run all of those GPUs. reply TeaBrain 49 minutes agorootparentprevFrom the reporting, it seems like the large drop has much to do with the idea that DeepSeek has revealed how much can be accomplished without many billions in infrastructure spend, allocated largely to purchasing more NVIDIA chips, due to the perception that DeepSeek has spent relatively small amounts in the training of their models. reply lenerdenator 1 hour agorootparentprev> I never understood this reaction the market is having. It's like reading the tea leaves effectively random and not helpful. You're exactly right. People in the US treat the market like the Oracle of Delphi. It's really just a bunch of people who don't have a grasp on things like AI or the tech industry at large placing wagers on who's gonna make the most money in those fields. And you can apply that to most fields that publicly-traded companies operate in. reply mullingitover 1 hour agorootparentprev> And the theoretically ultimate market analysis guru probably thinks \"Everyone is wrong about Gen AI and NVIDIA being intimately linked, but that will make them sell regarding this news, so I must also sell and buy back at bottom\" That's most likely exactly what's going on. Markets aren't about intrinsic values, they're about predicting what everyone else is going to do. Couple that with the fact that credit is shackled to confidence, and so much of market valuations are based on available credit. One stiff breeze is all it takes to shake confidence, collapse credit, and spark a run on the market. reply bombcar 20 minutes agorootparentprevThere are so many investors in the market that it's hard to figure out what or why anything happens. But roughly, I suspect the main thing is \"enough people thought NVDA was the only supplier for AI chips, and now they realize there's at least one other\" that it slipped. reply UltraSane 52 minutes agorootparentprevI wonder if someday AI can do a better job at pricing things like goods and company shares. reply rhubarbtree 1 hour agorootparentprev> Theoretically, anything that lets someone do more with the same number of their chips should be bullish. If NVidia make money per compute capacity, and a new method requires less capacity, then all other things being equal NVidia will make less money. Now, you might say \"demand will make more use of the available resources\", but that really depends, and certainly there is a limit to demand for anything. reply Ekaros 2 minutes agorootparentI especially see limit in demand for number of models. Eventually you have good enough models, and then you need less training and thus less hardware. Also Nvidia's profit are based on the margins. If there is less demand, there is most likely less margins unless they limit supply. Thus their profit will go down either as they sell less or they profit less per unit sold. reply verghese 55 minutes agoparentprevI'm not sure if this will impact the market the same way the R1 did. However, my general impression is that while Meta spent $20B on their 100k H100s, DeepSeek is demonstrating that you can achieve better results far more cost-effectively using just 2k H100s. This doesn't seem like good news for Nvidia, but it sets a great precedent for companies looking to train models. reply jeremyjh 26 minutes agorootparentIt’s essentially as if the number of existing premium GPU chips were multiplied by 30x or 50x. Yes, when you 30x a supply of something, you are going to lower its price. The question is does this lowered price then increase the demand but that’s a lot more speculative than the supply impact, and could easily take much longer to be felt. reply ein0p 1 hour agoparentprevIt's complicated. On the one hand Nvidia is supply constrained, so anything that makes AI better and more efficient (and therefore more usable by the masses) is bullish for it. On the other, a significant chunk of research lower tier large GenAI orgs have been doing is now obsolete, so they might reduce their cloud spend until they gain their bearings and reset at a higher level using DeepSeek's models and insights. Furthermore, the gap between open source and top tier behemoths has shrunk considerably last week. For the first time you can run a practically usable reasoning LLM on your MacBook Pro with 64GB of RAM or more. In the mind of the normies (some of whom are investors) this puts future profitability of top tier research into question. This is a midwit take top labs have much more than they show, but that might not matter if investors get cold feet, with secondary effects on NVIDIA and those staggeringly large planned investments into AI. Still, NVIDIA is a monopolist for GPU compute. That is not going to change in the foreseeable future, and they will remain supply constrained in the foreseeable future, and therefore able to exercise considerable pricing power. So my bet is: short term pullback, long term bullish. In fact you could see the bullish case last night: Deepseek's free chat service got overloaded and crapped out due to lack of GPU capacity. That's bullish for NVIDIA. reply bloomingkales 43 minutes agoparentprev [–] Imagine if in the infancy of the NBA someone figures out how to dunk.

Technical background Two things to know before diving in: how npm packages are distributed, and about the Zopfli compressor. npm packages are just gzipped tarballs First thing to know: npm packages are distributed as tar archives compressed with gzip. In other words, they’re just .tar.gz or .tgz files. You can download these archives using npm pack $PACKAGE_NAME: npm pack express && ls # => express-4.21.2.tgz If you extract this tarball, you’ll see all of the package’s files, such as package.json. Zopfli, a gzip-compatible compressor The second thing to know about: Zopfli. Zopfli can create gzip-compatible data that’s smaller than other tools can. For example, compare the zopfli command to the gzip command: gzip 9 romeo_and_juliet.txt du h romeo_and_juliet.txt.gz # => 64K romeo_and_juliet.txt.gz zopfli romeo_and_juliet.txt du h romeo_and_juliet.txt.gz # => 60K romeo_and_juliet.txt.gz As you can see, zopfli produces smaller files than gzip. If Zopfli produces smaller sizes than gzip, why not use it everywhere? Unfortunately, Zopfli is great but it’s much slower than regular gzip. time gzip 9 romeo_and_juliet.txt # => real 0m0.016s time zopfli romeo_and_juliet.txt # => real 0m0.462s In this simple test, Zopfli is about 28 times slower! That means it’s bad for content that changes a lot, but good for content that doesn’t. In my opinion, Zopfli’s killer feature is that it creates files that are backwards compatible with existing decompressors. Other compression algorithms, like LZMA, can be better than gzip, but you can’t decompress their results with gunzip or equivalent. With Zopfli, you can! cat my_file.txt # => Hello world lzma c my_file.txtgunzip c # => gunzip: unknown compression format zopfli c my_file.txtgunzip c # => Hello world So I wondered: if npm packages are compressed with gzip, could npm packages be compressed better with Zopfli? The answer is “yes”. Proof of concept To see if this would work, I tried it on one of my own npm packages. I did something like this: Get the file that is published by default. I used HumanizeDuration.js, one of my more popular packages, as a test. cd HumanizeDuration.js npm pack # ... # => humanize-duration-3.32.1.tgz This created humanize-duration-3.32.1.tgz, which was ~17 kibibytes large. I could npm publish this right now, but let’s try shrinking it. Decompress (but don’t unarchive) the file. gunzip humanize-duration-3.32.1.tgz This leaves us with an uncompressed tarball, humanize-duration-3.32.1.tar. Re-compress it with Zopfli. zopfli humanize-duration-3.32.1.tar As expected, this produced a slightly smaller file by over a kilobyte. That’s promising! Make sure I could still install it. I installed the tarball, and tried to use it. cd \"$(mktemp d)\" npm install /path/to/recompressed/humanize-duration-3.32.1.tar.gz # => added 1 package in 123ms node p 'require(\"humanize-duration\")(1234)' # => 1.234 seconds It worked! This saved 1114 bytes for a ~6.2% reduction. And this is completely backwards-compatible. That made sense; this is what Zopfli is supposed to do! I also tried it on a few of my other packages. Everything seemed to work and offered a ~5% size reduction. Great! I published one of my modules this way, and nobody complained. I later did this for Helmet, my most popular module—again, without issue. This was, and still is, a minor success. This is a small optimization that saves about 2 gigabytes of bandwidth per year across all installations. I doubt many individual installs were perceptibly faster after this change…but it’s nice to do a tiny amount of work for a 5% improvement! Now that I’d proved it’d work for my modules, I wondered: could this be done on a wider scale? 2022-05-27: asking for feedback Given that this worked fine for my packages, could this be done for the entire npm registry? On May 27, I asked my Signal colleagues for feedback on an idea. Here’s what I asked (reformatted slightly): Here is something I would like feedback on: npm packages are just gzipped tarballs (try it yourself with npm pack $PACKAGE_NAME). Zopfli does a better job at gzipping files than gzip 9. Therefore, the npm registry and developers could save bandwidth if they compressed new (or re-compressed existing) packages with Zopfli. With React as an example: The latest version of React is 81,166 bytes, compressed with the equivalent of gzip 9 Re-compressing it with Zopfli saves 4019 bytes; about a 5% reduction React was downloaded ~562M times last year That would save ~2 TiB of bandwidth just for React To be clear, this is completely backwards compatible as far as I understand. I got two important pieces of feedback: Jordan Rose pointed out that decompression time could be significant. I hadn’t checked this! I ran some quick tests and found that this wasn’t an issue. Fedor Indutny pointed out that npm’s lockfile, package-lock.json, contains a checksum of the package file. The npm people couldn’t easily re-compress existing packages without breaking things. It would only work for newly-published files; new packages or new versions of existing ones. Armed with that feedback, I brought the idea to the npm folks. 2022-05-29: RFC time I learned that the npm CLI people have a formal proposal process where you write up a document and submit a patch. I spent a few days writing and editing my proposal, “Improving tarball compression while maintaining backwards compatibility”. It was 708 words. I tried to make it sound compelling with things like this: Even a small savings, like 5%, would reduce the registry’s bandwidth usage by multiple terabytes. For example: React was downloaded 561,743,096 times in 2021. If we assume that each of these downloads shrunk from 81,166 bytes to 77,147 bytes, the registry would have saved more than 2 terabytes in bandwidth for React alone. On May 29, I finally submitted my RFC. I was nervous! 2022-06-01: they discussed it A few days later, the npm CLI people had a meeting where they discussed a bunch of stuff, including my RFC. I wasn’t able to attend but watched the recording. Overall, they felt it was worth evaluating further but were cautious. From their notes: Overall sentiment is that the compression improvement is welcome but it looks like it would take a proof of concept and challenge some of the edge cases to see if there are any unintended consequences, etc I built a little proof of concept web app that used a WebAssembly port of Zopfli to recompress npm packages and posted about it on the RFC. I attended the next meeting a couple of weeks later. 2022-06-15: the meeting I attended a call on June 15. I did the bad thing where I wasn’t really listening until it was my turn because I was thinking about what I was going to say. When it was finally my turn, I stammered. Watching it back, I cringe a bit. I was wordy, unclear, and unconvincing. But I think I did an okay job making my point: npm packages could become ~5% smaller if we could figure out how to run Zopfli at publish time. You can watch my mumbling in the recording, as well as the npm maintainers’ feedback. “Who benefits from this?” was probably the biggest question. It was discussed that the npm registry folks, paying storage costs, might care about this. But “literally no one’s noticed” some other recent performance improvements, so they wanted to see more data. Was this just something I thought was neat (a “performance romantic”, as one person called it), or did this solve a real problem for users? There were also concerns about including WebAssembly, the performance implications at install time, and Zopfli licensing issues. I was tasked with some investigation on the topics above, and I got digging. 2022-07-31: giving up After a bunch of thinking and feedback, what once seemed like an obviously great idea now seemed…well, less great. On July 31, after doing a bunch of research, I posted a comment on the RFC. I wrote up some pros and cons. The pros: The top 250 npm packages would shrink by about 4.5% with this change. This compression would be backwards compatible, and would require no changes from anyone else. But the cons were substantial: Integrating Zopfli into the npm CLI would be difficult. Publishing would be slower—in some cases, much slower. This wouldn’t retroactively apply to existing packages. After this discussion and thinking about the tradeoffs, I felt that it was not worth it, and I closed my RFC. And that was that! Lessons learned I learned a lot during this process. It was a bit nerve-wracking, but I learned how to make proposals like this. I’d written internal proposals at work, but I’d never made a semi-official RFC like this before. I also think I did a pretty bad job in my verbal communication during the meeting. Perhaps it was because I was nervous. I could have done a better job communicating about the tradeoffs—good and bad—of the proposal. And I could have been less wordy! I also learned that things that seem like obvious wins aren’t always obvious wins, either because the motivation isn’t there or because there are trade-offs I minimized. Overall, even though my proposal was denied, I’m glad I did this. I think I’m a better engineer for it! I hope this story was interesting and useful to you, dear reader. (Oh, and I’m still compressing my own modules with Zopfli.)",

You'll find those arguments the pointless nitpicking of entrenched interests who just don't want to make any changes, until you experience your very own \"oh man, I really thought this change was perfectly safe and now my entire customer base is trashed\" moment, and then suddenly things like \"hey, we need to consider how this affects old signatures and the speed of decompression and just generally whether this is worth the non-zero risks for what are in the end not really that substantial benefits\". I do not say this as the wise Zen guru sitting cross-legged and meditating from a position of being above it all; I say it looking at my own battle scars from the Perfectly Safe things I've pushed out to my customer base, only to discover some tiny little nit caused me trouble.

Attaining the proper balance between moving forward even though it incurs risk and just not changing things that are working is the hardest part of being a software maintainer, because both extremes are definitely bad.

The more bandwidth that Cloudflare needs, the more leverage they have at the peering table.

I don't think deploying a new version of a package is something that happens many times a day, so it wouldn't be a constant pain point.

Compressing React 20x slower once is one thing, but 50 million decompressions being even 1% slower is likely net more energy intensive, even accounting for the saved energy transmitting 4-5% fewer bits on the wire. reply web007 3 hours agoparentIt's very likely zero or positive impact on the decompression side of things. Starting with smaller data means everything ends up smaller. It's the same decompression algorithm in all cases, so it's not some special / unoptimized branch of code. It's yielding the same data in the end, so writes equal out plus or minus disk queue fullness and power cycles. It's _maybe_ better for RAM and CPU because more data fits in cache, so less memory is used and the compute is idle less often. It's relatively easy to test decompression efficiency if you think CPU time is a good proxy for energy usage: go find something like React and test the decomp time of gzip 9 vs zopfli. Or even better, find something similar but much bigger so you can see the delta and it's not lost in rounding errors. reply sltkr 3 hours agoparentprevFor formats like deflate, decompression time doesn't generally depend on compressed size. (zstd is similar, though memory use can depend on the compression level used). This means an optimization like this is virtually guaranteed to be a net positive on the receiving end, since you always save a bit of time/energy when downloading a smaller compressed file. reply woadwarrior01 2 hours agoprevFrom the RFC on github[1]. > Zopfli is written in C, which presents challenges. Unless it was added to Node core, the CLI would need to (1) rewrite Zopfli in JS, possibly impacting performance (2) rely on a native module, impacting reliability (3) rely on a WebAssembly module.

Changes to hardware/OS can require a recompile or even fixes. NPM build system already requires a JavaScript runtime, so is already handled as part of existing maintenance. The point is that Zopfli either needs to be rewritten for a platform-agnostic abstraction they already support, or else Zopfli will be added to a list of native modules to maintain. reply woadwarrior01 20 minutes agorootparent> It's not about C per-se, as much as each native compiled dependency creates additional maintenance concerns. Changes to hardware/OS can require a recompile or even fixes. This is a canard. zopfli is written in portable C and is far more portable than the nodejs runtime. On any hardware/OS combo that one can build the nodejs runtime, they certainly can also build and run zopfli. reply adgjlsfhk1 4 hours agoprevThis seems like a place where the more ambitious version that switches to ZSTD might have better tradeoffs. You would get similar or better compression, with faster decompression and recompression than zstd.It would lose backward compatibility though... reply vlovich123 1 hour agoparentNot necessarily could retain backward compat by publishing both gzip and zstd variants and having downloaders with newer npm’s prefer to download zstd. Over time, you could require packages only upload zstd going forward and either generate zstd versions of the backlog of unmaintained packages or at least those that see some amount of traffic over some time period if you’re willing to drop very old packages. The ability to install arbitrary versions of packages probably means you’re probably better off reprocessing the backlog although that may cost more than doing nothing. The package lock checksum is probably a more solvable issue with some coordination. The benefit of doing this though is less immediate it will take a few years to show payoff and these kinds of payoffs are not typically made by the kind of committee decisions process described (for better or worse). reply bufferoverflow 3 hours agoparentprevBrotli and lzo1b have good compression ratios and pretty fast decompression speeds.

Back then if you wanted to use a particular neural network it was meant for a certain version of Tensorflow which expected you to have a certain version of the CUDA libs. If you had to work with multiple models the \"normal\" way to do things was use the developer unfriendly [1][2] installers from NVIDIA to install a single version of the libs at a time. Turned out you could have many versions of CUDA installed as long as you kept them in different directories and set the library path accordingly, it made sense to pack them up for conda and install them together with everything else. But oh boy was it slow to unpack those bzip2 packages! Since conda had good caching, if you build environments often at all you could be paying more in decompress time than you pay in compression time. If you were building a new system today you'd probably use zstd since it beats gzip on both speed and compression. [1] click... click... click... [2] like they're really going to do something useful with my email address reply stabbles 5 hours agoprevOne thing that's excellent about zopfli (apart from being gzip compatible) is how easy it is to bootstrap: git clone https://github.com/google/zopfli.git cc O2 zopfli/src/zopfli/*.c lm It just requires a C compiler and linker. reply stabbles 5 hours agoparentThe main downside though, it's impressively slow. Comparing to gzip isn't really worth it. Combine pigz (threaded) with zlib-ng (simd) and you get decent performance. pigz is used in `docker push`. For example, gzipping llvm.tar (624MB) takes less than a second for me: $ time /home/harmen/spack/opt/spack/linux-ubuntu24.04-zen2/gcc-13.2.0/pigz-2.8-5ptdjrmudifhjvhb757ym2bzvgtcsoqc/bin/pigz k hello.tar real 0m0.779s user 0m11.126s sys 0m0.460s At the same time, zopfli compiled with O3 march=native takes 35 minutes. No wonder it's not popular. It is almost 2700x slower than the state of the art for just 6.8% bytes saved. reply Levitating 4 hours agorootparent> 2700x slower That is impressively slow. In my opinion even the 28x decrease in performance mentioned would be a no-go. Sure the package saves a few bytes but I don't need my entire pc to grind to a halt every time I publish a package. Besides, storage is cheap but CPU power draw is not. Imagine the additional CO2 that would have to be produced if this RFC was merged. > 2 gigabytes of bandwidth per year across all installations This must be a really rough estimate and I am curious how it was calculated. In any case 2 gigabytes over a year is absolutely nothing. Just my home network can produce a terabyte a day. reply bonzini 4 hours agorootparent2 GB for the author's package which is neither extremely common nor large; it would be 2 TB/year just for react core. reply Levitating 4 hours agorootparentI am confused, how is this number calculated? Because the authors mentioned package, Helmet[1], is 103KB uncompressed and has had 132 versions in 13 years. Meaning downloading every Helmet version uncompressed would result in 132*103KB = 13.7MB. I feel like I must be missing something really obvious. Edit: Oh it's 2GB/year across all installations.

Sometimes trying to ship something at that sorta scale turns out to just not really make sense in a way that is hard to see at the beginning. Another personal win is that you got a very thorough understanding of the people involved and how the outreach parts of the RFC process works. I've also had a few fail, but I've also had a few pass! Always easier to do the next time reply jsheard 5 hours agoprevI wonder if it would make more sense to pursue Brotli at this point, Node has had it built-in since 10.x so it should be pretty ubiquitous by now.

But I was already deep into doing people giant favors that they didn’t even notice, so I was juggling many other goals.

They pay at most pennies for 100% savings (that is somehow all the functionality in zero bytes not worth anything to those paying the bills) reply tyre 4 hours agorootparentSize savings translates to latency improvements which directly affects conversion rates. Smaller size isn’t about reducing costs but increased revenue. People care. reply soared 4 hours agorootparentAgreed often a CTO of an ecom site is very very focused on site speed and has it as their #1 priority since it directly increases revenue. reply fwip 3 hours agorootparentprevNote that this proof-of-concept implementation saves latency on first load, but may add latency at surprising points while using the website. Any user invoking a rarely-used function would see a delay before the javascript executes, without the traditional UI affordances (spinners etc) to indicate that the application was waiting on the network. Further, these secretly-slow paths may change from visit to visit. Many users know how to \"wait for the app to be ready,\" but the traditional expectation is that once it's loaded, the page/app will work, and any further delays will be signposted. I'm sure it works great when you've got high-speed internet, but might break things unacceptably for users on mobile or satellite connections. reply vlovich123 1 hour agorootparent> without the traditional UI affordances (spinners etc) to indicate that the application was waiting on the network. This part is obviously trivially solvable. I think the same basic idea is going to at some point make it but it’ll have to be through explicit annotations first and then there will be tooling to automatically do this for your code based upon historical visits where you get to tune the % of visitors that get additional fetches. Also, you could probably fetch the split off script in the background anyway as a prefetch + download everything rather than just 1 function at a time (or even downloading related groups of functions together) The idea has lots of merit and you just have to execute it right. reply KTibow 3 hours agoparentprevI think this is called tree shaking and Vite/Rollup do this by default these days. Of course, it's easy when you explicitly say what you're importing. reply avodonosov 2 hours agorootparentThat's not tree-shaking. reply nikeee 4 hours agoprevI don't see why it wouldn't be possible to hide behind a flag once Node.js supports zopfli natively. In case of CI/CD, it's totally feasible to just add a strong-compression flag. In that case, the user expects it to take its time. TS releases a non-preview version every few months, so using 2.5 minutes for compression would work. reply bhouston 3 hours agoprevWhat about a different approach an optional npm proxy that recompresses popular packages with 7z/etc in the background? Could verify package integrity by hashing contents rather than archives, plus digital signatures for recompressed versions. Only kicks in for frequently downloaded packages once compression is ready. Benefits: No npm changes needed, opt-in only, potential for big bandwidth savings on popular packages. Main tradeoff is additional verification steps, but they could be optional given a digital signature approach. Curious if others see major security holes in this approach? reply ndriscoll 1 hour agoparentThis felt like the obvious way to do things to me: hash a .tar file, not a .tar.gz file. Use Accept-Encoding to negotiate the compression scheme for transfers. CDN can compress on the fly or optionally cache precompressed files. i.e. just use standard off-the-shelf HTTP features. These days I prefer uncompressed .tar files anyway because ZFS has transparent zstd, so decompressed archive files are generally smaller than a .gz. reply glenjamin 4 hours agoprevThis strikes me as something that could be done for the highest traffic packages at the backend, rather than be driven by the client at pubish-time. reply fastest963 4 hours agoparentThe article talks about this. There are hashes that are generated for the tarball so the backend can't recompress anything. reply gweinberg 1 hour agoprevI was under the impression that bzip compresses more than gzip, but gzip is much faster, so gzip is better for things that need to be compressed on the fly, and bzip is better fro things that get archived. Is this not true? Wouldn't it have been better to use bzip all along for this purpose? reply loeg 50 minutes agoprevIt probably makes more sense to save more bytes and compressor time and just switch to zstd (a bigger scoped effort, sure). reply imoverclocked 13 minutes agoprev> But the cons were substantial: ... > This wouldn’t retroactively apply to existing packages. Why is this substantial? My understanding is that packages shouldn't be touched once published. It seems likely for any change to not apply retroactively. reply snizovtsev 2 hours agoprevYes, but it was expected. It's like prioritising code readability over performance everywhere but the hot path. Earlier in my career, I managed to use Zopfli once to compress gigabytes of PNG assets into a fast in-memory database supporting a 50K+ RPS web page. We wanted to keep it simple and avoid the complexity of horizontal scaling, and it was OK to drop some rarely used images. So the more images we could pack into a single server, the more coverage we had. In that sense Zopfli was beneficial. reply jefozabuss 3 hours agoprevI wonder what is the tarball size difference on average if you'd for example download everything in one tarball (full package list) instead of 1-by-1 as the gzip compression would work way better in that case. Also for bigger companies this is not really a \"big\" problem as they usually have in-house proxies (as you cannot rely on a 3rd party repository in CI/CD for multiple reasons (security, audit, speed, etc)). reply nopurpose 2 hours agoprevIt reminds me of an effort to improve docker image format and make it move away from being just a tar file. I can't find links anymore, but it was a pretty clever design, which still couldn't beat dumb tar in efficiency. reply kittikitti 3 hours agoprevThank you so much for posting this. The original logic was clear and it had me excited! I believe this is useful because compression is very common and although it might not fit perfectly in this scenario, it could very well be a breakthrough in another. If I come across a framework that could also benefit from this compression algorithm, I'll be sure to give you credit. reply choobacker 4 hours agoprevNice write up! > When it was finally my turn, I stammered. > Watching it back, I cringe a bit.

Good job for trying to push the boundaries. reply bangaladore 58 minutes agoprevI think the main TLDR here [1]: > For example, I tried recompressing the latest version of the typescript package. GNU tar was able to completely compress the archive in about 1.2 seconds on my machine. Zopfli, with just 1 iteration, took 2.5 minutes. [1] https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/595#issuecomment-1200480148 My question of course would be, what about LZ4, or Zstd or Brotli? Or is backwards compatibility strictly necessary? I understand that GZIP is still a good compressor, so those others may not produce meaningful gains. But, as the author suggests, even small gains can produce huge results in bandwidth reduction. reply pornel 5 hours agoprevIt only doesn't apply to existing versions of existing packages. Newer releases would apply Zopfli, so over time likely the majority of actively used/maintained packages would be recompressed. reply 1337shadow 2 hours agoprevOk but why doesn't npm registry actually recompress the archives? It can even apply that retroactively, wouldn't require zopli in npm CLI reply aseipp 2 hours agoparentHashes of the tarballs are recorded in the package-lock.json of downstream dependants, so recompressing the files in place will cause the hashes to change and break everyone. It has to be done at upload time. reply notpushkin 1 hour agorootparentBut it still can be done on the npm side, right? reply chuckadams 3 hours agoprevSwitching to a shared cache in the fashion of pnpm would eliminate far more redundant downloads than a compression algorithm needing 20x more CPU. reply liontwist 3 hours agoprevWhy would a more complex zip slow down decompress?

Do you think something like this would fare better or differently for some reason? reply tonymet 2 hours agoprevI’m more concerned about the 40gb of node_modules.

You pay the 10-100x slowdown once on the compressing side, to save 4-5% on every download which for a popular package one would expect downloads to be in the millions. reply philipwhiuk 3 hours agorootparentThe downloads are cached. The build happens on every publish for every CI build. reply bonzini 4 hours agoparentprevAssuming download and decompression cost to be proportional to the size of the incoming compressed stream, it would break even at 2000 downloads. A big assumption I know, but 2000 is a really small number. reply liontwist 3 hours agoparentprevIt absolutely is. Packages are zipped once and downloaded thousands of times. reply inglor_cz 4 hours agoparentprevAs the author himself said, just React was downloaded half a billion times; that is a lot of saved bandwidth on both sides, but especially so for the server. Maybe it would make sense to only apply this improvement in images that are a) either very big or b) get downloaded at least million times each year or so. That would cover most of the savings while leaving most packages and developers out of it. reply liontwist 3 hours agoprevThe fact that you are pursuing this is admirable. But this whole thing sounds too much like work. Finding opportunities, convincing entrenched stakeholders, accommodating irrelevant feedback, pitching in meetings — this is the kind of thing that top engineers get paid a lot of money to do. For me personally open source is the time to be creative and free. So my tolerance for anything more than review is very low. And I would have quit at the first roadblock. What’s a little sad, is NPM should not be operating like a company with 1000+ employees. The “persuade us users want this” approach is only going to stop volunteers. They should be proactively identifying efforts like this and helping you bring it across the finish line. reply efitz 2 hours agoparentI think that the reason NPM responded this way is because it was a premature optimization. If/when NPM has a problem storage costs are too high, or transfer costs are too high, or user feedback indicates that users are unhappy with transfer sizes then they will be ready to listen to this kind of proposal. I think their response was completely rational, especially given a potentially huge impact on compute costs and/or publication latency. reply maccard 2 hours agorootparentI disagree with it being a premature optimisation. Treating everything that you haven’t already identified personally as a problem as a premature optimisation is cargo cutting in its own way. The attitude of not caring is why npm and various tools are so slow. That said, I think NPM’s response was totally correct explain the problem and the tradeoffs. And OP decided the tradeoffs weren’t worth it, which is totally fair. reply Cthulhu_ 2 hours agoparentprevWhile NPM is open source, it's in the awkward spot of also having... probably hundreds of thousands if not millions of professional applications depend on it; it should be run like a business, because millions depend on it. ...which makes it all the weirder that security isn't any better, as in, publishing a package can be done without a review step on the npm side, for example.

The “persuade us users want this” approach is only going to stop volunteers. They should be proactively identifying efforts like this and helping you bring it across the finish line. Says who? Says an engineer? Says a product person? NPM is a company with 14 employees; with a system integrated into countless extremely niche and weird integrations they cannot control. Many of those integrations might make a professional engineer's hair catch fire \"it should never be done this way!\" but the real world is that the wrong way is the majority of the time. There's no guarantee that many of the downloads come from the official client, just as one example. The last thing they need, or I want, or any of their customers want, or their 14 employees need, is something that might break backwards compatibility in an extremely niche case, anger a major customer, cause countless support tickets, all for a tiny optimization nobody cares about. This is something I've learned here about HN that, for own mental health, I now dismiss: Engineers are obsessed with 2% optimizations here, 5% optimizations there; unchecked, it will literally turn into an OCD outlet, all for things nobody in the non-tech world even notices, let alone asks about.

Hell. Even 15 employees larping as a corporation is going to be inefficient. what you and NPM are telling us, is that they are happy to take free labor, but this is not an open source project. > Engineers are obsessed with 2% optimizations here Actually in large products these are incredible finds.

Every successful \"large\" open source project has outgrown the volunteer community. > Actually in large products these are incredible finds.

But in this story nothing like that happened. reply gjsman-1000 2 hours agorootparentBut NPM has no proof their dashboard won't light up full of corporate customers panicking the moment it goes to production; because their hardcoded integration to have AWS download packages and decompress them with a Lambda and send them to an S3 bucket can no longer decompress fast enough while completing other build steps to avoid mandatory timeouts; just as one stupid example of something that could go wrong. IT is also demanding now that NPM fix it rather than modify the build pipeline which would take weeks to validate, so corporate's begging NPM to fix it by Tuesday's marketing blitz. Just because it's safe in a lab provides no guarantee it's safe in production. reply maccard 2 hours agorootparentThat’s an argument against making any change to the packaging system ever. “It might break something somewhere” isn’t an argument, it’s a paralysis against change.

Are they not interested in improving bandwidth and speed for their users? The conclusion of this line of reasoning is to never make any change.

It’s not an issue. reply maccard 2 hours agorootparentprev> Engineers are obsessed with 2% optimizations here, 5% optimizations there; unchecked, it will literally turn into an OCD outlet, all for things nobody in the non-tech world even notices, let alone asks about. Just let it go. I absolutely disagree with you. If the world took more of those 5% optimisations here and there everything would be faster. I think more people should look at those 5% optimisations. In many cases they unlock knowledge that results in a 20% speed up later down the line. An example from my past I was tasked with reducing the running speed of a one shot tool we were using at $JOB. It was taking about 15 minutes to run. I shaved off seconds here and there with some fine grained optimisations, and tens of seconds with some modernisation of some core libraries. Nothing earth shattering but improvements none the less. One day, I noticed a pattern was repeating and I was fixing an issue for the third time in a different place (searching a gigantic array of stuff for a specific entry). I took a step back and realised that if I replaced the mega list with a hash table it might fix every instance of this issue in our app. It was a massive change, touching pretty much every file. And all of a sudden our 15 minute runtime was under 30 seconds. People used this tool every day, it was developed by a team of engineers wildly smarter than me. But it had grown and nobody really understood the impact of the growth. When it started that array was 30, 50 entries. On our project it was 300,000 and growing every day. Not paying attention to these things causes decay and rot. Not every change should be taken, but more people should care. reply lyu07282 2 hours agorootparentprev> Says who? > Says an engineer?

    "originBody": "A former tech CEO is on a crusade to get the record of his arrest removed from the internet Maury Blackman is suing a journalist who publicized his domestic violence arrest for $25 million By Joel Rosenblatt 12:24 PM PST on January 23, 2025 Share on Email It’s been almost three years since a San Francisco judge sealed the record of tech executive Maury Blackman’s 2021 arrest for domestic violence. But the allegations still show up in his Google search results, thanks to an independent journalist — one who Blackman is now suing for $25 million. On Dec. 22, 2021, Blackman, a self-described venture capitalist and former chief executive officer at intelligence contractor Premise Data, was arrested by San Francisco police after an altercation with his girlfriend in their apartment in the Mission Bay neighborhood. First disclosed by journalist Jack Poulson, the incident report is written by one of two police officers who responded to a 911 call from a woman who reported hearing a “heated argument,” and possibly the sounds of “furniture thrown into the walls” at an apartment building just blocks from Oracle Park. At the building, an officer listened to a recording the caller said she made with her phone placed against the apartment door, in which the officer heard a female voice saying “stop, please stop,” according to the report. Blackman answered the apartment door, shirtless and sweaty. Inside, an officer spoke with a woman who the report describes as Blackman’s girlfriend. She had cuts to her left cheek, and possibly a swollen left eye; she was at times crying uncontrollably, but also told police, “he just started beating me.” Police removed bloody pillowcases from the apartment’s bedroom as evidence, according to the report. “It should be noted that throughout the course of my investigation,” the reporting officer wrote, that the woman became “very uncooperative,” recanted her initial statement, and said that “she did not want Blackman to go to jail.” In February 2022, less than two months after he was booked at San Francisco county jail, Judge Carolyn Gold agreed to seal the arrest report, and to check a box saying the arrest was “deemed not to have occurred.” Because the records of the case are sealed, it remains unclear what crime Blackman was charged with. In a 2024 declaration to the court, he wrote that he had been arrested for, but not charged with, felony domestic violence, and that the charges he did face were ultimately dismissed. An unsolicited message For almost two years, Blackman’s arrest remained a secret. And it likely would’ve remained that way, had the report not reached Poulson. The publisher of the All-Source Intelligence newsletter on Substack, Poulson had covered a lawsuit that Premise Data filed against alleged whistleblower employees while Blackman was CEO. He received a copy of Blackman’s police report in an unsolicited message on Signal, an encrypted platform popular with journalists, in September 2023, his lawyers said in a court filing. Poulson called the San Francisco Police Department, which authenticated the arrest report, without mentioning that it had been sealed. Satisfied it was real, and that it was in the public interest to publicize the allegations, Poulson posted a copy of the report to his Substack on Sept. 14, 2023. The aim of his story, Poulson told Gazetteer SF, was “transparency” concerning Premise Data’s CEO. In December that year, Blackman resigned from Premise. Then, in October 2024 — over a year after Poulson published details from the arrest report — Blackman sued him for $25 million, arguing the journalist’s story cost him his job as CEO, and that Poulson is liable for more than a dozen claims, including defamation. The complaint also names Substack and its web host, Amazon Web Services, as defendants. A reputation ‘forever altered’ The lawsuit leans heavily on a California law that makes it illegal to publish an arrest report after it has been sealed by a court. The law has been attacked by First Amendment advocates, who say it violates free speech protections, strengthened in this instance because the information is an issue of public interest — an argument Blackman contests. In his court declaration, Blackman diminishes his own profile to argue he’s not a public figure. The police report’s illegal publication is a “gratuitous and prurient intrusion into my private life,” he says, causing irreparable, financial harm and “stigmatization.” Poulson’s stories created the “intentionally misleading understanding” that Blackman was guilty of the events described in the sealed police report, which the former CEO says has “forever altered” his reputation among friends, family, and business associates, according to the filings. “While my arrest was not itself newsworthy, people and entities interested in hiring me will become aware of it by conducting a basic Google search of my name,” he said in the filings. Yet, the harder Blackman fights, the brighter the light seems to shine on his arrest, attracting a widening circle of media and lawyerly attention. His lawsuit prompted the First Amendment Coalition to sue both the city of San Francisco and California’s attorney general in federal court, to stop enforcement of the law that blocks journalists from publishing sealed arrest reports. ‘How much you want for removing?’ In October 2023, a month after Poulson published the police report, the journalist received an email from someone with a Gmail address for Christian Ericssen. “My name is Christian Ericsen,” the message reads, the sender apparently misspelling his own last name. “I’m bothering you to request the cancellation of the post.” The message concludes with links to Poulson’s story about Blackman on Substack, and the police report, which Poulson had posted to the website for Tech Inquiry, a nonprofit he runs that helps reporters cover the surveillance and weapons industries. The email from Ericssen goes on to insist, in convoluted English, that Poulson should remove the story because “any type of prosecution or conviction was dismissed.” When Poulson asked him about his ties to the case, Ericssen said he was writing on behalf of Blackman, in a “non-formal representation” based on “online cooperation.” The sender declined Poulson’s invitation to call him, explaining that he didn’t live in the U.S. Christian Ericssen, or Ericsen, appears to be a pseudonym. The email address has been used several times to demand that websites tracking crypto-related scams remove unflattering information about specific people and companies. Poulson stopped responding to the messages after Ericssen refused to talk on the phone or otherwise verify his identity. But Ericssen continued to send emails over the next six days. His final message asked, “How much you want for removing?” “Never, under any circumstances, would I entertain a bribe,” Poulson told Gazetteer. When reached by email, Blackman declined to respond to detailed questions, including about the emails from Ericssen. His lawyer, David Marek, didn’t respond to emails or voicemails seeking comment. The takedown requests On Sept. 16, 2024 — a year after publishing the police report — Poulson received a letter from Marek, demanding a takedown of the story. “By publishing this report on your Substack platform and on the Tech Inquiry website, you have violated multiple legal protections, resulting in significant harm to my client’s reputation and causing emotional distress,” Marek wrote, on behalf of Blackman. “Your actions in disseminating this sealed report and information related to the sealed report are unlawful and require immediate remedy.” The lawyer gave Poulson 24 hours to remove the report from Substack and Tech Inquiry, or face a $25 million lawsuit. Poulson said he felt “bullied” by the letter, but refused to comply with its demands. Two weeks later, he received another letter, this time from San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu. Citing the same California law that Blackman’s suit leans on, Chiu demanded Poulson take down the police report, and “refrain from publishing this material in the future.” That same day, Blackman made good on his threat, filing his complaint against Poulson, Substack, and Amazon in San Francisco Superior Court. ‘Swimming naked’ Initially, for Poulson, the lawsuit set off a scramble for legal representation. He told Gazetteer that he quickly faced tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees, and struggled to find assistance from free speech groups like the American Civil Liberties Union. “I guess for the most part you're just swimming naked as an independent journalist is kind of the reality, unless you know there’s sufficiently positive press attention on your case, and it's a sufficiently clear David and Goliath case,” Poulson said. “But I don't really know how much more David and Goliath you can get.” Eventually, the Electronic Frontier Foundation agreed to defend him, covering all of his legal costs. David Greene, Poulson’s lawyer at the EFF, said the case bears the hallmarks of someone being targeted for exercising their constitutionally protected free speech, and resembles numerous Supreme Court cases that have upheld those protections. “To me, that’s classically within the very strong First Amendment protections, so I think it’s a very strong case,” Greene said. “It’s very well-established under U.S. law that journalists, or really anybody, who receives information from a source, and that information pertains to a matter of public interest, that they have a very strong First Amendment right to publish that information.” Substack and Amazon, both named as co-defendants in Blackman’s lawsuit, are aligned with Poulson. In a legal filing, Substack described Blackman’s argument that any statement that his arrest happened is, “by operation of law, not truthful” due to the sealing order, as “Kafkaesque.” He was arrested on suspicion of felony domestic abuse in 2021, “and the sealing order does not render it false,” Substack said. Substack’s response goes further, arguing Poulson’s stories were “equally related to the public’s interest in journalism about the status of women in the technology sector generally, and efforts to improve accountability for men who engage in abusive behavior toward women.” Amazon, in its court filing, called Blackman’s arguments about his arrest “spurious.” Blackman is now at a critical juncture in his campaign. Next month, a San Francisco judge will hear Poulson’s argument that the case should be thrown out under a law that protects journalists from so-called nuisance suits, which aim to restrict legally-protected free speech. Poulson says Blackman has made it “overwhelmingly clear” he is bothered by his Google results, but “he does not contest the facts” in the journalist’s reporting. “Basically he’s trying to clean up his Google search history through this lawsuit,” he told Gazetteer. City Attorney becomes a defendant In a classic example of the Streisand Effect, Blackman’s lawsuit has caused media interest in the fight to snowball, with stories in the San Francisco Chronicle, Daily Mail, and Courthouse News Service. It has also generated intense interest among First Amendment advocates, spawning another lawsuit in federal court over the California law forbidding the dissemination of sealed arrest records. In November, the First Amendment Coalition and a constitutional scholar at UCLA’s School of Law sued the San Francisco City Attorney and California Attorney General, arguing that the state law violates the First Amendment. “If members of the press or public happen to learn about an arrest such as the one at issue in this case, that’s a matter of public concern that the press and public have a right to report, and the people have a right to read about,” David Loy, a lawyer at the First Amendment Coalition, told Gazetteer. In what legal experts agree is an unusual move, the Attorney General and San Francisco City Attorney agreed last month to a court order blocking officials from enforcing the law until the litigation is resolved. “I take it as an encouraging sign that our position is correct, and that they saw the writing on the wall, and chose not to fight over it,” Loy said of the agreement. Asked if Blackman was behind the city attorney’s letter to Poulson, Jen Kwart, a spokeswoman for City Attorney Chiu, confirmed in an email that the office had learned about Poulson’s Substack post from Blackman. Chiu’s letter was “meant to inform and educate Substack about the court order, and ask that the information be removed from their website,” Kwart said. Poulson described the fight as “an immense time sink.” He said that, early on, a lawyer he consulted told him to give up, because “usually the rich people just win.” “Obviously, I have not,” Poulson said. But Blackman’s suit shows that wealth is a powerful tool against free speech, he said, even if the argument is “legally ridiculous.” Email this article Share on Email Joel Rosenblatt Joel covers the forces in San Francisco — money, business, personalities, local law and politics — that bind the city and pull it apart.

It's a massive and dangerous weapon in the hands of law enforcement (and others) that they can permanently damage someone's reputation—harming their future job prospects and social connections forever—without ever having to prove anything. This isn't a problem that's going to be solved by lawsuits, though, partially because Streisand and partially because in most of the cases where someone's hurt by this the newspapers have no legal obligation to refrain from publishing, so there's no grounds to sue. What we need is to reevaluate the law in light of \"the internet never forgets\". reply _heimdall 21 hours agoparent> It's a massive and dangerous weapon in the hands of law enforcement (and others) that they can permanently damage someone's reputation I'd love to see people take the real lesson here an arrest proves nothing of guilt, and it's surprisingly easy for cops to falsely arrest someone (whether they intended to or not). Our legal system is flawed enough as it is. When there are real concerns that can be raised over some cases that make it all the way to conviction we should be treating arrest records about as seriously a a politician promising the moon in a stump speech. reply lolinder 21 hours agorootparentThis is a really great idea in theory. Do you have a proposal for how to get there without stepping over tens of thousands of broken lives? How do you go about educating an entire population that's accustomed to thinking that arrest=guilt that this isn't true, especially when their news sources continue to report as though the arrest is the only really interesting part of the criminal justice system? reply dghlsakjg 21 hours agorootparentI don't know how it would mesh with the US constitution, but Canada, while still having freedom of expression, has much stronger rules about police and courts releasing names. Judges will happily kick all reporters out of a courtroom if personal details are leaked in the press. They will castigate police and prosecutors if they release too much information that could taint the jury pool, etc. There is no legal need for jails and police to release all of the details and photos that they do. A simple notice that a person is in police custody fulfills the argument against hidden arrests, while also not providing enough to damage a reputation. Announcing arrest reasons before charges have even been laid is unconscionable in a world where googling a name is this easy. reply JumpCrisscross 21 hours agorootparentprev> Do you have a proposal for how to get there without stepping over tens of thousands of broken lives? An innocent unless proven guilty law. Employers, et cetera, may not conclude adversely from criminal charges absent a guilty plea or conviction. reply _heimdall 20 hours agorootparentThat's such a huge gray area though. One doesn't know why an employer or anyone else decides to fire, or not hire, someone unless the employer documents the reason. We already have discrimination laws on the books in the US that can't reliably be enforced for this exact reason. I have heard multiple accounts of very clear discrimination taking place in org hiring practices, but they are never documented and when discussed everyone is very careful with their words. reply JumpCrisscross 20 hours agorootparent> One doesn't know why an employer or anyone else decides to fire, or not hire, someone unless the employer documents the reason It won't be entirely effective. But it gives companies plausible deniability. I've been the one who voiced up because a sealed marital-dispute arrest came up in an archival background check. Having such a law would have meant doing so was unremarkable, a routine comment. reply RHSeeger 21 hours agorootparentprevBut are they allowed to not hire someone if doing so would draw public outrage (and financial harm) against the company? What about if the person was arrested for something that would cause that, but never actually charged? In the US at least, being arrested (or even accused) of certain things can end your career. Because, even it it's proven you didn't do it, no company will touch you with a 10 foot pole, because people (who don't care/know that you were innocent) will avoid the company if they hire you. There is no known solution to this problem. reply giantg2 21 hours agorootparent\"But are they allowed to not hire someone if doing so would draw public outrage (and financial harm) against the company?\" Could you face the same because of gay/trans/etc hiring? That's the point of anti-discrimination laws that nobody is allowed to discriminate and thus the public outrage is diluted if all are hiring the \"undesireables\". reply JumpCrisscross 21 hours agorootparentprev> are they allowed to not hire someone if doing so would draw public outrage (and financial harm) against the company? Yes, that's the point of such a law. The company gets to deflect blame to it. reply _heimdall 19 hours agorootparentprev\"Allowed to\" pulls a lot of weight here, do you mean legally, socially, or something else? I do agree though, there's no good solution to the problem. That's one of the biggest indicators for me that state regulation, at least enforceable regulation, isn't the right answer. Companies, employees, industry organizations, etc can all come up with their own solutions that they're happy with though. A primary feature of federalism is allowing smaller groups to try different solutions, its pretty good at more quickly finding a solution that may actually work well enough universally reply foogazi 13 hours agorootparentprev> may not conclude Are you going to erase their memories Men-In-Black style ? reply giantg2 21 hours agorootparentprevIf you're constitutionally innocent until proven guilty, then you could create anti-discrimination protection laws that make it illegal to discriminate based on arrests without convictions. reply lolinder 20 hours agorootparentIt's already illegal to discriminate against a lot of things that people still choose to keep secret rather than rely on the law to protect them. Many people hide their diagnosed disabilities rather than trust that their employer will follow the law, because your advancement actually can be limited by exposing it even if it's technically illegal. Anti-discrimination laws also fail to protect people from the social consequences of the unwarranted publicity. reply giantg2 19 hours agorootparentThese aren't the situations we're discussing. The arrest is found through a background check, not disclosure. This is about companies avoiding public backlash for hiring someone with an arrest. reply 1659447091 18 hours agorootparentDon't most companies have a code of conduct or reputation brand protection policies? Anything that could cause \"public backlash\" would violate company policy. Not sure how it works for hiring, but it seems to hold up for firing. A company should have a right to protect their brand, within anti-discrimination bounds. Being arrested and having an arrest record, wrongly or not, is not the same as intrinsic human properties, such as being--for example--black and/or female etc. reply giantg2 17 hours agorootparentSo how would that work for types of people who maybe are arrested without being charged as a result of a protected attribute? You mentioned black people, so is it OK that they are disproportionately squeezed out of jobs this way? According to the constitution, innocence is an intrinsic human property. reply 1659447091 17 hours agorootparent> so is it OK that they are disproportionately squeezed out of jobs this way? I didn't say it was right, but I do believe that looking at it from the perspective of the burden being placed on a company is looking in the wrong direction. The names should not even be released unless convicted or settled--or at earliest at pre-trial (since more evidence can come forward if it's there). Those without charges should not have their name in the public, and that's where the focus should be. > how would that work for types of people who maybe are arrested without being charged as a result of a protected attribute? As I said, I am unsure how it works for hiring, but for firing it could be a violation of company policy and that's what the firing is for, not a protected attribute. reply _heimdall 16 hours agorootparentEven you working through this makes clear how it is to draw this line though. One extreme is only making names public after a conviction. That line is at least clear, though it does have downsides. Another extreme is making names public as soon as a person has ant interaction with police, similarly that is at least a clear line but has obvious issues. Lines like this can't be drawn easily. When in doubt inaction from the government should be the default. In this case that would mean the government not publicizing names at all, just process a case and move on. reply _heimdall 16 hours agorootparentprevBut why should the public backlash over a company hiring someone with an arrest? The public has direct interest in the company. More importantly, an arrest record alone means very little and if the person wasn't convicted they are supposed to be presumed innocent. reply lolinder 18 hours agorootparentprevUh, no, I'm talking about companies finding arrest records on a cursory Google search and avoiding that candidate in favor of other options, not because they don't want the backlash but because why would they hire them when there are other options? reply giantg2 17 hours agorootparentIf they aren't worried about some backlash for hiring a person arrested for domestic violence, then why would they pick another? If there's no potential for backlash, then there's no reason to avoid them or pick \"other options\". reply _heimdall 20 hours agorootparentprevI never said we need to educate people or that this idea, or any other for that matter, should be driven from a top-down approach. I wish people would learn it for themselves, not that the idea would be forced upon them. The idea is simple though, and I don't think it requires anything other than old ideas. A person is innocent until proven guilty. Period. End of story. An arrest proves very little and says nothing of guilt, just take it for what it is. The news may portray things wrong but people should be expected to, and given the trust to, think for themselves. The news can talk about an arrest however they want, its up to hear it, think critically, and take whatever meaning from it that I choose to take. reply lolinder 20 hours agorootparentI wish that too, but wishing people would be different than they are doesn't make it so. You have to act to make a change, and if there's no path to effect change in the people the next best thing is to change the laws to protect people from each other. reply _heimdall 19 hours agorootparent> You have to act to make a change I'm on board with this only to the extent of better supporting informed consent. The answer, in my opinion, is never to have someone in charge that believes they know what is best and forces that solution on everyone. That model is just too fragile, to dehumanizing to the those being mandated to, and too centralizing of authority that can be abused by someone later. reply ty6853 20 hours agorootparentprevAn arrest indicates probable cause a crime happened. It also for instance voided my complaint to the medical board when I complained I was treated without consent for a fabricated medical search for drugs without a warrant. It can also be used against you in immigration processes. reply _heimdall 19 hours agorootparent> An arrest indicates probable cause a crime happened It does, though you have to take that with a grain of salt. It isn't hard to find examples of arrests that go no where and were based on weak probable cause. The wright one puts behind probable cause also depends a lot on how much they respect the police. When people call for defending the police, for example, I wouldn't expect they care at all about an arrest record. reply elevatedastalt 16 hours agorootparentprevSure. Would you agree to making arrest a protected category in the US so that it can't be used for decision making? Coz employers, potential spouses, or heck even potential friends aren't going to share your loft ideals. reply pjc50 21 hours agorootparentprevSome situations (immigration?) count arrests against you even if there are no charges. reply _heimdall 19 hours agorootparentOh that's so much deeper of a rabbit hole though. Immigration is a case where its legally used against you. Technically I believe its a case where law enforcement isn't directed to go out of their way to enforce immigration laws, but if you interact with the police and they find you to be here illegally it becomes a situation where their guidance is to suddenly begin enforcing it. reply aimazon 21 hours agorootparentprev> I'd love to see people take the real lesson here an arrest proves nothing of guilt And neither does a guilty verdict in a court of law. An arrest is a data point that we can use to inform our opinion of someone just as a verdict is. reply _heimdall 6 hours agorootparent> And neither does a guilty verdict in a court of law We all agree to live in a system where a guilty verdict reached BT a jury of your peers means that you were legally found guilt. That still doesn't technically mean you did it, but it does mean you are legally deemed guilty. Is the court system flawless? Absolutely not, I've seen that first hand. But guilt, in a legal sense, has a definition and is directly linked to that jury verdict. reply woodruffw 22 hours agoparentprevIt's a problem, but the counterbalancing problem is (IMO) an equally big one: the public has a legitimate interest in how the criminal justice system handles cases, particularly when cases are dismissed before entering a public trial period. Florida has the worst possible version of this, where local governments/PDs appear to revel in publishing mugshots with virtually no pretense. But if I was a taxpaying citizen in SF, I believe I would be right in feeling entitled to read more about why a domestic violence case with a pre-existing written statement was dismissed and then sealed. reply lolinder 22 hours agorootparentIt's all well and good in theory, but no one publishes the follow-ups because they don't get engagement. Unless there's a very good story behind it, the vast majority of dismissals go entirely unreported, so the only record you get is that so and so was arrested. If it turns out that they arrest someone else for the same crime, you might get a follow-up that mentions that the original person was exonerated. But you certainly don't get a report that \"such and such wasn't actually as exciting as it first appeared so charges were dropped\". As you say, this case is the exception, but there has to be a decent middle ground that allows exceptions and doesn't allow casual voyeurism. reply mlyle 22 hours agorootparentEither harm is bad. If you release arrest records, people who are innocent have their reputations sullied. If you don't release arrest records, it's easier for the police to do questionable things (particularly to the poor and otherwise disadvantaged) without it being visible to the media, public, and those that might seek to right these wrongs. (Why so many arrests that don't lead to charges is interesting. People who prove innocent is one cause, and another is prosecutors only advancing really strong cases to maximize conviction rates is another. These are hard to tell apart.) So, the right now when we publish arrest records we give police the tool to create some lasting harm to people without strong proof, but make it harder for them to capriciously arrest people or for prosecutors to abuse their discretion. reply lolinder 22 hours agorootparentI'm less interested in whether arrest records are public than I am in whether they are publishable in online newspapers. If I have to go down to the county courthouse to get access to the records, then there's a barrier that prevents people from casually googling someone and learning that they were arrested at one point. If every arrest is published with both first and last name in the local newspaper, which is then archived online and fully indexed, that doesn't seem to be serving the cause of government transparency so much as the cause of sensational local news. I also think that allowing publication of the arrest but without the full name of the alleged criminal would address concerns about government accountability while not handing a dangerous reputational weapon to the police. reply mlyle 21 hours agorootparent> I'm less interested in whether arrest records are public than I am in whether they are publishable in online newspapers I think \"this is 'public' information that you can't publish\" is a yucky slippery slope. reply lolinder 21 hours agorootparentI think that if we can't define a category like that then the next century is going to be pretty awful in a lot of ways. If \"public\" automatically means \"accessible instantly from anywhere in the world and irreparably archived forever\", then we're either going to have to have a lot of stuff pulled from the public space or we're going to have a lot of lives ruined by all kinds of \"public\" stuff. reply MichaelZuo 20 hours agorootparentWhy does it matter? There are no preordained guarantees that any specific things will be or not be in the “public space”. reply skissane 21 hours agorootparentprev> If you don't release arrest records, it's easier for the police to do questionable things (particularly to the poor and otherwise disadvantaged) without it being visible to the media, public, and those that might seek to right these wrongs. In Germany, the media aren't legally allowed to publish the full names of suspects, only first name and first letter of surname. What if the law said law enforcement had to release all arrest records promptly to the media, but without surnames or photographs? reply elevatedastalt 16 hours agorootparentUnfortunately many people have unique enough names that that much will be bad enough. reply swatcoder 21 hours agorootparentprev> If you don't release arrest records, it's easier for the police to do questionable things (particularly to the poor and otherwise disadvantaged) without it being visible to the media, public, and those that might seek to right these wrongs. Hot take: you could have professinal journalists who have trafficked in the incidents but reserved publication of them investigate patterns of misbehavior in community institutions like the police. I mean, you can't now, as we seem to have crossed some kind of rubicon and abandoned investigative professional journalism for blogspam and tabloid, but that had been the functioning alternative for a while there. Maybe we can find a new functioning alternative? reply yencabulator 15 minutes agorootparentIt's a \"who will police the police\" problem, and letting the police choose who gets to view arrest records isn't going to be a great solution. reply woodruffw 22 hours agorootparentprev> As you say, this case is the exception, but there has to be a decent middle ground that allows exceptions and doesn't allow casual voyeurism. I agree, although I think that middle ground is elusive :-) Two things that strike me as easy to do and unequivocally good from a civics/civil liberties perspective: forbidding \"mugshot\" journalism (cf. Florida) and forbidding \"perp walks\" by local PDs. Both disproportionately punish the poor/underprivileged and directly promote the kind of reputational sullying that local PDs revel in. reply JumpCrisscross 21 hours agorootparentprev> Florida has the worst possible version of this, where local governments/PDs appear to revel in publishing mugshots with virtually no pretense Criminal charges are public information in Florida [1].

I think it really strengthens the oversight and trust people can have in the judicial system. reply BoxFour 22 hours agoparentprevIt’s a double-edged sword. If the press is prohibited from reporting on arrests, you can end up with people just apprehended without a trace. The US certainly isn't above that, especially for \"national security concerns.\" I’m not sure what the right balance looks like, but it’s definitely not a straightforward issue to resolve. reply Animats 21 hours agorootparentArrests have to be a public record.

That is not generally true. Or perhaps true in an idealised word, but in the real world many victims have a stigma attached to them. Victims of scams are frequently seen as guilible or naive. I think if it were known that someone has been scammed before many would be hesitant to hire them in a postition of financial trust. Similarly victims of rape are often portrayed in a bad light. People frequently question what did they do, or what did they wear such that what happened to them happened to them. Female victims of domestic abuse are often portrayed as schemers who orchestrated false circumstances such that they can get their exes in trouble with the law. Male victims of domestic abuse are often portrayed as not manly enough to protect themselves. Victims of workplace sexual harrasment are often portrayed as wrongdoers who just couldn’t keep their mouths shut. Someone who should just “took the compliment”, or perhaps be “less stuck up”. As if the real problem is that they reported what they reported as opposed to suffering it silently. None of these attitudes are okay, but nevertheless they do exists. Being a victim of these specific crimes happens to be dishonorable and shamefull at least in some people’s eyes. reply Xenoamorphous 21 hours agorootparentprevI guess it depends; see the recent case where apparently some old French lady was scammed out of hundreds of thousands of euro that she thought were being sent to Brad Pitt. reply BoxFour 21 hours agorootparentprevThat’s not really accurate, both historically and presently.

Many states require a license application which intentionally asks not whether you’ve ever been convicted of a crime but whether you’ve ever been arrested, which can then be used to deny you. reply curt15 21 hours agorootparentProtecting the 2A doesn't have to come at the expense of the 1A. The real problem is the license criterion that presumes guilt, not the accurate reporting of the arrest. reply ranger_danger 21 hours agorootparentprevIn what ways has it been used to deny a license application? Please give specific examples. reply user3939382 17 hours agorootparentSpecifically it tends to be referred to as a test of “good moral character”. So depending on what the reviewing officer thinks about your arrest (not conviction!) record you can be denied due to lacking good moral character, which is obviously a completely arbitrary determination hence why that practice is working its way through the courts. reply ourmandave 22 hours agoparentprevWhat if we had Community Notes for newspaper arrest reports? \"Ourmandave was mistakenly identified by Internet Sleuths and is NOT the shooter in the Grassy Knoll.\" reply sedatk 21 hours agoparentprevI once chatted with a police department Twitter account that used to publish names and pictures of people arrested.

What world do you want to live in ? reply lolinder 19 hours agorootparentA world where if we absolutely must group people into immutable categories like \"criminals\" and \"not criminals\", we at least work harder than we currently do to limit the number of people who immutably become branded as criminals. reply Waterluvian 21 hours agoparentprevIt’s bizarre and freaky to even imagine the newspapers being remotely the problem here. The problem is the significant mismatch between the stigma of being arrested and the ease and frequency in which police perform arrests. Arrests do not imply guilt but arresting someone later found to be not guilty should be incredibly embarrassing for the police. But this is at odds with the unhealthy amount of vindictiveness found in many societies. You get people frothing at the mouth about how cops don’t seem to arrest people so easily. Politicians are perpetually harder on crime because that satisfies fearful minds. But the price of running a society in such a broken manner eventually comes due. reply lolinder 20 hours agorootparentHow do you think the stigma of being arrested developed? It didn't come to exist in a vacuum, it exists in a feedback loop with the kinds of voyeuristic news reporting that glories in showing a captioned photo of a person at their lowest: in a mug shot. reply hsshhshshjk 22 hours agoparentprevSee: Luigi Mangioni reply iepathos 19 hours agoparentprevRight... but we all know this guy beat his girlfriend from the report.

For the good of any future women who might consider dating him it's actually in the interest of society that people like this have arrest reports published about them. Many abuse victims are too scared to press charges and just suffer silently. In doing so it enables abusers to move on to new victims who have no way of knowing until it's too late. reply ok_dad 22 hours agoprevSeems like a Streisand effect case to me, but I'm not Maury Blackman so I can't say whether or not his arrest for domestic violence in Mission Bay in 2021 will be more well-known now that he's bullying and suing a reporter about it and trying to make it disappear.

I’d much rather not do that kind of thing. I just want to avoid admitting obvious bad actors. We get a lot of scammers that try to sign up. We have probably let in a ringer or two, but they won’t find the app especially fruitful. It’s pretty locked-down. Facebook would be a much better hunting ground. Also, said demographic is exactly the type that might get hit pieces posted, so it is actually an argument in favor of them being the “real deal.” reply jjeaff 22 hours agoparentprevIn this case, the effect would not be to merely bring the arrest to light. Anyone who comes across the arrest now, is likely to come across the whole story, which is that it has been expunged and he was not guilty. reply ok_dad 22 hours agorootparentThe whole story is also what the report says, which was that his partner was bloodied and cut and only recanted her story after he was being arrested, which is common in domestic abuse cases. His arrest was sealed after the charges were dropped, but he wasn't found \"not guilty\" or \"guilty\" in this case. Also, the \"effect\" could be to ruin an independent reporter, not just hide or explain the arrest. reply mvdtnz 20 hours agorootparentDo you not see the problem?

It never occurred to me that there is such a choice to make here, but after thinking about it a bit, I realized that this is what distinguishes a bad journalist who writes an article that could end up hurting people more and make matters worse (e.g. about people who are going through divorce), from a good journalist that writes about things that actually matter to shareholders and to the industry. reply swatcoder 22 hours agoparentYep, professional journalists for much of the 20th century aspired to be conscious of what they were covering and how that served the public interest. There was a duty being honored. It was exactly this understanding that allowed closeted public figures in politics, entertainment, to navigate a time when it wasn't okay for their personal lives to be made public. Journalists and editors were often aware of stories that could be told, but believed that their duty wouldn't be served by reporting on them. Journalism did not always look like that, and did not everywhere look like that, but it was the prevailing norm. We're now in a very different time again, where any \"scoop\" that stirs moral outrage, earns lurid eyeballs, or undermines a public figure is not only fair game, but the ideal career-making story. reply ternaryoperator 22 hours agoparentprevPrecisely. This is the difference between scandal-mongering and journalism. Both can cover things that are true and factual, so can be deemed news.

At the time there was a fair amount of fear that the case would be entirely buried due to his advantageous position in society (not altogether different than what is being discussed here). He also changed his name. So people would make comments like above on Reddit and other social media platforms as a sort of attempt to ensure that it be extremely difficult to erase attachment of the name from the incident in the future entirely. You can see this at play still today anytime that teenager's name comes up on Reddit. Very typical example thread here[2] That thread is pretty exemplary of the trend, someone will say \"convicted rapist Brock Turner\", and everyone will pile on and also state it, in some sort of attempt to continue to keep the association at the top of the search engine.

    "originBody": "Nvidia’s $465 Billion DeepSeek Plunge Is Largest in Market History Carmen Reinicke and Cagan Koc Mon, Jan 27, 2025, 1:01 PM 3 min read In This Article: ASML (Bloomberg) Nvidia Corp.’s plunge, fueled by investor concern about Chinese artificial-intelligence startup DeepSeek, erased a record amount of stock-market value from the world’s largest company. Most Read from Bloomberg What Happened to Hanging Out on the Street? Vienna Embraces Heat Pumps to Ditch Russian Gas Billionaire Developer Caruso Slams LA Leadership Over Wildfires How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Hoboken PATH Station Will Close for Almost a Month on Jan. 30 Nvidia shares tumbled as much as 18% Monday, the biggest drop since March 2020. In early afternoon trading in New York, the decline erased $560 billion from the company’s market capitalization. That eclipsed the previous record — a 9% drop in September that wiped out about $279 billion in value — and was the biggest in US stock-market history. The drop rippled through the rest of the market due to how much weight Nvidia has in major indexes. Including Monday’s slump, Nvidia selloffs have caused eight of the top ten biggest one-day drops in the S&P 500 Index, based on market value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The S&P 500 fell as much as 2.3% Monday and the Nasdaq 100 tumbled as much as 3.6% before paring the drop. The semiconductor maker is leading a broader selloff in technology stocks after DeepSeek’s low-cost approach reignited concerns that big US companies have poured too much money into developing artificial intelligence, since the Chinese firm appears to provide a comparable performance to Western chatbots at a fraction of the price. All About DeepSeek and Its Lower-Cost AI Model: QuickTake The latest AI model of DeepSeek, released last week, is widely seen as competitive with those of OpenAI and Meta Platforms Inc. The open-sourced product was founded by quant-fund chief Liang Wenfeng and is now at the top of Apple Inc.’s App Store rankings. “Concerns have immediately emerged that it could be a disruptor to the current AI business model, which relies on high end chips and extensive computing power and hence energy,” Jefferies analysts said in a note to clients. Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of the influx in spending on AI because they design semiconductors used in the technology. While that heavy spending looks poised to continue, investors may be more wary of rewarding companies that aren’t showing a sufficient return on the investment. Meta announced plans on Friday to boost capital expenditures on AI projects this year by about half to as much as $65 billion, sending its shares to a record high.

At this point US can take deep seek off appstores but what's the point except to look petty. Eitherway, more technical ppl have pointed out some of the R1 optimizations _only_ make sense if Deepseek was constrained to older hardware, i.e. engineer at PTX level to circumvent H800 limitations to perfrom more like H100s.

You can't buy them as \"GPU\"s and integrate them to your system. NVIDIA sells your the platform (GPUs + platform board which includes switches and all the support infra), and you integrate that behemoth of a board to your server, as a single unit. So that open server and the wrapped ones at the back are more telling than it looks. reply belter 7 hours agorootparentprevYou missed the black unwrapped boxes in the background.... reply impossiblefork 6 hours agoparentprevIt's a very strange result. I believe that NVIDIA is overvalued, but if DeepSeek really is as great as has been said, then it'll be even greater when scaled up to OpenAI sizes, and when you get more out you have more reason to pay, so this should if it pans out lead to more demand for GPUs basically Jevon's paradox. reply lmm 6 hours agorootparentIf the top-tier premium GPUs aren't the difference-maker they were thought to be then that will hurt NVIDIA's margins, even if they make some of it up on volume. reply nialv7 4 hours agorootparentprevYou need to be prepared for the reality that naive scaling no longer works for LLMs anymore. Simple question: where is GPT-5? reply r00fus 1 minute agorootparentThere is a theory that Deepseek gives based on it's distillation process that hints towards, that o1 is really a distillation of a bigger GPT (GPT5?). Some consider this to be spurious/conspiracy. reply impossiblefork 2 hours agorootparentprevIt is a possibility, but my understanding of what OpenAI has said is that GPT-5 is delayed because of the apparent promise of RL trained things like o1, etc. and that they've simply decided to train those instead of training a bigger base model training on better data, and I think this is plausible. reply Jlagreen 3 hours agorootparentprevIf we expect that the demand for GPT-5 in AI compute is 100x of that of GPT-4 then if GPT-4 was trained in months on 10k of H100 then you would need years with 100k of H100 or maybe again months with 100k of GB200. See, there is your answer. The issue is the compute of GPUs is way to low yet for GPT-5 if they continue parameter scaling as they used to do. GPT3 took months on 10k A100s. 10k H100 would have done it in a fraction of a time. Blackwell could train GPT4 in 10 days with same amount of GPUs as Hopper which took months. Don't forget GPT3 is just 2.5 years old. Training is obviously waiting for the next step up in large clusters of training speed increasement. Don't be fooled, the 2x Blackwell vs. Hopper is only chip vs. chip. 10k of Blackwell including all networking speedup is easily 10x or more faster than the same amount of Hopper. So building a 1 million Blackwell cluster means 100x more training compute compared to a 100k Hopper cluster. Nobody starts a model training if it takes years to finish... too much risk in that. Transfer model was introduced in 2017 and ChatGPT came out 2022. Why? Because they would have needed millions of Volta GPUs instead of thousands of Ampere GPUs to train it. reply franktankbank 6 hours agorootparentprevThe architecture doesn't keep yielding better results, Jevon's paradox doesn't apply. reply joak 5 hours agorootparentAnyhow, if you can deliver more with less, this is huge good news for AI industry.

I can guess that overall deepseek spent way less than openai to release the model, because I have the feeling that the R&D part was cheaper too, but we don't have the numbers yet. Anyway, we can assume that deepseek and Alibaba will try to get the most out of their current GPUs however. reply negamax 7 hours agoparentprevThe bigger correction will be in tech stocks that are overly exposed to datacenter investments to accommodate for ever rising AI demands.

The issue is that DeepSeek have shown that you don't need that much raw computing power to run an AI, which means that companies including OpenAI may focus more on efficiency than on throwing more GPUs at the problem, which is not good news for those in the business of making GPUs. At least according to the market. reply paganel 1 hour agorootparentOne of the questions about this is that of the US’s human capital, i.e. does the US (still) have enough capable tech people in order to make that happen? reply mike_hearn 10 minutes agorootparentLol, yes.

Especially when such a lie could cause the nasdaq to dip multiple percent points. Not saying they are lying, but there incentives. reply pizza 7 hours agorootparentMuch easier to identify the incentives of the people who just lost a lot of money who were betting on the idea that it was their money that was going to make artificial intelligence intelligent. Everyone’s already begun trying this recipe in-house. Either it works with much less compute, or it doesn’t. For instance, HKUST just did an experiment where small weak base models trained with DeepSeek’s method beat stronger small base models being trained with much more costly RL methods. Already this seems like it is enough to upend the low end models niche market, things like haiku and 4o-mini. Be really skeptical why the people who should be making tons of money by realizing actually it was all a mirage and that they can now get the real stuff for even cheaper, would spend so much effort shouting about this, in order to undercut their own profitability.. reply 42lux 7 hours agorootparentprevHuggingface is reproducing it live on their blog… reply logicchains 7 hours agorootparentprevThey express their cost in terms of GPU hours, then convert that to USD based on market GPU rental rates, so it's not affected by subsidies. It's possible however they lied about GPU hours, but if that was the case an expert should be able to show they lied by working out how many flops are needed to train based on the amount of tokens they say they used vs the flops of the GPUs they say they used. reply rfoo 6 hours agorootparentTotal training FLOPs can be deduced from model architecture (which they can't hide since they released weights) and how many tokens they trained on. With total training FLOPs and GPU hours you can calculate MFU. And the MFU of their deepseek-v3 train is around 40%, which sounds right. Both Google and Meta reported higher MFU. So the GPU hours should be correct. The only thing they could have lied is on how many tokens they trained the model on. DeepSeek reported 14T which is also similar to what Meta did so nothing crazy here. tl;dr all numbers check up and the winnings come from the model architecture innovations they made. reply imdsm 7 hours agorootparentprevLet's wait for reproduction first reply SebFender 5 hours agoparentprevTaking out the popcorn early today. reply Palmik 13 minutes agoprevMassive overreaction in my opinion (not financial advice).

Of course, sure, ASML isn't going anywhere, but their stock price isn't based on them \"sticking around\", it's based on the idea that growing usage of AI will require exponentially more computing power over time, and DeepSeek kinda put a pin to that balloon. reply maxglute 1 hour agoparentprevNot making the news in western media yet is PRC claims to have started mass producing their indigenous 28nm litho (70% of global wafer use) this month... the estimated cost is 1/30th of ASML machines. Extrapolate and they're on trend of produce 14nm machines at comparable fraction cost in next few years. reply hintymad 1 hour agoparentprevI'm guessing the sentiment is not about training, but about the R&D capability of China. If Chinese can figure out how to build a good enough model faster and cheaper, they may be able to come up with an ASML competitor as well. reply maxglute 1 hour agorootparentPRC just announced mass producing 28nm litho that cost 1/30 ASML hardware. Easy to extrapolate where this goes especially mature nodes like 28nm still accounts fo over 70% of global wafer use. reply hintymad 54 minutes agorootparentI'm increasingly believing that the West has turned their dream of free trade for comparative advantage into a massive deindustrialization. The end result is unfolding in front of everyone and the sentiment I see, even on HN, is we can't outcompete China any more. This is sad. Really sad. And this fits exactly what Liu Cixin said in Three Body Problem: Weakness and ignorance are not barriers to survival, but arrogance is. We thought we won, and we thought we could \"control\" what other markets do, and we thought we could focus on only the \"high-value add\". Now where are we? reply mike_hearn 1 minute agorootparentThis is the kind of overly dramatic thinking that leads to stock market plunges. China is an enormous country. It has over 4x the population of the USA. Unless you assume Chinese people are fundamentally different, it should be producing 4x the output in every field vs America. Yet the impact and legacy of communism is dire: China clearly isn't even close to 4x the productivity of the USA. How many companies on the leading edge of AI does the USA have? Meta, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, NVIDIA, Cerebras, X.ai to pick just a handful of thousands. Meanwhile Europe has produced one, Mistral (or two if you count DeepMind), and China has produced one. DeepSeek meanwhile, despite being impressive, has been doing the usual thing Chinese firms focus on of rapidly driving down the cost of tech already proven out by companies elsewhere. They have a long history of doing this and it's something they take cultural pride in, but at the same time, Chinese tech executives do worry about their relative lack of leading edge innovation. The head of DeepSeek has given interviews where he talks about that specifically and their desire to change attitudes and ideas about what Chinese firms can do, because there's a widespread cultural belief there that the Americans go from 0-1 and the Chinese can go from 1-10. It's also worth remembering that prices in China are artificial. It's a somewhat planned economy still. Sectors of the economy with military relevance are heavily subsidized and they play games with their exchange rates, indeed perhaps in an attempt to forcibly deindustrialize the west. Just because something is made cheaper there doesn't necessarily mean they're doing it better. It can also be that they're just subsidized all the way to do that, and the average Chinese citizen is the loser (because they can't afford to buy things that would otherwise be affordable to them). maxglute 38 minutes agorootparentprevIMO not so much as \"where are we\" as \"where are they\", west was always going to have reckon with competing with PRC who is on trend to add more STEM than OECD combined or US adds new people. And eventually this will apply to India as well. Arrogance doesn't help, but at some point reality of high value regressing to mean because magnitude more smart brains is involuting the margins out of everything. PRC competitors likely also getting creamed by deepseek as well. The running joke in China is when China does something advanced, that thing is no longer considered advanced since China very good at driving costs to nothing and commodizing advanced into common which ironically hurts PRC from getting into the true high value game. reply apexalpha 1 hour agoparentprevI think everyone was just a bit overpriced because of the AI hype and it's just letting out some air. reply fldskfjdslkfj 1 hour agoparentprevNot really, if demand for high end high margin chips goes down considerably than margins and demand will go down across the board. reply Sol 7 hours agoprevI find it interesting because the DeepSeek stuff, while very cool, doesn't seem invalidate that more compute wouldn't translate to even _higher_ capabilities? It's amazing what they did with a limited budget, but instead of the takeaway being \"we don't need that much compute to achieve X\", it could also be, \"These new results show that we can achieve even 1000*X with our currently planned compute buildout\" But perhaps the idea is more like: \"We already have more AI capabilities than we know how to integrate into the economy for the time being\" and if that's the hypothesis, then the availability of something this cheap would change the equation somewhat and possibly justify investing less money in more compute. reply lagrange77 7 hours agoparent> doesn't seem invalidate that more compute wouldn't translate to even _higher_ capabilities? That's how i understand it. And since their current goal seems to be 'AGI' and their current plan for achieving it seems to be scaling LLMs (network depth wise and at inference time prompt wise), i don't see why it wouldn't hold. reply Dalewyn 7 hours agoparentprevThe stock market is not the economy, Wall Street is not Main Street. You need to look at this more macroscopically if you want to understand this. Basically: China tech sector just made a big splash, traders who witnessed this think other traders will sell because maybe US tech sector wasn't as hot, so they sell as other traders also think that and sell. The fall will come to rest once stocks have fallen enough that traders stop thinking other traders will sell. Investors holding for the long haul will see this fall as stocks going on sale and proceed to buy because they think other investors will buy.

If this is true then Openai, Google or even many magnitudes smaller companies etc. can just easily replicate similar methods in their processes and provide models which are just as good or better.

The paper is well-written and has a lot of specifics. Exactly the opposite of what you would do if you had truly made an advancement of world-altering magnitude. All this says to me is that the models themselves have very little intrinsic value / are highly fungible. The true value lies in the software interfaces to the models, and the ability to make it easy to plug your data into the models. My guess is the consumer market will ultimately be won by 2-3 players that make the best app / interface and leverage some kind of network effect, and enterprise market will just be captured by the people who have the enterprise data, I.e. MSFT, AMZN, GOOG. Depending on just how impactful AI can be for consumers, this could upend Apple if a full mobile hardware+OS redesign is able to create a step change in seamlessness of UI. That seems to me to be the biggest unknown now how will hardware and devices adapt? NVDA will still do quite well because as others have noted, if it’s cheaper to train, the balance will just shift toward deploying more edge devices for inference, which is necessary to realize the value built up in the bubble anyway. Some day the compute will become more fungible but the momentum behind the nvidia ecosystem is way too strong right now. reply gitfan86 6 hours agoparentWhat has changed is the perception that people like OpenAI/MSFT would have an edge on the competition because of their huge datacenters full of NVDA hardware. That is no longer true. People now believe that you can build very capable AI applications for far less money. So the perception is that the big guys no longer have an edge. Tesla had already proven that to be wrong. Tesla's Hardware 3 is a 6 year old design, and it does amazingly well on less than 300 watts. And that was mostly trained on a 8k cluster. reply plaidfuji 6 hours agorootparentI mean, I think they still do have an edge ChatGPT is a great app and has strong consumer recognition already, very hard to displace.. and MSFT has a major installed base of enterprise customers who cannot readily switch cloud / productivity suite providers.

I disagree completely on this sentiment.

Hopefully, we can reverse course on this trend and go back to when world-changing innovations are shared openly so they can actually change the world. reply evanjrowley 2 hours agorootparentExactly. There's a strong case for being open about the advancements in AI. Secretive companies like Microsoft, OpenAI, and others are undercut by DeepSeek and any other company on the globe who wants to build on what they've published. Politically there are more reasons why China should not become the global center of AI and less reasons why the US should remain the center of it. Therefore, an approach that enables AI institutions worldwide makes more sense for China at this stage. The EU for example has even less reason now to form a dependency on OpenAI and Nvidia, which works to the advantage of China and Chinese AI companies. reply hintymad 1 hour agoprevIs it possible that the key here is all about where top talent goes?

We’ve been getting the impression that the limiting factor was the number of GPUs right? If so, this reduces that bottleneck and frees them up to do even better right? reply ReptileMan 6 hours agoparentFrom my understanding the limiting factor is the quantity and quality of data available for training. reply junon 7 hours agoprevNot sure what the fuss is. I tried Deepseek earlier today for the first time and it was even worse than o1 when it came to reasoning skills and following my requests for how I wanted to engage with it. o1 at least gives it to me straight. When I ask it to engage in more back and forth before assuming what I'm after, it tends to follow through. Deepseek seemed immediately eager to (very slowly) feed me a bunch of made up information thinking that's what I wanted. I feel as though a lot of people get hung up on these sort of \"micro benchmarks\" whereas trying to get practical work done is severely under tested. I'm not a fan of openai at all but I don't have the spare compute to run anything locally so o1 suffices for now. Still don't see how this is anything but a win for Nvidia though. reply LittleTimothy 7 hours agoparentThe excitement isn't the capabilities of the model, it's how efficiently it was created. One of the major lessons in AI in the last couple of years was that scale mattered you would want to throw more and more compute at a problem and that has turned into incredible share prices for Nvidia and incredible investments in data centre and energy generation. If it turns out that actually we didn't need quite such incredible scale to get these results and actually we were just missing some really quite basic efficiency optimizations then the entire investment cycle into Nvidia, data centres and energy generation is going to whipsaw in an incredible way. reply nejsjsjsbsb 7 hours agorootparentWhich doesn't make sense.

How much value a company creates is at best tangential and often completely orthogonal to how much the stock is worth. The stock market has always been a Keynesian beauty contest, but in the past few decades, strongly shaped and morphed by attention economies. A good example of this is DJT, a company which functionally doesn't do much anything, but in the last year has traded at wildly differing prices. P/E, EBITDA, etc, are all useless metrics in trying to explain this phenomenon. In other words, NVIDIA is in the red not because the company is suddenly doing worse, but because traders think other traders think it will trade down. That is a self fulfilling prophecy, but only so long as there is sufficient attention to drive that. The same works the other way around as well, so long as there is sufficient attention to drive the AI hype train upwards, related stocks will do well as well. reply dogma1138 7 hours agorootparentI understand that part, hence why this is very much buy the dip for me. reply novaRom 6 hours agorootparentI think the message everyone now accepts is: \"there is no moat\".

Large models are different you don't need all of that the future of LLMs is Open Source like Linux. reply dist-epoch 7 hours agorootparentprevYou are assuming that the stock rose to this level \"on merits\" and now it falls due to \"stupidness\". Maybe part of the growth was also \"stupidness\", and in that case buying the dip is a mistake because the \"merit\" price (value) is still way below. reply Mordisquitos 7 hours agorootparentprevYou can buy the dip if you want, as long as you're aware that you're not betting that \"stupid\" traders are undervaluing NVIDIA's fundamentals. Rather, you're betting that \"stupid\" traders will again rally NVIDIA's share price significantly above this dip, and you will be a smart trader who will know when to sell what you bought. Good luck. reply ido 6 hours agorootparentAnd not just that, but even if AI's future is indeed as bright as the hype says (i.e. that NVIDIA's fundamentals are solid & that the market will eventually acknowledgment that after the fluctuations) they may still be wrong about the timeline. In the .com bust you could have \"bought the dip\" in the early 00s right after the crash started and still taken 5 years before you weren't in the red even on \"good\" (in hindsight) stocks like amazon, ebay, microsoft, etc. The big hype there was eCommerce it turned out to be true! We use eCommerce all the time now, but it took longer than predicted during the .com boom (same for broadband internet enabling \"rich web experience\" it came true, but not fast enough for some hyped companies in '00). And if you bought some of the darling stocks back then like Yahoo or Netscape that ended up not so great in hindsight you may have never recouped your losses. reply belter 7 hours agorootparentprevDon't try to catch a falling knife...bla bla... reply short_sells_poo 7 hours agorootparentprevIt's not just the usual herding behavior though. There's a convex response to news like this because people look at higher order effects like the growth of growth for stocks. Basically the DeepSeek story is about needing 40x fewer compute resources to run inference if their benchmarks are true. The dip doesn't mean that NVidia is now doomed, it simply means that if DeepSeek is legit, you need much less NV hardware to run the same amount of inference as before. Will the demand rise to still use up all the built hardware? Probably, but we went from a very stratospheric supply constraint to a slightly less stratospheric one, and this is reflected in the prices. Generally these moves are exaggerated initially, and it takes a bit of time for people to digest the information and the price to settle. It's an oscillating system with many feedback loops. reply gitfan86 6 hours agorootparentAs someone who bought NVDA in early 2023 and sold in late 2024 I can say this is wrong. There was never a question of if NVDA hardware would have high demand in 2025 and 2026. Everyone still expects them to sell everything they make. The reason the stock is crashing is because Wall St believed that companies who bought 50B+ of NVDA hardware would have a moat. That was obviously always incorrect, TPUs and other hardware was eventually going to be good enough for real world use cases. But Wall St is run by people who don't understand technology. reply short_sells_poo 6 hours agorootparentLoving the absolute 100% confidence there and the clear view into all the traders' minds that are trading it this morning. If they'll sell everything they make and it's all about the moat of their clients, why is NVDA still down 15% premarket? You could quote correlation effects and momentum spillover, but that is still just the higher order effects I mentioned about people's expectations being compounded and thus reactions to adverse news being convex. reply qwytw 6 hours agorootparent> why is NVDA still down 15% premarket? Presumably because backorders will go down, production volume and revenue won't grow as fast, Nvidia will be forced to decrease their margins due to lower demand etc. etc. Selling everything you make is an extremely low bar relative to Nvidia's current valuation because it assumes that Nvidia will be able to grow at a very fast pace AND maintain obscene margins for the next e.g. ~5 years AND will face very limited competition. reply short_sells_poo 5 hours agorootparentThat's literally what I wrote in my post, which the parent disagreed with. You could disagree with the part that it is because inference is now cheaper but again I'd argue that's just a different way of saying there's no moat. reply gitfan86 5 hours agorootparentprevPeople owned NVDA because they believed that huge NVDA hardware purchases was the ONLY way to get a AI replacement for a Mid Level software engineer or similar functionality. reply short_sells_poo 53 minutes agorootparentThat's basically what I wrote: \"it simply means that if DeepSeek is legit, you need much less NV hardware to run the same amount of inference as before.\" So I still don't understand what it is that you are so strongly disagreeing with, and I also don't understand how having owned NVidia stock somehow lends credence to your argument. We are in agreement that this won't threaten NVidia's immediate bottom line, they'll still sell everything they build, because demand will likely rise to the supply cap even with lower compute requirements. There are probably a multitude of reasons why the very large number of people who own NVidia stock have decided to de-lever on the news, and a lot of it is simple uneducated herding. But we are fundamentally dealing with a power law here the forward value expectations for NVidia have exponential growth baked in to the hilt, combined with some good old fashioned tulip mania, and when that exponential growth becomes just slightly less exponential, that results in fairly significant price oscillations today even though the basic value proposition is still there. This was the gist of my comment you disagree with this? reply gitfan86 13 minutes agorootparentUp until recently there was a belief by some investors that OpenAI was going to \"cure cancer\" or something as big as that. They assumed that the money flowing into OpenAI would 10x, under the assumption that no one else could catch up with them after that event and a lot of that would flow to NVDA. Now is looks like that 10x of flow of money into OpenAI will no longer exist. There will be competition and compodiditzation, which causes the value of the tokens to drop way more than 40x. api 7 hours agorootparentprevEverything above the street level and physical economy is becoming gambling. There has always been a component of gambling to all investing, but that component now seems to utterly eclipse everything else. Merit doesn’t even register. Fundamentals don’t register. reply Cumpiler69 7 hours agorootparentprev>In other words, NVIDIA is in the red not because the company is suddenly doing worse, but because traders think other traders think it will trade down. Well put. People need to unterstand that some stocks are basically one giant casino poker table. There was a comment with a link here that a lot of Nvidia buyers don't even know what products Nvidia is making and they don't care, they just want to buy low and sell high. Insert old famous comment abut shoe shine boy giving investment advice to Wall Street stock traders. reply scotty79 7 hours agorootparentprevMarkets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. reply Dalewyn 7 hours agorootparentprevPut more simply: The stock market is not a reflection of the economy. Wall Street is not Main Street. reply WJW 7 hours agorootparentIt's a reflection of expectations about the future economy. Obviously, such expectations are not always accurate because humans are quite fallible when trying to predict the future. This is even more true when there is a lot of hype about a certain product. Yesterdays price of (say) NVidia was based on the expectation that companies would need to buy N billion of USD of GPUs per year. Now Deepseek comes out and makes a point that N/10 would be enough. From there it can go two ways: NVidia's expected future sales drop by 90%. The reduced price for LLMs should allow companies to push AI into markets that were previously not cost effective. Maybe this can 10x the total available market, but since the estimated total available market was already ~everything (due to hype) that seems unlikely. NVidia finds another usecase for GPUs to offset the reduced demand from AI companies. In practice, it will probably be some combination of all three. The real problems are not caused for the \"shovel sellers\" but for companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, who now suddenly have to compete against a competitor that can produce the same product at (apparently) a fraction of the price. reply larschdk 7 hours agorootparentI think it is more expectation about expectation. You buy/sell based on whether you expect other people to expect earn or lose. It is self-referential, hence irrational. If a new play enters and peoples expectations shift, that affects your expectation of value even though the companies involved are not immediately or directly affects. reply zozbot234 7 hours agorootparentprev> OpenAI and Anthropic, who now suddenly have to compete against a competitor that can produce the same product at (apparently) a fraction of the price. OpenAI and Anthropic can react by adopting DeepSeek's compute enhancements and using them to build even better models. AI training is still very clearly compute-limited from their POV (they have more data than they know what to do with already, and training \"reasoning\"/chains-of-thought requires a lot of reinforcement learning which is especially hard) so any improvement in compute efficiency is great news no matter where it comes from. reply Dalewyn 7 hours agorootparentprevAs already mentioned elsewhere, Jevon's Paradox will increase demand subsequent to improved efficiency. Yes, will not can. So if the stock market was reflective of the economy (future or the present) then stocks should go up, instead they're going down. Why? Because the stock market is not reflective of the economy. The stock market is essentially a reflection of societal perception. DJT which was brought up earlier is a great example, because the price of DJT has next to nothing to do with Trump's businesses and almost everything to do with how he is perceived (and remember there is no such thing as bad publicity). Personally I think the fall will be momentary and followed shortly by a climb to recovery and beyond, but who really knows. If you don't want to lose your money: Don't let the sensationalist financial journalists and pundits get to you, don't let big red numbers in your portfolio scare you, ignore traders (they all lose their money), don't sell your stocks unless you actually need that money for something right now, re-read your investment manifesto if you have one, and maybe buy the dip for shits and giggles if you have some spare cash laying around. reply WJW 6 hours agorootparentI agree that it will improve demand for AI services. There's no hard rule that the demand increase will be larger than the efficiency increase though, and so total sales of GPUs may still decrease as a result. reply nejsjsjsbsb 7 hours agorootparentprevWall St is not Main St even if they price it perfectly. reply diegocg 7 hours agoparentprevNvidia is way too overvalued regardless of deepseek or the success of AI. This is just some correction (not even too big even considering the current bubble), these traders are not stupid. reply matwood 7 hours agorootparentI agree with Aswath Damodaran here. NVDA is priced for perfection in AI, but also whatever is next. In addition, IMO NVDA’s margins are a gift and a curse. They look great to investors, but also mean all their customers are aggressively looking to produce their own GPUs. reply goeiedaggoeie 7 hours agorootparentExactly. gpu's have become too profitable and of strategic importance, to not see several deep pocketed existing technology companies invest more and try and acquire market share. there is a mini moat here with cuda and existing work, but some the start of commodification must be on theselling a stock because the product the company produces is now even more effective is mind bogglingly stupid. No it isn't. Investors are most likely expecting there will be less demand for Nvidia's product long-term due to these alleged increased training efficiencies. reply PeterStuer 6 hours agorootparentThere is afaict no inherent limit to expand on the bottom end of the market. My gut feeling is lower training costs will expand the market for hardware horizontaly far faster than any vertical scaling by a select 2 digit of mega corps could. reply InkCanon 7 hours agorootparentprevIt's arguable how good a strategy it is to check against other P/E. During the tech bubble people would say X is cheap, because Y is trading at 100P/E instead of 200 reply dogma1138 7 hours agorootparentAgain that may reasonable but it’s a completely different argument. Whether there is a bubble or not and whether NVDA is overvalued is irrelevant to the subject at hand. If it’s cheaper to train models it means far more customers that will try their luck. If you reduce training requirement from a 100,000 GPUs to a 1000 you’ve now opened the market to 1000’s and 1000’s of potential players instead of like the 10 that can afford dumping so much money into a compute cluster. reply fragmede 7 hours agorootparentthe holy grail is to not have a separate train and inference steps. when the model can be updated while it is inferencing is where we're headed. deepseek only accelerates the need for more compute, not less reply Jlagreen 3 hours agorootparentTHIS is the only correct statement in all of this. The goal for AGI and ASI MUST BE to train, inference, train, inference and so on and that all on the fly in fractions of a second from every token produced. Now good luck calculating the compute and hard work in algorithms to get there. Not possible? Then AGI won't ever work because how can AGI beat a human if it can't learn on the fly? Not to mention ASI lol. reply nejsjsjsbsb 7 hours agorootparentprevP/E alone is useless anyway. A growth company is likely not making a profit as they are reinvesting. But not a profit doesn't implies good either of course. reply redwood 6 hours agorootparentprevThis is hackernews, not some boilerroom pump n dump forum. Please use more professional language and take your confidence down a notch. Try to learn and add to the discussion. You seem to believe that the more inference or training value per piece of tech the more demand there will be for that piece of tech full stop when there are multiple forces at play. As a simple example, you can think of this as a supply spike; while you can make the bet that the demand will follow there could be a lag on that demand spike due to the time it takes to find use cases with product/market fit. That could collapse prices over the near term which could in turn decrease revenue. As a reminder the stock value isn't a bet on whether \"the gold trader\" will sell more gold or not, it's a bet on whether the net future returns of the gold trader will occur in line with expectations, expectations that are sky high and have zero competition built in. reply nobunaga 7 hours agorootparentprevAMD does not have a PE double of NVIDIA. PE is high because of amortisation of an acquisition. People on hackernews talk a lot but have no idea what they talk about.

That's why PER is not that relevant for them, it's been over 50-70 since forever, but the stock went up 10x, which means earnings went up as well. DeepSeek might be good for their business overall, but it might mean earnings will not continue growing exponentially like they have been for the past two years. So it's time to bail. You shouldn't underestimate the fact that a large amount of these trades are on margin. Sometimes you can't wait it out because you'll get margin called and if you can't pony up additional cash you're basically getting caught with your pants down. Disclaimer: I am not a trader, so could be way off reply dogma1138 7 hours agorootparentWhy? The compute requirements would still continue to grow the more efficient and more capable the models become. If it’s cheaper to inference you end up using the model for more task, it it’s cheaper to train you train more than models. And if you now need only 1000’s of GPUs instead of 10’s or 100’s of thousands you’ve just unlocked a massive client base of those who can afford to invest high six to low seven figures instead of 100’s of millions or billions into to try their luck. reply margorczynski 7 hours agorootparentDoesn't this situation also imply to some degree that China is focused on beating the US on AI and probably they will develop a competitor to NVIDIA that will cause margins to drop significantly? They have a lot of very smart people and the will to do it, seems like a matter of time before they succeed. reply redwood 6 hours agorootparentprevIt might take 5 yrs to find the use cases. That's what happened with the dark fiber from the .com boom. Go look at Cisco 2001 for parallels reply locallost 6 hours agorootparentprevIt could be, but maybe the feeling is the investments now are already massive and everyone has jumped on the AI train. If you are suddenly 10x efficient, and everyone gets 10x more efficient, there's less room to grow than before. What you're saying makes a lot of sense, but it's one thing to write it on a message board and another to use it to back up your decision that affects billions of dollars you have in your fund. The proof is in the pudding, you're welcome to prove \"everyone\" wrong. reply WithinReason 7 hours agoparentprevIndeed: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox In economics, the Jevons paradox occurs when technological progress increases the efficiency with which a resource is used, but the falling cost of use induces increases in demand enough that resource use is increased, rather than reduced. reply belter 7 hours agorootparentI beat your Jevons paradox and raise you the Theory of Constraints.. reply ReptileMan 6 hours agorootparentprevYes but it will also mean that people wouldn't need cutting edge NVIDIA chips it will be able to run on older node chips. Or from different manufacturers. So NVIDIA wouldn't be able to command the margins they do now. It may be great news for VRAM manufacturers tough. reply WithinReason 5 hours agorootparentThey only need cutting edge to be competitive, and that will be true independently of efficiency. That's the point. reply fintechie 7 hours agoparentprev> I don’t understand how stupid some traders can be. 90% of traders lose money, so that's a data point... You're trying to apply rational thinking but that's not how markets work. In the end valuations are more about narratives in the collective mind than technological merit. reply mistercow 7 hours agoparentprevI think it's because the media coverage is all focused on how this means the big AI players have lost their competitive advantage, rather than the other side of the equation. But that's also dumb, because \"huge leap forward in training efficiency\" is not exactly bad news for the major players in even the medium term. Short term, it means their models are less competitive, but I don't see any reason that they can't leverage e.g. these new mixed precision training techniques on their giant GPU farms and train something even bigger and smarter. There seems to be this weird baked in assumption that AI is at a permanent (or at least semi-permanent) plateau, and that open source models catching up is the end of the game. But this is an arms race, and we're nowhere near the finish line. reply omgJustTest 7 hours agoparentprev> Good time to buy then, I don’t understand how stupid some traders can be. Likely a \"how solid is the technical moat\" evaluation this could be a one-off or could be that there are an avalanche of advancements to continue along the efficiency side of the process. Given the style and hype of logic in the AI space, I fully believe resources are not well allocated in compute and _actual_ thinking as to how they are spent. Deepseek's apparent 10x more efficient per inference token... implies a lot of other hardware meets the general use-case. We also know that reasoning should be about 10W for human speed-of-thought... maybe another 1-2 orders of power efficiency. \"Pre-Training: Towards Ultimate Training Efficiency We design an FP8 mixed precision training framework and, for the first time, validate the feasibility and effectiveness of FP8 training on an extremely large-scale model. Through co-design of algorithms, frameworks, and hardware, we overcome the communication bottleneck in cross-node MoE training, nearly achieving full computation-communication overlap. This significantly enhances our training efficiency and reduces the training costs, enabling us to further scale up the model size without additional overhead. At an economical cost of only 2.664M H800 GPU hours, we complete the pre-training of DeepSeek-V3 on 14.8T tokens, producing the currently strongest open-source base model. The subsequent training stages after pre-training require only 0.1M GPU hours.\" [1] [1] https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3 reply amazingamazing 7 hours agoparentprevmaybe Nvidia is fine but I don't understand this logic. suppose it turns out GPUs are unnecessary at all, but they still provide a performance boost, but you can do everything you can do right now with CPUs w.r.t performance. would that be good or bad for Nvidia? unless it can be said we need more performance than is currently possible, e.g. new demand, it would be catastrophic. it is unclear that throwing more compute actually expands what is possible. if that is not the case, efficiency is bad for nvidia because it simply results in less demand. reply diggan 7 hours agorootparentI could see arguments be made in both ways here. If GPUs end up being more efficient/powerful (like today) it could induce even more demand, but also if CPU gets within ~20% of how fast you can do something with a GPU, people might start opting for something like Macs with unified memory instead of GPUs. Today a CPU setup is still nowhere near as fast as a GPU setup (for ML/AI), but who knows how it looks like in the future. > it is unclear that throwing more compute actually expands what is possible Wasn't that demonstrated to be true already in the GPT1/2 days? AFAIK, LLMs became a thing very much because OpenAI \"discovered\" that \"throwing more compute (and training data) at the problem/solution expands what is possible\" reply belter 7 hours agoparentprevNVDA is a totally manipulated stock. The company beat earnings in the last three quarters and the stock dropped 15% to 20% immediately after the results release.

DeepSeek and friends basically reduce the commodity value of AI (and to be fair, Facebook, Microsoft et al are trying to do the same thing with their open source models, trying to chop the legs out of the upstart AI cos). If AI is worth less, there are going to be fewer mega capitalized AI ventures buying a trillion dollars worth of rapidly-depreciating GPUs in hopes at eeking out some minor advantage. I wouldn't short nvidia stock, but at the same time there is a point where the spend of GPUs just isn't rational anymore. >And as more efficient models proliferate it means more edge computing which means more customers with lower negotiating power than Meta and Google Edge compute has infinitely more competition than the data center. reply ransom1538 7 hours agoparentprev [–] \"dig only 1 day instead of an entire month\" You answered your own question.

    "originLink": "https://www.theindex.media/this-man-is-a-coward/",
    "originBody": "Tech This Man is a Coward. Joan Westenberg 27 Jan 2025 3 min This man is a coward. And no amount of corporate jargon or performative masculinity can make that stain go away. Mark Zuckerberg sat in the safety of his bubble this week, silent as Donald Trump dismantled and declawed the National Institutes of Health. Forty billion dollars in research funding now hangs frozen. Thousands of scientists wait in limbo. And the tech billionaire who once promised to help cure all diseases can't muster a single word of protest. The silence tells us everything. So do the actions that preceded it. In the months since Zuckerberg's Thanksgiving meeting with Trump, the architect of the Poke has orchestrated a complete surrender of principles at Meta. He stripped away fact-checking programs. He gutted content moderation policies. He elevated Republican executives to key positions. He eliminated diversity initiatives across the company, claiming without evidence they had somehow worked \"too well\" even as men continue to outnumber women at Meta by two to one. Watch how quickly he moves when Trump demands change. Special rules for Trump's social media posts? Done. A warm welcome back to Meta's platforms? Arranged immediately. The dismantling of years of protective policies? Executed within weeks. Zuckerberg transforms himself with each passing month, molding himself into whatever shape he thinks will please his new master. The awkward coding prodigy now struts around as a cage-fighting, wild-pig-hunting warrior philosopher, spouting tired talking points about \"masculine virtues\" on Joe Rogan's podcast. Money tells the real story. Meta makes billions by harvesting and selling our attention to the highest bidder. Zuckerberg controls it all with near-absolute authority. He has more wealth than he could spend in a hundred lifetimes. He commands a platform that reaches billions of people. All that power, all those resources, all that potential influence and he uses it to make himself smaller, bow lower, and surrender in ever more craven contortions of the human spirit. Look at his performances at Mar-a-Lago. Listen to him parrot Trump's language about \"wokeness\" and \"masculinity.\" See how eagerly he implements Trump's wishes, destroying programs and policies that took years to build. The corporate jargon about \"cultural balance\" and \"positive aggression\" can't hide the truth. The talk of preventing cultural \"neutering\" can't disguise what's really happening. His response to criticism reveals everything. When confronted about his silence on Trump's NIH cuts, he accused his critics of \"making things up.\" When questioned about dismantling diversity programs, he buried the truth under buzzwords about \"workplace culture.\" He retreats behind a wall of corporate doublespeak when pushed about his constant capitulation to Trump's demands. He rolls out contingents of Proud Women of Meta to defend his \"feminism.\" But he cannot conceal the simple, obvious truth. This man is a coward. The world already sees the damage. With each capitulation, Zuckerberg writes the simpering manual for corporate America's submission to authoritarianism. Amazon followed Zuckerberg's lead, rolling back its own diversity initiatives. Other tech companies watch and learn, reading the political winds through the lens of Zuckerberg's surrender. Power corrupts, but cowardice corrupts more completely. It corrupts not through excess but through absence the absence of backbone, principle, and basic human courage. Zuckerberg had every resource needed to stand up to Trump's assault on American institutions. He chose weak-willed submission in its place. Surrounded by wealth and power, Zuckerberg probably tells himself he's making necessary compromises. He likely sees himself as a pragmatic leader navigating difficult times. But history will see him clearly: a child who would not become a man, a vacuum who traded his principles for proximity to power, a peon who sacrificed everything he claimed to believe for a seat at an authoritarian's table. Mark Zuckerberg commands one of the most powerful companies on Earth. He controls vast wealth, unimaginable resources, and direct access to billions of human minds. Mark could speak up. He could take a stand. He could use even a fraction of his power to defend the institutions and principles he once claimed to cherish. Instead, he cringes. He capitulates. He collaborates. This man is a coward. And no amount of corporate jargon or performative masculinity can make that stain go away.",

But I think it worked both ways. It was pretty clear that Facebook (and a lot of other industries) also took on a lot of practices that they clearly didn't believe in either. DEI was taken up performatively for political reasons. We cannot be upset when it is removed performatively for political reason. And we have to be honest that these programs were largely failures. Fact checking especially. Even performatively, these companies took on pretty big responsibilities, only garnered more criticism and controversy, gained nothing, and after years of plugging away had no light at the end of the tunnel. reply ffsm8 10 hours agoparent> Fact checking especially It's very confusing to me that pretty much nobody takes what Zuck said in that interview at face value. It's entirely possible he thought that doing fact checks is a good approach in the context of the beginning of Corona and then find out how borderline impossible such an approach is in practice and consequently change his opinion on doing it... reply grajaganDev 18 hours agoparentprevSandberg was pushing DEI long before 2020.

Entities with that kind of attitude usually don't grow to the size facebook is. The biden administration using backchannels to pressure social media instead of being transparent about it are the one to MAINLY criticize.

You may not be able to bend the will of state officials, but if you can bend the will of national-level companies this easily, \"the Feds\" are effectively a much larger operation than it otherwise would be. reply tomrod 20 hours agorootparentSince the 1950s, more and more power has been claimed by the executive, sometimes as a consequence of legislature dysfunction, more often by unchecked supremacy clause execution. The US was envisioned to look a lot more like the EU. The US Civil War required a stronger federal response, and unfortunately reconstruction failed to sufficiently address the primary economic differences in industrialization, resulting in deep geographical divides. Further propaganda machines set up by one party due to embarrassment over Nixon's resignation has resulted in one effective party; the other is primarily controlled by corporations. reply readthenotes1 19 hours agorootparent\"more often by unchecked supremacy clause execution.\" Which is also quite often legistrature dysfunction. reply 2muchcoffeeman 19 hours agorootparentprevThere’s always been disgusting amounts of money involved with US presidential elections.

Definitely instructive, but I think also important is how it recharacterizes the past. We should not assume that \"kissing the ring\" is new starting with this administration. Instead, it's probably fairer to conclude that rich successful tech companies will almost always adopt whatever stance they think will be most to their benefit. It's generally safer to presume that their actions are based on exigency rather than deeply held beliefs. reply sottol 18 hours agoparentprevThis _is_ the rich controlling our government! Except it's more openly visible in this case than usual. Going forward they'll have a good deal of say in the policies they care about, by donating and attending and show of loyalty. reply saghm 19 hours agoparentprevHow do you think \"the rich controlling our government\" would look? I can think of two possibilities: either someone rich and corrupt being elected and using the office to their own advantage and that of other rich people, or the rich influencing the government to enact the policies they want despite the people in control not also being rich. I'm not sure about you, but watching \"worlds richest people line up to kiss the ring\" of the new Trump administration is impossible for me to differentiate from either of those scenarios, let alone both of them. Yes, most Trump voters are not nearly as wealthy as him (or the other executives kissing the ring), but when taxes are lowered and government services are cut due to the reduced budget, they're the ones losing more than the rich compared to a higher progressive tax rate. If the theory you're trying to disprove is that the government couldn't possibly be caused to enact policies that benefit the rich to the expense of everyone else, the fact that someone is elected by a large number of non-wealthy people doesn't demonstrate anything that would make your argument more convincing. reply fallinghawks 19 hours agorootparentYou're assuming that those non-wealthy people have objectively studied both candidates, weighed their platforms, and chosen the one they have determined will make their lives better. As opposed to, say, the one who promises to hurt they people they want to see hurt, or the one who claims they will protect them from whatever out-group they consider dangerous. reply saghm 14 hours agorootparentHow am I assuming that? If those non-wealthy people haven't objectively studied both candidates, how does that make it less likely that the wealthy are able to exert outsized influence on government policy (either by directly taking part or lobbying)? Trying to distract people by redirecting their unhappiness towards convenient targets that are unrelated to wealth is pretty much exactly what I'd expect from someone wanting to enact a pro-wealthy agenda that doesn't actually help the average voter at all. reply Sparyjerry 17 hours agoparentprevI find it interesting how they were afraid before Trump to say their feelings.

But the way I see it, it's pretty clear he disagreed with a lot of it, and just felt too much pressure (internal from employees, external from the media) to not fall in line. Does no one remember that in the 2010s, Zuck went around trying to advocate against the calls for censoring \"disinformation\", arguing free speech shouldn't be regulated by a company? These types of views aren't new for him, they were aggressively suppressed by the press which published thousands of articles calling his ideas anything from \"reckless\" to \"violent.\"[1][2] At some point, he gave in, in part because the new administration very much agreed with the media on this (and again, many of Meta's employees). But now he has the political cover to run things the way he actually wants to, which we can see from his public remarks years ago. So, you can I guess call him a \"coward,\" but it would be misinformed, in my opinion, to claim he's a coward because he's seemingly kowtowing to the Trump people in the changes he's making. On the contrary, if anything he was a being a coward before by not following through on his true convictions! (fwiw, I don't agree any of this is cowardice. It's extremely difficult to run a company at that scale and try to keep everyone happy, and he's only human at the end of the day. The author simply disagrees with his currently expressed opinions. If he agreed, she might be calling him a hero, though probably not. I also think laying the NIH stuff at his feet is a huge non-sequitor.

An antenna cable is not just a piece of wire. Technically, it's called a \"transmission line\", with special properties such as its characteristic impedance. But transmission lines are quite a bit older than radio technology: they date back to the second half of the 19th century, in the form of (mostly submarine) telegraph cables. In this article we look at the principles and properties of transmission lines, with special emphasis on Oliver Heaviside's contribution to our knowledge of them. Oliver Heaviside After secondary school, Oliver Heaviside (1850-1925) started working at the company which operated the submarine telegraph cable between Newcastle (UK) and Denmark. At first he worked as a telegraph operator, but soon he also got involved with the (electro)technical side of the telegraph systems. One of the things he noticed, was that when water leaked into a submarine cable and progressively short-circuited it, the signals did not just become weaker (as expected), but also clearer, less distorted. In those days, electrical engineering was still in its infancy. Thanks to the work of physicists like Volta, Ampère, Ørsted and Faraday, there was a decent understanding of generating electrical currents and moving compass needles using an electromagnet. Together, that is enough for building a telegraph, at least in principle. But if one uses as very long cable, and tries to send dots and dashes at a high rate, it turned out to not work so well. There was little theoretical understanding of this, particularly among the more practically minded people who cobbled together telegraph systems. Heaviside studied physics by himself, and stumbled on the books by James Clerk Maxwell. Maxwell's ideas about electromagnetism were, at that time, rather speculative and not widely accepted, but Heaviside got enthousiastic, studied them, and succesfully applied this theory to telegraph lines. Thus, Heaviside, who never had studied at a university, rose from being a humble telegraph operator to a respected physicist. After quitting his job at the telegraph company at the age of 24, he never had another job. The rest of his life he lived in relative poverty while working on the theory. He became one of the so-called Maxwellians: a group of physicists who enhanced Maxwell's theory after his untimely death (in 1879 at the age of 48) and popularised it. One of Heaviside's achievements is that he converted Maxwell's twenty mathematical formulas into a more accessible set of just four, which nowadays are taught at all universities as \"Maxwell's equations\". If you want to learn more about this remarkable person, I recommend his biography [1]. Thomson's model William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) attempted to describe what happens in a long telegraph cable. His model is sketched in the figure. He mentally chopped the cable into short pieces, each of which has some resistance and some capacitance. Next, he calculated what happens if at the left end one suddenly applies a voltage of say 1 volt. The graphs show the result, for a 4 km long cable having 0.1 ohm of resistance per meter, and 10 pF of capacitance per meter. The cable has been divided into 4 pieces of 1 km each, so each having 100 ohm and 10 nF. We see that the voltage on the first capacitor gradually increases to 1 volt: that's logical, as the capacitor gets charged via the first resistor. The voltage on the second capacitor also gradually increases to 1 volt, but slower: that makes sense, as it is charged from the first capacitor. And so on. At the right end of the cable, the voltage increases only very gradually, and this slow increases puts a limit on how quickly Morse code signs can be sent. However, Thomson's model is wrong. Heaviside's model Heaviside realised that the inductance of the cable is also important. See the next figure: here we have replaced Thomson's resistors by inductors, of 1 µH per meter of cable length. First have a look at the first set of graphs, marked as \"4 sections\". We see that the voltage on the first capacitor reaches the full 1 volt much earlier than in Thomson's model, and even overshoots. This is because once there is current flowing in an inductor, this current doesn't just stop when the voltage across the coil becomes lower. This faster increase of the voltage, and the fact that the current doesn't just stop, also causes the second capacitor to be charged earlier and faster than in Thomson's model, and so on. Of course, modelling a 4 km long cable in just 4 pieces is not very realistic. For a better model, we could e.g. model it using 10 times as many pieces, each 10 times shorter (i.e., 40 pieces of 100 m each), each with 10 times less capacitance and inductance. The result is shown in the second set of graphs. The third set of graphs is for a yet 10 times finer modelling of the cable. The graphs now show the voltage at every 10th and every 100th capacitor, respectively; i.e., still at distances of 1, 2, 3 and 4 km from the start of the cable, like in the first set of graphs. We see that with the more refined model, the voltages increase faster and the overshoot takes less long. The schematic with all those coils and capacitors resembles a low-pass filter, and indeed, we see that the voltages increase only gradually, hinting at the absence of high frequencies. When one partitions the model in ever smaller pieces, the inductances and capacitances become smaller and the filter's cut-off frequency becomes higher. If one mathematically takes the limit, eventually modelling the cable as consisting of infinitely many pieces, each having infinitely little inductance and capacitance, one gets an ever more accurate model. While doing so, the low-pass effect disappears, and the voltage jump from 0 to 1 volt is transmitted without distortion. Impedance Heaviside's model also helps us to understand what the \"impedance\" of a cable is. At the left, suddenly a voltage of 1 volt is applied to the cable. The capacitors are as yet uncharged, so there's 1 volt across the first inductor, causing a gradually increasing current to flow. How large will that current become? That depends on the inductance: the more inductance, the slower the current increases. And it also depends on the capacitance: the more capacitance, the more charge needs to be supplied to charge it to 1 volt. When the capacitor has been charged to 1 volt (ignoring the overshoot), there will be 0 volts across the inductor, so the current through it will no longer change. The current doesn't become 0, but remains constant, flows into the second inductor, charges the second capacitor, and so on. And what happens when also the last capacitor has been charged? As noted above, the current through those inductors cannot just stop. If we \"terminate\" the cable in a resistor, as shown in the figure, then the current will flow through the resistor and cause a voltage drop across it. If the resistor has exactly the right value, then that voltage drop is exactly 1 volt. Then we reach a stable state: all capacitors are charged to 1 volt, across the coils there's no voltage, and a constant current flows from the source through the cable and the termination resistor. If the termination resistor is too large, the voltage drop across it will be more than 1 volt, so the last capacitor will be charged to more than 1 volt. Via the last inductor a part of that charge will then flow back from the last to the second-to-last capacitor, from there to the third-last capacitor, and so on: we get a reflected wave. Something similar happens if the termination resistor is too small. The value of the termination resistor which does not cause a reflection, is called the impedance of the cable. It turns out that this equals L/C , where L and C are the inductance and capacitance per meter of cable length. Note that this formula matches what we already observed earlier: more L means less current and thus higher termination resistor needed to still drop 1 volt; similarly, more C means more current and thus lower termination resistor. Speed In the previous figure, we effectively saw a wave move from left to right through the cable; the farther from the source, the later the voltage change arrives. How fast does this wave move? That also depends on the values of L and C. The larger the inductance L, the slower the current increases (at given voltage), so the longer it takes to charge the next capacitor. And the larger C, the longer it takes (at given current) to charge the capacitance. Heaviside showed that the speed equals 1/LC. Does this mean that we can make a cable with any desired speed, simply by choosing L and C appropriately? Perhaps even faster than light? (Einstein already starts turning over in his grave.) No: it turns out that we have only limited freedom in choosing L and C. Changing the shape and size of the cable affects both L and C, and always such that the speed of light is never exceeded. As an example, consider a coaxial cable. If one makes the center conductor thinner, the capacitance between center conductor and shield decreases, so by the formula one would expect the speed to increase. Unfortunately, at the same time the inductance increases! That's (among others) because making the center conductor thinner causes the currents inside that center conductor to be closer together, and thus sense more of each other's magnetic field (which, after all, is what causes (self)-inductance). The figure shows, for a coaxial cable with air as isolation, the theorectical dependence of the capacitance and inductance (both per meter) on the ratio of the diameters of the center conductor and the shield. Furthermore, the resulting impedance and wave velocity are indicated. The solid lines are based on the assumption that the current spreads itself equally over the entire cross-section of the center conductor. We see that in this case the velocity increases when the center conductor is made thinner, but does not exceed the speed of light (300 × 106 m/s). At higher frequencies the skin-effect kicks in, forcing the current to only flow on the outside of the center conductor. That case is indicated with dotted lines, and the speed exactly equals the speed of light, regardless of the diameters. If we fill the cable with e.g. some plastic material, the capacitance increases while the inductance remains the same. Then the speed decreases; this is generally described as the \"velocity factor\" being less than 1. Loss and distortion So far, we haven't included loss in the model, but a real cable does have loss due to resistances, and Heaviside included this in his model, as sketched at the right. There are two kinds of loss. The first one is the resistance of the copper wire itself; to model this, Heaviside included a resistance of R ohms per meter in series with each inductance. The second one is the leakage of the capacitor's isolation, modelled as a parallel resistance 1/G. (We write this as 1/G because this resistance is inversely proportional to the length; the shorter the cable section, the less leakage, so the larger the leakage resistance. Thus G itself, being the inverse of the resistance, is again directly proportional to the length; it is expressed in Ω-1 per meter, also called Siemens per meter.) Heaviside showed that losses do not just attenuate the signal, but also cause distortion. In fact we already saw this in Thomson's model in the first figure: the sudden increase of the voltage at the input of the cable, is distorted to something that only rises slowsly, as it travels down the cable. However, Heaviside also found out that this distortion disappears if the following condition is satisfied: L/R = C/G. If there is no loss, then R and G are both 0, so the condition is satisfied. But a realistic cable usually has L/R much smaller than C/G, because G, the leakage of the isolation, is almost zero (good isolation material), and particularly in submarine cables, the capacitance is rather high. In principle, we can improve such a cable in four ways to satisfy the condition: decrease R: use thicker copper wire, that's expensive. decrease C, i.e., increase the distance between the wires: that may be feasible on telegraph poles on land, but making a coaxial submarine cable thicker is hard (expensive). increase G, so use a not-so-good isolation material: this is what happens when water seeps into a sea-cable (recall that Heaviside as a telegraph operator had already noticed that then the distortion is reduced), but the obvious disadvantage is that the signals become weaker. what remains: increase L. Indeed, special cables have been manufactured in which the center conductor has extra inductance, by covering it in a suitable magnetic material. But the most commonly used way to increase L, is by connecting a coil in series every couple of kilometers. Heaviside invented this idea, but William Preece, the British telegraph service's engineer-in-chief didn't believe it, and in fact thought that one should avoid inductance. As a consequence, the technique initially was not tried in England (and this was not the only conflict between Heaviside and Preece [1]). But Michael Pupin patented the idea a few years later in America. It turned out to work very well and has been used for decades in the telephone industry, until it became possible to amplify signals electronically. And radio amateurs have, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s, used such Pupin coils for making audio filters. The picture shows a typical Pupin coil. It had two windings, with red and green wires, for both wires of the telephone line. Separately the windings usually were 22 mH, in series 88 mH. Should we now also insert coils into our antenna cables to prevent distortion of our radio signals? No: firstly the distortion is negligible for relatively narrow-band signals; and secondly, such coils would work as a low-pass filter, so our (high) frequencies wouldn't get through anymore.

William Henry Preece was Engineer-In-Chief at the British Post Office in the late 19th Century (basically heading their telegraphy efforts) and controversially stuck to Thomson's model, or the \"KR Law\" as it was called back then, relying on poor quality experimental results to direct the organization. Oliver Heaviside publicly criticized Preece, who in turn blocked publication of Heaviside's writing to preserve his own reputation (according to Wikipedia). When Preece retired in 1899 and received a knighthood, Heaviside wrote in the preface of Volume II of \"Electromagnetic Theory\": \"It is to be hoped and expected that the late important removals in the British Telegraph Department will lead to much improvement in the quality of official science.\" Writing by hand on his own copy, Heaviside suggested that the preface (and thus the book's publication) were \"held back\" so as to \"allow W H Preece to make sure of his knighthood\". https://outsideecho.com/DGT-BIO_files/PDFs/DGT13.pdf So! On the one hand, we have an esteemed engineer who ran the country's telegraphs and refused to admit he made a mistake, became a knight and faded somewhat from history; on the other hand, we have a self-taught physicist who made massive contributions to our understanding and analysis of electromagnetism, lived in \"relative poverty\" for fifty years while doing so, didn't shy away from calling out bad science, and he gets the analogue of heaven named after him in the musical \"CATS\". reply brunohaid 4 hours agoparentNot a religious person, but there's something deeply spiritual about Katalin Karikó type characters, who throughout the ages stuck with their curiosities and craft for the craft's sake. reply brunohaid 5 hours agoprevExcellent post! Controlled impedance took me a long time to wrap my head around when starting PCB design, the moment when it finally clicked was watching this excellent AlphaPhoenix video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AXv49dDQJw& asking and practically demonstrating the simple question: When you flip on a switch, to turn on anything, send data, morse something etc, how does the circuit know how much current the load at the other end needs? Spoiler: Given that information can't travel faster than light, the simple answer is: it doesn't. So it just guesses and adjusts, which you don't want as it gives you exactly the ringing etc Heaviside identified. The video is a nice complement, as it perfectly visualizes the issues at play. It's a pretty wild bit of understanding to have, even in simple situations like flipping on a light switch. reply nyrikki 1 hour agoparentThat video is good for the water like wave explanation that is a very useful lens. If you want a more in-depth explanation, particularly how the field is in the dielectric and the wires/traces are simply the wave guide, this long presentation by Rick Hartley will help move to the next level. https://www.youtube.com/live/ySuUZEjARPY The dramatic shift in behavior above the audio frequency range is where the water wave lens starts to fall down IMHO. I was looking at my brothers memory card from a Cray 1a the other day and that video popped in my head. They had the timing traces snaking through several flat-pack chips legs. No wonder they had to move from parity to Hamming code even with exclusively using differential twisted pairs between modules. reply brunohaid 1 hour agorootparentThat one‘s gold too, but for me it was the other way round needed Hartley to fully grasp Alpha Phoenix. Understanding waves feels a bit like the bell curve meme for me: you start with the mental water model, and eventually end up with it again. Or Feynman: you hear him helpfully talk about bouncy rubber balls, then learn a bunch of stuff over the next decade, and randomly listen to the same lecture again, and suddenly all sorts of „aaaah, that’s what he meant“ lightbulbs go off. reply elteto 5 minutes agorootparentWatching the Alpha Phoenix video I had a sort of realization that waves (as phenomena in general) are basically nature’s calculator/probes. If nature doesn’t “know” what will happen there’s probably some wave involved to figure it out. reply nyrikki 57 minutes agorootparentprevI should also clarify something above, Oliver Heaviside did discover the energy flows through the dielectric, most explanations like that video use other lenses to communicate the very real need to consider voltage and current. The original link side stepped that as to be honest it is to complicated for the intended use case. All models are wrong, some are useful, and the water wave model is very useful for very real needs. I personally wasted a lot of time confusing the map for the territory, but yes everyones path will be different. I confused the \"electron flow\" and water wave model as being absolute ground truth for way longer than I would like to admit. reply thijson 4 hours agoparentprevI remember reading about the first cable that was laid across the Atlantic. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_telegraph_cable They didn't know much about transmission line theory, and even burned out the cable at one point.

Must pay him a visit at some point. reply phreeza 5 hours agoprevThis exact theory is also used to model the electrical behavior of neurons in the brain, with some slight differences (no inductances, non-linear resistances), under the name \"cable theory\" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_theory I remember one professor mentioning the origin of this theory in undersea cable modeling at some point. reply brunohaid 5 hours agoparentTried skimming the page but couldn't find the answer: do we know if the neural connection impedance is perfectly matched? It looks quite organic in shape, with teardrop connections and so on, but curious how nature did that job? reply mannykannot 4 hours agorootparentThat's an interesting question. One follow-up question I would have is whether impedance matching is a relevant concept here, given that the model has no inductance (I'm guessing that's because the flow of charge is in the form of ions moving radially through the membrane. If neurons were more like transmission lines, would we be susceptible to interference from distant lightning?) I also skimmed the page and saw that equation 20 is not a wave equation (as the article says, it is a diffusion equation.) Again, I am not sufficiently knowledgeable to say whether that renders the question of impedance matching moot. Update: I see from the sibling thread and its excellent reference that the refractory period, where the sodium and potassium ions are being pumped back to their starting positions, suppresses reflection. reply brunohaid 3 hours agorootparentSibling thread? reply mannykannot 2 hours agorootparentSorry if that's not clear I was referring to phreeza's reply to your question and the link you had posted below it, which is as far as the discussion had gone at that time.

Maybe the impedance added some colorful garnish to your memory... :-) reply amelius 3 hours agoparentprevThis looks different, as there is a completely resistive path from source to destination, which is not the case for transmission lines (as that would mean an instantaneous response which isn't possible due to the speed of light limit). reply phreeza 2 hours agorootparentI think it's just a matter of scale, technically there is an inductance but the distances are so small and frequencies so low that they never really matter. reply amelius 2 hours agorootparentYes, but then it is not a transmission line. reply CamperBob2 2 hours agorootparentprevThey're modeling delay with capacitance to 'ground', it seems. So there's capacitive reactance. reply amelius 1 hour agorootparentBut that's not a complete model, as the output will start changing the moment the input changes. And a short burst will not appear so on the output. reply myth2018 4 hours agoprevThank you very much for sharing this. I've been trying to form a mental model of why reflection in transmission lines is a thing and never found a theoretical foundation that satisfied me. I've read a number of publications that just state that as fact, without further explanation. I'll spend some time sketching my own graphs and formulas to fully absorb the fine article. PS: he discusses the impossibility of moving signals faster than light. I'm in fact interested in moving them way slower than they do, since that could make it possible to build very short antennas. I'm surely not the first to think of this. Maybe that's not even possible and that theoretical model could help to demonstrate why (even though it applies to transmission lines while I'm concerned about antennas). reply basementcat 4 hours agoparentFor me, an optics analogy appealed to my intuition. A transmission line is analogous to a periodic crystalline material, perhaps a form of quartz. Impedance is analogous to index of refraction; if two materials of differing index of refraction are juxtaposed, some of the light will reflect back. If the indices of refraction match (\"impedance match\") then there is no reflection and maximum energy transfer takes place. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_index reply myth2018 32 minutes agorootparentThanks. I found experiments like this [0] helpful to visualize reflections and standing waves, but, like a sibling comment said, although these are similar phenomena and show what happens with the energy inside the wire, I couldn't see why these effects manifested at the electrical level.

I’ve dabbled in digital electronics and never managed to form an intuitive understanding on ‘impedance’ in signal wires despite reading quite a few ‘basics’ texts about it. I’d ended up accepting that I wouldn’t really understand its basis without learning a lot more about analog electronics, but this explanation really worked for me. reply immibis 3 hours agoparentprevIt's the general theory of waves: whenever some value exists on a continuum, has a position and a velocity at each point, and the acceleration (change in velocity) brings each point towards the average of its neighbours. When someone waves a skipping rope at one end, they directly move the portion of the rope closest to them, which pulls on the portion next to it, which pulls on the portion next to it, and so on. Some wave-shapes happen to be are sustainable enough to travel along the whole rope with low distortion. (Like when you draw random pixels in Conway's Game of Life and run it, you usually end up with lots of gliders and a few spaceships travelling off in various directions, because those happen to be the simplest travelling patterns and the rest of your scribble died out or turned into things that don't travel. There aren't any non-travelling wave shapes.) In a rope, the usual wave packet is like a hump, and if the rope is infinitely long, the wave packet can travel forever, as sections at the front of the wave get raised up by the hump just behind them, and sections the hump passed through get pulled down by the rope in its default position behind them. If you now imagine the rope is cut in half and one end is tied to a wall, when the wave gets to this wall, the bit that is tied to the wall does NOT rise up because it's tied to the wall, so the bit just behind it gets pulled down more than it would be in an infinite rope, and after running the simulation for a short time, the net effect is that the back part of the wave doesn't just get pulled down to its equilibrium position like it would if the rope was infinite, but gets pulled down twice that, forming a negative copy of the original wave. And you can have in-between values, where some section of the rope is harder but not impossible to move, which causes the back part of the wave to be pulled down more than usual, but not twice as much, forming a smaller inverse copy, and the part that is harder to move is pulled up, but less than usual, forming a smaller non-inverse copy. You can also go the other way, and have a section of the rope that's easier to move than usual (or infinitely easy i.e. an open end), and when the wave gets to this point, the back part of the wave doesn't get pulled down as much as it normally would, leaving it still in the shape of the wave, i.e. a smaller non-inverse copy, instead of returning it fully to equilibrium. And if you can visualize this with ropes it works similarly for electricity just replace position by voltage and velocity by current or any other imaginable system where each piece of a continuum has a second derivative that tries to bring its value back to the average value of its neighbors. reply myth2018 27 minutes agorootparentThose are interesting insights, thanks for the extensive reply reply parsimo2010 6 hours agoprev [–] A very interesting explanation with history and math combined!
