If Netanyahu and Gallant really think they are innocent, and the allegations are absurd and false, they should cooperate with the ICC. Have your day in court and show how absurd the accusations are.

Without this protection, their sovereignty would quickly be at risk. reply mmastrac 2 hours agorootparentprevAs a follow-up to [2], even more interesting is the text of covered persons: \"military personnel, elected or appointed officials, and other persons employed by or working on behalf of the government of a NATO member country, a major non-NATO ally including Australia, Egypt, Israel, Japan, Argentina, the Republic of Korea, and New Zealand\" reply buckle8017 1 hour agorootparentThat's not the list of covered persons. The act bars military aid to any country that is a signatory to the court, except those countries. reply seabass-labrax 2 hours agorootparentprevIsrael don't recognize the authority of the International Criminal Court. Palestine, however, does, and therefore the ICC consider these allegations within their jurisdiction. A relevant point is that the UK (under the previous Conservative party government) requested the opportunity to dispute the allegations of war crimes based on this complication, but the new British government did not choose to continue with the objection. No other countries have made objections. reply bawolff 1 hour agorootparentThe challenge wasn't based on exactly that, they were trying to argue that a treaty palestine signed with israel precluded palestine from giving icc juridsiction that it didn't have itself. That said, if it ever gets to trial, the defendants will almost certainly try to challenge it on that basis. Realistically though i think the chance of that type of challenge succeding is unlikely. International courts generally are above domestic law.

The real tests will begin if, for instance, Netanyahu visits Germany, because that will trigger an obligation for Germany to arrest him. There may of course already be domestic German laws which arms sales to Israel may be breaking, but as far as I'm aware Germany has only had a duty to cooperate with the ICC since the warrant was issued earlier today. reply usaar333 1 hour agorootparentprevNeither Israel nor the de-facto government of Gaza they are fighting ever accepted the authority of the ICC; neither has signed the Rome Treaty.

The claim is from a report published a few days ago called 'South Africa, Hamas, Iran, and Qatar: The Hijacking of the ANC and the International Court of Justice': https://isgap.org/follow-the-money/ Its author, the Institute for the Study of Global Antisemitism and Policy, is ostensibly American, although I can find no indication of its incorporation in the USA.

Either 40,000+ people dead or seemingly nearly all Palestinian's civilian infrastructure being destroyed, both warrant being witnessed and investigated by the international community with a fine tooth comb, no? The ICC isn't some amateur city court in some backwaters country, it is the current epitome and evolutionary state from effort and passion of humanity towards holding the line for justice. reply nimbius 10 minutes agorootparentprevpolitical is..sorta true. the point of these international legal bodies was to maintain and enforce a world order dominated by western powers. it was not about promoting justice (albeit sometimes that happened.) the selective application of enforcement and investigation have reduced the ICC to little more than a tool of neocolonial rule. the rome statute itself contains provisions that limit its reach. article 98 precludes extradition, which has been abused by the US to prevent US nationals from being tried. in short the ICC is allowed to go after western geopolitical rivals, however going after an ally whos committing genocide is a bridge too far; they will be shielded. for example: the US pressured its allies to refuse to refer any activities in Afghanistan to the ICC and largely succeeded as its allies form the dominant half of the UN Security council. whats interesting here is the US seems so isolated this time as to have lost the ability to block the referral. perhaps a first in history. reply stanfordkid 19 minutes agorootparentprevThere is indeed, as you state, political influence being exerted on courts. Most of that influence is in support of Israel and Netanyahu — do you really think there is significant political power and influence upon the ICC from Palestine or Hamas? Look at the amount AIPAC has contributed to pro-Israel politicians. It’s quite frankly absurd such a political organization exists under the guise of representing American Jews yet pretty much lobbies solely for Israeli geopolitical issues. Kennedy even tried to get it to register as a foreign agent.

Netanyahu's strategy has been particularly clever, pushing the US to overthrow Middle Eastern governments that oppose Israeli policies, as seen with Iraq, Syria, and Libya. Through campaign financing, Israel has basically bought out Congress for surprisingly little money, ensuring the US consistently backs them internationally - like vetoing UN resolutions that favor Palestinians. This US shield is so strong that when the UN voted on Palestinian self-determination, only the US, Israel, and a couple other countries opposed it. Even when Biden sets boundaries for Israeli actions, they just ignore them without consequences.

Read Later Laurence Geai for Quanta Magazine Introduction By Kelsey Houston-Edwards Contributing Writer November 18, 2024 View PDF/Print Mode education mathematics Q&A All topics (opens a new tab) David Bessis was drawn to mathematics for the same reason that many people are driven away: He didn’t understand how it worked. Unlike other creative processes, like making music, which can be heard, or painting pictures, which can be seen, math is for the most part an internal process, hidden from view. “It sounded a bit magical. I was intrigued,” he said. His curiosity eventually led him to pursue a doctoral degree in math at Paris Diderot University in the late 1990s. He spent the next decade studying geometric group theory before leaving research mathematics and founding a machine learning startup in 2010. Through it all, he never stopped questioning what it actually means to do math. Bessis wasn’t content to simply solve problems. He wanted to further interrogate — and help other people understand — how mathematicians think about and practice their craft. In 2022, he published his answer — a book titled Mathematica: A Secret World of Intuition and Curiosity, which he hopes will “explain what’s going on inside the brain of someone who’s doing math,” he said. But more than that, he added, “this is a book about the inner experience of humans.” It was translated from the original French into English earlier this year. In Mathematica, Bessis makes the provocative claim that whether you realize it or not, you’re constantly doing math — and that you’re capable of expanding your mathematical abilities far beyond what you think possible. Eminent mathematicians like Bill Thurston and Alexander Grothendieck didn’t owe their mathematical prowess to intrinsic genius, Bessis argues. Rather, they became such powerful mathematicians because they were willing to constantly question and refine their intuitions. They developed new ideas and then used logic and language to test and improve them. According to Bessis, however, the way math is taught in school emphasizes the logic-based part of this process, when the more important element is intuition. Math should be thought of as a dialogue between the two: between reason and instinct, between language and abstraction. It’s also a physical practice of sorts, like yoga or martial arts — something that can be improved through training. It requires tapping into a childlike state and embracing one’s imagination, including the mistakes that come with it. Share this article Copied!

Laurence Geai for Quanta Magazine Everyone, Bessis says, has some experience with this process, meaning that everyone has practice thinking like a mathematician. Moreover, everyone can, and should, try to improve their mathematical thinking — not necessarily to solve math problems, but as a general self-help technique. Quanta spoke with Bessis about what mathematicians are really doing when they’re “doing math,” and what it means for math to be a form of self-help. The interview has been condensed and edited for clarity. Why did you write this book? For maybe 20 years, I tried and failed to write it many, many times. Then in 2020, I reread texts that I had read a long time ago — accounts by the mathematicians René Descartes, Alexander Grothendieck and William Thurston. I realized that these three people, who were not connected to one another, were all telling the same story in different ways. That story resonated with what I had been living. After that realization, the book completely crystallized in a matter of weeks. What we can learn from Descartes, Grothendieck and Thurston is that the nature of the mathematical process is not what people think. At its core, Bessis says, mathematics is a game of back-and-forth between intuition and logic, instinct and reason. Laurence Geai for Quanta Magazine What do people think? That math is a bunch of cryptic symbols on a piece of paper. This is what has been advertised as mathematics for millennia, because that’s what people see. But the whole journey — how you work with things in your mind, how math transforms you — is all secret. It’s not part of the curriculum. Math is a sort of dialogue between these external and internal processes. It is the activity of aligning your inner representation — your intuition — with some logical, external representation. You use a very rigid, crazy-looking formalism to test your intuition, to recalibrate, grow and reinforce it until you feel that you have a good understanding of something. You claim that everyone is secretly doing math, even if they don’t realize it. You have to force them to become aware of their own mathematical training. Can you see a circle in your mind? Can you make it bigger, smaller? Can you move it around? That’s weird, you know. “High school students are often unhappy with math, because they think it requires some innate things that they don’t have,” Bessis said. “But that’s not true; really it relies on the same type of intuition we use every day.” Laurence Geai for Quanta Magazine Or say I ask, “What’s a billion minus one?” I’ve never met anyone who doesn’t immediately have the answer in their head. I have to think about it when I want to say it out loud, but I see it in my mind. And I think most people are like that. Even if they don’t see it — it’s not a visual perception — they have a strong feeling of the outcome. This is really mathematical intuition. It’s obvious to people. But it’s also historical: 2,000 years ago, nobody would have been able to easily answer this question, because they were using Roman numerals. It proves that what you view as very easy math is actually deep math that you’ve internalized. You learned a very abstract numbering system that transformed your intuition of numbers. It makes you find things completely obvious that 2,000 years ago would have made you look like Einstein. It’s not hardwired. You wired it yourself. Do you believe in the notion of a mathematical genius, then? It would be dishonest to deny that there are people who are incredibly good at math. There are 5-year-olds who are already genius mathematicians. You can see it: It looks like they’re communicating with aliens from outer space. But I do not think this is innate, even though it often manifests in early childhood. Genius is not an essence. It’s a state. It’s a state that you build by doing a certain job. Math is a journey. It’s about plasticity. I am not saying that math is easy. Math is hard. But life, whatever you do, is extremely hard. Bessis is inspired by the practices of mathematical greats like Bill Thurston, Alexander Grothendieck and René Descartes. Laurence Geai for Quanta Magazine If it’s not innate, but rather a process, does that mean that with practice I could eventually do math like Thurston? No, not Thurston. I don’t think so. But maybe you’ll surprise me. Thurston gave a detailed account of how he decided at a young age to practice this kind of self-education every day. I don’t think you can catch up with that. Grothendieck and Descartes probably started very young, before they were even speaking. The point I want to make is that high school students are often unhappy with math, because they think it requires some innate things that they don’t have. But that’s not true; really it relies on the same type of intuition we use every day. So how can one get better at math? Whenever you spot a disconnect between what your gut is telling you and what is supposed to be rational, it’s an important opportunity to understand something new. And then you can start this game of back-and-forth. Can you articulate your gut instinct and place it within a rational discussion? If there’s still a disconnect, can you visualize why? As you play that game, your imagination will gradually reconfigure. And in the end, if you’re persistent, your instinct and your reason will align, and you will be smarter. This is mathematical thinking. What can someone gain by improving their mathematical thinking? Joy, clarity and self-confidence. Children do this all the time. That’s why they learn so fast. They have to. Otherwise, I mean, nothing makes sense. I think this is also why babies are super happy — because they have epiphanies all day long. It’s wonderful. “When you do math, you’re exposed to the human thought process in a way that is really pure,” Bessis said. “It’s not just about understanding things, but about understanding things in a very childish, deep, naïve, super clear, obvious way.” Laurence Geai for Quanta Magazine For adults, this way of thinking can be very slow. But if you don’t give up, what you can do with your intuition is way beyond your wildest expectations. And this is universal. My book is a life lesson for all creative people, not just those who want to learn mathematical concepts. The mathematician’s message is for everyone: Look at what you can do if you don’t give up on your intuition. Do you view this as a self-help book? I’m actually more extreme than just saying this is a self-help book. I’m saying that, in a way, mathematics itself is a self-help technique. How so? Mathematicians have to be radically honest about what they don’t understand and what they think. That might help them see, for example, that an object is defined the wrong way. Or that a different definition will make a theory simpler. Or that this is not the important notion, that one is. Related: Why Math Is the Best Way to Make Sense of the World Perplexing the Web, One Probability Puzzle at a Time A Wormhole Between Physics and Education There’s something about honesty, about being radically candid, about trying to find ways to articulate what you really feel — it’s super hard. It takes practice. When you do math, you’re exposed to the human thought process in a way that is really pure. It’s not just about understanding things, but about understanding things in a very childish, deep, naïve, super clear, obvious way. It’s very good training for creativity. It’s a scaffold for your imagination. When I look at my own life, and the way I managed to overcome personal challenges, I realize that my ability to think in a mathematical way helped. From an emotional standpoint, we all need math.

The title of this post doesn't do it justice. He shows that math skill is almost more like a sports talent than it is knowledge talent. He claims this based on the way people have to learn how to manipulate different math objects in their heads, whether treating them as rotated shapes, slot machines, or origami.

Is mathacademy good? I have been thinking of giving it a month of a try. You say \"stressful\", which I'm not sure is a mis-type or not. I ordered Mathematica at my local library by the way, and can now forget about it until I get an SMS one day informing me of its arrival. Thank you for confirming that it's worth it! reply Shosty123 1 hour agorootparentI've had a MathAcademy subscription for some time and it's quite good. I'd say it's best at generating problems and using spaced repetition to reinforce learning, but I think it falls short in explaining why something is useful or applicable. I don't know, most math education seems to be \"here's an equation and this is how you solve it\" and MathAcademy is undoubtedly the best at that, but I wish there were resources that were more like \"here's how we discovered this, what we used to do before, why it's useful, and here's some scenarios where you'd use it.\" reply Nevermark 1 hour agorootparentI have so wanted such resources for years. I have found some and should make a list. The first time the difference between understanding some math, and understanding what the math meant, was after high school Trig. The moment I started manually programming graphics from scratch, the circle as a series of dots, trigonometry transformed in my mind. I can't even say what the difference was - the math was exactly the same - but some larger area of my brain suddenly connected with all the concepts I had already learned. While ordering the \"Mathematica: A Secret World of Intuition and Curiosity\" I came across these books, which looked very promising in the \"learning formal math by expanding intuition\" theme, so I bought them too: Field Theory For The Non-Physicist, by Ville Hirvonen [0] Lagrangian Mechanics For The Non-Physicist, by Ville Hirvonen [1] The Gravity of Math: How Geometry Rules the Universe, by Steve Nadis, Shing-Tung Yau [2] Vector: A Surprising Story of Space, Time, and Mathematical Transformation, by Robyn Arianrhod [3] [0] https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CN7HMTJN [1] https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CN7HMK38 [2] https://www.amazon.com/dp/1541604296 [3] https://www.amazon.com/dp/0226821102 Excited to read each (based on their synopses & ratings), and if I will get compounding fluency across both math and physics between all five books. reply Shosty123 46 minutes agorootparentBurn Math Class follows that tradition, although it starts pretty basic, so it requires some patience. https://a.co/d/fZnWUU8 reply gravypod 1 hour agoparentprevI really want to try MathAcademy.com.

I think our obsession with innate mathematical skill and genius is so detrimental to the growth mindset that you need to have in order to learn things. I've been working a lot on my math skills lately (as an adult). A mindset I've had in the past is that \"if it's hard, then that means you've hit your ceiling and you're wasting your time.\" But really, the opposite is true. If it's easy, then it means you already know this material, and you're wasting your time. reply junto 12 hours agoparent> I agree with the sentiment of this. I think our obsession with innate ~~mathematical~~ skill and genius is so detrimental to the growth mindset that you need to have in order to learn things. I strongly believe that the average human being can be exceptional in any niche topic given enough time, dedication and focus. The author of the book has picked out mathematics because that was what he was interested in. The reality is that this rule applies to everything. The belief that some people have an innate skill that they are born with is deeply unhelpful. Whilst some people (mostly spectrum) do seem have an innate talent, I would argue that it is more an inbuilt ability to hyper focus on a topic, whether that topic be mathematics, Star Trek, dinosaurs or legacy console games from the 1980’s. I think we do our children a disservice by convincing them that some of their peers are just “born with it”, because it discourages them from continuing to try. What we should be teaching children is HOW to learn. At the moment it’s a by-product of learning about some topic. If we look at the old adage “feed a man a fish”, the same is true of learning. “Teach someone mathematics and they will learn mathematics. Teach someone to learn and they will learn anything”. reply diffeomorphism 11 hours agorootparentCaveat here is that \"talent\" and \"dedication\" is linked to speed at least in the beginning. For instance, any student can learn calculus given enough time and advice even starting from scratch. However, the syllabus wants all this to happen in one semester. This gives you vicious and virtuous cycles: Students' learning speed increases with time and past success. So \"talented\" students learn quickly and have extra time to further explore and improve, leading to further success. Students who struggle with the time constraint are forced to take shortcuts like memorizing \"magic formulas\" without having time to really understand. Trying to close that gap is very hard work. reply drbig 10 hours agorootparentThank you for the insight that academic (in a very broad sense) bulk-fixed-time approach does in fact produce both of the cycles, and the gap indeed only widens with time (speaking from personal experience, especially from my life as an undergrad student). Reminds me of my personal peeve that \"studying\" should not be \"being taught\", studying is pursuit of understanding, \"being taught\" is what happens in primary school (and I'm aware I'm simplifying here). reply blackbear_ 8 hours agorootparentI would say that you could generalize this even further outside of education. A few early successes in life can greatly accelerate one's trajectory, while early failures could set one many years back. And this happens independently of whether those events are due to skill or luck. reply jvanderbot 6 hours agorootparentprevIndeed, speed is often read as \"smarts\" whereas I would maintain it's much more often \"preparation\". We can't on one hand believe in the plasticity and retrainability of the mind, while simultaneously believing that speed is something only a few are born with. On the nature/nurture scale, I think it's 20/80 or so - but prodigies and geniuses have an interest that keeps them thinking and learning 10x or 100x more than other kids, and a little bump that lets them get started easier and therefore much earlier. This sets them up for fantastic success very quickly. [1] shows a great example of this. I'm fond of saying \"You can do anything you want, but wanting is the hard part\", because to truly be a grandmaster, genius-level mathematician, olympic athlete, etc, requires a dedication and amount of preparation that almost nobody can manage. Starting late, with emotional baggage, kids, and having to spend 5 years relearning how to learn? Forget it. 1. https://danielkarim.com/how-to-become-a-genius-the-polgar-ex... reply stonemetal12 2 hours agorootparentBobby Fisher won his first US Championships at 14 against people who had been playing chess longer than he had been alive. Suggesting they didn't want it more, or practice more than some kid is silly. \"We can't on one hand believe in the plasticity and retrainability of the mind, while simultaneously believing that speed is something only a few are born with.\" Sure we can, the initial orientation of neurons differs between people, so some people need less \"plasticity and retrainability\" to be good at a task. Plasticity is physical characteristic like height and varies between people. Initial speed usually isn't that important, but speed of learning is important and makes the difference between possible and impossible within a human lifetime. reply hilbert42 1 hour agorootparent\"Initial speed usually isn't that important, but speed of learning is important and makes the difference between possible and impossible within a human lifetime.\" Likely so, but is suggest that personality, drive and motivation are also very important factors. I know from experience that stuff I had little interest in as a youngster and that I've still little in I still know little about. Yes, my interests have grown and broadened over the years but simply I regard some stuff so irrelevant to my life that it's not worth a second thought and I am much better off applying my limited number of neurons to matters of greater importance and enjoyment. Of course, no one has the luxury of just learning about what one finds interesting and or enjoyable, life's knocks and experiences along with utilitarian-like imperatives force one to learn stuff they'd rather not know about. reply jvanderbot 2 hours agorootparentprevI think there's a probabalistic argument I'm making that's more in line with the article. Yes - there will be 10x-ers. And that group will have a 10x-er iside it, and so on given exponential dropoff of frequency of talent. Bobby Fisher is a few std dev above even the best, perhaps. Generally speaking, \"You can do anything you want, but wanting (enough, and naturally) is the hardest part\" might need a three standard deviation limit. Have you heard the phrase: Being average among those who practice makes you 9X% among the population? I think that's what I'm saying - you can be a top performer if you dedicate yourself, especially early enough, but almost nobody will. reply matwood 2 hours agorootparentI agree with you. I don’t think I’m naturally gifted at much (I’m just average), but I was taught stubborn hard work pretty early on. Unfortunately it took me until my 20s to figure out I could be athletic if I applied that hard work. I could also be good at programming doing the same. I’ve met people who are truly gifted and it’s amazing, but I’m pretty decent at the things I worked hard at. reply NoMoreNicksLeft 3 hours agorootparentprev> I'm fond of saying \"You can do anything you want, but wanting is the hard part\", because to truly be a grandmaster, genius-level mathematician, olympic athlete, etc, requires a dedication and I was having a problem agreeing with this subthread, and I have you to thank for putting it into words that I can finally formulate my disagreement against. Have you never met one of those people for whom they did not need to \"want\"? They could literally phone it in and still do better than anyone else, no matter how dedicated they were. Even should practice/study be necessary for them, they benefited from it to some absurd proportion that I couldn't even guess to quantify. I've known more than one of these people. I think most believe they don't exist for two reasons. The first is the ridiculous number of television shows and movies that depict motivation as being the key to success. We're just inundated with the (unsupported by evidence) that this is the means to extraordinary genius. Second, I would say that this is the most comforting theory. \"Why yes, I could have been a gifted whatever or a talented something-or-other if I had put the time in, but I chose this other thing instead.\" Maybe some would say we all need to believe this, that a society that doesn't believe in it is harsher or more unkind. reply jvanderbot 3 hours agorootparentI think I have met those folks. Maybe not. And you're welcome! They're just quick. But the ones I've met, at least, are quick to make associations. When I really dig and ask them to explain themselves or a concept, they usually make analogies to things they know, but I don't. Then I have to go learn that thing. Then they try the analogy again, but I haven't fully learned it from years of making analogies about it. Years of grad school experience was painful like this, until I got to a point 10 years after grad school, after a PhD, and well into research, that I \"just got\" things (in my subfield) as well. It's these experiences that made me feel that it's 80% preparation and perspiration (both of which are dominated by time), and 20% \"other\" mythology. Don't get me wrong, that 20% is what makes a 2 year old read earlier than others, and getting started reading at 2 (and continuing it!) for 4 years before starting school will make you light years ahead of your peers. The same goes for chess, math, etc etc. There is something legendary about Oppenheimer learning enough dutch in 6 weeks to deliver a lecture. Or perhaps learning to translate his lecture and memorizing it. Who knows. Do we really believe there's a magical \"genius\" such that they can do anything? No, so what are the limits to their genius? The limits are defined by what they are a genius at. This is a tautological definition. I'm not saying \"Anyone at any time can become a genius at anything\". I'm saying \"If you take a kid, start early, and cultivate them just right so that you have time to realize compounding effects, - you can let them grow into basically anything\" (probablistically speaking - there are learning disabilities and physical issues etc). reply StefanBatory 1 hour agorootparentprev> I think most believe they don't exist for two reasons.

The general factor of intelligence, which is measured through various somewhat lossy proxies like IQ tests, is exactly the degree to which someone exceeds expectation on all cognitive tasks (or vice versa). The interesting finding is that this universal correlation is strong, real, and durable. Of course people in general have cognitive domains where they function better or worse than their g factor indicates, and that's before we get into the fact that intellectual task performance is strongly predicated on knowledge and practice, which is difficult to control for outside of tests designed (successfully, I must add) to do so. reply nradov 2 hours agorootparentprevMost NBA players are under 2 meters tall.

Because it turns out that, in the NBA, height does not correspond with ability! This of course makes sense, because all the players are filtered by being NBA professional basketballers. A shorter player simply has more exceptional ability in another dimension, be that dodging reflex, ability to visualize and then hit a ball trajectory from the three point line, and so on. Conversely, a very tall player is inherently useful for blocking, and doesn't have to be as objectively good at basketball in order to be a valuable teammate. Despite this lack of correlation, when you look at an NBA team you see a bunch of very tall fellows indeed. Simpson's Paradox. We see the same thing in intellectual pursuits. \"I'm not nearly as smart as the smartest programmer I know, but I get promoted at work so I must be doing something right.

Besides which it makes no sense to say people are born with complex interests. I mean, OK, your genes might incline you a certain way, but that's not the same thing. Being interested in a subject is massively helpful to learning it. But interest arises circumstantially, it's an emotion.

Nonsense! The brain you are born with materially dictates the ceiling of your talent. A person with average ability can with dedication and focus over many years become reasonably good, but a genius can do the same in 1 year and at a young age.

If it's easy, then it means you already know this material, and you're wasting your time. It’s a well-established effect in pedagogics that learning vs. difficulty has a non-monotonic relationship, where you don’t learn efficiently if the material is either too hard or too easy compared to your current level. There is an optimum learning point somewhere in-between where the material is “challenging” – but neither “trivial” nor “insurmountable” – to put it that way. reply chipdart 11 hours agoparentprev> I agree with the sentiment of this. I think our obsession with innate mathematical skill and genius is so detrimental to the growth mindset that you need to have in order to learn things. I would argue something different. The \"skill\" angle is just thinly veiled ladder-pulling. Sure, math is hard work, and there's a degree of prerequisites that need to be met to have things click, but to the mindset embodied by the cliche \"X is left as an exercise for the reader\" is just people rejoicing on the idea they can needlessly make life hard for the reader for no reason at all. Everyone is familiar with the \"Ivory tower\" cliche, but what is not immediately obvious is how the tower aspect originates as a self-promotion and self-defense mechanism to sell the idea their particular role is critical and everyone who wishes to know something is obligated to go through them to reach their goals. This mindset trickles down from the top towards lower levels. And that's what ultimately makes math hard. Case in point: linear algebra. The bulk of the material on the topic has been around for many decades, and the bulk of the course material,l used to teach that stuff, from beginner to advanced levels, is extraordinarily cryptic and mostly indecipherable. But then machine learning field started to take off and suddenly we started to see content addressing even advanced topics like dimensionality reduction using all kinds of subspace decomposition methods as someting clear and trivial.

Even professional athletes spend a little bit of their time doing simple drills: shooting free throws, fielding fly balls, hitting easy groundstrokes.

It's just \"feel-good thinking.\" \"Everybody can do everything.\" Well, that's simply not true. I'm fairly sure you (yes, you in particular) can't run the 100m in less than 10s, no matter how hard you trained. And the biological underpinning of our capabilities doesn't magically stop at the brain-blood barrier. We all do have different brains. I've taught math to psychology students, and they just don't get it. I remember the frustration of the section's head when a student asked \"what's a square root?\" We all know how many of our fellow pupils struggled with maths. I'm not saying they all lacked the capability to learn it, but it can't be the case they all were capable but \"it was the teacher's fault\". Even then, how do you explain the difference between those who struggled and those who breezed through the material? Or let's try other topics, e.g. music. Conservatory students study quite hard, but some are better than others, and a select few really shine. \"Everyone is capable of playing Rachmaninov\"? I don't think so. So no, unless you've placed the bar for \"mathetical skill\" pretty low, or can show me proper evidence, I'm not going to believe it. \"Everyone is capable of...\" reeks of bullshit. reply nestes 6 hours agorootparentNot the original poster, but I want to push back on one thing -- being capable of something and being one of the best in the world at something are hugely different. Forgive me if I'm putting words in your math -- you mentioned \"placing the bar for mathematical skill pretty\" low but also mentioned running a sub-10s 100m. If, correspondingly, your notion of mathematical success is being Terence Tao, then I envy your ambition. I do broadly agree with your position that some people are going to excel where others fail. We know there trivially exist people with significant disabilities that will never excel in certain activities. What the variance is on \"other people\" (a crude distinction) I hesitate to say. And whatever the solution is, if there is even a solution, I'd at least like for the null hypothesis to be \"this is possible, we just may need to change our approach or put more time in\". On a slightly more philosophical note, I firmly believe that it is important to believe some things that are not necessarily true -- let's call this \"feel-good thinking\". If someone is truly putting significant dedicated effort in and not getting results, that is a tragedy. I would, however, greatly prefer that scenario to the one in which people are regularly told, \"well, you could just be stupid.\" That is a self-fulfilling prophecy. reply chipdart 5 hours agorootparentprev> cannot agree. It's just \"feel-good thinking.\" Not really. There's nothing inherently special about people who dedicated enough time to learn a subject. > \"Everybody can do everything.\" Well, that's simply not true. I'm fairly sure you (yes, you in particular) can't run the 100m in less than 10s, no matter how hard you trained. What a bad comparison.

And many millions have tried. There may be 200 people who can run it under 10s, but there are thousands that can run it under 11s, and hundreds of thousands that can run it under 12s. Unless you've got clear evidence that those people can actually run 100m in less than 10s if they simply try harder, I think the experience of practically every athlete is that they hit a performance wall. And it isn't different for maths, languages, music, sculpting (did you ever try that?), etc. Where there are geniuses, there also absolute blockheads. That's not to say that people won't perform better when they work harder, but the limits are just not the same for everyone. So 'capable of mathematical reasoning' either is some common denominator barely worth mentioning, or the statement simply isn't true. Clickbait, if you will. reply davidbessis 3 hours agorootparentI'm the author of what you've just described as clickbait. Interestingly, the 100m metaphor is extensively discussed in my book, where I explain why it should rather lead to the exact opposite of your conclusion. The situation with math isn't that there's a bunch of people who run under 10s. It's more like the best people run in 1 nanosecond, while the majority of the population never gets to the finish line. Highly-heritable polygenic traits like height follow a Gaussian distribution because this is what you get through linear expression of many random variations. There is no genetic pathway to Pareto-like distribution like what we see in math — they're always obtained through iterated stochastic draws where one capitalizes on past successes (Yule process). When I claim everyone is capable of doing math, I'm not making a naive egalitarian claim. As a pure mathematician who's been exposed to insane levels of math \"genius\" , I'm acutely aware of the breadth of the math talent gap. As explained in the interview, I don't think \"normal people\" can catch up with people like Grothendieck or Thurston, who started in early childhood. But I do think that the extreme talent of these \"geniuses\" is a testimonial to the gigantic margin of progression that lies in each of us. In other words: you'll never run in a nanosecond, but you can become 1000x better at math than you thought was your limit. There are actual techniques that career mathematicians know about. These techniques are hard to teach because they’re hard to communicate: it's all about adopting the right mental attitude, performing the right \"unseen actions\" in your head. I know this sounds like clickbait, but it's not. My book is a serious attempt to document the secret \"oral tradition\" of top mathematicians, what they all know and discuss behind closed doors. Feel free to dismiss my ideas with a shrug, but just be aware that they are fairly consensual among elite mathematicians. A good number of Abel prize winners & Fields medallists have read my book and found it important and accurate. It's been blurbed by Steve Strogatz and Terry Tao. In other words: the people who run the mathematical 100m in under a second don't think it's because of their genes. They may have a hard time putting words to it, but they all have a very clear memory of how they got there. reply llm_trw 5 hours agorootparentprevThere's a difference between being able to memorize what a square root is and being able to do math - which to mathematicians means being able to organize a proof. I've found that the people who most believe in math being a genetic ability are the ones who do not work in the symbolic world of modern math, but in the semantic world of whatever the field the math describes is. The two are rather different. reply Tainnor 3 hours agorootparentSquare roots are not some \"mathematical trivia\", they're amongst the most fundamental operations in mathematics. reply tgv 4 hours agorootparentprevStrangely enough, you'd be hard pressed to find a mathematician who doesn't know what a square root is.

You brought up the point of mathematicians not knowing what a square root is yourself. Anyway, the square root is is so many levels below maths as done by mathematicians, it's laughable. reply bloqs 4 hours agorootparentprevThis is mostly correct. Working memory plays a huge component in grokking more complicated mathematical components, and IQ itself is separated into performance and verbal IQ (which together constitute your IQ score) and its demonstrably robust. Some people find this easier than others and that is OK. I dont disagree with the premise that mathematical thinking can benefit anybody, but its absurd notion that everything abstract is teachable and learnable to all is a fantasy of a distinctly left-wing variety, who would have you believe that everything is just social conditioning and human beings dont differ from one-another. reply vacuity 3 hours agorootparentI think most people can become fairly skilled in useful fields if educated properly, and the people who can't are a small group that can be cared for. I agree that even in a better education system, people aren't all going to be equally skilled in the same fields, just that most people can contribute something of value. reply sourcepluck 3 hours agorootparentprevImagine our world was extremely similar to how it is now in any way you'd care to imagine, except two things were different. 1. Everyone (young, old, poor, rich) thinks that maths is interesting and fun and beautiful and important. Not important \"to get a good job\" or \"to go to a good college\" or \"to be an impressive person\", but rather important because it's fun and interesting. And maybe it also helps you think clearly and get a good job and all these practical things, but they're secondary to the tremendous beauty and wondrousness of the domain. 2. Everyone believes that barring actual brain injuries people can learn mathematics to a pretty high level. Not Ramanujan level, not Terrence Tao, not even a research mathematician at one of the smaller universities, but a level of extreme comfort, let's say a minimum level of being able to confidently ace the typical types of exams 17 and 18 year olds face to finish secondary school in various countries. Would you claim that in that world - people think maths is great, and that anyone can learn it - we'd see similar levels of ability and enjoyment of mathematics? My claim is that we don't live in \"Math-World\", as described above, but \"Anti-Math-World\". And further, that anyone suggesting things have to be the way they are in Anti-Math-World is not only wrong, but also fundamentally lacking imagination and courage. Kids are told week in week out that maths is stupid, that they are stupid, that their parents themselves are stupid, that the parents hated maths, that the teachers are stupid, and then when they end up doing poorly, people say: \"ahhh, some kids just aren't bright!\" Parents who like things like learning and maths and reading and so on, have kids that tend to like those things. And parents that don't, usually don't. Saying that this somehow tells us something concrete and inalterable about the nature of the human brain is preposterous.

If someone's smart enough to get into a psychology class they are smart enough to be thought basic undergrad math. It wasn't your teaching failure necessarily, but it was someone's teaching failure at some point. Not everyone can play Rachmaninov like Lugansky or do math like Terence Tao, but there is absolutely no doubt that almost all people are magnitudes away from their latent potential in almost all domains. I'm fairly certain you could teach any average person how to play Rachmaninov decently. You could bring any person to a reasonably high mathematical level. You can get any person to lift a few hundred pounds. Most people today read at a 7th grade level, can't do basic math, and are out of air after 3 flights of stairs. \"Everyone can do everything\" is maybe not literally right but directionally right given how utterly far removed we are from developing practically anyone's potential. reply antegamisou 2 hours agorootparentprev> Or let's try other topics, e.g. music. Conservatory students study quite hard, but some are better than others, and a select few really shine. \"Everyone is capable of playing Rachmaninov\"? I don't think so. Bad example, it's much more likely to create a musical prodigy by providing early and appropriate guidance. Of course this is not easy as it assumes already ideal teaching methods and adequate motivation to the youngling, but even those with some learning difficulties have the potential to excel. The subtypes of intellect required to play complex music and absord advanced abstract math subjects are quite different, former requiring strong short-term memory (sightreading) the latter fluid intelligence -I think almost everyone is familiar with these terms by now and knows that one can score high/low on certain subtypes of an IQ test affecting the total score-. BTW IDK if the Rachmaninoff choice was deliberate to imply that even the most capable who lack the hand size won't be able to perform his works well yeah, but there are like 1000s of others composers accessible that the audiences appreciate even more. Attempting to equate music with sports in such manner is heavily Americanized and therefore completely absurd. Tons of great pianists who didn't have the hand size to interpret his most majestic works and of others. Tons of others who could but never bothered. There have been winners of large competitions who barely played any of his works during all stages of audition or generally music requiring immense bodily advantage. Besides, it's almost 100% not a hand size issue when there are 5 year old kids playing La Campanella with remarkable fluidity. And even in this case this isn't even the point. Most conservatory alumni today are 100x skilled than the pianists of previous generations... yet they all sound the exact same, their playing lacks character/variability, deepness, elegance to the point where the composers ideas end up distorted. And those can be very skilled but just have poor understanding of the art, which is what music is, not the fast trills/runs, clean arpeggios, very strict metronomic pulse. > So no, unless you've placed the bar for \"mathetical skill\" pretty low, or can show me proper evidence, I'm not going to believe it. \"Everyone is capable of...\" reeks of bullshit. Well the vast majority of people in the Soviet Union were very math literate, regardless of what they ended up working as (although indeed most became engineers) and in quite advanced subjects. This is obviously a product of the extensive focus of primary and secondary education on the sciences back then. So the point isn't to make everyone have PhD level math background and I heavily dislike the dork undertones/culture that everyone should love doing abstract math on their freetime or have to have some mathematical temperament' .

Couldn't see the practicality until he got bit by a geology and water science bug. He went from calling me to get help figuring out percentages to doing chemistry equations in his head because he \"got\" the applicability. My brother's mom tutors math. One of her insights with a former student was that they were in need of forming some number sense. She started by walking them both out to the street: \"how many tires are there on this street of parked cars?\" The student, already flummoxed, started panic guessing. So she started with counting. For times tables, have you developed any intuition around it? For me, times tables are rectangles composed of unit squares and that helps with my intuition. Modern Common Core standards in the US focuses a lot on exposing different mental models to students. And after seeing the same 4x6 enough times your brain will automatically associate that with its solution. Instead of calculating, it is memorized. My brain doesn't require car tires, geology, or other practical needs: it likes puzzles. I struggle with medical stuff and I can feel my brain switching to meh-mode and hardly anything sticks.

There's no fractions there so it should be easier to visualize that your buddy got twice as much as you did. Comparing those two visualizations might make it easier to see that someone who gets 2/3 of a pint gets more than someone who gets 1/2 of a pint. reply nradov 2 hours agorootparentprevFamously the A&W restaurant chain failed when introducing a 1/3 lb hamburger because many customers thought it was smaller than a 1/4 lb hamburger. https://awrestaurants.com/blog/aw-third-pound-burger-fractio... reply willtemperley 4 hours agoparentprev> I think our obsession with innate mathematical skill and genius is so detrimental to the growth mindset that you need to have in order to learn things.

While it’s indisputable that terse symbolic formalisms have great utility, one can capture all the same information verbally. This is perhaps most evident in formal logic. It’s not hard to imagine a restricted formalized subset of natural language that is amenable to mechanical manipulation that is isomorphic to say modal logic. And finally, for logic at least, there is something of a third way.

Before high school, math is just a grind of memorization and unmotivated manipulation of numbers. Many students (ok, me, but I expect the same was true of others), get turned on to math for the first time when they encounter proofs in high school geometry and also actual applications in high school physics. It's a revelation to students that math can be a way to go from one truth to another and thus find new truths. It's a way of thinking and that can be very exciting. Tragically, many students disengage before this can happen because of sheer boredom and the tedium of endless math drills. Once they develop a gap in their knowledge it becomes difficult to progress unless those gaps are addressed. For lots of students, it all ends with fractions. You'd be surprised how many adults don't really understand fractions. For others it ends with algebra, and for the college bound it ends with calculus.

This issue becomes very clear when you see how many ways there are to express a simple concept like linear regression. I've had the chance to see that for myself in university when I pursued a bunch of classes from different domains. The fact that introductory statistics (y = a + bx), econometrics (Y = beta_0 + beta_1 * X) and machine learning (theta = epsilon * x, incl. matrix notation) talk about the same formula with quite different notation can definitely be confusing. All of them have their historical or logical reasons for formulating it that way, but I believe it's an unnecessary source of friction. If we go back to basic maths, I believe it's the same issue. Early in my elementary school, the pedagogical approach was this: 0. only work with numbers until some level 1. introduce the first few letters of the alphabet as variables (a, b, c) - despite no one ever explaining why \"variable\" and \"constant\" are nouns all of a sudden 2. abruptly switch to the last letters of the alphabet (x, y, z), two of which don't exist in my native language 3. reintroduce (a,b,c) as sometimes free variables, and sometimes very specific things (e.g., discriminant of a quadratic equation) 4. and so on for greek letters, etc. It's not something that's too difficult to grasp after some time, but I think it's a waste to introduce this friction to kids when they're also dealing with completely unrelated courses, social problems, biological differences, etc. If you're confused by \"why\" variables are useful, why does the notation change all the time, and why it sometimes doesn't - and who gets to decide - this never gets resolved. Not to mention how arbitrarily things are presented, no explanation of how things came to be or why we learn them, and every other problem that schools haven't tackled since my grandparents were kids. reply bunderbunder 3 hours agoparentprevThe ironic thing is, I swear that this must have been how math (at least more advanced math) was taught a century ago. Or at least, nowadays I've taken to relying on textbooks from the early-to-mid 20th century to learn new math. Maybe it's survivor bias and the only textbooks from back then that anyone remembers are the good ones. I hate new textbooks because they're so built around instant gratification. They just come out and tell you how to solve the problem without building the solution up in any way. Maybe afterward they take a swipe at telling you how it works, but that's just completely the wrong way around IMO. It robs me of the chance to mull things over, try to anticipate how this will all come together in the end, and generally have my own \"aha\" moments along the way. But, getting back to what you say, I think that it also engenders this tendency to reduce math to symbol manipulation. Because if they give you the formula in the first paragraph, then all subsequent explanation is going to end up being anchored to that formula. And IMO that's just completely wrong. Mathematical notation is at its best when it's a formalizing tool and mnemonic device for cementing concepts you already mostly understand. It's at its worst when it's being used as the primary communication channel. (It's also an essential tool for actually performing any kind of symbolic reasoning such as algebraic manipulation, of course, but I'm mainly thinking about pedagogical uses here.) reply noqc 3 hours agoparentprevI have never disagreed more with a comment.

Do you mean formal in the sense of using formulaic, rote manipulations or formal in the sense of proofs and rigor? As someone who went on to study mathematics at the graduate level, I was bored out of my mind in high school math and most subjects. What's missing from a lot of primary and secondary school education is context, and that's what makes it boring. Math wasn't easy because I was particularly good at it. It was easy because it was just blindly following formulas and basic logic. Something is very wrong with our educational system because almost all math at the primary and secondary levels is basic logic. So when people with this maximum level of mathematics education say they're \"bad at math\" or \"don't get math\", it means that they lack extremely basic logic and reasoning skills. In my mind, we need to teach mathematics in a contextual way (note that I don't necessarily mean applications) in a way to enrich the reasoning and exploring of it. This should include applications, yes, but not be fully concentrated on applications.

There's a difference between what your human brain would become accustomed to (which you'd be right, it'd scale up and up forever) versus what would allow the base level of health and opportunity.

My point was, people will still prioritize earning more money when on UBI instead of pursue their passions because it won't be enough. UBI is not a safety net, if a middle class salary person fails, they would have to work hourly lower wage work, that's why they keep working their middle class job, it isn't because they fear starvation or losing their shelter. UBI would relieve stress for the lowest earning people, but it won't result in pursuit of passion for most people. economically speaking, because most people can afford certain things (like rent) the price of those things will go up, things are priced based on what potential consumers are willing to pay. If rent costs $1000 for a specific type of unit, but suddenly everyone on UBI can afford that easily, the landlord would raise the rent, the cost of things won't remain static when wages rise for a large portion of the population. Increased demand without increased cost is loss of potential revenue. The quality of life for people on UBI would be barely surviving, and UBI would need to increase constantly to keep people from becoming homeless or starving. This is the \"Cobra effect\" embodied. It provides a perverse incentive. healthcare in the US is out of control for this reason. health care providers keep increasing cost, because the patient is not the client, the insurance company is, so long as everyone is getting insurance, the cost of care is the maximum reliably predictable pay out by the insurance company. Not increasing cost is just bad business. You will have to also force all kinds of businesses from raising prices if it can work, and even when it works UBI will result in subsidizing low-wager workers for businesses, because they'll still have to work some job to afford anything outside of food,shelter and the basics. A practical alternative to UBI is a local tax on businesses, kind of like a property tax but this tax is based on an inverse of an assessment of wages, rent, welfare pay out and other social conditions in the area. the higher wages are, lower rent is,etc.. the lower the tax is, it might even result in a credit. An inverse of a perverse incentive like UBI. Unemployment would also be partially funded through this, the unemployed would forever get a UBI like pay out so long as they are pursuing education or work of some kind based on what is in demand in their area.

But then it keeps going, all the way up to formal methods of software analysis and verification. https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/ reply vanderZwan 7 hours agoparentprevYes, I agree! And also that a lot of the fun stuff is hidden behind historically opaque terminology. Although I'm also sympathetic to the fact that writing accessible explanations is a separate and hard to master skill. Once you understand something it can be really hard to step back into the mindset of not understanding it and figuring out an explanation that would make the idea \"click\". I think a lot of maths is secretly a lot easier than it appears, but just missing an explanation that makes it easy to get the core idea to build upon. For example, I've been meaning to write an explorable[0] for explaining positional notation in any integer base (so binary, hexadecimal, etc) in a way that any child who can read clocks should be able to follow. Possibly teaching multiplication along the way. Conceptually it's quite simple: imagine a counter that looks like an analog clock, but with the digits 0 to 9 and a +1 and -1 button. We can use it to count between zero and nine, but if we add one to nine, we step back to zero. Oh no! Ok, but we can solve this by adding a second counter. Whenever the first counter does a full circle, we increase it by one. A full circle on the first counter is ten steps, so each step on the second counter represents ten steps. But what if the second counter wants to count ten steps? No problem, just add a third! And so on. So then the natural question is... what if we have fewer digits than 0 to 9? Like 0 to 7? Oh, we get octal numbers. 0 and 1 is binary. Adding more digits using letters from the alphabet? The core approach is just a very physical representation of base-10 positional, which hopefully it makes it easy to do the counting and follow what is happening. No \"advanced\" concepts like \"base\" or \"exponentiation\" needed, but those are abstractions that are easy to put on top when they get older. I've asked around with friends who have kids - most of them learn to read clocks somewhere between four and six, and by the time they're eight they can all count to 100. So I would expect that in theory this approach would make the idea of binary and hexadecimal numbers understandable at that age already. EDIT: funny enough the article also mentions that precisely thanks to positional notation, almost every adult can immediately answer the question \"what is one billion minus one\".

It turned out that PHIL 104 was cross listed as MATH 562, because the professor who taught Logic I was allowed to teach whatever he wanted for the followup class. I had technically taken the prereq, which was a basic CS logic course, but I was in way over my head. It was one of the most fun courses I took in college. We were given the exact text of the final exam weeks in advance, and were allowed to do anything at all to prepare, including collaborating with the other students or asking other professors (who couldn't make heads or tails of it). The goal was to be able to answer 1 or 2 out of the 10 questions on the exam, and even if you couldn't you got a B+ at minimum. I wish I had a better memory, but I believe one of the questions I successfully answered was to prove Post's Theorem using Turing machines? The problem is, I never used the knowledge from that class again, but to this day I still think about it. It would be amazing to go back and learn more about that fascinating intersection of philosophy and computer science. What I loved the most was that it combined hard math with the kind of esoteric metaphysical questions about mathematics which many practitioners despise because they feel like it undermines their work.

I remember, I didn't fully understand what \"f o g\" was until I was given the definition of a monoid. Also limits and derivations, once you get the proper definition, you can pretty easily derive all the formulas and theorems you use in high school. Also in high school, we mostly did calculations and simple deductions, but at university we were proving everything. Nice change of perspective. reply openrisk 10 hours agoprevThere is this element of abstract mathematical thinking that many young people get exposed to at some point in the educational system but just never \"get it\" and they disconnect. This is where it goes awry as the gap only widens later on and its a pity. Working with symbols, equations etc. feels like it should be more widely accessible. Its almost a game-like pursuit, it should not be alienating. It might be a failure of educators recognizing what are the pathways to get the brain to adopt these more abstract modes of representing and operating.

I've long thought that almost all have the capability to learn roughly high school level math, though it will take more effort for some than for others. And a key factor to keep up a sustained effort is motivation. A lot of people who end up hating math or think they're terrible at it just haven't had the right motivation. Once they do, and they feel things start to make sense and they're able to solve problems, things get a lot easier. Personally I also feel that learning math, especially a bit higher-level stuff where you go into derivations and low-level proofs, has helped me a lot in many non-math areas. It changed the way I thought about other stuff, to the better. Though, helping my family members and friends taught me that different people might need quite different approaches to start to understand new material.

    "originBody": "HOME > PIRACY RESEARCH > A recent study published in the Journal of University Teaching & Learning Practice sheds light on people's motivations to use Z-Library. Expensive books and limited access to academic material play a key role among those surveyed. That includes a group of Chinese postgraduate students who believe that shadow libraries help to overcome (academic) poverty. Z-Library is one of the largest shadow libraries on the Internet, hosting millions of books and academic articles that can be downloaded for free. The site defied all odds over the past two years. It continued to operate despite a full-fledged criminal prosecution by the United States, which resulted in the arrest of two alleged operators in Argentina. These two Russian defendants are wanted by the United States and earlier this year a judge approved their extradition. However, according to the most recent information we have, the defendants escaped house arrest and vanished into thin air. The roles of the two Russians remain unclear, but they were not vital to the site’s survival. Z-Library continued to expand its reach despite their legal troubles. Z-Library Motivations Research Z-Library users don’t seem to be hindered by the criminal prosecution either, as they continue to support and use the site. For many, Z-Library is simply a convenient portal to download free books. For others, however, it’s a vital resource to further an academic career. A recent study published in the Journal of University Teaching & Learning Practice sheds light on the latter. It looks at the ‘piracy’ motivations of Redditors and students in higher education, specifically when it comes to Z-Library. The paper The paper, published by Dr. Michael Day of the University of Greenwich, labels the use of Z-Library as ‘Academic Cybercrime’. The findings, however, suggest that students are more likely to draw comparisons with “Robin Hood”. The research looks at the motivations of two groups; Reddit users and Chinese postgraduate students. Despite the vast differences between these groups, their views on Z-Library are quite similar. Redditors’ Responses The 134 Reddit responses were sampled from the Zlibrary subreddit, which is obviously biased in favor of the site. However, the reasoning goes well beyond a simple “I want free stuff” arguments. Many commenters highlighted that they were drawn to the site out of poverty, for example, or they highlighted that Z-Library was an essential tool to fulfill their academic goals. “Living in a 3rd world country, 1 book would cost like 50%- 80% already of my daily wage,” one Redditor wrote. The idea that Z-Library is a ‘necessary evil’ was also highlighted by other commenters. This includes a student who can barely make ends meet, and a homeless person, who has neither the money nor the space for physical books. Some responses The lack of free access to all study materials, including academic journal subscriptions at university libraries, was also a key motivator. Paired with the notion that journal publishers make billions of dollars, without compensating authors, justification is found for ‘pirate’ alternatives. “They make massive profits. So stealing from them doesn’t hurt the authors nor reviewers, just the rich greedy publishers who make millions just to design a cover and click ‘publish’,” one Redditor wrote. Chinese Students The second part of the study is conducted in a more structured format among 103 postgraduate students in China. This group joined a seminar where Z-Library and the crackdown were discussed. In addition, the students participated in follow-up focus group discussions, while also completing a survey. Despite not all being users of the shadow library, 41% of the students agreed that the site’s (temporary) shutdown affected their ability to study and find resources for degree learning. In general, the students have a favorable view toward Z-Library and similar sites, and 71% admit that they have used a shadow library in the past. In line with China’s socialist values, the overwhelming majority of the students agreed that access to knowledge should be free for everyone. While the students are aware of copyright law, they believe that the need to access knowledge outweighs rightsholders’ concerns. This is also reflected in the following responses, among others. – Z-Library, or a similar website, is helpful to students living in poverty (82% agree). – Academic textbooks are too expensive, so I can’t afford to buy them as a student (67% agree). – I have limited access to English medium academic books in my country (63% agree) – I prefer to download books without restrictions, like [paywalls etc.], as it is difficult (77% agree). All in all, Z-Library and other shadow libraries are seen as a viable option for expensive or inaccessible books, despite potential copyright concerns. Robin Hood Mentality This research sheds an intriguing light on key motivations to use shadow libraries. However, the small sample sizes, selection bias, and specific characteristics of the groups, means that these findings should be interpreted with caution. Dr. Michael Day, nonetheless, notes that the responses show clear signs of a Robin Hood mentality. Z-Library users evade the publishers’ ‘tax’ on knowledge by downloading works for free. Overall, the paper suggests that universities and publishers may want to reconsider the status quo and consider making more content freely accessible, taking a page from Z-Library. “There is need for universities to re-consider the digital divides faced by socioeconomically and digitally disadvantaged students, alongside publishers, who must rethink their approach by making open access research more commonplace and thus pro-human,” the author concludes. The paper provides a good example, as it is published under a Creative Commons license and is freely accessible to all. — Day, M.J. (2024).

Every once in a while one of these books ends up being awesome and truly useful for the class, and then I order it physically because I actually want it in my bookshelf (admittedly I'm not battling poverty). Such shadow libraries have driven me to buy the books I liked, while rarely opening and reading the ones I didn't need, and also not buying them.

Additionally, not all pirates are the selfish monsters that MPAA, RIAA, and friends would have you believe: many pirates, including several I know personally, use pirated media as a preview, and go on to pay for the content they actually enjoyed, yet wouldn't have done so without the option to pirate to know whether or not the media is worth the asking price to begin with.

You are thinking logically. Humans are NOT logical. In some other countries, Politicians hold huge banquets right before election day. Lots of people eat at these banquets. They could go vote for someone else after eating the free food because it is a secret ballot. However, overwhelmingly those who got to eat the free food will vote for the people who reliably show up to feed them every election. Why? Because humans are not logical. Same applies here. You'd think people have already gotten free books or music or whatever. But if they like something, they want to be a part of it. Even if they don't personally pay for it, If they really like it, they will share it with others. Who in turn will likely pay for it. Also I remember something profound I read when I was younger.

Stealing involves taking a resource, which makes it unavailable to others and causes the legitimate owner to have one fewer of the thing. Piracy is stealing, typically on boats, with a threat of violence involved. This is unauthorized copying. It does devalue the work of the copyright holder. It is illegal in many jurisdictions. It costs the legitimate owner something, the opportunity of a sale, but it doesn’t actually cause the legitimate owner to have fewer copies of the thing to sell. If the perpetrator was some kid with no money, the opportunity denied to the copyright owner was pretty minimal. I mean we should be honest about it, unauthorized copying is bad. But it is much less bad than stealing and it is not anywhere near piracy (applying the name piracy to unauthorized copying was some over-dramatic silly nonsense). reply firesteelrain 12 hours agorootparentIf unauthorized copying is akin to preventing a potential sale then using a gym for an authorized/non paid amount of time to try the gym without paying is not stealing. Doubt anyone would be put into jail for doing that. At worst if done maliciously then they might be asked to leave or trespassed. Creator of the thing sets the terms. People have the ability to not buy it if they do not like the terms. But they do not have the right to alter the terms via stealing. reply echoangle 12 hours agorootparent> If unauthorized copying is akin to preventing a potential sale then using a gym for an authorized/non paid amount of time to try the gym without paying is not stealing. Well using a gym for free isn’t stealing either. Although the analogy is flawed because a gym has a limited capacity so you could take up the space of legitimate customers, which you don’t do when torrenting copyrighted stuff. > Creator of the thing sets the terms. People have the ability to not buy it if they do not like the terms. But they do not have the right to alter the terms via stealing. No, creators can’t just redefine words. It’s not stealing, because you’re not taking something away from someone. reply firesteelrain 8 hours agorootparentUsing a gym for free is a theft of services. All states have a law like this. For example, Florida Statutes § 812.014. Pirating is theft. reply echoangle 8 hours agorootparentI wouldn't really call theft of services \"stealing\", but I'm not a native speaker. Maybe that's something people say. > Pirating is theft. Do you mean copyright violations or ship piracy? I don't see how this follows, because torrenting a movie doesn't take a service from the movie right holder. They wouldn't even notice if they wouldn't actively monitor torrent users. Theft of service is a crime because it causes unpaid work for the service provider, right? That's why I said the gym analogy doesn't apply here. reply firesteelrain 7 hours agorootparentTheft of services isn't just about causing unpaid work; it involves intentionally depriving a provider of the rightful compensation for their services. Both cases are equal in principle. Theft of IP falls under a different law in the US than theft of something like gym services. reply echoangle 7 hours agorootparent> Theft of IP falls under a different law in the US than theft of something like gym services. Yeah, you know why? It’s not theft, it’s called copyright infringement. reply firesteelrain 6 hours agorootparentAgree, but it causes economic harm, it’s a misuse of legal rights, and breach of the IP holders agreement. Creators have a right to protect their control and revenue streams. reply LocalH 3 hours agorootparentThat's disputable by a strict reading of the original copyright law, before it was perverted by those who would vacuum up \"IP\" solely for the control and for potential profit. Copyright is ultimately intended \"to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries\". Limited times. \"75 years past the author's death\" is not in any practical way limited, when none of the people who were alive during or in the years postceding the author may access what should be, at that point, their rightfully publicly owned work. Current copyright terms hinder the progress of human knowledge and creativity. It incentivizes people who get lucky and create the next huge hit, to rest on their laurels for the rest of their life, getting paid repeatedly for the same work, with no incentive to create anything new. At the same time, those who would make a transformative use of a work (that isn't otherwise a fair use) are rebuked. 14+14 is all we need. Anything else is rent-seeking. Don't even get me started on those in the world who would support perpetual copyright (not that you espoused that opinion, but many do). Fortunately, that one would require a constitutional amendment in the US to be legal. The dirtiest tactic used in the copyright push was the Berne Convention. It allows countries to throw their hands up and say \"sorry, we can't do anything, we have to harmonize the copyright terms\", thus making a treaty that effectively supercedes various national constitutions. reply bee_rider 3 hours agorootparentIt is interesting that the wording specifies “the useful arts.” Perhaps implying the existence of non-useful arts. I wonder what they meant there. I would include a lot of media as non-useful arts. Like maybe someone could argue that really thoughtful movies are useful as works of philosophy or education. But most movies, especially most blockbusters are basically non-useful, right? They are just for fun. And so shouldn’t be covered by copyright. reply LocalH 1 hour agorootparentFrom my understanding of it, \"arts\" doesn't even refer to artistic works, but more the work of artisans, those skilled in a manufacturing craft. By the same token, \"sciences\" doesn't just refer to the institution of Science, but of all human knowledge. reply jjtheblunt 2 hours agorootparentprevI think the idea (which is why i asked the original question) is \"theft\" of opportunity for income. reply eesmith 8 hours agorootparentprev> If unauthorized copying is akin to preventing a potential sale then using a gym .. Theft of services and copyright infringement are two very different bodies of law and cannot be compared this way. For example, at 11:59pm on New Year's Eve this year, if I sell you a copy of Hemingway's \"A Farewell to Arms\", that violates copyright law unless I have an agreement with the copyright holder. However, if I wait 1 minute, it will enter the public domain, and I am free to do so. There is no equivalent to the public domain for using a gym. > Creator of the thing sets the terms. The copyright holder sets the terms that end users agree to, which is rarely the creator. For example, the copyright for commercial software is often held by the company, and not the software developers who created it. The work product of an employee is considered \"work-for-hire\", which means the employer is treated as the legal author. Companies don't create. Unlike people, companies don't exist except as a shared consensus. This means the people who make unauthorized copies of software are almost never breaking terms set by the creator, they are breaking terms set by the copyright holder. The distribution oligarchy for fields like music and books puts the creator in a Faustian situation where technically the creator does set the original terms, but there's no real chance of distribution without transferring copyright ownership and control of terms over to the distributor, with little say on the end-user terms. We can see a glimpse of what a \"creator sets the terms\" world looks like with copyright termination, where a creator can regain copyright after 35 years, as with Victor Willis and the YMCA song. > But they do not have the right to alter the terms via stealing. The legally correct ending is \"via copyright infringement\", because copyright infringement isn't stealing. I mean, wage theft is much closer to stealing, and yet wage theft is usually (but not always) under civil law while stealing is usually under criminal law, so clearly the legal distinctions are important. There's been hundreds of millions of dollars of advertising over the last 50 or so years to try to convince everyone that copyright infringement is equivalent to criminal theft or privacy. It's apparently worked on you. Yet even though wage theft is massive, with dollar amounts which exceed actual theft, there's an almost complete lack of advertising equating the two. Almost as if the people who profit from copyright transfers from creators, and the people who profit from wage theft, have more control over advertising, and thus our perceptions of how things work. reply LocalH 16 hours agorootparentprevPiracy isn't stealing. Legally or morally. You know what is stealing? The heavily lengthened copyright term.

Copyright itself is the problem. For example, for an academic from a poor region trying to keep up with publications in his field, even the short length of copyright set out by the American Founding Fathers, is too long. reply jjtheblunt 2 hours agorootparentIt predates America: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright#History reply PrismCrystal 1 hour agorootparentObviously. But HN is American-dominated, and the Copyright Clause in the Constitution and the original length of 14 years, are what most people are likely to think of when it is mentioned that copyright used to be a short monopoly to spur the arts and sciences. In modern scholarship, where progress is continual and scholars hail from countries that have differing degrees of access to paid resources, any monopoly for any length of time is harmful. reply lubujackson 15 hours agorootparentprevWhat a strange perspective. How does piracy dilute the work's value? I would think most informative/artistic work is elevated by spreading awareness to more people. For a lot of creators that's a primary goal (otherwise there is easier work to be had). What is lost by piracy is some potential cold hard cash for a copy of the work, which partially filters down to the creator. Also \"control\" of the distribution, for whatever that's worth.

IME, the expansion of piracy follows a contraction of purchasing power without a commensurate contraction of the expectation to consume media/information.

There’s a relatively fixed population of people who pirate software (i.e. people who are independently good at cracking or knowledgeable enough to apply cracks) so the answer is typically to just sell more software and the percentage lost through pirating goes down. It becomes a problem when piracy becomes a percentage of revenue no matter what scale you’re in. This is when even Joe Shmoe knows about and can use the cracked version (e.g. WinRAR).

I’d also be inclined to discard theoretical “in the long run it’ll be unhelpful” concerns, since that opens up an infinitely-deep can of hypothetical contrived scenarios of arbitrary complexity that can’t be disproven. I’m sure there are very real concerns, but it’s impossible to reason about which concerns specifically people would care about. IMO that leaves the purely practical concerns: - Students in poverty might not have reliable internet, devices or digital literacy. If zlib isn’t available to them, it isn’t helpful - Books available might not cater to the local language/culture, or the real world curriculum needs of those students. If zlib doesn’t help them succeed, it isn’t helpful - The interface sucks and is confusing, which makes students struggle to find what‘s useful. If zlib isn’t useable for them, it isn’t helpful reply crvdgc 11 hours agoparentprevAn interpretation given the benefit of the doubt is, using Z-library might get the said student in trouble and therefore is not helpful overall. reply bluedays 16 hours agoparentprevI could play devils advocate and say that it’s bad for poor students because if authors are not fairly compensated then these authors won’t write textbooks and if they don’t then future students won’t benefit from having the textbooks. reply tomrod 16 hours agorootparentFew academic authors are in it for the money. reply DiscourseFan 16 hours agorootparentI mean yeah, getting your work published just means that you can sue if someone steals it (often the case with those university presidents that they plagiarized work from undergrads or those who otherwise couldn't fight back). But if publishers stop making money off academic texts, then they won't be inclined to fight those battles.

Historically, your lazier instructor took problem sets out of these books which put extra pressure on students to buy them. There's also the accelerated edition turnover in the publishing industry, so that teachers always get the latest edition, which has slightly different problem sets than the one from two years ago, even if the material is the same as it was two decades ago. It's hard to feel much pity for any lost sales suffered by those outfits due to online distribution of current texts. Today, any instructor with access to an LLM can come up with unique problem sets and solutions with relatively little effort for a whole semester's coursework, and just do that every time they teach the course. Yes students will just use LLMs to help them solve the LLM-generated questions - so more in-class quiz sessions are likely to become the norm. reply DiscourseFan 14 hours agoparentOk, a publisher stakes their reputation on having reliable problem sets.

    "originBody": "Science and Technology, Health And Wellness, Research Weight-loss drug found to shrink heart muscle in mice, human cells U of A researchers urge caution about the unknown unintended negative health consequences of trendy anti-obesity medications. November 18, 2024 By Michael Brown A new U of A study shows that drugs like Ozempic may not just be causing people to lose weight — they may be causing the heart to lose muscle. (Photo: Getty Images) Trendy weight-loss drugs making headlines for shrinking waistlines may also be shrinking the human heart and other muscles, according to a new University of Alberta study whose authors say should serve as a “cautionary tale” about possible long-term health effects of these drugs. “If people have been prescribed these drugs, then the benefits should likely far exceed the risks,” says Jason Dyck, lead author on the study, pediatrics professor in the Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry and a member of the Women and Children’s Health Research Institute. “However, the growing number of people who may be taking these drugs who do not meet the eligibility criteria and who are not at risk have a different risk-reward calculation that they should be made aware of.” Dyck and his team set out to study why a reported side-effect of the leading weight-loss drug Ozempic is the loss of skeletal muscle. Ozempic, known medically as semaglutide, was originally designed to help adult patients with type 2 diabetes control their blood sugar. However, this drug — and a host of others in this class of medication — are also being touted for their effectiveness as an anti-obesity medication. Using mice for the study, the researchers found that heart muscle also decreased in both obese and lean mice. The systemic effect observed in mice was then confirmed in cultured human heart cells. Dyck, who is the Canada Research Chair in Molecular Medicine and heads up the Cardiovascular Research Centre, says his team did not observe any detrimental functional effects in hearts of mice with smaller hearts and thus would not expect any overt health effects in humans. But he adds that there may be more impact over the long term, or some forms of cardiac stress may have a detrimental effect that wasn’t observed at rest. “Given the growing number of people taking this drug who have no cardiovascular disease or who are not classified as obese, we suggest that cardiac structure and function be carefully evaluated in previous and ongoing clinical studies.” Dyck’s study comes on the heels of a commentary published in the November issue of The Lancet by an international team of researchers from the U of A, McMaster and Louisiana State University who examined emerging research showing that up to 40 per cent of the weight lost by people using weight-loss drugs is actually muscle. Carla Prado, a nutrition researcher in the Faculty of Agricultural, Life & Environmental Sciences and lead author on the commentary, explains this rate of muscle decline is significantly higher than what is typically observed with calorie-reduced diets or normal aging and could lead to a host of long-term health issues — including decreased immunity, increased risk of infections and poor wound healing. “Muscle does much more than just help us move or lift things. It is a powerful organ that keeps us healthy in a number of ways,” she says. For example, muscle stores important building blocks — amino acids — that the body uses when we’re sick, stressed or injured to repair itself and stay strong. It also plays a huge role in managing blood sugar, which helps prevent diabetes. As well, Prado notes muscle releases special molecules called myokines that signal other parts of the body to help fight infections and support our immune system. “That’s why preserving muscle is so important, especially during weight-loss treatments — it’s not just about staying strong, but about keeping our whole body resilient and healthy.” In the commentary, the authors suggest that muscle loss due to weight reduction may also exacerbate conditions like sarcopenic obesity — characterized by a combination of high body fat and low skeletal muscle mass — which contributes to poorer health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease and higher mortality rates. Though the short-term effects of muscle loss on physical strength and function remain unclear, the commentary calls for future research to explore how reductions in muscle mass might improve muscle mass and composition. To keep muscle strong while losing weight, Prado says it is essential to focus on two main things: nutrition and exercise. Proper nutrition means getting enough high-quality protein, essential vitamins and minerals, and other “muscle-building” nutrients. Sometimes, this can include protein supplements to make sure the body has what it needs. “Exercise is just as important — specifically resistance training like lifting weights or using resistance bands,” said Prado, who was recently named Canada Research Chair in Integrative Nutrition, Body Composition and Energy Metabolism. “This type of exercise helps keep muscle from breaking down during weight loss and maintains strength.” She adds that for anyone using weight loss medications, it’s best to follow a balanced program that includes both enough protein and resistance training. “This can help people lose fat while minimizing muscle loss, which helps them get the full health benefits of treatment and stay strong.” Prado, who is a member of the Cancer Research Institute of Northern Alberta, the Women and Children’s Health Research Institute, the Alberta Diabetes Institute, the Alberta Transplant Institute and the Institute of Sensory Motor Rehabilitative Technology, is collaborating with Dyck to explore the mechanisms and impact of various forms of muscle wasting in relation to this class of medication.

    "commentBody": "Weight-loss drug found to shrink muscle in mice, human cells (ualberta.ca)326 points by Eumenes 19 hours agohidepastfavorite369 comments crazygringo 7 hours agoI'm always so baffled by warnings about losing muscle when losing weight. Of course you do! If your body is tens of pounds lighter, then you don't need the extra muscle to lug it around. This paper is about reduction in heart muscle, and of course your heart doesn't need to be as strong because there's less blood to pump and less tissue to fuel. When you gain weight, you also increase the muscles needed to carry that weight around. If you see someone obese at the gym doing the leg press, you may be astonished at how strong their legs are. When you lose weight, you don't need that muscle anymore. Our bodies are really good at providing exactly the amount of muscle we need for our daily activities (provided we eat properly, i.e. sufficient protein), so it's entirely natural that our muscles decrease as we lose weight, the same way they increased when we gain weight. Muscles are expensive to keep around when we don't need them. Obviously, if you exercise, then you'll keep the muscles you need for exercising. But this notion that weight loss can somehow be a negative because you'll lose muscle too, I don't know where it came from. Yes you can lose muscle, but you never would have had that muscle in the first place if you hadn't been overweight -- so it's not something to worry about. reply lee 5 hours agoparentFrom the article: \"...explains this rate of muscle decline is significantly higher than what is typically observed with calorie-reduced diets or normal aging and could lead to a host of long-term health issues...\" The warning isn't that you're losing muscle during weight-loss with these drugs. It's that the ratio of muscle vs fat loss is much greater with the drugs compared to traditional weight loss methods. It's been well studied that if you exercise and eat enough protein while losing weight, you can retain more muscle. Losing a lot of lean mass is incredibly detrimental to your longevity and quality of life. reply beejiu 5 hours agorootparentEven amongst traditional calorie deficits, rapid weight loss results in greater loss of muscle mass when compared to gradual weight loss, even if you lose the same amount of mass overall. I.e. you keep more muscle losing 0.5 lbs a week over 40 weeks than 2 lbs a week over 10 weeks. reply cactca 3 hours agorootparentprevCan you provide a single high quality (randomized) study demonstrating GLP1 therapeutics are 'incredibly detrimental to [your] longevity and quality of life'? Consider the type of confounding that occurs in studies of people losing a lot of lean mass: cachexia, restriction to bed, famine. Traditional weight loss methods have not shown the magnitude of survival benefits wrt cardiovascular disease, joint pain, diabetic complications. Exercise is wonderful, but as a public health intervention it is not sufficient. If anyone looks at the totality of the high quality GLP1 clinical evidence and concludes these drugs are going to cause a net reduction in longevity and quality of life, then they should step back and assess their process for evaluating information. reply IG_Semmelweiss 5 hours agorootparentprev>>>Losing a lot of lean mass is incredibly detrimental to your longevity and quality of life. While true, its also true that if you manage to lose substantial fat in the process, it leads to longer and better quality life reply mathgeek 3 hours agorootparent> it leads to longer and better quality life This needs a slight change in wording or clarification, depending on what you meant. Losing substantial fat when overweight increases your chance of a longer and better quality life than if you had maintained high levels of fat. Losing substantial muscle in that process reduces your chances of the same. It's statistics and never guaranteed. reply crazygringo 4 hours agorootparentprevIf I'm reading the study [1] correctly, that conclusion is not warranted. It appears that they fed the control group and treatment group of mice lots of food to get them fat, then gave them identical normal diets, and gave the treatment group semaglutide. The semaglutide group lost significantly more weight (fig A.ii) than the control group, and also lost heart muscle. So it does not seem that they compared to an equivalent amount of weight loss in mice, which is what I'd think you'd need to do to come to the conclusion from the article (actually, not just an equivalent amount of weight loss, but also at the same rate).

It raises questions, and is worthy of discussion, even if we do land at answers that say it is an acceptable level of risk. reply bityard 1 hour agoparentprevI don't mean to target your comment specifically because it's obvious you know the difference, but I'm continually annoyed by the conflation of fat and muscle as \"weight,\" even by medical professionals who should know better. We should not be talking about losing \"losing weight\" as a substitute for saying \"losing fat,\" which is what most people mean. Likewise, when people say they want to \"gain weight\", they almost always mean they want to \"gain muscle.\" Why does this matter? Trying to manage one's health or fitness as \"weight\" gives (most) people the wrong idea about what their weight number represents, and what to do to improve their level of fitness and dial in on the anatomically appropriate amount of body fat. As an example, it's possible (although admittedly unlikely) for one to work hard to gain muscle and strength while reducing body fat and stay exactly the same weight the whole time. Their overall health, fitness, and longevity will be significantly improved but pop fitness will tell them that they haven't made any progress at all. reply s1artibartfast 43 minutes agorootparentThat doesn't strike me as a real problem. Everybody already understands that \"losing weight\" means losing fat, not muscle. They don't leave the doctors office after a weight warning thinking they need to stop going to the gym. Likewise, nobody is scared of gaining muscle because they think it will be bad for their health. reply watwut 1 hour agorootparentprevThe other thing is conflation between health and fitness. If you are below overweight range, no matter where you are, loosing additional fat is unlikely to make you healthier. At some level of fat, which is actually more then \"thin\", you are perfectly fine. Further weight loss is about aesthetic or athletic performance, but has zero effect on health or even slight negative estimated health effect. reply bArray 7 hours agoparentprevI wondered about exactly this. The study is actually a published letter [1], and it doesn't appear to account for this. Science Direct even published a study about this in 2017 [2]: > Weight loss, achieved through a calorie-reduced diet, decreases both fat and fat-free (or lean body) mass. In persons with normal weight, the contribution of fat-free mass loss often exceeds 35% of total weight loss, and weight regain promotes relatively more fat gain. We already know how to reduce the effect of this, the person simply needs to increase exercise as the weight is lost in order to maintain lean muscle mass.

If you see someone obese at the gym doing the leg press, you may be astonished at how strong their legs are. When you lose weight, you don't need that muscle anymore. Anyone can put up impressive #s on a leg pres. Try the bench press instead. No one impressed by leg press. In regard to the oft claim of obese people being stronger or more muscular, not really. Studies show that obese people carry only a tiny extra 'lean body mass' compared to non-obese people when matched for height, age, and gender, and much of this extra mass is organs, not muscle. Otherwise, the extra weight is just water. Sometimes it is even less because obesity impairs movement, leading to muscle loss due to inactivity. If obese people seem strong it is because the fat reduces the range of movement for certain lifts like the squat and bench press, so it's possible for obese people to put up impressive numbers owing to having to move the weight less distance. Same for pushing movements, e.g. linemen, as being heavier means more kinetic energy, but this is not the same as being stronger in the sense of more muscle output. This is why obese people are not that impressive at arm curls or grip strength relative to weight, but wirey guys can curl a lot relative to weight or have a lot of grip strength. An obvious example of this is overweight women having worse grip strength compared to men; the extra fat does nothing. reply jmcgough 5 hours agoparentprevI'm always so baffled by people commenting without reading the article first. reply crazygringo 4 hours agorootparent> \"Please don't comment on whether someone read an article.\" https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html If you care to actually have a conversation about the article, feel free to respond to some specifics I provided here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42204741 reply tomhoward 14 hours agoprevI'm not commenting specifically on the heart-muscle aspect of the study, but it shouldn't be a surprise that the weight loss from this drug is significantly attributable to muscle loss; it almost always is when dieting. It's the same with keto/low-carb or any other kind of caloric-restrictive dieting (which Ozempic facilitates). The modern weight-loss programs I'm seeing now (at least those aimed mostly at middle-aged men) emphasize consuming significant amounts of protein (2g for every 1kg of body weight each day) and engaging in regular resistance training, in order to maintain muscle mass.

For example in bodybuilding one normally 'bulks' while working out, because it maximizes muscle gain. But then naturally this needs to be paired with cutting, unless you're a Greek Grizzly, but the total muscle loss is relatively negligible, especially when maintaining a proper high protein diet. At 40% muscle loss you're getting awful close to losing weight while increasing your body fat percent!

It always comes back to that, yet people avoid it like the plague. The modern weight loss program you described is pushed because that's what people want; an extremely low-effort methodology that yields extremely high results. The idea that their is some silver bullet to weight loss has dominated the US health market for ages now because selling someone a pill that they don't have to do anything but swallow and be cured is really, really easy.

As I realized this and just put more work into eating better and doing more activities (I did not join a gym, but started riding my bicycle more, walking neighbor's dogs, and doing body-weight exercises at home, etc, making it more integrated into my day rather than a separate event I could skip), I lost a healthy amount of weight and got stronger. It took a lot longer, of course, than what the pills promised, but that's the trick of the whole weight loss industry...and make no mistake, it is an industry.

Pretending it's just hard, when statistics show what is true at a societal level, will not bring us solutions. We need something else. Either that's massive societal change to i.e. approach something like the diet/workout culture you have in Japan. That's hard.

Multiple cultures have supported these values since the times of snake-oil salesmen, which did not exactly vanish with history, as we so often forget. Look at products like Optavia, Xenedrine, etc. It keeps happening because the market wills it to, but not without good reason.

Hmm, that is not my experience generally. People will take insanely ineffective routes if that is what the system pushes them toward, without taking much offense. For example, on the topic of health/weight loss: Weight Watchers or yoga classes are huge industries while also being insanely elaborate and expensive ways of eating better and moving your body. I agree with you that, for example, drugs are currently not a solution to these problems. But what I propose is: they are going to be. And they had better be because there is no other effective solution poised to work at a societal scale. We just can’t help ourselves. “Just eat the salad and walk every day” simply did not do the trick. We tried. While it works on a mechanistic level, of course, it does not work in practice. Blaming people for their inability to fight their nature is just inhumane and not how we usually progress: we fix reality for ourselves. While it is not impossible to design a society that is healthier (see: Japan), it’s at such odds with our current culture, and societal change is slow. We should certainly get to work on this decades-long project, but we should also treat this like any other health issue that costs billions of life-years and find a more effective intervention. reply s1artibartfast 25 minutes agorootparentI think some people feel strongly about this issue because it seems like giving up on societal change, which IS necessary for many reasons besides just weight. Even if GLP-1 drugs are safe and long term effective for body fat, they are still a band-aid for a deeper problem. The deeper problem is that people feel and express less and less agency and control over their personal lives. This manifests in many forms, such as depression, anger, cynicism, addiction, loneliness, and personal stagnation. Weight loss will do little to improve these measures while the average American watches 4 hours of TV and is devoid of community.

Companies like Amazon insist that their employees piss in bottles or wear diapers because leaving their workstation, even to use a bathroom, will get them fired.

My wife told me exactly this - potentially all muscle mass loss (and she made sure I understood that 'all' part), yoyo effect once stopping, potentially other nasty long term/permanent side effects, and overall just a bad idea, attacking the problem from a very wrong direction. Just look at musk for example - he pumps himself with it obsessively and the results even for richest of this world are... not much there (or maybe his OCD binging would make him 200kg otherwise so this is actually some success).

Yes, it's difficult -- especially after developing bad eating habits over a long time -- but moderation is required in all things.

This requires very advanced technical equipment. My suspicion is that you have noticed an increase in muscle volume and assumed it to be an increase in muscle mass.

I was recently out of town for over two weeks and came back with the ability to lift roughly the same amount I was able to prior to leaving. My DEXA scans seem roughly correlated with the amount of weight I can do in my regular sets, which has increased about 50-70% depending on which muscle group you are talking about. This is with heavy resistance training 3 times a week and Pilates once a week. reply cthalupa 13 hours agorootparentA good portion of the strength related to any specific lift is CNS adaptation up until a certain point (and most new lifters won't hit that threshold for quite some time), so strength on a lift you've been doing regularly isn't necessarily a good indicator. Building muscle will of course increase your strength too, but I've doubled my squat since getting back into lifting while certainly not doubling the muscle mass of the respective muscles. reply phil21 12 hours agorootparentFair enough. I didn’t mean a 1:1 correlation in 50% on a Dexa means 50% more strength, just would expect my lifting ability to go down if I lost muscle mass (or if it were water weight to begin with). Neither have decreased much if at all during breaks, so I’m fairly convinced it’s “real” so to speak. Looking through my weightlifting app my best tracked exercise (leg press) increased about 250% from start with a 60% (roughly, speaking from memory) increase in lean muscle mass as measured by a DEXA scan. If I remember when back from dog walks tonight I’ll update that with a real number off the actual data. I was a total newb at lifting though, so those early gains came quite quickly.

The hearts of obese people are generally more muscular as you say, but not in a good way, so I wouldn't compare this to training. In overweight people, the heart walls get thicker and the volume of blood that the heart pushes out with each stroke is decreased as a result. This means their heart needs to beat faster to reach the right throughput and their heart is under constant strain, kind of like having your car overrevved at all times. With exercise, the heart muscles grow in a different way, and the volume of blood contained inside is not reduced.

So any observed muscle loss might not be just from losing body mass and not having to work as hard. But if you're already lean and then go on a calorie deficit (as a result of decreased appetite from taking the drug), then muscle mass will be lost through metabolism of muscle and other tissue. Then the study states further that the proportion of muscle loss is higher than expected from calorie restriction alone.

I would recommend checking out some of the learnings from the keto diet. You may or may not subscribe to it, but they had to very carefully tread these lines when the body was essentially in starvation mode. A few things I know of: 1. You have to maintain a certain amount of protein intake (~10% to ~20%) to prevent your body burning lean muscle mass. 2. Too much protein gets converted into sugars, these in turn are easily stored as fats. 3. Maintain exercise, use it or lose it. 4. Don't over-exercise. \"Exercise flu\" results in limited performance and muscle loss through gluconeogenesis.

So to start with, if that's the case, all they are observing is the effect of a diet. Not sure the diet drug has much to do with it. Then I went from 133kg to 88kg with these diet drugs.

The rather obvious problem is that these GLP1 agonists don't improve your diet. If you continue to eat a protein and nutrient deficient diet (which is probably a majority of Americans) with caloric restriction on top of that, that leads to excessive muscle loss that you wouldn't see in a weight loss diet. This normally doesn't happen without GLP1 agonists, because these diets are too difficult to stick to for most people. Those who stick to them usually turn to nutritious high satiety whole foods that help combat the negative effects of caloric restriction. Losing weight without losing muscle mass is very hard. It requires extreme diets like a protein sparring modified fast where 80%+ of your calories are from lean protein while running a 50% caloric deficit. If this research is correct, then using GLP1 agonists shortcuts the feedback loops that make the diets hard to stick to, but they shift the tradeoffs from weight to overall nutrition. \"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure\" and all that. reply llamaimperative 18 hours agorootparent> The rather obvious problem is that these GLP1 agonists don't improve your diet My understanding from initial anecdotes is this is actually literally wrong.

When I was on and could afford semaglutide, I improved my diet by consuming a high protein product with a low calorie breakfast nutrition supplement. I'm sure I probably could've accomplished similar with a multivitamin and a protein product. What I need to change is eating more low calorie, high fiber fruits and vegetables that don't taste like cardboard or a mowed lawn. My diet has gone to shit again because the insatiable, all-consuming (no pun intended) hunger has returned.

I was with you up to here. In my experience it's easy to maintain a huge proportion of your lean tissue during a weight loss diet: Do some resistance training, get some protein, and don't lose weight too quickly. There's no need to go to the extreme of a PSMF - which will still have you lose a bunch of muscle on account of being too big a deficit.

More and more scientific literature points to modest calorie surplus is the key to muscle gain (along with regular weight training). reply phil21 18 hours agorootparentprevBodybuilders I know seem to have a a very difficult time keeping their muscle gains while on a cut, I don’t know why someone who is not in a gym 5+ days a week and on an extremely optimized heavy protein diet measured down to the gram would expect otherwise. Is it possible to go very slow and keep most of your lean muscle mass? Sure. Is it practical? I have my doubts. Part of the effectiveness of these drugs - for me at least - is that results are rapid and that is a self-reinforcing feedback loop. Diets that had me losing 1lb/week were simply too boring and unmotivating for me to keep up beyond a few months. A few days of vacation “cheating” and you wipe out a month or more of incredibly difficult to achieve loss. Restricting yourself mentally in what you eat every day adds up to exhaustion over time. Some folks can manage to lose very slowly while also adhering to a strict calorie deficit of a few hundred per day, while also being consistent with resistance training. I’d say the evidence shows that these folks are in the small minority. I will say more evidence is needed for this drug class - especially where the harm reduction principle may be a bit iffy outside of obese folks. However it was life changing to me in the way it let me change my eating habits to very healthy protein and veggies as my primary calorie intake, as well as made going to the gym on a strict schedule motivating enough to actually come out at the end with a better bodyfat to lean muscle ratio than where I started. These gains have continued since I hit my goal weight - and now I’m starting to become one of those folks who the BMI no longer applies to in a good way. I do wish there was a good way to test heart muscle mass like there is lean body mass with a DEXA scan as I’m curious if my increased regular workout heartrates translates into building back any heart muscle mass like it did other lean muscle. Certainly a concern to keep an eye out for! I’m curious as you are if folks who are slow responders and live active lifestyles see the same muscle loss the hyper responders do.

So this isn't really 3 separate unrelated changes. Also at least in my experience, people tend to regard high protein things as the \"energy dense\" part of a meal - the problem with a lot of carbohydrates is they're not very filling. The biggest problem with exercise is it's an awful way to lose weight - you don't burn that many calories, it makes you hungrier, and then your body optimizes to burn even less calories as you do it. reply twelve40 18 hours agorootparentprev> In my experience it's easy > Do some resistance training, get some protein jeez, if people actually did that they wouldn't need the drug to begin with reply throwaway2037 17 hours agorootparentI must disagree with your comment.

However, the standard advice is to eat a lot of grains, some fruit and vegetables, a modest amount of protein, and little fat. This is awful and leads to very high hunger. Especially if you eat multiple meals a day, as is also commonly recommended, this is a recipe for being ever hungrier day by day. It wasn't until I eschewed all advice, started eating one big meal a day and maybe one snack and matching my carb intake with my fat intake that the hunger that I had known since childhood magically disappeared and I lost 25 lbs (and am losing more).

So with semaglutide, a larger fraction of the weight loss affects muscles than when the same weight is lost by traditional means.

With so many people taking these drugs, there is enough data to begin to profile the rare risks of these drugs in humans (the clinical trials would have found any of the obvious risks) reply hnthrowaway0328 18 hours agoparentprevJust curious, does your appetite come back whence you cut off the meds? The only reason I want to lose weight is to eat more freely, won't be useful if I lose my appetite too. reply cm2187 18 hours agorootparentYou don't lose taste, you lose your appetite, which means you can resist the temptation to eat easily, and you feel full very quickly. That doesn't prevent you from eating what you like, but it does help you to not eat too much of it, which I hope is not what you mean by \"more freely\". The appetite comes back when you cut the meds, but it's an appetite based on your new weight. But if you then go on a some suggar rampage, you will regain weight and your appetite will grow too. Those drugs are merely a guard rail to complete a diet successfully, but if people do not change their eating habbits, the same causes will produce the same effects after they cut the meds. reply andy_ppp 18 hours agorootparentWhat I’ve found is foods I could usually binge on like pizza I’m quite full on GLP-1 inhibitors and can quite happily stop at half or 2/3 of a pizza.

    "originBody": "Original posts A common urban intersection in the Netherlands Can urban intersections be designed in such a way that motor traffic, cycling and walking flow smoothly and that the potential conflicts of these very different types of traffic crossing each other’s paths are made less complicated and less dangerous? In my opinion the answer is “yes”. Intersections are most important in making cycling safer and more attractive. They can be the weakest link in the chain that is your journey and one nasty junction can put people off cycling. In this week’s post I would like to show you a common intersection between a distributor road with protected cycleways and a smaller neighbourhood access street. How do the Dutch design an intersection between two streets like that and how does everything work? Aerial picture of this intersection from Google maps. Google recently published 3D images from ʼs-Hertogenbosch. This is great to study the cycling infrastructure. In this post I focus on the crossing with the side street in the foreground. I would like to emphasise that this intersection is not special in any way. You can find many similar examples all over the country. That is because the design features stem from the design manuals which are used throughout the country. This particular intersection is in ʼs-Hertogenbosch, between the recently rebuilt Bartenbrug, that I wrote about earlier, and the Graafseweg, a main street with service streets, that I also wrote about before. This distributor road has a speed limit of 50km/h, a surface of black asphalt and dedicated cycle infrastructure. Cycling takes place shared with cars on the service street and also on completely separated cycleways connecting the service street parts. The neighbourhood access street has a surface of bricks and a speed limit of 30km/h. The traffic volume here is low, since only residents will use this street. That makes mixing traffic possible and therefore there are no protected cycleways in the side street. Drivers wanting to turn onto the main road or into the side street can wait out-of-the-way of drivers with priority on the main road. It is easy for drivers turning into the side street to wait for people cycling. That means a driver in a Mercedes not only needs to let a child on a bicycle go first, but they really do that! The intersection feels like a T-junction, but in fact it is a 4 arm-crossroads. The fourth arm, however, is a very minor residential street and that arm of the intersection is therefore designed differently. With far less turning movements, meaning far less potential conflicts, it is not necessary that the cycleway bends out the way it does for on the other side of the street with the crossing of the more important neighbourhood access road. Due to its different nature I will not discuss that fourth arm in this post. Other typical design features of the intersection are the differences in road surface and a split main street. Splitting the lanes for the two directions leads to room for refuge islands in the centre and a big central area where turning motor vehicles can wait out-of-the-way of vehicles that go straight-on. There is also enough space between the main road and its parallel cycleway, where drivers of cars wanting to turn into the side street can wait for people cycling, again, out-of-the-way of other traffic. The entire crossroads is raised to emphasise this area as a point of potential conflict at which people need to pay attention. There are of course yield signs in the side street, complimented with shark’s teeth in the surface. Last but not least the cycleway surface continues over the crossing, to make very clear cycling has priority over motor traffic in the side street. There is but one thing missing here: there should have been elephant’s feet in the surface alongside the cycleway on the crossing itself. I have no idea why they are omitted here, but maybe the city thought the contrast between the red asphalt of the cycleway and the reddish-brown bricks of the side street is already big enough as it is. What is perhaps also striking is the fact that there are no traffic signals. The Dutch generally feel that traffic signals are a last resort and that they should be used with care. Even the traffic signal expert of this city of ’s-Hertogenbosch is convinced that people are much better at negotiating who goes first than you can ever arrange with traffic signals. Without traffic signals people really must interact here, but their decisions are made easy by the clear design features of the intersection. The distance between the driveway and the cycleway, in this case 5.5 metres, eliminates the blind corners almost completely, even for trucks. Here you can see that a car drivers waiting for people cycling are never in the way of other people in cars. Let’s look at the intersection from the viewpoint of the different type of road users. 1. Motorists The intersection is crystal clear for drivers of motorised vehicles. On the main road they drive on black asphalt. That signals it is a 50km/h priority road. Parking is not allowed on the main roadway. This improves sight lines and it also signals that this is a main route. When drivers approach this intersection, even on the main road, they experience a speed bump, forcing them to slow down. They will also notice the two traffic lanes split with a space in between. This is to signal that attention needs to be given to turning traffic and the possibility of pedestrians crossing the street. There are no zebra crossings here, so there is no need to give pedestrians or any other road user the right of way. That changes the minute a driver would like to turn here. In that case priority must first be given to oncoming other motor traffic. The corner has a tight radius, so speed must really come down. For a left turn, a driver can wait out-of-the-way of other traffic in the median. This central waiting space is 6 metres wide, so there is more than enough space for even a larger vehicle. Once that stage is sorted, or when drivers make a right turn, the driver has to deal with crossing the cycleway. This crossing needs to be at least 5 metres from the main roadway, at this particular location it is 5.5 metres. That space reduces the blind spot to an absolute minimum, even for truck drivers. The cycleway is continuous and there are yield signs and yield markings (the shark’s teeth in the surface). Fortunately, thanks to the distance from the roadway, a driver can wait out-of-the-way again. The driver can look for pedestrians at the same time. Even though the driver is now at a straight angle, he or she is still making a turn and turning traffic must let pedestrians go first, because they are considered traffic on the same road and going straight-on. A driver may only continue when there are no pedestrians or people cycling. Drivers wanting to turn into the main road need to wait for cycling first. The yield sign and the shark’s teeth in the surface make that clear. Also note the sign “end of the 30km/h zone” of the residential street. The main road has a speed limit of 50km/h. This is the blanket speed limit in the built-up area and it is therefore almost never indicated. When you approach from the side street, as a driver, the order of dealing with other traffic is different, but the priority is similar. First you will notice a speed bump. The complete intersection is on a raised table. Pedestrians would not have priority if the street was level, but now that it isn’t the “exit construction” rule could apply and in that case a crossing pedestrian would have priority. But for that rule to apply the footway should be continuous, and that is not the case here. As a driver I would let a pedestrian go first at all time, to avoid any misunderstandings. You need to wait for other traffic anyway. As a pedestrian I would see whether a driver lets me go first or not. That way it doesn’t really matter whether you know the exact rule or not. What is very clear, is that people crossing on a bicycle have priority. Once you have dealt with that crossing you finally reach the main road. All traffic there, whether going straight-on or turning, has priority. You must wait until everything is clear and then you can turn into the main street. A car driver waiting for a gap in traffic on the main road is also not in the way of people cycling. 2. Cyclists When you ride on the cycleway alongside the main road it is clear that you have priority over all motor traffic, whether it turns across your path from the main road or whether it comes from the side street. The cycleway bends out, but the turns are not sharp, so you only have to slightly decrease your speed to take these curves. That way you can also make sure all other road users saw you. Preferably by looking them in the eyes one by one. Pedestrians who would want to cross the cycleway must wait for you to pass. They do not have the right of way. A clear indication of the priority, also in the road surface. The shark’s teeth indicate you must yield. The so-called piano teeth markings indicate a speed bump. Note the continuous surface of red asphalt of the cycleway, interrupting the roadway. If you were to turn into the side street on a bicycle you would have to let pedestrians crossing that side street go first. I would also do that if I were to cycle from that side street onto the cycleway of the main road. Even though pedestrians don’t officially have that priority here. When you want to turn left, onto the cycleway alongside the main road, you need to cross that main road first. In that case you can also do that in two stages, exactly like the motor traffic drivers do. First you deal with traffic coming from the left. Once that lane is clear you can go to the central waiting area and once there are no vehicles coming from the right you can cross that lane as well and turn into the cycleway. Crossing a main road is convenient with this design. The crossing is cut up in four easy parts. This man is crossing the 3.3 metre traffic lane very quickly in 5 small steps. 3. Pedestrians It could already be clear from the above paragraphs what the rights of pedestrians are. But I’d like to repeat everything from the view of a pedestrian nevertheless. When you walk straight-on on the main road you will have to cross the side street. For traffic turning into that side street from the main road, whether motor vehicles or people on bicycles, it is certain that you must get the right of way from those road users. The ground rule is namely, that turning traffic must give way to traffic going straight-on on the same road. And in this case pedestrians are consided traffic. It is a bit different for traffic from the side street, that is obviously not on the same road. And as explained previously, the tricky part is the fact that the intersection is raised, but that at the same time the footway is not continuous. Often when road users experience a level change in their path they must give priority, when they exit a driveway for instance. But that also goes for intersections that have a continuous and raised footway. I’m pretty sure many in the Netherlands would not be 100% certain about the priority here, or they think it is different from what it really is. To prevent problems due to such misunderstandings it is best to look the other road user in the eyes, read what they are going to do and act accordingly. The crossing is flush. There are no kerbs. This makes it also easy to cross in a wheel chair or pushing a stroller. For people with impaired vision there are tactile markings in the surface, indicating the outer edge of the road. When it comes to crossing the main road, everything is plain and simple again. As a pedestrian that crossing is divided into four parts. First you cross the cycleway. You must wait for the cycleway to be clear, because you have no priority. That would be different if there were zebra stripes, in that case you would have priority. The cycleway is 2.3 metres wide. That means you can get to the other side in 3 to 4 steps, so you need only a little gap in the stream of people cycling. There is a waiting space between the cycleway and the first lane of the roadway. There you can wait for a gap in motor traffic, because, here too, you have no priority due to the absence of a zebra crossing. The motor traffic lane is 3.3 metres wide here, a pretty standard width. That means most people will be able to cross this lane in 4 to 5 steps. This means you also only need a small gap in the motor traffic flow. That is one reason why you see so much movement in the video. Nobody really needs to stop for longer times. Once you have also walked the 5 metres of the central traffic island, you can deal with traffic coming from the opposite direction. First one lane of motor traffic and then the cycleway. The crossing is completely level. This makes crossing the road easy for people in wheel chairs or mobility scooters and for parents with a stroller. A fine demonstration of how easy it is for pedestrians with all kinds of wheels to cross the main road and the cycleways. This type of intersection is perfectly clear for all road users. Mainly because all the moments and locations, where you have to negotiate the right of way with different types of other road users, are separated. You can make one decision at the time and then quickly move to the next point. This makes that traffic can flow smoothly in a safe way. In this week’s video I explain how a typical Dutch intersection works. You may have noticed that I numbered the types of traffic and that we Dutch distinguish three different types of traffic. Not only do we acknowledge we have three types, we also design our infrastructure specifically for these three types of traffic. As Tim Burns, Perth Biker, noticed, this is what sets the Dutch apart from most of the world and he wrote an interesting post about it years ago. Always good to remember this key element of the Dutch traffic system!

Here, we often have shared use pavements with sometimes a bit of white paint to designate the pedestrian and cycle lanes, but they cede priority at every single side road. The problem is that it makes cycling using them really awkward as it takes significant energy for cyclists to slow down and then speed up multiple times. The irony is that if you just use the main road instead, then you have priority over all the side roads, so the bike \"lane\" is pretty much useless. Of course, we also suffer from just having fragments of cycle infrastructure that don't join up and most of the time, the infrastructure consists of \"magic\" paint that is somehow going to prevent motorists from parking and blocking the lane (it doesn't and they do). Edit: Thought I'd share the sheer incompetence that we're faced with. Here's a \"cycle lane\" in the centre of Bristol that doesn't even use a different colour, so pedestrians aren't particularly aware of it which just leads to unnecessary confrontation - peds and cyclists fighting over the scraps left over from designing for motorists. https://maps.app.goo.gl/JjfG1YJBwaqyov5H8 reply reddalo 6 hours agoparentItaly has exactly the same problem. Not only we have a horrible infrastructure (the quality of our asphalt is abysmal), but cycle paths are pretty much always shared with pedestrians, and they're filled with obstacles (manholes, poles, chicanes...). Moreover, bike paths are usually built on only one side of the road as a two-way path. It's dangerous for everybody involved, especially when a car has to stop and give way to both sides (spoiler: cars don't do it). Everything makes biking on a bike path a slower and horrible experience, so nobody uses bike paths and then a vicious circle ensues. We should all learn from the Ducth and the Danes. reply ndsipa_pomu 6 hours agorootparentItaly is often associated with cycle sport and I believe there are some excellent rides over there, but certainly the cities that I've been to (only Rome and Naples) don't look at all encouraging to cycle around. Naples is almost a perfect example of how to cram in cars into the smallest possible streets and a lot of the streets have to have metal bollards to provide some kind of protection for the pedestrians from the cars and mopeds. reply reddalo 6 hours agorootparentYes, both Rome and Naples are in the \"South\" of Italy, and the situation is worse there than in the North. Milan, Ferrara, Bolzano, Modena, Bologna are just some Northern cities where cycling is encouraged and I can see them trying to get a better infrastructure; but unfortunately there's still a long way to go. reply rsynnott 7 hours agoparentprevIn Ireland, Dublin City Council has mostly gone with lanes which are either on the side of the road (with or without bollards), or entirely separate, whereas South Dublin County Council prefers shared use pavements. The two local authorities are contiguous, so it's all a bit jarring when you go between them. Separately, a national project, Busconnects, is putting in its own bike lanes.

The bike intersections won't work if users behave differently (just like how automobile traffic is terrible if you get different driving styles mixing). reply Citizen_Lame 2 hours agorootparentprevWhich in turn means only most aggressive cyclists stay on the road.

What’s the point being made? reply ndsipa_pomu 1 hour agorootparentOne point is that traffic lights are designed for the benefit of drivers. Most of the time, cyclists can easily and safely navigate through a red light as they take up so much less space than cars. e.g. turning left at a junction (assuming UK driving on the left) can be done without causing any inconvenience for drivers and will often be safer for a cyclist than having to wait at a red light and then deal with drivers who've only just looked up from their phone and might not have seen you. It's notable how RLJing differs between cyclists and drivers. RLJing drivers will see a light turn to amber and then speed up so that they can get through the junction before the other directions can start moving. Obviously, speeding up to RLJ is very dangerous to pedestrians who might be crossing. reply itronitron 7 hours agoparentprevHere is a related article from a UK perspective: https://www.cycling-embassy.org.uk/blog/2013/07/03/how-does-... reply Hates_ 4 hours agoparentprevI was pleasantly surprised to find one of the major London cycle lanes that goes from Tower Bridge to Greenwich gives priority to cyclists crossing side roads https://maps.app.goo.gl/b3SweRqzvNehTcE38 reply zelos 7 hours agoparentprevIt's even worse in my UK village. they don't even paint white lines, just the white outline of a bike every few hundred meters on the road. reply ndsipa_pomu 7 hours agorootparentHere's a premium shared use pavement in Bristol (allegedly a \"cycling city\") that shows what you're missing https://maps.app.goo.gl/Gw3SBWT9WdYLDTN3A reply reddalo 6 hours agorootparentlol are you serious?

For some more giggles, here's one of my favourite bits of \"infrastructure\" that's further along that same road (Coronation Rd, A370) on the other side. 5m of faded paint. https://maps.app.goo.gl/znjzJ7bphdqhH5Sk7 reply reddalo 6 hours agorootparentlol that's a place where a modal filter would be perfect; they could make a \"hole\" in the curb to only let bikes go straight through.

Not actually suitable for cycling by an adult operating their vehicle beyond a walking pace. reply globular-toast 6 hours agoparentprevThe problem in the UK is a deep cultural one. First we have to understand that, all things being equal, cars \"win\" by default on the roads. They are bigger, heavier, faster and more powerful (thanks to burning fossil fuels), and the operators are more reckless and inconsiderate due to being shielded from the outside world. That means their presence on the roads automatically makes it more dangerous and unpleasant for everyone else. Second notice that primary routes are always designed for cars first. Every two places has a primary route connecting it. Depending on the importance of the route that route will have some level of protection against things like flooding, subsidence etc. and also be generally higher quality. That primary route is always for cars. Due to the above, that generally makes it undesirable or often practically unavailable for non-motorised traffic. See, for example, dual carriageways. Technically everyone has a right to use them by any means (they have paid for it, after all), but you'd be crazy to walk/cycle down one. Third notice that cars are basically untouchable. It's considered a perfectly acceptable and normal part of driving to put people's lives in danger by driving too close and too fast etc. But nobody dares touch a car. They have the capability of killing or seriously injuring people, but people don't have the capability of killing them (the cars). The police will laugh at you if you report a car driving too closely. But scratching a car or something? Police will be on your case. Basically, we value metal boxes on wheels more than people's bodies. Fourth notice that every part of the road network is designed to make it easier for cars at the detriment of pedestrians and cyclists. Why does a pedestrian need to press a button to cross the road? Why, upon pressing the button, must the pedestrian wait to cross? Why doesn't the light cycle start immediately? There is absolutely no sense at all in making the pedestrian wait. But everyone is used to it and doesn't question it; it's just the way it is. But what it does is makes being a pedestrian a third class status. It's these little things, like having to sit at the back of the bus, that chip away at people's ability to feel like an equal member of society. If you walk or cycle you are under no illusion that you come second to cars. It's little wonder people choose the car if they can. reply ndsipa_pomu 6 hours agorootparent> See, for example, dual carriageways.

Whilst I get that it can be unnerving for most cyclists, dual carriageways are well designed for cycling along as they typically have great visibility (drivers can see you from a distance) and there's a whole lane for drivers to overtake safely. > Fourth notice that every part of the road network is designed to make it easier for cars at the detriment of pedestrians and cyclists.

By the way, I like to refer to the pedestrian crossing buttons as \"beg buttons\". reply Paianni 2 hours agorootparentDual carriageways are ok for cycling when the AADT for a particular road is below about 30k. Above that, cyclists would be an impediment to traffic flow as a following motorist would be waiting a long time for a safe gap in the second lane to overtake, especially when the speed difference is above 100%. reply globular-toast 6 hours agorootparentprev> and there's a whole lane for drivers to overtake safely. But do they actually use it? Last time I biked on a dual carriageway I had cars and lorries passing at 60+mph with a centimetre gap.

I run forwards and rear cameras so that I can report dangerous/close passes. Strangely enough, I've had more issues with driver aggression (e.g. horn sounding) along the A370 than I've had with close passes. Of course, I've reported a fair few close passes in other areas (Avon & Somerset Police seem to be one of the few pro-active forces when it comes to dealing with video submissions). reply Neonlicht 5 hours agorootparentprevWhat makes the Netherlands special is not the bike paths.

I’d argue EVs are more powerful on average, if not the staggering majority of cases. reply r00fus 1 hour agorootparentEVs are much safer - they both accelerate and decelerate faster and most EVs have regen braking by default - this means a) they get up to speed quickly b) drivers aren't worried about slowing because they can get back up to speed much faster c) as soon as the foot comes off the pedal the car start decelerating immediately. This makes for a more chill ride - I'm much more aware in EVs than I am in my remaining ICE vehicle (a minivan).

It is, in fact, not at all relevant to the conversation. The easiest thing is to stay on topic, wouldn't you agree? reply mattlondon 6 hours agorootparentprevThe roads are paid for in a large part by road taxes and fuel taxes. Cyclists pay zero towards it in direct taxation, apart from general taxation that everyone pays anyway. Why should cyclists be able to free load off of infrastructure paid for by tax-paying vehicles, and dictate that they are built to favour cyclists when they are not contributing a single penny? Also your point about being \"near\" is kinda ridiculous. The police would take an interest if someone cut your skin deliberately, but would equally not take any interest if you just walked near a car. You're comparing apples to oranges. I agree on your point about waiting to cross as a pedestrian though. It is often quite unreasonable for multiple people to be standing there - often in rain or other inclement weather - waiting for a single person in their nice dry car to drive past. Life is too short to care about these trifling matters really though isn't it? Sure, die on this hill if you want but for most people it is easier to just buy an electric car, pay the taxes, and move on with the important things in life. Life isn't fair - if you want to dedicate your ire to something unjust then there are IMO better causes to champion than the first world problem of not having nice cycle lanes in an otherwise safe and secure developed first world democratic country with low infant mortality, high quality water, universal free healthcare, and high adult literacy levels.

Cyclists pay zero towards it in direct taxation, apart from general taxation that everyone pays anyway. Why should cyclists be able to free load off of infrastructure paid for by tax-paying vehicles, and dictate that they are built to favour cyclists when they are not contributing a single penny? The bulk of road funding is from general taxation in most places (including the UK, I think?). To put a bit of a spin on your argument, most tax is paid by urban areas, with rural areas generally being a funds sink. So, should rural areas really get roads at all? See how silly that is? reply ben-schaaf 3 hours agorootparentprevI always find this argument really funny because I wholeheartedly agree that taxes should be relative to the usage/damage of roads.

The fuel duty has been frozen for a long time (15 years?) so the general public are in fact subsidising motorists. \"Road Tax\" was abolished in 1937 due to the ridiculous attitude that some motorists get about \"owning\" the roads - this seems to be exactly your kind of attitude. I wonder if you've thought about the logical conclusion of your \"ideas\" when applied to electric vehicles? They don't pay VED (emmissions tax, which is often referred to as \"road tax\" by idiots) and they don't pay fuel tax, so what are they doing on \"your\" public roads? reply analog31 6 hours agorootparentprevIn my locale, in the US, local roads are paid for by property taxes. The higher traffic state and Federal roads are paid for through a combination of fuel and income taxes. Cyclists tend to avoid those roads due to safety and distance. Cycles are prohibited on our equivalent of the motorways. Most cyclists in the US also have cars, and are paying for license, registration, and insurance. Higher insurance rates are necessary because cars get in more crashes. Meanwhile, bikes take up less space and do negligible damage to roads, and to other things like vehicles and stationary objects. A more useful model is that we all pay to subsidize heavy trucking. But also, each person paying for goodies that they don't use but someone else does, is kind of how a modern society works. It would be vastly more expensive to administer a society in which each person is charged a fee in precise proportion to the facilities and services that they use.

There isn't really a big difference in the total space available, in my limited experience. You can find a big difference for a photo op, sure. Based on where I have been, I guess the big difference is that the Dutch allocate continuous space to bikes and the British have a patchwork of bike space and parked cars. The Dutch use of space seems more effective, the space they use for bikes is connected, rather than unconnected/ineffective bits. But note that on the first photo, you see four streets meeting at an intersection, that's eight sides, and there are cars parked on only two of the eight.

It just means you can't use an off-the-shelf design. Just like the UK, most towns and cities weren't designed for a mix of cars and low-speed traffic. They predate cars by quite a bit, so they are now pretty cramped. The average urban area in The Netherlands back in the 1960s-1970s looked very much like the UK does now. Infrastructure has to be designed case-by-case, because no two neighborhoods are ever exactly the same. You might start out with a menu of a few dozen common designs, but they are always modified to fit the specific location. Often that means making compromises, but achieving 90% of your goals is already a lot better than 0%. If it can be done in The Netherlands, there's no reason it can't be done in the UK as well. reply ndsipa_pomu 6 hours agorootparentprevThe UK isn't alone in having old narrow streets, so it's just a case of re-allocating space.

Look at the pedestrian side, they only cross a single lane where they have to look in a single direction. This makes pedestrian behaviour so obvious that its hard to miss someone looking straight at you while you're crossing. Same with car behaviour, no matter where the car is, the nose is pointing straight at you before crossing the conflict zone. The line of communication you have before a potential accident is insanely useful. It does not matter wether a stop sign or right of way was there if you're dead. The \"buffer\" reduces decision complexity even more because people treat them like train blocks. The only annoyance I have is when people actually break-and-check at these points even though its better to roll the car slowly trough to save the people right behind from brake checking entire queues. reply dmurray 8 hours agoparentprevThe article doesn't deal with what happens when the queue gets bigger than one. It looks like a second car would queue on the main road, blocking traffic. To eliminate this you could turn the buffer into a whole extra lane with room for say 5 cars to queue, but this would compromise on the nice feature where the partially turned car gets to completely turn and have great vision of the cycle lanes in both directions. It's an interesting article, but from a systems design perspective I'd be much more interested in how they handle a change in requirements like \"there are now five times more cars turning left here than the intersection was designed for\". reply desas 8 hours agorootparentBuild more bike lanes. To an extent, it's a self-solving problem. If you have great non-car transport options and an increase in traffic makes car driving less appealing, then more people will use those non-car transport options rather than joining the queue. reply vanderZwan 8 hours agorootparentAnd an often forgotten point: this benefits people who have to drive cars too, since there are less cars on the car road! reply mrweasel 6 hours agorootparentprev> Build more bike lanes. The problem is that you may not have the room for it. The US might often have more room to retro-fit bike lanes, due to their roads be generally pretty wide. European cities, like Copenhagen have a massive issue as more and more people get things like cargo bikes and electric bikes. The bike lanes needs to be expanded to accommodate them, but there's no room. You'd have to remove cars from large parts of the city, which sounds great, except you do need to have the option to drive, either due to distances, public transport or deliveries. You can't do parking and have people walk, because there's also no room for parking. For some cities I also don't see bike lanes as solving to much. Some cities, again often in the US have a huge area and millions of people. Distances in cities like Houston, New York, Los Angeles or Atlanta are just insane, taking up enough space to cover half of a small European nation. reply hehehheh 7 hours agorootparentprevebikes mean you dont need to be that fit (or sweat) either. reply lqet 8 hours agorootparentprevAt least where I live, such a type of intersection is used when a residential street branches off a large main road. You do not have a high volume of traffic going into this residential street, and \"waiting for a crossing cyclist\" does only take 1-2 seconds. So a buffer size of 1 is usually enough. reply CalRobert 8 hours agorootparentprevThe backpressure is a feature and ensures people like me take a bike and train to work instead of driving reply dspillett 7 hours agorootparentprev> when the queue gets bigger than one. It looks like a second car would queue on the main road, blocking traffic. Without the buffer, a single car wanting to turn that way when there is a cycle in the lane would block traffic, unless of course the car takes priority and just expects the cyclist to deal with them cutting in front (which is my experience too often at junctions with or without cycle lanes…). In either case, with or without this design, the car slowing down to turn is going to create some back pressure if the road is busy, there is no avoiding that and this design might even actually slightly reduce that issue. Looking at the picture I assume that most vehicles are going to be going straight on, and when someone is turning the only extra delay is when their need to turn coincides with there being cyclists or pedestrians in range of crossing, so it is likely that none of this back pressure is a problem the vast majority of the time. reply Scarblac 7 hours agorootparentprevIf that happens rarely, then the cars just have to queue for a few seconds, no big deal. If it becomes structural, say the neighbourhood becomes larger and substantially more cars will go there now, then the intersection will be redesigned.

The photo description for \"Here you can see that a car drivers waiting for people cycling are never in the way of other people in cars\" would not hold true in my area of a US. There would quickly be at least two additional cars waiting in the main lane. reply hencq 32 minutes agorootparentYeah, it's important to note that this design is specifically for local side streets that are only expected to get destination traffic. If it's a busier street, there would typically be a separate turning lane, i.e. a bigger buffer. reply tralarpa 7 hours agoparentprev> Makes me wonder how much traffic planning and distributed systems could learn from each other I don't know any concrete example, but since road engineers have been using queueing theory, originally invented for telecommunication networks, for more than 70 years, I would be surprised if models and tools designed for one use case had not been reused for the other. reply jalk 7 hours agorootparentThink it was the Tannebaum Networking book which has a chapter on queuing theory.

In fact this is what I've seen living here in Amsterdam for a few years, every once in a while they remove a lane or two from some street and beef up these security features as well as add more pedestrian space.

There are tons of times when you remove lanes and it improves are keeps flow constant. 4 lane roads are the worst, you can get the same effect with a 2 lane with a turn.

My memories of living in the UK is that there's a weird disconnect where \"everyone walks\" so walkers are treated as in-group and supported in their hobbies of walking, while \"only lycra-clad fitness freaks cycle\" so they're an out-group and demonised.

The cars here give you no leeway so if you are slightly late in crossing (and there's only about 3 seconds between the \"hurry up the lights gonna change soon\" flashing light to the cars getting a green light) then you have no place to stop / slow and look if there's any bikes coming. After that you are directly in a pedestrian crossing zebra zone in the island, which then throws you into anther bike crossing, another pedestrian zone and then finally crossing the other three lanes of traffic.

For intersections where they expect more turning traffic (where the one car buffer wouldn't be enough), they add turning lanes that can accomodate more than one car.

Even proper, separated bike lanes often terminate in right turn lanes for cars (even in places where there is a lot of bikes and in places where there would be a lot of space), leading to weird situations where a car is trapped in a wall of cyclists from every side.

I live and bike daily in Amsterdam and it took me about a minute to fully understand what's going on here. The picture seems to show a special case where the intersecting road is bike only, and instead of the normal painted arrows that show where bikes should queue up when making a left, there's an open area off to the left where one would wait behind the \"shark teeth\". FYI if you are ever biking here in NL, the thing to remember is that if the \"haaientanden\" point at you, watch out!, as that means you do not have the right of way. Edit: The side roads are for cars as well, which means you have a strange turning lane in the middle of the intersection where traffic might back up. A simple roundabout seems like a much better solution here unless the goal is to keep cars moving quickly and the turn lane is rarely used. reply coolgoose 8 hours agoparentI never understood why people have a tough time understanding the lovely shark teeth signs. It's literally a painted give way sign. reply hellweaver666 8 hours agoparentprevFellow Amsterdam resident here, this kind of layout is very common all over the city (I live in the south of the city but I have seen these all over). reply itronitron 8 hours agoparentprevCan someone explain this, the italicized part below, in more detail? >> When you approach from the side street, as a driver, the order of dealing with other traffic is different, but the priority is similar. First you will notice a speed bump. The complete intersection is on a raised table. Pedestrians would not have priority if the street was level, but now that it isn’t the “exit construction” rule could apply and in that case a crossing pedestrian would have priority. But for that rule to apply the footway should be continuous, and that is not the case here. reply miggol 6 hours agorootparentThis is a part of the national design language of the roads in The Netherlands. Almost universally the following two rules hold: pedestrians walk on a raised pavement next to the road, and through roads have priority. To compliment those existing rules, exits from side streets where pedestrians on the through road have priority include a raised hump that brings motorists up to pavement level. That emphasizes that it is the motorist who is crossing into a pedestrian area, where pedestrians have priority. The pedestrian footpath is continuous, while the car road is interrupted. Here's a typical example of the \"exit construction\" with continuous footway: https://rijbewijshulp.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Uitrit-7... And an obvious added benefit is that motorists will slow down for the speed bump. The author phrases this a bit awkwardly without really making a point. But what I think they are saying is that because the footpath isn't continuous despite the raised bump this is not a typical exit construction, and pedestrians on the through road don't have priority. Even though most motorists would yield to them anyway because of the shark's teeth on the cycle path. I think it's debatable if the pavement is continuous or not, I would say \"kinda\". But either way the intersection in the article is not a \"typical\" example of the exit construction. reply Freak_NL 6 hours agorootparentThe linked photo actually shows a really bad example. For the 'exit construction' to be valid, the footway must continue uninterrupted with the same surface. In this example, different pavers where used, making the situation ambiguous. See the pictures in this article: https://www.anwb.nl/juridisch-advies/in-het-verkeer/verkeers... The first two examples are how it should be done. The third is similar to your link, and is ambiguous. I've had a cyclist curse me to hell and back for taking priority on one of those raised tables as a pedestrian because the paving didn't match the sidewalk. :) reply itronitron 4 hours agorootparentprevIs there priority for the pedestrian if they are already crossing the side street when a car driving down the side street approaches the intersection, or can the pedestrian be run over by the car without consequence to the driver? reply palotasb 7 hours agorootparentprevhttps://www.theorieexamen.nl/theory-exam/what-is-a-entrance-... An entrance or exit construction is a place on a road where you aren't just turning onto the road but exiting the road entirely. The most common example from any country would be a private driveway. Pedestrians, cyclists and cars going along the sidewalk, bike path or road have priority against anyone turning into the driveway or turning onto the road from the driveway. The Netherlands generalizes this concept to some low-priority side streets. If there is a continuous sidewalk (i.e., the cars go up a bump to the level of the sidewalk as opposed to the pedestrians stepping down from the sidewalk to the level of the street). This is not the case in this specific intersection. reply itronitron 7 hours agorootparentAnd yet the photo in the article shows piano teeth markings before the shark teeth, which indicates a level change for the car. In that case I would assume that cars are required to yield to pedestrians crossing the side street even though the sidewalk surface is not continuous. reply Out_of_Characte 7 hours agorootparentprevThat's some word salad but let me make things clear, All intersections have signs indicating priority. All intersections have road markings indicating right of way. All intersections have a level change indicating priority. Either you bump up to pedestrians, which also reduces your speed. Or pedestrians step down to asphalt. All intersections have/dont have color change to indicate right of way. All intersections have/dont have pavement type indicating right of way (usually bricks for street or pedestrians, black asphalt for roads, red asphalt for cyclists.) Although you could probaly find some rulebreakers in there, its universally accepted as such. reply Etheryte 7 hours agoparentprevThese types of interactions are pretty much everywhere outside of historical city centers and the like where you don't have space for it. You might not find them in the old town of Ams, but as soon as you head out a bit, you see them everywhere. Same in Delft and pretty much anywhere else with historic architecture. reply gpvos 8 hours agoparentprevI haven't read the entire article, but this is a very common situation: main road with two cycle paths crosses a minor road (or has two side roads at the same place). All roads are also for cars. I'm not sure why the article makes such a difference between the two side roads: they seem quite similar apart from the one-car waiting space before the cycle path. reply alexanderchr 8 hours agoparentprevYeah there is not really space for these eleborate intersections in central Amsterdam. Most are signal controlled or pure spaghetti with trams coming from four directions with almost absolute priority, like this one https://www.google.com/maps/place/52%C2%B021'49.1%22N+4%C2%B... reply vanderZwan 8 hours agoparentprevIn general, separate bike lines are nothing special in the Netherlands, even in Amsterdam. However, it's an old, compact city with narrow streets, so you're unlikely to see these types of intersections in those streets. Same is true for other old city centers with compact layouts. You're more likely to see this if you go to places with more space, such as suburbs built in the last century (which basically means going to another town or city that Amsterdam grew into, because in the Netherlands city distribution is also compact). As you can see from the picture this street is in such a neighborhood. Also, the general concept of having a distance of one car between crossing and bike lane is universal whenever there is space. I can give you a personal anecdote (at the cost of doxxing myself). I grew up in Oldeberkoop, a tiny village with around 1500 people in it that somehow has its own wikipedia page[0]. Just outside of the village is a crossing with an N-road, which is Dutch for \"provincial national road but not quite highway\". In the early nineties it was still a simple crossing, no separate bike lanes, and I recall traffic accidents happening once or twice every year. For context, nowadays the speed limit on provincial roads is 100 km/h[2], although in the early nineties it was still 80 km/h. That didn't matter though: everyone was speeding as if they were on a highway and going 120 to 140 km/h. In mid nineties the crossing was changed to a roundabout, solving the speeding problem, and separate bike lanes were added (this also reduced traffic noise a lot). In the early 2000s the roundabout was changed to the safer design described in the article: more space between corner and bike lane, and a bigger island in the middle of the road for pedestrians[3]. I haven't heard of any incidents in the years since. Recall: this is a village of 1500 people. When the article says: > I would like to emphasise that this intersection is not special in any way. You can find many similar examples all over the country. That is because the design features stem from the design manuals which are used throughout the country. ... it is not exaggerating. This is the norm with any new intersection that is being built, or any existing one that is due for its two-decade maintenance.

The “urban” in the title is a bit misleading, this intersection is definitely more suburban, or on the boundary of an urban center. (Or rather, the author has a different definition of urban - in my definition cities like den Bosch are really just a small medieval urban core surrounded by continuous medium-density suburban neighborhoods.) reply schrijver 7 hours agorootparentIn my experience, cars are discouraged from city centres, but not banned. You can drive your car all around Amsterdam, although you’ll have many one way streets and parking is going to very expensive for non-residents… and it’s hard (but not impossible) to find street level parking. Amsterdam has a number of car parks in the outskirts that are cheap if you can show that you used public transport afterwards. The result is that people use their car (if they have one, still quite common esp. for families) to get out of the city, or big errands, but use bike or public transport for day to day trips. Actual car free zones exist in cities across Europe but tend to be pretty small and constrained to the hyper centre, like the church square and the major shopping streets. Not that I’m opposed to them being bigger but that seems rare at this point. reply peoplefromibiza 8 hours agorootparentprev> Such old urban places would just be car-free in the Netherlands that's the hardest part that everyone always ignores. first you have to remove cars from the streets, than it's becomes easier to implement biking infrastructures.

And in those parts of the city where space is basically free, people live too far from where they need to go by bike anyway.

    "originBody": "Best Hail-Mary Revenue for Publishers 2024 Google stops letting sites like Forbes rule search for “Best CBD Gummies“ If you've noticed strange sites on \"Best\" product searches, so has Google. Kevin Purdy – Nov 20, 2024 7:47 PM124 Credit: Getty Images Credit: Getty Images Text settings \"Updating our site reputation abuse policy\" is how Google, in wondrously opaque fashion, announced yesterday that big changes have come to some big websites, especially those that rely on their domain authority to promote lucrative third-party product recommendations. If you've searched for reviews and seen results that make you ask why so many old-fashioned news sites seem to be \"reviewing\" products lately—especially products outside that site's expertise—that's what Google is targeting. \"This is a tactic where third-party content is published on a host site in an attempt to take advantage of the host's already-established ranking signals,\" Google's post on its Search Central blog reads. \"The goal of this tactic is for the content to rank better than it could otherwise on a different site, and leads to a bad search experience for users.\" Search firm Sistrix cited the lost traffic to the third-party review content inside Forbes, The Wall Street Journal, CNN, Fortune, and Time as worth $7.5 million last week, according to AdWeek. Search rankings dropped by up to 97 percent at Time's affiliate review site, Time Stamped, and 43 percent at Forbes Advisor. The drops are isolated to the affiliate subdomains of the sites, so their news-minded primary URLs still rank where relevant. ARS VIDEO Trusted names in CBD gummies and pet insurance The \"site reputation abuse\" Google is targeting takes many forms, but it has one common theme: using an established site's domain history to quietly sell things. Forbes, a well-established business news site, has an ownership stake in Forbes Marketplace (named Forbes Advisor in site copy) but does not fully own it. Under the strength of Forbes' long-existing and well-linked site, Forbes Marketplace/Advisor has dominated the search term \"best cbd gummies\" for \"an eternity,\" according to SEO analyst Lily Ray. Forbes has similarly dominated \"best pet insurance,\" and long came up as the second result for \"how to get rid of roaches,\" as detailed in a blog post by Lars Lofgren. If people click on this high-ranking result, and then click on a link to buy a product or request a roach removal consultation, Forbes typically gets a cut. Forbes Marketplace had seemingly also provided SEO-minded review services to CNN and USA Today, as detailed by Lofgren. Lofgren's term for this business, \"Parasite SEO,\" took hold in corners critical of the trend. Ars has contacted Forbes for comment and will update this post with response. “The unfair, exploitative nature” of “parasite SEO” Google writes that it had reviewed \"situations where there might be varying degrees of first-party involvement\" (most publishers' review sites indicate some kind of oversight or editorial standards linked to the primary site). But however arranged, \"no amount of first-party involvement alters the fundamental third-party nature of the content or the unfair, exploitative nature of attempting to take advantage of the host sites' ranking signals.\" As such, using third-party content in such a way as to take advantage of a high search quality ranking, outside the site's primary focus, is considered spam. That delivers a major hit to a site's Google ranking, and the impact is already being felt. The SEO reordering does not affect more established kinds of third-party content, like wire service reports, syndication, or well-marked sponsored content, as detailed in Google's spam policy section about site reputation abuse. As seen on the SEO subreddit, and on social media, Google has given sites running afoul of its updated policy a \"Manual Action\" rather than relying only on its algorithm to catch the often opaque arrangements.

I think often about Mahalo, the sleazy shovel content that was spamming the web back in 2007. Google shut that down somewhat fast, although it did take several years. These days with AI and more aggressive spammers it's a losing battle. The real problem is the financial incentives that make this kind of spamming profitable in the first place.

Yeah, but the financial incentives exist on both ends. There's a gross symbiotic relationship between Google and SEO spammers, because Google also owns the ad network the spammers put on their page. If Google puts ad-laden SEO blogspam as the top result and a user clicks it, the user sees a bunch of ads from Google. Everyone wins: Google, the SEO spammers, and advertisers.

For the longest time they followed the usual neoliberal economist trope that markets solve everything optimally. As a result they have created in the so-called \"big tech\" conglomerates a monster fit for the history books, the most broken and cornered market there ever was. But a wholly government run search engine is not a solution. There are inherent biases in both constructing and presenting indices. You dont want to further stoke the anti-commons mistrust of polarized societies. What the public sector could do is fund all the background techonologies to make it easy to have much larger numbers of search engines. Some of those assembled services could be completely open source, others could be value adding with various added services and customizations. In any case the status quo is a disaster that has no future. Its effectively a forced dumbification of society as it artificially suppresses the flow of high-quality public information.

Web search has always been an extremely messy solution to many problems. Think about the premise: type in anything, and somehow it will read your mind, intuit who you are and what you really wanted, find the exact thing amid the morass of the whole web, and then give it to you? That's impossible. So it uses tricks to make it seem like it worked. It uses information about you to refine results. It uses curated, human-edited search and result heuristics for the most common or difficult search queries. It uses a giant corups of data, and shows you things that are like what you wanted. You don't notice that it isn't giving you the best result, because there are so many mediocre-but-acceptable results to look at. And it doesn't have to work perfectly every time, because we can \"sift through\" results and \"refine\" our search. Often we are flooded with results that are targeted at us, rather than what we want, because, remember: Google is an advertising company, and the entire Web is now a shopping mall, where either you're being sold-to, or you're just being sold. You will get results, and they will sort-of seem like what you wanted, so you will just sort of sigh and accept it. Because what other option is there? There are more intelligent, more accurate, more safe, ways to solve the problems people have, that are not \"a search engine\".

There is no corporate-curated algorithm that is up to the task, especially when the primary purpose is to profit from advertising. reply jfengel 19 hours agorootparentGoogle is remarkably effective at handling the scale. It doesn't seem up for handling the sheer army dedicated to misleading it. Especially now that they've been given tools for automating crap generation. Ironically, Google itself was a key developer of that tech. If there is any solution it would seem to involve removing the incentive to merely look at your page. That problem seems remarkably stubborn. reply amanaplanacanal 6 hours agorootparentIt \"doesn't seem up for handling\" it because it profits from showing you those ad laden sites. It's intentional, not incompetence. reply jfengel 4 hours agorootparentI think that they'd rather show you the right answers, if they can. Those sites will often have exactly the same ads, and they won't make you think about jumping ship to Bing or Kagi. And advertisers will pay more for sites that actually have good reputations. Search engines are the picks-and-shovels of the Internet gold rush. They profit either way. They want to do it in a way that keeps the gravy train going. I'm no starry-eyed capitalist.

There are loads more hits like the above and they are nearly all wrong. The RPI distribution is based on Debian Linux but has a few differences.

It would probably be an article written by professional writers in a trustworthy publication with a strong ethics policy, provably followed over the years, concerning whether they accept payment for promoting specific products in supposedly impartial reviews.

Google has been fighting against SEO spammers since the very beginning, in fact there was keyword stuffing even before there was Google. Google at some point made a decision to privilege sites like Forbes because they were dealing with hundreds of subprime sites that looked even sketchier. Rather than playing whac-a-mole with new spammers every month as they change the rules they could put sites like Forbes and Wirecutter on top, ultimately discouraging other SEO spammers from even trying, and being able to manage the relationship. (e.g. if you see Forbes rank for \"best CBD gummies\" just once it looks a little sketchy but you get over it, you only really catch the bad smell after you've done 5,000 searches and see Forbes ranks so high on so many of them) I've been working with a financial analyst to quantify the value of online engagement (what value does YC get from an HN comment? what value do users get from it?) and reviews are one of the clearest examples since a review adds or subtracts revenue from a vendor and gives customers a certain amount of satisfaction.

I think it's a really attractive package for an early-stage one-person project. Nice docs, and cute bunny. FWIW, it also seems super-sensible to focus on Mac only for now, and get the basics working well there — a good Mac DX could provide the traction/momentum to get more contributors to help build out the obvious cross-platform promise. reply klabb3 14 hours agorootparent> it also seems super-sensible to focus on Mac only for now I’m the first guy to agree to reduced scope, but unfortunately the reality of cross platform is that the subtle details affect the APIs, and once you add more platforms, you can realize issues too late. As a simple example, MacOS has a concept of “showing/activating the app” whereas Windows has… well individual windows. They add up, especially if you add mobile to the mix. I think the most sensible is to keep the api surface small, and also to peek at electron, tauri etc to learn and try not making expensive mistakes. reply brailsafe 13 hours agorootparentprevYa, I kind of hate to say it, but it feels like because of Window's backwards compatibility and variation in UI styles over the years, people expect Mac apps to be comparatively pretty consistent, and consistently good. There's some wiggle room, but usually it's some niche open source app that's just too generally useful to prioritize mac reply dmazzoni 14 hours agoprevI'm a fan of more frameworks for desktop apps that wrap system webview rather than embedding Chromium. Chromium is awesome and all, but it's just way overkill for many apps, and doesn't make sense for the download size and the need to support auto-update for security features. reply hresvelgr 14 hours agoparentI feel the reason the system web-view is eschewed in these frameworks is because you have no choice but to maintain compatibility with 3-4 browsers: Edge/IE on Windows, Safari on Mac, and Firefox on Linux (usually). reply thayne 13 hours agorootparent> Firefox on Linux (usually). No, linux is usually webkit (which is also what safari is based on). Both Gtk and Qt have webkit-based widgets. I'm not aware of a gecko based webview for desktop. Unfortunately, Firefox's technology is even more poorly suited for embedding than chromium's. reply Klonoar 2 hours agorootparentWebkitGTK has notoriously lagged behind Webkit on other platforms. reply yoav 14 hours agorootparentprevThe number 1 request I get from people is to add the ability to optionally bundle chromium. I personally prefer the system webview because you don’t have to rush update your app for every chromium security update. And on the web making things cross browser is a normal part of the job and instinct imo. But there are a ton of early startups that only have bandwidth to support chrome/chromium in their complex webapps and want a quick way to port their web app to desktop app. For them taking on the security burden and increasing bundle size is a good tradeoff to getting that consistency. Luckily electrobun has a custom zig bsdiff implementation that generates update diffs as small as 4KB and self extracting executable that uses zstd so at least the file size is less relevant of a concern compared to electron. reply lolinder 12 hours agorootparent> you don’t have to rush update your app for every chromium security update I'm interested to hear more about this—if you're using security-sensitive features in a WebView, aren't you then at the mercy of the OS to patch them whenever they see fit? And if you're not using features that have security implications, why do you need the latest version of Chromium at all times? reply littlestymaar 12 hours agorootparentprev> But there are a ton of early startups that only have bandwidth to support chrome/chromium in their complex webapps and want a quick way to port their web app to desktop app. Ugh! People writing web apps without supporting anything else than Chrome should burn in hell.

Project name suggests Electron, but they never mention it > The current Electrobun Playground app is 50.4MB in size (most of this is the bun runtime) Seems to be more than just bun runtime. reply klabb3 4 hours agoparentElectron is not a rendering engine. It’s an application bundler, which itself bundles Chromium and NodeJS. This project uses native web views, like Tauri. They wrote that they might provide the option of bundling your own engine, ie like Electron, which I personally think it’s a bad idea. Tauri proved that you don’t need it. But now that you mention it, agreed that 50MB is a lot.. maybe just standard JS dep bloat? That could be clarified. reply yoav 5 hours agoprevHey hn! Author here: Thanks to whoever submitted. Electrobun is in the very early stages. The roadmap is a bit out of date. Here are some highlights: - it’s like Tauri in that it uses the system webview and does not bundle chromium - it’s like Electron in that it bundles Bun instead of Node for the main process so you just write typescript for both the main and browser contexts - native bindings written in c/objc with a zig wrapper that the bun process runs - it will be cross platform, but working on stability first - the cli handles updates code signing and everything else you need and outputs build artifacts that you just need to upload to S3 or any static file host. - it has a custom optimized bsdiff implementation in zig that autogenerates updates for your app as small as 4KB - it has a custom zig self extracting mechanism that uses zstd so your initial download is also as small as can be. - it has a custom encrypted easy to use RPC mechanism between bun and browser processes where you just write method signatures and handlers. - it has a custom OOPIF implementation so you can embed isolated browser contexts with your htmlelement that are performant and easy to use so you could build a multi tab web browser with it if you wanted. reply pmuk 13 minutes agoparentDo you have any examples apps built on electrobun? reply jacobgorm 4 hours agoparentprevTauri also uses the system webview and does not bundle Chromium, right? reply bsimpson 4 hours agoparentprevIt looks like you also have a thing that used to be called EggBun and is now called co(lab).

To me it looks like OS-specifics aren't dealt with in the project. It uses bun to run the TypeScript. From the getting started docs the project just opens a browser window for the UI. I didn't look to see if this meant the user's default browser or a bundled browser. reply yoav 16 hours agorootparentNative bindings written in c/objc and a zig binary that bun spawns. reply semireg 17 hours agoparentprevA: native bindings written in zig reply bitsandboots 9 hours agoprevAs an alternative to electron, using bun as a base sounds nice.

But it's on my xmas wishlist :) reply bobajeff 15 hours agoprev>Security and Performance with isolation between the main and webview processes That's one of the performance characteristics I'm afraid will hinder certain applications. It sounds like you need to use a IPC bridge to share data between the main process and renderor. Which means copying all the shared data. Like if I wanted to use ffmpeg for decoding video then each frame I'm waiting for a the decoded image to be copied before rendering it. reply yoav 15 hours agoparentOriginally I had it going via browser -> postmessage -> zig -> bun via named pipes and then bun -> zig via named pipe -> js via evaluate js. I’m building https://colab.sh/ with electrobun and that rpc was pretty slow when trying to load multi MB files in the code editor. Last week I added an encrypted socket rpc option directly between bun and browser. Loading a 2MB file went from a few seconds to 400ms. I made it so that in contexts where CORS allows it automatically upgrades to the socket based faster RPC. That’s via RPC though. electrobun also exposes a custom views:// scheme in the browser context that can load files directly from specific sandboxed places in the file system. More to improve there but for a very big file you’d be better off writing it to the file system that would be much faster. reply afavour 15 hours agoparentprevEh, it’ll hinder certain applications but very few, really. Assuming the webview is intended for UI and very little else. reply PittleyDunkin 6 hours agoprevAny plan for supporting native toolkit access ala react-native, or is the plan to just rely on web tech? reply dboreham 7 hours agoprevNever understood why these things aren't done by running a local http server and use a regular browser. reply whizzter 6 hours agoparentDeveloping for Electron you usually had a regular webpack server in the background to handle hot-reload cases and technically you could have a regular browser. In production however you don't want a browser for 2 reasons, first should a local app really expose internals to the network(And get mucked up by firewalls)? secondly the deployment is easier the more it's self-contained. Also since there are internal communication channels between \"browser\" and native/\"server\" parts (that are far faster than going over the network) you don't want to diverge the production and development environment to avoid having hard to debug things. On top of it, in this case bun is also a bundler so you get the typescript transpilation for free. So to summarize, if your app is really only a plain webapp distributed to desktop then sure you can developer everything with a local webserver and package with whatever is available, but as soon as you involve native off-browser parts you don't want to start exposing everything and using the embedding systems(be it electron or webview2/khtml,etc) built in browsernative communication is simply the saner choice and the point of these projects is to abstract that from the developer. reply dymk 5 hours agoparentprevLocal file system access is one reason, any other native APIs needed for making a desktop app, etc reply yard2010 9 hours agoprevYoav, you are a genius.

PHP 8.4 is a major update of the PHP language. It contains many new features, such as property hooks, asymmetric visibility, an updated DOM API, performance improvements, bug fixes, and general cleanup. Upgrade to PHP 8.4 now! Property hooks RFC Doc ¶ PHP setLanguageCode($languageCode); $this->setCountryCode($countryCode); } public function getLanguageCode(): string { return $this->languageCode; } public function setLanguageCode(string $languageCode): void { $this->languageCode = $languageCode; } public function getCountryCode(): string { return $this->countryCode; } public function setCountryCode(string $countryCode): void { $this->countryCode = strtoupper($countryCode); } public function setCombinedCode(string $combinedCode): void { [$languageCode, $countryCode] = explode('_', $combinedCode, 2); $this->setLanguageCode($languageCode); $this->setCountryCode($countryCode); } public function getCombinedCode(): string { return \\sprintf(\"%s_%s\", $this->languageCode, $this->countryCode); } } $brazilianPortuguese = new Locale('pt', 'br'); var_dump($brazilianPortuguese->getCountryCode()); // BR var_dump($brazilianPortuguese->getCombinedCode()); // pt_BR PHP 8.4 class Locale { public string $languageCode; public string $countryCode { set (string $countryCode) { $this->countryCode = strtoupper($countryCode); } } public string $combinedCode { get => \\sprintf(\"%s_%s\", $this->languageCode, $this->countryCode); set (string $value) { [$this->countryCode, $this->languageCode] = explode('_', $value, 2); } } public function __construct(string $languageCode, string $countryCode) { $this->languageCode = $languageCode; $this->countryCode = $countryCode; } } $brazilianPortuguese = new Locale('pt', 'br'); var_dump($brazilianPortuguese->countryCode); // BR var_dump($brazilianPortuguese->combinedCode); // pt_BR Property hooks provide support for computed properties that can natively be understood by IDEs and static analysis tools, without needing to write docblock comments that might go out of sync. Furthermore, they allow reliable pre- or post-processing of values, without needing to check whether a matching getter or setter exists in the class. Asymmetric Visibility RFC Doc ¶ PHP version; } public function increment(): void { [$major, $minor] = explode('.', $this->version); $minor++; $this->version = \"{$major}.{$minor}\"; } } PHP 8.4 class PhpVersion { public private(set) string $version = '8.4'; public function increment(): void { [$major, $minor] = explode('.', $this->version); $minor++; $this->version = \"{$major}.{$minor}\"; } } The scope to write to a property may now be controlled independently from the scope to read the property, reducing the need for boilerplate getter methods to expose a property’s value without allowing modification from the outside of a class. #[\\Deprecated] Attribute RFC Doc ¶ PHP getVersion(); } public function getVersion(): string { return '8.3'; } } $phpVersion = new PhpVersion(); // No indication that the method is deprecated. echo $phpVersion->getPhpVersion(); PHP 8.4 class PhpVersion { #[\\Deprecated( message: \"use PhpVersion::getVersion() instead\", since: \"8.4\", )] public function getPhpVersion(): string { return $this->getVersion(); } public function getVersion(): string { return '8.4'; } } $phpVersion = new PhpVersion(); // Deprecated: Method PhpVersion::getPhpVersion() is deprecated since 8.4, use PhpVersion::getVersion() instead echo $phpVersion->getPhpVersion(); The new #[\\Deprecated] attribute makes PHP’s existing deprecation mechanism available to user-defined functions, methods, and class constants. New ext-dom features and HTML5 support RFC RFC Doc ¶ PHP loadHTML(PHP 8.4 is a feature-rich release! PHP 8.4 adds new DOM classes that are spec-compliant, keeping the old ones for compatibility.HTML, LIBXML_NOERROR, ); $xpath = new DOMXPath($dom); $node = $xpath->query(\".//main/article[not(following-sibling::*)]\")[0]; $classes = explode(\" \", $node->className); // Simplified var_dump(in_array(\"featured\", $classes)); // bool(true) PHP 8.4 $dom = Dom\\HTMLDocument::createFromString(PHP 8.4 is a feature-rich release! PHP 8.4 adds new DOM classes that are spec-compliant, keeping the old ones for compatibility.HTML, LIBXML_NOERROR, ); $node = $dom->querySelector('main > article:last-child'); var_dump($node->classList->contains(\"featured\")); // bool(true) New DOM API that includes standards-compliant support for parsing HTML5 documents, fixes several long-standing compliance bugs in the behavior of the DOM functionality, and adds several functions to make working with documents more convenient. The new DOM API is available within the Dom namespace. Documents using the new DOM API can be created using the Dom\\HTMLDocument and Dom\\XMLDocument classes. Object API for BCMath RFC ¶ PHP0); // false PHP 8.4 use BcMath\\Number; $num1 = new Number('0.12345'); $num2 = new Number('2'); $result = $num1 + $num2; echo $result; // '2.12345' var_dump($num1 > $num2); // false New BcMath\\Number object enables object-oriented usage and standard mathematical operators when working with arbitrary precision numbers. These objects are immutable and implement the Stringable interface, so they can be used in string contexts like echo $num. New array_*() functions RFC ¶ PHPstr_starts_with($value, 'c'), ); var_dump($animal); // string(3) \"cat\" New functions array_find(), array_find_key(), array_any(), and array_all() are available. PDO Driver specific SQL parsers RFC ¶ PHP sqliteCreateFunction( 'prepend_php', static fn ($string) => \"PHP {$string}\", ); $connection->query('SELECT prepend_php(version) FROM php'); PHP 8.4 $connection = PDO::connect( 'sqlite:foo.db', $username, $password, ); // object(Pdo\\Sqlite) $connection->createFunction( 'prepend_php', static fn ($string) => \"PHP {$string}\", ); // Does not exist on a mismatching driver. $connection->query('SELECT prepend_php(version) FROM php'); New subclasses Pdo\\Dblib, Pdo\\Firebird, Pdo\\MySql, Pdo\\Odbc, and Pdo\\Sqlite of PDO are available. new MyClass()->method() without parentheses RFC Doc ¶ PHP getVersion()); PHP 8.4 class PhpVersion { public function getVersion(): string { return 'PHP 8.4'; } } var_dump(new PhpVersion()->getVersion()); Properties and methods of a newly instantiated object can now be accessed without wrapping the new expression in parentheses. New Classes, Interfaces, and Functions ¶ New Lazy Objects. New JIT implementation based on IR Framework. New request_parse_body() function. New bcceil(), bcdivmod(), bcfloor(), and bcround() functions. New RoundingMode enum for round() with 4 new rounding modes TowardsZero, AwayFromZero, NegativeInfinity, and PositiveInfinity. New DateTime::createFromTimestamp(), DateTime::getMicrosecond(), DateTime::setMicrosecond(), DateTimeImmutable::createFromTimestamp(), DateTimeImmutable::getMicrosecond(), and DateTimeImmutable::setMicrosecond() methods. New mb_trim(), mb_ltrim(), mb_rtrim(), mb_ucfirst(), and mb_lcfirst() functions. New pcntl_getcpu(), pcntl_getcpuaffinity(), pcntl_getqos_class(), pcntl_setns(), and pcntl_waitid() functions. New ReflectionClassConstant::isDeprecated(), ReflectionGenerator::isClosed(), and ReflectionProperty::isDynamic() methods. New http_get_last_response_headers(), http_clear_last_response_headers(), and fpow() functions. New XMLReader::fromStream(), XMLReader::fromUri(), XMLReader::fromString(), XMLWriter::toStream(), XMLWriter::toUri(), and XMLWriter::toMemory() methods. New grapheme_str_split() function. Deprecations and backward compatibility breaks ¶ The IMAP, OCI8, PDO_OCI, and pspell extensions have been unbundled and moved to PECL. Implicitly nullable parameter types are now deprecated. Using _ as a class name is now deprecated. Raising zero to the power of a negative number is now deprecated. Passing invalid mode to round() throws ValueError. Class constants from extensions date, intl, pdo, reflection, spl, sqlite, xmlreader are typed now. GMP class is now final. MYSQLI_SET_CHARSET_DIR, MYSQLI_STMT_ATTR_PREFETCH_ROWS, MYSQLI_CURSOR_TYPE_FOR_UPDATE, MYSQLI_CURSOR_TYPE_SCROLLABLE, and MYSQLI_TYPE_INTERVAL constants have been removed. mysqli_ping(), mysqli_kill(), mysqli_refresh() functions, mysqli::ping(), mysqli::kill(), mysqli::refresh() methods, and MYSQLI_REFRESH_* constants have been deprecated. stream_bucket_make_writeable() and stream_bucket_new() now return an instance of StreamBucket instead of stdClass. exit() behavioral change. E_STRICT constant has been deprecated. Better performance, better syntax, improved type safety. Upgrade to PHP 8.4 now! For source downloads of PHP 8.4 please visit the downloads page. Windows binaries can be found on the PHP for Windows site. The list of changes is recorded in the ChangeLog. The migration guide is available in the PHP Manual.

    "commentBody": "PHP 8.4 (php.net)210 points by theThree 8 hours agohidepastfavorite146 comments acabal 1 hour agoI'm most excited for property hooks. Having getters and setters as part of the language syntax was something I dearly missed from my C# days, nearly two decades ago. In my projects I sometimes emulate getters and setters using `__get()` and `__set()` but that's heavy-handed and requires lots of PHPDoc annotation for type checking. Property hooks look awesome! reply foolfoolz 0 minutes agoparentthis was the one feature i read in here thinking “why would anyone want this?” reply Xeoncross 13 minutes agoparentprevI'm curious, why do you like getters and setters? I know the textbook answer is so that every single possible property can become some mutable chain of events so you can swap names or side-effects without the caller knowing, but I've yet to find a use for that in real life. It just leads to builder patterns and other oddities like forced decorators like Java has everywhere. I felt like beans were the realization that perhaps we shouldn't be doing this. reply munk-a 0 minutes agorootparentI've always been a fan because if a property turns from a simple value to a more complex interaction that might involve DB operations or other side effects then if a getter is in place you can modify the logic without needing to update widespread code. reply idoubtit 7 hours agoprevI'm just a PHP programmer for work, but I worry about the orientation PHP has chosen. As French people say: better is the enemy of good (Le mieux est l'ennemi du bien). The two new language features bring a higher language complexity for dubious gains. I hope I won't have to work with these. Property hooks mean that some language magic will turn a property access into a call to methods. It implies that `$this->x` has a different meaning if it's inside a hook or outside hooks. I've used this kind of feature (getters/setters) with JS code (and with Moose/Perl decades ago), and I wasn't convinced. Plain methods are more explicit, have less cognitive charge, and are easier to extend. On the bright side, I'm glad that the language is still thriving. In 2021, I was worried when the foundation was created, especially as I read that Nikita Popov had left. He was the creator of PHP's JIT code, and at the time the only developer who could fully understand it. But it seems there was no need to worry. PHP is now longer \"the elephant in the room\" of web programming, but it's still a good language, with many active developers at its core. reply ok123456 2 hours agoparentThis feature has been in C# since about 2.0, and it's been an overall positive. It reduces boilerplate and inconsistencies in different programmers doing the boiler-plate differently. It also gives static analysis tools semantic information about the structure of your classes. It can group pairs of methods that deal with the encapsulation of fields. reply crowcroft 2 hours agorootparentI am also in favour of the change. I would argue though that because it's been in C# for so long, then yes it reduces inconsistencies across programmers/codebases, but introducing it to a language as mature as PHP is now though, might not have the same outcome. reply ok123456 2 hours agorootparentI used it immediately in my C# code at the time. It was a breath of fresh air not to have code that looked like \"enterprise\" java. reply signal11 49 minutes agorootparentprevIt’s interesting to consider the “magic” criticism in the context of languages like Zig, where devs actively want no hidden control flow. And Properties beyond simple { get; set; } are definitely hidden control flow. But as you said — it’s been there in C# for a while and imho it’s a good abstraction over getters and setters. Even 2005-era IDEs could manage it fine, making it easy to access the property’s get/set code, so that it wasn’t really magical. Maybe it’s a culture thing — most C# devs use IDEs. Not sure what PHP devs use, but I suspect tools like PhpStorm will make this easy to work with somehow. Devs using no-LSP editors will likely have a different view. reply James_K 39 minutes agorootparentprevEvery step on the path to bloat is justified. reply brtkdotse 2 hours agorootparentprevMy experience is that 99% of the work related to geters and seters is handled by the IDE reply ok123456 2 hours agorootparentThis encapsulation style for OOP is standard; the language should support it and not require additional design patterns or IDE tools. An argument could be made for adding a sigil so the class user knows this isn't a dumb field, but then if someone wants to upgrade a dumb field to this, as Python encourages, they would need to modify every use. reply Shorel 2 hours agoparentprevI just checked the code samples from the article/post. Property hooks look awesome, they fix something that's my main pain point in PHP nowadays. All these getters and setters manually coded make it feel like Java. Just completely boring and unusable without some fancy IDE that types all that boilerplate. It is one great feature of C# that I'm glad PHP is adopting. This code is also easier to extend than the Java-like sea of getters and setters. (I don't consider any mention of JS code as a valid comparison, if anything we are better ignoring JS existence unless forced to do some frontend) reply klaussilveira 1 hour agoparentprevI feel the opposite: this brings simplicity and pragmatism back to PHP. Gone are the years of bowing to the verbosity of Java, sacrificing a dynamic powerful language at the altar of 1995's OOP paradigms. reply cutler 1 hour agorootparentSeriously? Since 5.3 PHP has worshiped at the alter of Java OOP to the extent that writing PHP code is now an exercise in pseudo-Java. reply klaussilveira 1 hour agorootparentYes, that is correct. And this release marks a point where the language is officially moving away from that. reply jacobyoder 2 hours agoparentprevI'd tried to put together an RFC years ago to introduce groovy-style accessors in PHP. $this->foo would look for a getFoo() method, and execute if it existed, or not if not. Felt like that was easier to reason about, fwiw, but I couldn't get it off the ground. Even then, there were multiple C#-style get/set proposals floating around, so this style seems to be the one more people like. Not a fan of the style, personally, and probably won't use these much directly any time soon. If it helps people maintaining libraries that I use to deliver code that is cleaner and more productive to them... I'm OK with that. reply wvenable 31 minutes agorootparentI'm not a fan of that kind of magic in my languages but such a thing was already easily doable in PHP. You could just have a base class that implements __get and __set so that $this->foo automatically calls $this->getFoo(). reply beberlei 7 hours agoparentprevJust to set the record straight, Nikita is not the creator of the PHP JIT code, that is Dmitry and he is employed by Zend owned by Perforce working mostly on this. reply idoubtit 6 hours agorootparentThanks for correcting me, and sorry for the error. I should have checked before writing. reply alt227 2 hours agoparentprevI agree. PHP is such a simple language to follow but now with these property hooks, if you dont fully understand how they work then the code becomes unreadable due to the magic. Worse than that, it is possible to read it wrongly which is going to cause many nasty headaches for amateur developers of the future trying to debug PHP code. reply wvenable 29 minutes agorootparentPHP has had the ability to dynamically handle properties for decades so this doesn't hurt readability -- in fact, it makes it better. reply giraffe_lady 2 hours agorootparentprevI wrote php exclusively only for about two years early in my career but have had to come back to it periodically every once in a while. I find it one of the most difficult languages to be a visitor in. The way variable, array, and class semantics mix can make it hard to decipher the exact behavior of a chunk of code. Especially if you have a mix of \"old\" procedural and modern OO php, which the projects I work on do. I'm not bringing this up as a particular criticism of the language, I think it's fine. It is also an experience I have with lisp, where it is fun and easy to write but hard to read when coming back to it after a while away. I just don't think php is a simple language, on several levels. The semantics that I mentioned, combined with the mixing of paradigms, and the large and inconsistent standard library. You can write simple php but it takes a lot of discipline. reply alt227 1 hour agorootparent> Especially if you have a mix of \"old\" procedural and modern OO php I guess thats a result of such wildly changing features in each version change. Each major version of PHP has brought in such drastic changes of concept and semantic that it is easy to start mixing them together and get confused looking code. However I find this in a lot of other systems. Look at node.js, every release changes things so much that people regularly rewrite their entire code base multiple times to take advantages of the new features. Do a google search for guides on node programming a specific issue, and depending on how old it is it you will get wildly differnt approches and results. Popular and highly developed languages change often, and this will always cause issues between old and new. reply giraffe_lady 1 hour agorootparentI agree. I think for largely cultural and timing reasons, and also its success, there are a lot more long-lived php codebases for this to play out in compared to most languages. I also think possibly node is our generation's php, with it being so fast-changing and there not being a community consensus about framework. So every complex node project is, like pre-laravel php, essentially a totally unique ad-hoc framework composed of a mix of libraries. Ruby and python aren't better languages than php or node, and rails and django aren't perfect, but to a large extent those languages avoid this problem just because everyone is using the same solutions. reply wbl 1 hour agorootparentT_PAAMAYIM_NEKUDOTIM, mysql_real_es ape2, parse_str, etc. reply conradfr 6 hours agoparentprevDon't you get tired of managing getters/setters in your entities? reply cutler 1 hour agorootparentEntities, shrentities - it's all just data. reply mgkimsal 2 hours agorootparentprevaren't you just managing them in a new syntax now? reply whalesalad 29 minutes agorootparentprevstockholm syndrome is real reply tcfhgj 54 minutes agorootparentprevwhich getters/setters? reply chx 7 hours agoparentprev> Property hooks mean that some language magic will turn a property access into a call to methods. __get / __set was doing that already and some frameworks very heavily rely on those. > It implies that `$this->x` has a different meaning if it's inside a hook or outside hooks. this is a valid critique but hopefully hooks will be super short and this won't be a major issue. Indeed, if your get is not an arrow function -- which only allows one statement -- then it needs a good thinking over whether this is indeed the best solution. Ie if your get is so complicated then perhaps a helper method is best and then you have get => $this->foo($this->thing) and that's the only place where $this->thing is special. reply idoubtit 6 hours agorootparent> hopefully hooks will be super short and this won't be a major issue. Even if a PHP project has a policy of short hooks, I think hooks impede clarity. public string $countryCode { set (string $countryCode) { $this->countryCode = strtoupper($countryCode); $this->country = nameCountry($this->countryCode); } get => ... In this short hook, the first line of the setter obviously uses the underlying property. But the second line of the setter... Does `$this->country =` use the setter even if it's in a hook (but not a `country` hook)? Does reading `$this->countryCode` use the getter hook, even it's from a `countryCode` hook? If not, is there a way to call the `countryCode` getter from this setter? If quickly parsed the doc and the RFC, so I don't have answers (I suppose it's yes, no, no). But even if I knew how this code behaved, I would still think it's much more complex than plain methods. reply Gabrys1 0 minutes agorootparentWhy would you write such code though? If you want to store an underlying properly, use a differently named (and private) one: public string $countryCode { set (string $countryCode) { $this->_countryCode = strtoupper($countryCode); $this->country = nameCountry($this->_countryCode); } chx 6 hours agorootparentprev> Does `$this->country =` use the setter even if it's in a hook (but not a `country` hook)? To me it is obvious hooks won't use other hooks because that could lead to an infinite loop in a hurry > Does reading `$this->countryCode` use the getter hook, even it's from a `countryCode` hook? same > If not, is there a way to call the `countryCode` getter from this setter? There is although it's a bit tricky and not intuitive but I feel this falls under the \"it is enough this is possible, there's no need for it to be easy\": \"Be aware, the detection logic works on $this->[propertyName] directly at compile time, not on dynamic forms of it like $prop = 'beep'; $this->$prop. That will not trigger a backing value.\" Using dynamic properties in what should be simple code should be rare enough this is not a problem. It's like a bridge convention, the benefits vastly outweigh the drawbacks. reply patates 44 minutes agorootparent> To me it is obvious hooks won't use other hooks because that could lead to an infinite loop in a hurry Yet in Javascript: test = { set a(x) { this.b = x }, get a() { return 2 }, set b(x) { this.c = 10 }} Object { a: Getter & Setter, b: Setter } test.a = 10 10 test Object { a: Getter & Setter, b: Setter, c: 10 } and yes it's possible to make infinite loops. reply c0wb0yc0d3r 4 hours agorootparentprev> Does `$this->country =` use the setter even if it's in a hook (but not a `country` hook)? To me it is obvious hooks won't use other hooks because that could lead to an infinite loop in a hurry I would expect hooks for properties other than `$this->contryCode` to be called inside of a `$this->contryCode` hook. Btw the docs that are linked in the post[0] seem to be clearer than the example in the announcement. Reads less ambiguously to me.

Why would they muddy the concept in the release post? reply dubcanada 7 hours agoparentprevNone of this is required. You can still write spaghetti code perfectly fine. reply smarkov 7 hours agorootparentOf course it's not required but when you start pushing the boundaries of a language with the goal of achieving a clean interface, obscure features you wouldn't normally resort to become appealing. I dislike all of the magic around Laravel's Eloquent ORM - model relationships, query builder, abuse of ForwardsCalls trait, etc, but at the same time I can appreciate how \"clean\" it all looks once it's put together. reply cbg0 2 hours agoprevGlad to see PHP still chugging along after all these years. It's the language I started with as a freelancer more than a decade ago and I still remember having books on my desk learning the proper way to do things, as you had to work around all the unsafe things the language would let you do and which unfortunately led to it getting a bad rep. reply ChrisMarshallNY 1 hour agoparentOne of the issues with creating a language that is easy to use (PHP, BASIC, and many modern languages), is that people who aren't good at programming, will use it. With predictable results. The difference between languages like PHP and more modern languages, is that the more modern languages have more airbags, for the bad code. It's still bad code, but it won't do as much damage. PHP is likely to be around for a long time: https://w3techs.com/technologies/history_overview/programmin... reply grey-area 1 hour agorootparentThis varies by domain of course, but on the web (PHP's domain), the language in greatest use nowadays by professional programmers is....Javascript. reply omnimus 1 hour agorootparentBecause its hard requirement. Its not the case at all on backend. reply grey-area 13 minutes agorootparentNo, I’m talking about voluntary use of frameworks like react to create websites.

But I am not a \"gatekeeper\" type, maybe you are confusing me for one. I'm a high school dropout with a GED, and have been staring up people's noses, all my life.

Even if they were, they're still right. A lot of modern languages are designed with bad programmers in mind. reply tored 5 hours agoprevGreat PHP release. Better stack traces for closures, performance improvements (always nice), HTML5 support, lazy objects and much more. Great work and a big thanks to everyone involved! reply PaulHoule 49 minutes agoprevThat “public private(set)” boggles my mind. Why not “readonly public”? reply wvenable 41 minutes agoparentReadonly might have different semantics (as it does in C#). Readonly has been discussed but it wasn't part of the property hooks RFC and is a separate issue/feature. This is just a natural consequence of having private setters. reply nneonneo 6 hours agoprevIf you want any evidence that terrible language design is alive and well in PHP, look no further than the new array_find function. Not only is it yet another global function in a namespace already chock full of random array helpers, it is extremely similar in both name and usage to array_search - a global function since PHP 4. Except, of course, that in typical PHP fashion, array_find’s argument order is ($array, $filter_callback) while the older array_search is ($search_value, $array). There are literally hundreds of hits for existing, global, functions named array_find. If these are loaded from a library, they will break uses of the new built-in function in exciting ways. Yet, even with this mentioned in the RFC (https://wiki.php.net/rfc/array_find) it seems to have been no obstacle whatsoever to its inclusion - despite the fact that the implementation is literally three lines of code. I have to question if the benefits of this global function really outweigh the benefits. PHP devs claim that other languages have these functions so PHP should too - but neglect to note that most languages don’t make them global functions (rather, they’re usually array methods or in some utility module). reply kyleee 2 hours agoparentI had similar thoughts, but do appreciate the additional mb_ functions bringing multi byte support to some remaining functions. Also people should be coding defensively with things like “if not defined” when implementing their own global helper functions (or avoid doing that at all) reply williamdclt 1 hour agorootparent\"if not defined\" doesn't help, if your own `array_find` doesn't have the same signature and semantics than the new global then you're screwed. You'd want the opposite: overwrite it if it already exists in the global scope (dunno if that's easy / how that'd work in PHP) reply nodogoto 1 hour agorootparentYou can't redefine functions in PHP. reply trevor-e 1 hour agoprevThe property access is looking a lot like Swift, particularly the `private(set)` part which I haven't seen in many other languages. reply KRAKRISMOTT 2 hours agoprevAre there any solid PHP WebSockets and WebRTC setups outside of Laravel? reply hipadev23 1 hour agoparentswoole makes websockets extremely easy and fast. webRTC is a beast with the STUN server needs better handled elsewhere. reply kyleee 1 hour agoparentprevSymfony? Or is this a case where Laravel has actually built out their own packages for support in these two instances? reply theodorejb 6 hours agoprevProperty hooks are the headline feature, but they seem like something I'd rarely use in practice. It is nice to have the option available though, in case I need to add extra logic to a property without breaking everywhere that it's accessed. reply IluTov 2 hours agoparent> A primary use case for hooks is actually to not use them, but retain the ability to do so in the future, should it become necessary. My personal motivation was always to finally put an end to the getters/setters boilerplate. reply littlestymaar 1 hour agoprevI find it pretty fascinating that what used to be a beginner-friendly language, with limited capabilities but that is very easy to get started with, has now evolve to a bloated monster full of advanced features that you can't expect to know entirely, with a complex framework and tooling ecosystem to support it. PHP lovers generally don't like acknowledge that, but the PHP we've learned back-end development two decades ago is no more and that it's now as beginner unfriendly as Java was when we picked it. It's a pity because there's nothing as beginner-friendly anymore. I think the blame is on people calling themselves “PHP developers” who never bothered learning more advanced languages after PHP and instead pushed PHP to reach parity with those, at the expanse of losing its soul. reply cute_boi 1 hour agoprevI can see PHP is getting too much complex. reply wvenable 38 minutes agoparentYou trade complexity in source code for complexity in language. For example, property hooks will make code that currently uses other methods to accomplish that task much easier to read and write. reply chx 1 hour agoprevoooo variable-length lookbehind assertions are now supported. yay! I needed that so many times. reply inglor_cz 7 hours agoprevI have a question to the PHP-in-production crowd: how long do you wait before migrating to higher version of PHP? Is the first release usually already fine, or is it better to wait for a few months and let someone else catch the early errors? reply kugelblitz 6 hours agoparentSolo Dev on my own PHP project since 14 years. I wait 1-3 months, but then update. It used to take way longer, because Amazon's Elastic Beanstalk platform would take longer to update, but I've now changed to Platform.sh and the transition should be easier. It has been very backward-compatible (i.e. stuff that works in 8.n also works in 8.n+1; and unless you use exotic functions or are relying on special functionality, it should work for you, too). Once I'm at 8.4, I would slowly update the code / syntax with rector and the assistance of phpstan. For framework updates I wait 1-2 patch versions before updating, because of composer dependency problems and sometimes bugs do still find themselves into new releases (e.g. I would wait at least until Symfony 7.2.1 before upgrading from Symfony 7.1.x). reply edhelas 7 hours agoparentprevBasically I follow Debian Stable releases and migrate all my code to it when a new version is pushed. So so far I'm on 8.2. It also often fit with the current Laravel version (11). reply jspaetzel 7 hours agoparentprevI usually wait 6mo to a year in order for composer dependencies I use to get updated. Then its usually a trivial upgrade. I've upgraded sooner before for simpler projects though and things are usually pretty stable upon release. reply pilif 7 hours agoparentprevWe start making sure our application runs on the next version around the time Beta 1 comes out. We upgrade the development environment around the time when our tooling (phpstan, cs-fixer) runs on the next version, but doesn't necessarily support new language features. We upgrade the production environment when our tooling supports most of the new language features and at least all of the ones we want to make use of. This usually happens within 3-6 months of the release. By that time the version has stabilized enough to be safe for production use. reply Dachande663 7 hours agoparentprevThe last few point releases have been very stable, so normally within a week or so.

Another pet peeve of me is that the global namespace is littered with these utility functions that should be easily composable or maybe be methods on the objects themselves - and looks like PHP 8.4 adds four more `array_*` functions. For comparison, Python's builtin namespace has a total of 71 functions and a couple of exception classes. PHP's builtin namespace has more functions for dealing with arrays and now 58 of those are prefixed with `array_`. reply dubcanada 7 hours agoparentThe global namespace change would break everything. It’s unlikely they would ever do something like that. It’s hard to build on a language used by so many, when you can’t modify the base. Python decided to do 2.7 vs 3 and fragmented the eco system terribly. reply nneonneo 7 hours agorootparentThey could help by not adding any more cruft to the global namespace. Adding any globals should be a carefully-considered change. User-defined functions are global by default, and although there are (now) much better ways to write PHP libraries, I can absolutely see some old library defining array_find (one of the new global functions in 8.4) in an incompatible way and breaking new code that attempts to use the built-in function. Sure, you can’t touch the existing pile of globals, but at least stop pouring fuel on that particular fire… reply chx 6 hours agorootparentThat would be some really old library. Already in 2012 when Composer was released there was PSR-0 and today almost all libraries are Composer managed and using a namespace following PSR-4 which itself is ten years old. A library that old would almost surely not run on PHP 8 unchanged anyways. Surrendering the global namespace to the language is not so bad an idea. reply nneonneo 6 hours agorootparentSuppose I want to add some new code to an old website? Or I want to gradually upgrade an ancient code base - twelve years is not so old for PHP, when ancient frameworks like Wordpress are still alive and kicking. reply chx 6 hours agorootparentIf we hitched language development on Wordpress we would still be on PHP4 as they refused to join gophp5 some seventeen years ago. Again, an ancient enough codebase which contains a library using array_find will need enough upgrades to run on PHP8 much less PHP8.4 the change from array_find to something else is the least of your worries. reply nneonneo 5 hours agorootparentSeriously? 2k results for array_find in PHP on GitHub: https://github.com/search?q=array_find++language%3APHP&type=.... RFC authors (https://wiki.php.net/rfc/array_find) explicitly noted over 600 hits for definitions of array_find, around 30% of which are not false positives - that is, there's a good possibility that there are 200+ implementations of global array_find in just open-source projects. First page hits https://github.com/hawind/gdoo/blob/master/app/Support/helpe..., a PHP app last updated just two years ago (140 stars, 63 forks) which only supports PHP 8.x. Implementation is thoroughly incompatible with 8.4's array_find. There are so many more examples. Lots of the hits are from codebases that have seen updates in the last few years. Many more are plugins or other addons for PHP frameworks or apps which are still widely used (WordPress, phpBB, etc.). reply alganet 55 minutes agorootparentThe example you picked: https://github.com/hawind/gdoo/blob/master/app/Support/helpe... Is namespaced. You need to realize that \\array_find is different from \\Illuminate\\Support\\Arr\\array_find. There is zero chance of collision here. Totally compatible. reply imoverclocked 7 hours agorootparentprevI think the bigger issue is that these lessons have already been learned. However, PHP (Personal Home Page) was not created carefully by someone to become a fully fledged language. It grew into that role organically which is why it has so many warts in hindsight. reply sam_goody 6 hours agoparentprevI don't get your issue with builtin utilities. The design philosophy of PHP is to include whatever common methods would otherwise be in a popular library. (PHP actually began more as a library than as a language.) This differs from, eg, Python, but doesn't hurt. The decision not not to make methods on the objects, but to include everything in the main namespace (so array_walk instead of Array.walk or Array()->walk etc) is another function of the same philosophy. It may not fit your idea of cosmetics, but there is nothing wrong with it. On the other hand, I would love if PhP gained chainability ([].array_map.array_find()) and then the names would be a pain. If that ever happens there are solutions. reply askonomm 6 hours agorootparentThere is a RFC on it (https://wiki.php.net/rfc/function-composition) which I'd love if it made it through. Until then Crell's FP library is a good option (https://github.com/Crell/fp). reply lofaszvanitt 7 hours agoparentprevWhats the problem with global namespace littered with utility functions. Do they get in the way? They hurt you? They whisper in your ear? Or with the badly named functions? Or the type juggling? Do they eat your soul? reply rty32 6 hours agorootparentIt could be much easier for user defined functions to collide with standard functions, especially when it happens unintentionally. Someone else creates a function named array_something in the namespace. Maybe it already exists in earlier versions, maybe it happens to collide with one of the four introduced in 8.4. This function is accessible to you in the current scope. Now, you try to call the function like the way it is defined in the standard library. You get a very confusing error and spend 10 minutes trying to figure if it is you or PHP that is hallucinating. Turns out you have been inadvertently calling that other user defined function. The other user may be completely unaware of the fact that they created a function with naming collision. To combat this, you need strong IDE help including static type checking, which is not always there for everybody. And it still doesn't help with cases where the user defined function collides with a new standard function. Most \"modern\" languages have very few built-in functions in the global namespace. Another example is Go. Correct me if I am wrong, but I believe there is 0 function in global namespace in Rust. println! exists but that's a macro. In other words, the example I mentioned just never happens with these languages. Not to mention the long list of junk you see in IDE when you type \"array_\". I guess you haven't written much MATLAB. reply alganet 1 hour agorootparentThis would be a valid point 20 years ago. PHP functions can be namespaced. I can just write myLib\\array_find, otherLib\\array_find. You choose what implementation you want when importing. IDE will pick the correct one. So, zero chances of collision. reply nneonneo 6 hours agorootparentprevRust namespaces everything in the standard library to std:: or core::, and has a clear distinction between them. However, it does implicitly include the entirety of the std::prelude namespace (https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/prelude/index.html) into every source file, as well as including every macro directly exported under std:: (including println!). This enables the unprefixed use of things like Result, Option, Some, Send, etc. The prelude and std:: macros are the closest thing that Rust has to a global namespace, and even they can be disabled in crates that specifically request it. reply mg 7 hours agoprevThese days, I am super torn about what language to use for new web projects. PHP: - Easy to deploy: Upload files, done. - Easy to develop: Reload page, see changes. - Lots of HTTP tooling built in. - Fast. Python: - Great language. - Great code reuse system: Modules. - Nice framework: Django. - Less breaking changes in recent years. reply notpushkin 7 hours agoparent> Reload page, see changes. This should work in Python, too. With Django, I think you need to use https://pypi.org/project/django-browser-reload/, and rith most other frameworks / WSGI servers just try adding --reload flag. Edit: Django should wor out of rhe box actually – that package is for refreshing the page in browser. > Easy to deploy. Upload files, done. I can see the appeal, but generally you’d want to avoid that (for anything other than quick prototypes, maybe). Set up a CI, push to deploy. This goes for modern PHP as well.

(Feel free to reach out if you need any help!) reply mg 7 hours agorootparentThere are of course ways to get \"reload page, see results\" to work even with Python. After all, computers are touring complete. But in PHP you have it out of the box. Faster, with less complexity and less resource consumption. And you can use the same setup in development as you can use in production. reply notpushkin 7 hours agorootparentMaybe I'm missing something, but PHP is not more efficient in that regard. When you load a Python page, it is served by an in-memory process. If code is updated, the process is restarted, parsing the code and initialising the application, but it is done only once. When you load a PHP page, it parses the code and initializes the app for each request. It then tears everything down after the request. There are less wasteful ways (most recent are app servers, just like in Python or other langs), but I'm not sure if those are widely used in local development. Even then, it’s same as Python, Node or pretty much anything else. And of course, I’m not trying to diss on PHP here – it’s gotten pretty good recently. But reload on change is built in pretty much every app framework nowadays. It works out of the box and is negligibly fast. It’s not a good point to compare. reply graemep 6 hours agorootparent> When you load a PHP page, it parses the code and initializes the app for each request. It then tears everything down after the request. There are less wasteful ways (most recent are app servers, just like in Python or other langs), but I'm not sure if those are widely used in local development. There are things like opcode caches that make PHP more efficient transparently, while still feeling to the developer like a reload each time. There are reliability and development advantages to starting each request from scratch. NO leaks, no state you need worry about. PHP is very much like serverless. reply mg 6 hours agorootparentprevIn my experience: PHP is always blazing fast, with no additional setup to make \"Reload page, see results\" work. Python needs additional setup. Either by monitoring the filesystem and pessimistically recompiling the application every time a file changes. Causing resource consumption every time you hit save in your editor. Or by having the web workers that serve the requests die after 1s of inactivity or so. Which makes the next pageview slow again, even if no code changed. I think PHP's advantage is because of 3 things: 1: Recompiling changed files is built in. 2: With PHP you can set your project up in a way that only the code necessary to answer a single request is updated. With Python and Django, all the code for all requests is updated and even code paths that are actually never used. 3: PHP keeps each file compiled to bytecode in memory and only recompiles files that have been changed. Although you might accomplish something similar in Python if you let it pollute your filesystem with cached bytecode files. reply mobilio 3 hours agorootparentprevThis is true when you call PHP using CGI or CLI. Then opcode is build, running and thrown away. But when u are using FCGI or PHP-FPM then you have running process where opcode is cached except on first request where opcode cache is build. reply hipadev23 1 hour agorootparentprevWith standard opcaching and jit enabled, the reparsing step doesn’t happen.

Is this something you do? If you’re running locally PHP spawns its own server which other runtimes have. If you’re running this on a server you’re most likely going to have app/code caching (apc Or opcache) switched on so you’ll need to restart the server anyway, in which case it’s not more advantageous than uploading a js file and restarting node. reply sjm-lbm 1 hour agorootparentprev.. and as soon as you stop just uploading files (which, as you say, nobody does), a lot of the other advantages go away also. Laravel and Symphony both make PHP much slower. If you are going to have sane routing, you're probably going to need to tweak your websever to behave, well, less like a web server. There's a decent chance you'll need to clear a cache after you upload your changed files if you want to actually see those changes. I actually like PHP a lot, and it's amazing how far it has come in the past 10 or so years, I just think way too many people assume you get the 2004-era PHP simplicity with all of the 2024-era PHP refinements, and you really don't.

    "originBody": "Hyrum's Law in Golang Abenezer Belachew · November 09, 2024 4 min read I recently stumbled upon an intriguing comment while exploring the Go codebase. \"Due to Hyrum's law, this text cannot be changed.\" func (e *MaxBytesError) Error() string {// Due to Hyrum's law, this text cannot be changed.return \"http: request body too large\" } Prior to this, I had never heard of Hyrum's law. A quick search revealed that it is a principle named after Hyrum Wright, a software engineer at Google. The \"law\" is simple: With a sufficient number of users of an API, it does not matter what you promise in the contract: all observable behaviors of your system will be depended on by somebody. In other words, any behavior that can be observed in code — whether intentional or accidental — will eventually become something that someone, somewhere, relies on. So in the code above, the author is acknowledging that the error message cannot be changed because it is likely being relied upon by someone, somewhere. Even though it might seem trivial to tweak the error message, doing so could cause unintended issues for anyone relying on this specific message. In this case, a seemingly small change could break existing code where someone depends on the exact phrasing of \"http: request body too large\". For example, here are some open source codebases that will be affected if the error message is changed: http: request body too large This wasn't the only instance. I found similar comments referencing Hyrum's Law in Go's crypto/rsa and internal/weak packages as well. Here they are: crypto/rsa/rsa.go func EncryptOAEP(hash hash.Hash, random io.Reader, pub *PublicKey, msg []byte, label []byte) ([]byte, error) {// Note that while we don't commit to deterministic execution with respect// to the random stream, we also don't apply MaybeReadByte, so per Hyrum's// Law it's probably relied upon by some. It's a tolerable promise because a// well-specified number of random bytes is included in the ciphertext, in a// well-specified way. crypto/rsa/pss.go func SignPSS(rand io.Reader, priv *PrivateKey, hash crypto.Hash, digest []byte, opts *PSSOptions) ([]byte, error) {// Note that while we don't commit to deterministic execution with respect// to the rand stream, we also don't apply MaybeReadByte, so per Hyrum's Law// it's probably relied upon by some. It's a tolerable promise because a// well-specified number of random bytes is included in the signature, in a// well-specified way.if opts != nil && opts.Hash != 0 { hash = opts.Hash} internal/weak Using go:linkname to access this package and the functions it references is explicitly forbidden by the toolchain because the semantics of this package have not gone through the proposal process. By exposing this functionality, we risk locking in the existing semantics due to Hyrum's Law. Observation This is obviously not specific to Golang and is mentioned in other codebases as well. TBH, this whole thing reminds me of how JavaScript's evolution over the years has been heavily shaped by widespread reliance on all sorts of quirky, unintended behaviors, which became de facto standards. Now, I finally know what to refer to this phenomenon as — Hyrum's Law. Final thoughts A good reminder to be careful when changing code others might depend on—and to try designing things in a way that doesn't accidentally lock in weird quirks. And even better, to design systems in a way that minimizes the chances of unintended behaviors being relied upon in the first place. After all, you know the saying: \"All it takes is one small change to... something something...\" I don't remember the whole quote. 😶🌫",

Consider that even the total runtime of a function is an observable property, which means that optimizing a function to make it faster is a breaking change (what if suddenly one of your queues clears too fast and triggers a deadlock??), despite the fact that 99.99999999% of your users would probably appreciate having code that runs faster for no effort on their part. Therefore it's unavoidable that what constitutes a \"breaking change\" is a social contract, not a technical contract, because the alternative is that literally nothing is ever allowed to change. So as a library author, document what parts of your API are guaranteed not to change, be reasonable, and have empathy for your users. And as a library consumer, understand that making undocumented interfaces into load-bearing constructs is done at your own risk, and have empathy for the library authors. reply materielle 3 hours agoparentI think everything you said is totally correct for open source library owners. But let me offer a different perspective: Hyrum’s law is neither a technical contract nor a social contract. It’s an emergent technical property in a sufficiently used system. How you respond to that emergent property depends on the social context. If you are a FOSS maintainer, and an optimization speeds up 99.99% of users and requires 0.01% to either fix their code or upgrade to a new API, you ship it. If you are working at a big tech company, you need both the optimization and breaking 0% of the company. So you will work across teams to find the sweet spot. If you are an enterprise software company, and you change breaks 0.1% if users, but that user is one of the top 5 contracts, you don’t ship. reply kmacdough 1 hour agorootparentSeems like you're saying the same thing, just using \"social contract\" differently. I think they use social contract not to mean binding, but to highlight the fact that Hyrums Law must be taken in the social context of the project. In the case of large SW company, the social contract would be to not break services, even when folks are misusing an API. And for a popular open source project, it would mean not breaking a widely used behavior, even if it isn't specified or officially supported. Determining the social contract seems to be precisely what you describe as \"not a social contract\". reply uoaei 3 hours agorootparentprev> It’s an emergent ... property in a sufficiently used system This is also a sufficient description of \"social contract\" for this context. reply SatvikBeri 1 hour agoparentprevI once sped up a very suboptimal routine that from ~100s to ~.1s (it was doing database lookups in a for loop), and that broke the reporting system because the original author had made several asynchronous function calls and assumed they would have all finished running by the time the (formerly) slow routine was done. Figuring out exactly what happened took forever. reply bluGill 3 hours agoparentprevThat used to be a problem in the 1980s. Thus PCs came with a turbo button to slow them down, and 8 bit computers went the entire decade without upgrading their speed even though faster CPUs were available. These days nearly everything runs on more than one CPU and so nobody relies on function runtime (other than is if fast enough). Even in embedded they have been burned by their one CPU going out of production and so try to avoid that dependency because it cannot be relied on anymore. reply hinkley 45 minutes agorootparentI found a used copy of Warcraft III and found it was unplayable because the scrolling algorithm ran as fast as possible with no minimum time.

The operating environment will have an impact on that, for example, as will the load the system is currently experiencing. A GC pass can affect it. In short, I wouldn't consider emergent behaviours of a machine as part of an intentional interface or any kind of contract and therefore I wouldn't see it as a breaking change, the same as fixing a subtle bug in a function wouldn't be seen as a breaking change even if someone depended on the unintentional behaviour. I think it's more of a testament to Go's hardcore commitment to backwards compatibility, in this case, than anything else. reply skybrian 1 hour agorootparentYes, it’s an absurd example to make a point. We don’t normally consider performance in scope for what’s considered a breaking API change and there are good reasons for that, including being non-portable. Performance guarantees are what hard real-time systems do and they’re hardware-specific. (There is also the “gas fee” system that Ethereum has, to make a performance limit consistent across architectures.) But there are still informal limits. If the performance impact is bad enough, (say, 5x slower, or changing a linear algorithm to quadratic), it’s probably going to be reverted anyway. We just don‘t have any practical way of formalizing rough performance guarantees at an API boundary. reply kibwen 53 minutes agorootparent> If the performance impact is bad enough Even worse, it's possible to select a new algorithm that improves the best-case and average-case runtimes while degrading the worst-case runtime, so no matter what you do it will punish some users and reward others. reply AlotOfReading 1 hour agorootparentprevIt's quite common in cryptography for the runtime to be important.

We take Hyrum's Law (and backwards compatibility [1]) extremely seriously in Go.

IMO this is a worthwhile tradeoff. I use Go a lot and love the strong backwards compatibility, but I would happily accept a (slightly) higher rate of breaking changes if it meant greater freedom for the Go devs to improve performance, add features etc. Based on the kind of hell users of other ecosystems seem willing to tolerate (cough Python cough), I believe I am not alone in this viewpoint. reply wild_egg 4 hours agorootparentData point of one, but I've been using Go since 2012 and would drop it instantly if any of the backwards compatibility guarantees were relaxed. Having bugs imposed on you from outside your project is a waste of time to deal with and there are dozens of other languages you can pick from if you enjoy that time sink. Most of them give you greater capabilities as the balance. Go's stability is a core feature and compensates for the lack of other niceties. Adding features isn't a good reason to break things. I can go use something else if I want to make that trade. reply otterley 3 hours agorootparentRespectfully, I don’t think you would just pack up and leave. The cost of switching to an entirely different language—which might have even worse backwards compatibility issues—is significantly higher than fixing bugs you inadvertently introduced due to prior invalid assumptions. I’d call your bluff. reply hinkley 37 minutes agorootparentprevJava 5 was a fun upgrade for a lot of people because it caused JUnit tests to run in a different order. Due to hashtable changes altering the iteration of the reflected function names. Don’t couple your tests, kids! reply ljm 2 hours agorootparentprevI'd consider stuff like that part of the opinion the language has. Go's opinion is that backwards compatibility at all reasonable cost is a priority. When it comes to ecosystems, the opinions have trade-offs. I would say that Go's approach to dependencies, modules and workspaces is one of those. As a language it mostly stays out of your way, but correcting imports because it pulled in the wrong version, or dealing with go.mod, go.work and replace directives in a monorepo, gets old pretty fast (to the extent it's easier to just have a monorepo-wide go.mod with literally every dependency in it). At least it's an improvement over having to use a fairly specific directory structure though. reply jerf 4 hours agorootparentprevBreaking iteration order was also well established as a valid move. Several other languages had already made a similar change, much later in their own lifecycle than Go did. That helps a lot, because it shows it is largely just an annoyance, mostly affecting tests. reply unscaled 5 hours agoparentprev> We randomly read an extra byte from random streams in various GenerateKey functions (which are not marked like the ones in OP) with MaybeReadByte [2] to avoid having our algorithm locked in You don't seem to do that in ed25519.

I would add as a slight caveat that to benefit from this policy, users absolutely must read the release notes on major go versions before upgrading. We recently didn't, and we were burnt somewhat by the change to disallow negative serial numbers in the x509 parser without enabling the new feature flag. Completely our fault and not yours, but I add the caveat nevertheless. reply FiloSottile 9 hours agorootparentWe have gotten a liiiiittle more liberal ever since we introduced the new GODEBUG feature flag mechanism. I've been meaning to write a \"how to safely update Go\" post for a while, because the GODEBUG mechanism is very powerful but not well-known and we could build a bit of tooling around it. In short, you can upgrade your toolchain without changing the go.mod version, and these things will keep working like they did, and set a metric every time the behavior would have changed, but didn't. (Here's where we could build a bit of tooling to check that metric in prod/tests/CLIs more easily.) Then you can update the go.mod version, which updates the default set of GODEBUGs, and if anything breaks, try reverting GODEBUGs one by one. reply gnfargbl 9 hours agorootparentThat sounds good. Breaking changes in major version updates is a completely normal thing in most software and we usually check for it. Ironically the only reason we weren't previously bothering in go is that the maintainers were historically so hyper-focused on absolute backwards compatibility that there were never any breaking changes! reply hambes 10 hours agoprevSolution to the specifically mentioned problem: Don't use string-based errors, use sentinel errors [1]. More generally: Don't produce code where consumers of your API are the least bit inclined to rely on non-technical strings. Instead use first-level language constructs like predefined error values, types or even constants that contain the non-technical string so that API consumers can compare the return value againnst the constant instead of hard-coding the contained string themselves. Hyrum's Law is definitely a thing, but its effects can be mitigated.

It was and still is sometimes idiomatic to generate Go because it is so featureless and writing it is often a chore. So it is very much about how well you design your API. reply Svip 10 hours agoparentprevIn your example, the onus is on the consumer not the provider. I could still be writing code that checks if `err.String() == \"no more tea available.\"`. I agree, I shouldn't do that, but nothing is preventing me from doing that. Additionally, errors.Is is a relatively recent addition to Go, so by the time people would check for errors like this, it was just easier to check the literal string. But as an API provider in Go, you cannot prevent your consumers from checking the return values of .String(). reply hambes 10 hours agorootparentUnfortunately true. The Go maintainers might not agree with me on this, but I think in this case consumers have to learn the hard way.

In practice, most Go code, and even significant parts of the Go standard library, return arbitrary error strings. And error returning functions never return anything more specific than `error` (you could count the exceptions in the top 20 Go codebases on your fingers, most likely). Returning non-specific exceptions is virtually encouraged by the standard library (if you return an error struct, you run into major issues with the ubiquitous `if err != nil` \"error handling\" logic). You have both errors.New() and fmt.Errorf() for returning stringly-typed errors. errors.Is and errors.As only work easily if you return error constants, not error types (they can support error types, but then you have to do more work to manually implement Is() and As() in your custom error type) - so you can't easily both have a specific error, but also include extra information with that error. For the example in the OP, you have to do a lot of extra work to return an error that can be checked without string comparisons, but also tells you what was the actual limit. So much work that this was only introduced in Go 1.19, despite MaxBytesReader existing since go 1.0 . Before that, it simply returned errors.New(\"http: request body too large\") [0]. And this is true throughout the standard library. Despite all of their talk about the importance of handling errors, Go's standard library was full of stringly-typed errors for most of its lifetime, and while it's getting better, it's still a common occurrence. And even when they were at least using sentinel errors, they rarely included any kind of machine-readable context you could use for taking a decision based on the error value. [0] https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/refs/tags/go1:src/pkg/n... reply kbolino 3 hours agorootparentYou do not have to do more work to use errors.Is or errors.As. They work out of the box in most cases just fine. For example: package example var ErrValue = errors.New(\"stringly\") type ErrType struct { Code int Message string } func (e ErrType) Error() string { return fmt.Sprintf(\"%s (%d)\", e.Message, e.Code) } You can now use errors.Is with a target of ErrValue and errors.As with a target of *ErrType. No extra methods are needed. However, you can't compare ErrValue to another errors.New(\"stringly\") by design (under the hood, errors.New returns a pointer, and errors.Is uses simple equality). If you want pure value semantics, use your own type instead. There are Is and As interfaces that you can implement, but you rarely need to implement them. You can use the type system (subtyping, value vs. pointer method receivers) to control comparability in most cases instead. The only time to break out custom implementations of Is or As is when you want semantic equality to differ from ==, such as making two ErrType values match if just their Code fields match. The one special case that the average developer should be aware of is unwrapping the cause of custom errors. If you do your own error wrapping (which is itself rarely necessary, thanks to the %w specifier on fmt.Errorf), then you need to provide an Unwrap method (returning either an error or a slice of errors). reply unscaled 3 hours agorootparentprevGo errors cannot be string-typed, since they need to implement the error interface. The reason testing error types sometimes won't work is that the error types themselves may be private to the package where they are defined or that the error is just a generic error created by errors.New(). In this case the Error has an easy-to-check public type (*MaxBytesError) and the documentation clearly indicates that. But that has not always been the case. The original sin is that the API returned a generic error and the only way to test that error was to use a string comparison. This is an important context to have when you need to make balanced decisions about Hyrum's law. As some commentators already mentioned, you should be wary of taking the extreme version of the law, which suggest that every single observable behavior of the API becomes part of the API itself and needs to be preserved. If you follow this extreme version, every error or exception message in every language must be left be left unchanged forever. But most client code doesn't just go around happily comparing exception messages to strings if there is another method to detect the exception. reply karel-3d 1 hour agorootparentprevThey didn't have them when they implemented this code. Back then, error was a glorified string. Then it started having more smart errors, mostly due to a popular third party packages, and then the logic of those popular packages was more or less* put back to go. * except for stacktraces in native errors. I understand that they are not there for speed reasons but dang it would be nice to have them sometimes reply TheDong 10 hours agorootparentprevIt has typed errors, except every function that returns an error returns the 'error' interface, which gives you no information on the set of errors you might have. In other statically typed languages, you can do things like 'match err' and have the compiler tell you if you handled all the variants. In java you can `try { x } catch (SomeTypedException)` and have the compiler tell you if you missed any checked exceptions. In go, you have to read the recursive call stack of the entire function you called to know if a certain error type is returned. Can 'pgx.Connect' return an `io.EOF` error? Can it return a \"tls: unknown certificate authority\" (unexported string only error)? The only way to know is to recursively read every line of code `pgx.Connect` calls and take note of every returned error. In other languages, it's part of the type-signature. Go doesn't have _useful_ typed errors since idiomatically they're type-erased into 'error' the second they're returned up from any method. reply inlined 2 hours agorootparentYou actually should never return a specific error pointer because you can eventually break nil checks. I caused a production outage because interfaces are tuples of type and pointer and the literal nil turns to [nil, nil] when getting passed to a comparator whereas your struct return value will be [nil, *Type] reply rocqua 9 hours agorootparentprevExceptions in Python and C are the same. The idea with these is, either you know exactly what error to expect to handle and recover it, or you just treat it as a general error and retry, drop the result, propagate the error up, or log and abort. None of those require understanding the error. Should an unexpected error propagate from deep down in your call stack to your current call site, do you really think that error should be handled at this specific call-site? reply adontz 9 hours agorootparentNope, exceptions in Python are not the same.

You still need to recurse down the entire call stack to figure out which exceptions might be raised. reply vlovich123 7 hours agorootparentprevC also doesn’t have exceptions and C++ similarly can distinguish between exception types (unless you just throws a generic std::exception everywhere). reply TheDong 4 hours agorootparentprevYes, python and C also do not have properly statically typed errors. In python, well, python's a dynamically typed language so of course it doesn't have statically typed exceptions. \"a better type system than C\" is a really low bar.

For many people, the most obvious way to determine if the error was a MaxBytesError was to check the string. I'm not familiar with Go, but assuming it has RTTI, I'm guessing the intended path for people to take was to check the type of the error against MaxBytesError, and occurrences of this were people who either didn't know that, or found the error string to be immediately available in their tooling, but the type not immediately available. [edit] Per [2], this looks desire paths is even more an apt analogy than I thought; until 3 years ago, this code returned a generic Error type. 1: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_path 2: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42202472 reply jameson 1 hour agoprevwhat I learned from shipping APIs: 1. Clients will do whatever they need to do get their job done, even if it's not the publisher's intended way 2. Clients don't read documentation 3. Bugs will become part of API once enough clients rely on their behavior 4. The number of API calls does not necessarily equate to importance. --- As such, I aim for the following when developing an API 1. Ship the beta API early and see how they use it to minimize the surprise. (This may not always be possible) 2. In most cases, bump up the major version while supporting the previous version. This means you'll need to define SLA for your API 3.

It worked fine on Windows 3.x, because the memory never went anywhere. Here’s the amazing part: On beta versions of Windows 95, SimCity wasn’t working in testing. Microsoft tracked down the bug and added specific code to Windows 95 that looks for SimCity. If it finds SimCity running, it runs the memory allocator in a special mode that doesn’t free memory right away.

HeyLaughingBoy 2 hours agoThis gives me an idea. We have a very large compost pile from mucking out various horse stalls and pens. It's mainly composed of urine-soaked woodchips and mostly broken-down horse manure. There's also some dirt in there as well. As an experiment this summer, I tried growing potatoes and carrots in it. Potatoes did extremely well, the carrots not so much (but I attribute that to poor watering). It would be interesting to monitor the temperature to see how active it still is, since I can tell that it's not completely broken down yet. I actually have an ESP8266-based temperature sensor around here that I was using to track ambient temp for another fermentation project. Now I'm thinking of encapsulating its thermistor and putting the 8266 in an IP67 enclosure along with a solar cell and just planting the whole lot on top of the compost pile. It already serves a web page on a .local domain so there would be minimal work required on my part. I might actually get to that this weekend! reply _whiteCaps_ 1 hour agoparentThe soil might have actually been too rich for carrots.

If mine is over 45C, I'm fairly sure that means the thermophiles are present and doing their thing reply montycompostco 14 hours agoparentYou’re absolutely right— a temperature gauge is a fantastic tool for monitoring for many composters who are focused on the basics of maintaining an active hot composting pile. Where our system shines is when you want to go a little deeper. For example, adding data on gas, moisture levels, and air pressure allows users to troubleshoot or optimise their process more effectively. Is the activity aerobic or anaerobic? Is your moisture level tipping the pile too far one way or another? These kinds of insights can help when composting setups or inputs get more complex, or when things stall and you’re not sure why. That said, we totally get that not everyone needs all the bells and whistles—sometimes a reliable temp gauge and your composting instincts are all you need to make amazing, healthy compost! reply hermitcrab 2 hours agoparentprevI can barely get my compost more than 5C above ambient. But I think it is mainly because the compost bin isn't big enough (one of those black plastic daleks), so has too much surface area/volume. Also, it is in a very shady spot. reply duckmysick 1 hour agorootparentShade shouldn't be a problem. In fact, a cover is good because it helps you control the sunlight and rain. If the pile isn't heating up it's usually either bone dry or there's not enough volume. Aim for at least one cubic meter (or 3x3x3 feet). If you have fresh grass clippings, add them - they will help a lot. A heap of grass clippings with nothing else will heat up on its own (but don't do it because it will smell). Your cold compost is going to be fine, it will just take longer and won't cook the weed seeds. If you have more questions there's a composting subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/composting/ reply PittleyDunkin 14 hours agoparentprevHow do you verify the expected metabolic processes are occurring that produce said temperatures? reply montycompostco 13 hours agorootparentGreat question— thanks for asking! Verifying the metabolic processes in composting is a bit of a mix between understanding composting fundamentals and interpreting the data we collect. The processes are highly dependent on factors like feedstock type and volume. For example, a sudden spike in temperature might be due to an addition of nitrogen-rich materials or a recent turning of the pile—both of which can accelerate microbial activity. While our sensors provide 24/7 data on temperature, gas composition, and more, there are always factors we can’t directly see or control for, like the exact distribution of materials within the pile. That’s where a bit of interpretation comes in: matching what the data is telling us with the fundamentals of composting. By combining real-time monitoring with an understanding of what’s happening in the pile, users can make informed decisions to keep their composting process on track. It’s not an exact science, but the extra data helps a lot! reply wswope 16 hours agoprevThanks for posting! Out of curiosity, could you talk more about the practical utility of the sensor readings you get while monitoring compost? Temp and moisture seem straightforward, but e.g., does gas composition imply anything about C/N ratio, or does it check if the pile is going anoxic? Is air pressure a general proxy for decomposition rate? Also, have you changed any of your own composting practices due to what you’ve learned from your experience with monitoring? reply montycompostco 15 hours agoparentTo dive into the utility of the sensor readings-- The main gas we monitor is Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOCs), which act as a general proxy for decomposition activity. Combined with temperature data, this gives a strong indication of whether the activity is aerobic (a healthy compost pile) or anaerobic (not ideal and potentially smelly!). For example, a spike in TVOCs with decreasing oxygen availability often flags anaerobic conditions. In terms of air pressure, this is used as part of our pile turn events detection in our companion app Monty Mobile. The app also analyses other data to assess how changes in conditions (e.g., moisture levels, turning frequency) affect decomposition. For most users, though, the general proxy is plenty— by identifying when a pile is “active” or “stalled,” they can tweak their process (e.g., adding browns, adjusting moisture, or aerating). Compost is incredibly diverse, and the results will vary depending on the setup (tumblers, bins, worm farms) and inputs (manure, food scraps, garden waste). That said, 24/7 data from our system helps streamline the behaviour-change process. Rather than relying on a “try-wait-try-again” approach, users get immediate feedback, which can be a game-changer for both beginners and seasoned composters. As for me, Monty has been a massive learning tool. Using the Monty Mobile app has personally helped me engage more with my compost pile and remember to add feedstock to adjust the pile when needed. It definitely makes me feel more in tune with what’s going on! I hope this clarifies things! Happy to chat more :) reply wswope 2 hours agorootparentGreat summary - tyvm!

My most-productive compost operation mostly just consisted of just piling stuff up beside my brick shed, which was conveniently near an outside door on my kitchen. The rest of the process consisted of giving it a bit of a toss with a hoe, a shovel, or a fork if I was outside, bored, and felt like doing that, or giving it a bit of water from the garden hose if it had been very hot and dry. And I did as little of this as possible because taking care of compost, while certainly interesting to me, is just not something I generally enjoy doing. I really didn't pay much attention to it. By the time spring came 'round again and I had a use for the stuff, I had plenty of it for the garden. And this worked very well -- for me, on my scale, in my region, with my needs. Therefore, I do not need to monitor my compost. --- But not all composting operations are lazy. Sometimes, they are very active. And some operations are large enough (or the available space small enough) that real estate becomes a seriously-limiting factor. And in these instances, optimizing the process to get higher-quality compost faster can become a very desirable goal. Optimization of composting is not dissimilar to optimization of any other process, wherein: Having some good data is better than having no data. reply exDM69 5 hours agoparentprevI need to monitor my compost to keep it from freezing in the winter. Probably not what OP's system is for, given that they are from Australia.

But this requires that there isn't too much finished compost in the bin that won't produce heat any more, so any turn downwards on the thermometer means I'm probably late in emptying the bin. Which happens every year when it gets cold (below -20C/-5F), but can be remedied by a 40W light bulb for 48 hours to heat up and restart the composting. Another thing that needs to be monitored is humidity, because too humid and the compost goes anaerobic and starts rotting instead of composting. This I \"monitor\" by smell but this project has some kind of gas composition sensor which could be useful. I don't have issues with this any more as I have practically unlimited supply of wood chips to keep it dry. But the wood chips bring another problem which is pH levels that may go too low. Here's where I'd really like to have a monitor so I could estimate if I need to do something to adjust the pH. reply duckmysick 1 hour agorootparent> But the wood chips bring another problem which is pH levels that may go too low. Is this something you've measured? I add a lot of wood chips and conifer needles and it's not a problem; the compost ends up between 6 and 7.5 pH (neutral is 7). I also liberally spread woodchips on the paths between the beds and things are fine.

Slotin wasn’t really doing an experiment at the time, in the sense of taking careful scientific measurements — he was simply showing how one would do them, because he was about to leave the laboratory to be part of the assembly team for the first postwar nuclear weapons test at the Bikini atoll, and they were going to be taking over the experimental work for him while he was gone. In front of him was a beryllium hemisphere (a neutron reflector), with a plutonium weapon core inside of it. In his left hand he held another beryllium hemisphere, with his thumb reaching into a hole in the top, and using a screwdriver as leverage, he carefully lowered the top hemisphere over the core. As he did so, the neutrons exiting the core began to reflect back into it, increasing the overall reactivity of the system. A recreation of the Slotin accident, in the same room, at the same table, even possibly the same screwdriver. Another plutonium core, in two hemispheres, is also visible on the table. And then… the screwdriver slipped. The top hemisphere slid over the plutonium, and it tipped just slightly over the edge of prompt criticality, creating a brief but intense nuclear reaction that showered Slotin and those around him with radiation and created a brief flash of blue light in the air around them. In less than a second, Slotin had reflexively knocked the top hemisphere off, and the reaction had stopped, but it was too late: he was walking dead, having absorbed enough radiation to kill him horribly and painfully within nine days. The story of the so-called “Demon Core,” which was involved in two criticality accidents — the one that killed Slotin, and another, different accident that killed another scientist, Harry Daghlian, a year before — is part of the lore of the atomic age. A fictionalized version of the accidents was featured in the very first Hollywood film about the Manhattan Project (MGM’s The Beginning or the End?, from 1947), as well as in the 1989 film Fat Man and Little Boy. And over the years there have been many non-fiction accounts of the accident, with ever more details emerging over time; if you do want more details on the accident, the core, and the aftermath, you might take a look at an article I published on it a few years back, for example. What really has fascinated me about the Slotin accident in particular, though, is the emergence of an entire ecosystem of “memes” about it. The first one I can remember seeing in this one, in 2019: You could, at the time, only buy it on a T-shirt from someone on Etsy based out of Japan, but now there are a million knock-off/duplicates available on the Internet. I don’t know who the original author was, but at the time I was pretty amazed at it — it felt like something of a “deep cut,” because you had to recognize the entire Slotin set-up in order to see why this somewhat kawaii rendering of the Slotin experiment, along with the “I love science” phrasing, was a form of dark humor. I don’t remember seeing “Demon Core” memes prior to the above. I am sure one can find earlier ones — that was just the first one that came across my computer screen. Google Trends has some interesting results on this: The above is showing the relative search volume of three terms: “Louis Slotin” (red, always very low), “Demon Core” (blue, interesting spikes, and a growing relevancy from 2019 onward), and “NUKEMAP” (yellow, included as something of a “control” — something I consider “somewhat well-known in certain circles” but not “universally well-known”; about 1/4th of my engineering-school freshmen this year had heard of the NUKEMAP before taking any courses with me). My reading of this is that the “Demon Core” was still pretty obscure among non-nuke-nerds until around 2019/2020, when it “broke through” some barrier and is now something that can readily referenced online and you would expect a significant fraction of the readership (esp. geeky boys, I imagine) to recognize. Since 2019 or so there has been an, er, explosion of “Demon Core”/Slotin experiment memes. The veritable source Know-Your-Meme created a dedicated “Demon Core” page in May 2021, showcasing some of the variety of the meme. Most of the initial ones seem to be of the same sort of kawaii (Japanese for “cute”) model as the one above, transporting it into a context of anime girls, cats, and anime cat girls: What is going on here? I am not exceptionally well-versed in anime or manga tropes, but I think the “obvious” reading of this is a classic case of “unexpected juxtaposition creates humor.” That is, moving something from one context (“Demon Core,” radiation experiment, horrible death) into another (cute, anime, girls) creates something that feels novel and unusual. One could no doubt analyze many different dimensions of juxtaposition at work here, including the gender roles: Slotin was not just male, but the entire accident was caused by the sort of risk-taking bravado (which had he been explicitly warned about) that anyone who has spent time as or around young men recognizes immediately. So having a cute Japanese schoolgirl performing this very male-coded experiment is quite a switch in tone — and one that probably also is dually resonant with the “geeky boy” demographic that I suspect is largely the primary “receiver” and “transmitter” of the meme. The Slotin accident has also achieved, in recent years, that “sweet spot” of “if you know, you know” virality: it’s not so well-known that everyone would get it, but it’s also not so obscure that only dedicated wonks or experts would know about it (a reference to the Kelley accident, or the SL-1 accident, would be probably too deep a cut to go viral). I have not made a full survey or taxonomy of these memes; there are dozens and dozens, if not more. The ones above I would categorize as “entirely new drawings,” in which the Demon Core pictures are used as reference, but the entire style is novel. There also cases where the Demon Core pictures (or self-serious drawings/renderings of the experiment) are added to existing meme formats, such as the “pondering my orb” wizard: There is also quite a few of the “take a stock photograph of a product and add the Demon Core to it” variety: And so on — there are an almost unlimited number. There are arguably no tasteful versions of this meme, of course. (XKCD, perhaps, comes closest.) Because it’s a meme derived from human suffering. It’s meant to be in bad taste — that’s the source of the humor. The medical details of the “Demon Core” accidents are pretty horrible. The photographs of the victims are not something you probably want to see — they are bad. I have described them elsewhere. Suffice to say these were extremely painful deaths, involving a body whose internal cellular processes were breaking down in real time under the influence of billions of tiny cellular cuts, and all the while the poor scientists were being monitored, photographed, and (ultimately) inventoried. Slotin’s hubris and bravado caused his death, but it didn’t mean he deserved that suffering, and it doesn’t mean we can’t feel sorry for him, one human to another. I am not trying to be a scold. We just have to remember that we are not making fun of an abstract idea, here. There was real suffering involved. And… yet. What is interesting to me about many of the initial memes, especially the anime ones, is that they appear to have originated from Japan. And that adds a wrinkle to the sentiment here. Godzilla + the “Demon Core” = an interesting fusion of nuclear metaphors… The “Demon Core” was, as people who know the full story are well-aware, was actually the third plutonium core fabricated, after the one detonated at Trinity and the one detonated over Nagasaki, and would have almost surely been used over a Japanese city had World War II continued for a few more weeks. The plutonium core before it killed some 40,000–70,000 people, mostly Japanese civilians but also Korean laborers and even some Allied Prisoners of War, at Nagasaki. The “Demon Core” killed two American weapons scientists, and at least in Slotin’s case was entirely preventable and due to a lack of proper procedure and respect for the hazards involved. So perhaps if anybody has a “right” to make jokes in poor taste about the “Demon Core”… it might be the Japanese? Because Americans have made jokes about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki since they occurred. One can’t just attribute it to wartime sentiment. Well after the suffering of the Japanese victims was public knowledge, and after the Japanese became a key American ally, there were still novelty songs about the killing of cities. Even just a few weeks ago, Saturday Night Live featured a joke in particularly bad taste about the Nobel Peace Prize being awarded to atomic bomb survivors. I’m not here to be the humor police, or to say things should be “off limits” for comedy, or that it’s “too soon,” or make any other scolding noises. Dark humor, in its own strange and inverted way, is arguably a sort of coping mechanism — a defense against the darkness, a way to tame and de-fang the horrors of the world. The bomb is no stranger to such treatment, of course — consider Dr. Strangelove, or Tom Lehrer — although my sense is that the “Demon Core” memes are not, in any serious way, making conscious “interventions” in how people think about the risks of the nuclear world.

It’s meant to be in bad taste — that’s the source of the humor. I don’t agree. To me, it’s derived from many things, like juxtaposing something incredibly stressful and dangerous, with something else. I’d go further and say the suffering that happened is only important in that it made the demon core popular and well-known, but the memes would still work if it somehow became well-known without the death and suffering because no accident happened. reply anon84873628 20 minutes agoparent>juxtaposing something incredibly stressful and dangerous, with something else. That \"something else\" to me is the absolute ease of the act. I think we normally expect the scale of the consequences to match the setup difficulty. Simply bringing two pieces of metal together for instant death? It's absolute magic! So there's also the wizardry component of it. It tickles our love of fantasy stories and arcane power, and the irresponsible handling thereof. Elsewhere someone mentions lighting cigarettes at a gas station. That situation has similar aspects, but lacks the magical flair. reply mikewarot 12 minutes agorootparent>Simply bringing two pieces of metal together for instant death? It's absolute magic! There wasn't anything instant about the death, from Wikipedia:[1] Despite intensive medical care and offers from numerous volunteers to donate blood for transfusions, Slotin's condition was incurable.[2] He called his parents and they were flown at Army expense from Winnipeg to be with him. They arrived on the fourth day after the incident, and by the fifth day his condition started to deteriorate rapidly. Over the next four days, Slotin suffered an \"agonizing sequence of radiation-induced traumas\", including severe diarrhea, reduced urine output, swollen hands, erythema, \"massive blisters on his hands and forearms\", intestinal paralysis and gangrene. He had internal radiation burns throughout his body, which one medical expert described as a \"three-dimensional sunburn.\" By the seventh day, he was experiencing periods of \"mental confusion.\" His lips turned blue and he was put in an oxygen tent. He ultimately experienced \"a total disintegration of bodily functions\" and slipped into a coma. Slotin died at 11 a.m. on 30 May, in the presence of his parents.

The other people in the room got a couple years’ worth of rads from his mistake didn’t they? I’m sure they rationalized not using an apparatus for this due to embrittlement, thermal expansion, response time, or all three. But from the perspective of someone looking back on this era 50 years later (now 80), Jesus fucking Christ.

So obscenely reckless. reply vundercind 2 hours agorootparentYep. It's like someone chain-smoking cigarettes while working with gasoline. There's a \"yo, WTF?\" humor to how reckless it is.

She used to chain smoke as well. Whenever a customer would complain, she would intentionally spill a tiny bit of gasoline on the ground[1], then put her cigarette out in the puddle. She told me she would never light one while filling, because the spark and flame from the lighter could be enough to start a fire, but that the cigarette itself was not hot enough. I've never repeated this experiment. 1: Yeah I know this is a bad idea itself, but what can you do? She was ~20 and her pre-frontal cortex was still not fully developed. reply lenerdenator 4 hours agorootparentprevPart of me thinks he'd laugh his ass off at the memes.

Like its own unique and wildly unexpected category of the Darwin awards. Yeah it’s sad but it is almost difficult to believe, so it ends up being kind of funny reply caseyy 10 minutes agoparentprevIt's also important to acknowledge the reader's (or viewer's) relationship to the accident. While the accident may have been awful and full of suffering, the average reader may be exposed really only to 1% of that experience. And so for them making dark comedy out of the events is not in bad taste. My point is that not everyone should be fully traumatized by every historic traumatic event. That is (luckily) not how our brains work and they have defence mechanisms against it, too. We can live in a world where there is tremendous suffering, and continue history built on immense suffering, without becoming dysfunctionally depressed. And yet, it seems like certain people really want to force everyone to be exposed to traumatic history through guilt and shame. Like shaming someone's taste in comedy because they chose not to fully experience and become fully aware of the suffering in the \"source material\" of the joke. reply tokai 4 hours agoparentprevYeah the article completely misses the mark there. The suffering is not even a part of the meme, nobody really delves into that. reply PaulHoule 4 hours agorootparentI think it's about that ecstasy in losing yourself in something that can sometimes cause you to lose your life. reply sho_hn 4 hours agorootparentI think it's about something else: In German there's the word \"betriebsblind\", an adjective that describes a state of knowing better but out of convenience/lazyness/routine foregoing precautions or ignoring warning signs, often resulting in preventable calamity. It's relatable: It's so human to experience fatigue and just let it go and do it the quick way that one time. From jaywalking to not checking whether the power is turned off. The Demon Core is an exciting parable about how closely we're flirting with death when we do that. Just one little slip, and life completely changes from one moment to the next. It's that wretching discomfort of how easy it is to imagine being Slotin. The nihilistic humor/sarcasm is a way to cope/confront it all. reply skullt 4 hours agorootparentThat doesn't quite fit either. Slotin did the screwdriver trick a bunch of times before the accident. He was showing off. reply vanderZwan 3 hours agorootparentWeirdly enough that conclusion reminds me of a scene I once saw in a nature documentary. It involved a species of birds where the males showed off their \"fitness\" to the females by doing dangerous things. One remarkable thing was that in one particular area near a highway, a group had adapted to show off by diving in front of a car without being hit (I guess that that species already used to do that with snakes and other predators before). Anyway, in a general sense that's a particular type of sexual selection[0] that's been observed more often: showing that you are a healthy individual with good genes by taking risks. It probably has name. I suspect that with humans it's also an instinctual way of showing off who is the strongest in your peer group, without the sexual selection connotations. EDIT: turns out the wikipedia article was one click removed from what I had in mind: signaling theory!

Doing party tricks with barely sub-critical masses absolutely qualifies for me. reply PaulHoule 3 hours agorootparentprevThere is Slotin and his motivations and then there is the visual vocabulary of musume art and how it represents emotions. The quickest way to get schooled on the latter is to watch the anime for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azumanga_Daioh which has a mad scientist character that I can easily picture screwing around with plutonium half-sphere and a screwdriver. reply Dilettante_ 1 hour agorootparentI don't remember a scientist in Azumanga Daioh, were you thinking of Nichijou? reply throw7 2 hours agorootparentprevThat makes this even more funny.

But on the surface level of it, it's a scientist doing something knowingly incredibly dangerous and dumb for no particularly justifiable reason. We've all felt a bit like that at some point. We just probably didn't have a core and a screwdriver. reply vundercind 2 hours agoparentIt's a master-tier Darwin Award win. That's why it's funny. Same reason should-have-known-better accidents often get a laugh even when the consequences were pretty grave. \"I'm a highly-trained scientist who helped develop the bombs that leveled two cities and usher in the nuclear era... yeah, lemme just fuck around with this bomb core and a screwdriver such that I'm one muscle-twitch from killing everyone around me, that seems fine.\" reply numpad0 2 hours agoprevOh they still haven't figured this one out at knowyourmeme? Demon Core meme came from KanColle(2013) communities in Futaba, and permeated to nicovideo.jp as well as to Twitter. That's why it is predominantly image based with few GIFs inbetween, why it is Demon Core and Demon Core only, and why there are few comical non-girl versions created years after inception.

What's the context? I have no idea what those communities are. reply PaulHoule 4 hours agoprevOddly the art is largely Japanese in style, not just the musume (e.g. \"girl\") images but that first one. Between that accident and the year 2000 there were about 60 criticality accidents causing about 20 fatalities https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ml0037/ML003731912.pdf After a software project failure that overturned my life I got interested in the quality movement, Deming, Toyota Production System and all that. I was also interested in nuclear energy, actually opposed to it at that time, an opinion I have changed. Before the Fukushima accident I became aware that Japan was leading the world in nuclear accidents, especially this criticality incident https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-sec... as well as the comedy of errors at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monju_Nuclear_Power_Plant which I could summarize as \"makes Superphenix look like a huge success\" Causes floated for that were that (1) Japan was more aggressive at developing nuclear technology post-1990 more than any country other than Russia (who is making the FBR look easy today) and (2) the attitudes and methods that served Japan well in cars and semiconductors served them terribly in the nuclear business. Workgroups in a Japanese factory, for instance, are expected to modify their techniques and tools to improve production but takes detailed modelling and strict following of rules to avoid criticality accidents. reply marcosdumay 5 minutes agoparent> Workgroups in a Japanese factory, for instance, are expected to modify their techniques and tools to improve production If you go through the Fukushima disaster handling, that doesn't seem to have happened at all. In fact, people seemed to be super inflexible and actions seemed to have a long authorization chain. The Toyota Production System wasn't actually that free, it expected people to report the changes before they happen and had plenty of opportunities for a manager to step in and stop it. Anyway, I'm not sure how widely it was adopted in Japan, the system famously came from there, but the country isn't famous for applying it. reply dale_glass 4 hours agoprevDespite it being so famous, and the memes, I still don't understand what Slotin was doing. So I get it, it was a demonstration of how to perform an experiment. But I can't understand how the screwdriver makes any sense at all. What's being measured? What does success and failure look like? What does the experiment produce, what data in what format? Because in my head, a proper experiment has data collection and precise measurements. Somebody's working on a data table that says \"At position X, we measured value Y\". But randomly wiggling stuff around with a screwdriver, I can't see how one can do anything of the sort. And I figure at this level, \"more coverage = more radiation\" is kind of a trivial point that doesn't really need to be demonstrated. reply lm28469 4 hours agoparentIt's all in the wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_core > It required the operator to place two half-spheres of beryllium (a neutron reflector) around the core to be tested and manually lower the top reflector over the core using a thumb hole at the polar point. As the reflectors were manually moved closer and farther away from each other, neutron detectors indicated the core's neutron multiplication rate. The experimenter needed to maintain a slight separation between the reflector halves to allow enough neutrons to escape from the core in order to stay below criticality. The standard protocol was to use shims between the halves, as allowing them to close completely could result in the instantaneous formation of a critical mass and a lethal power excursion. > Because in my head, a proper experiment has data collection and precise measurements. In your head yes, in early nuclear science it seems protocols weren't that important as long as it went boom in the end. As with many industries, regulations are written in blood reply atomicnumber3 3 hours agorootparentI've read about this in a few different mediums before and no it's not just that protocols weren't that important. The guy doing this experiment was *notorious* for it and multiple other manhattan project people had already told him he was going to die if he kept doing it. But he had the kind of bravado and personality that he kept doing it. So to be clear: all of the other people whose risk tolerance levels already had them handling weapons-grade plutonium as a career ALSO thought this guy was insane for doing this. reply vundercind 2 hours agorootparentHe took a dip in a pool with a functioning nuclear pile some time before that just to avoid having to shut the thing down before doing some maintenance, taking a pretty big dose.

How can you measure the core's neutron multiplication rate if you're not exactly controlling the distance? Isn't the measurement going to be all over the place? reply kstrauser 3 hours agorootparentIn a demonstration, not an experiment, it’s sufficient to have the Geiger counter go clicky at different rates while the demonstrator plays the sphere like a theremin. The point was to show it to people, not to collect data. reply lm28469 3 hours agorootparentprevIt was a boy's club with unlimited funding working on things that were never attempted before, a lot of things weren't exactly done by the books, even their original \"safe\" protocol would seem completely insane by modern standards. As long as it went boom in the end and they kept it secret I doubt they had many rules reply michaelt 2 hours agorootparentprevImagine if you'd invented the world's first modern sink, in a world that had never seen a faucet or a plughole before. And you're training some new guys on the details of what you're working on. Sure, some of that training is going to involve blackboard calculations and careful measurements. But you're also probably going to demonstrate a sink to them and say \"As you can see, when we turn this knob more hot water is added to the mix. Note how, after I put the plug in the plughole, the water level starts rising.\" The purpose of the demo isn't to precisely measure the depth of the water or the temperature at the faucet or the angle the tap is turned to. It's just to let them see the thing in practice, so as they study it in theory they know what to imagine and how the model maps onto the real world. reply GTP 3 hours agorootparentprevRegardless of the outcome, this still looks like a poor demonstration: what's the point of showing how it is done, if you're not following the protocol anyway? My understanding is that those in the room where nuclear experts, so they didn't need a demonstration to know that, the closer the two cores where, the higher the radiation. reply SoftTalker 2 hours agorootparentSame reason that chemistry professors demonstrate dramatic reactions in front of the class from time to time. It's fun, and keeps things interesting, even if you already know the chemical processes that are happening. reply sho_hn 4 hours agoparentprevMy understanding is that he was demonstrating a technique for how to bring the system to near supercriticality, without causing it. I.e. the objective was to look at the measurement devices they had and monitor them, and build an understanding of what the data was showing. This would then (in principle) be repeated by others with more specific objectives later. Obviously they should've built a rig for that (at least), but I guess there was a \"ain't nobody got time for that\" attitude. reply dale_glass 4 hours agorootparentRight, but shouldn't distance be a critical part of such a measurement? Like if we measure the amount of noise a device makes, we do it in a quiet room and at a standard distance. Without precision there's no useful data being generated. So that's the part that I don't get. Shouldn't there be a screw being turned precise amounts, precisely made shims, or at least calipers be involved? reply StableAlkyne 3 hours agorootparentThe honest truth is there's just a certain acceptable level of jank in a scientific lab. Not everything needs to be measured to a high precision to be useful, and it's always a balance of how much effort you want to expend versus how useful that extra accuracy/precision is. If all you care about is \"when you're getting close to a critical mass, your instruments will look like this,\" you don't care that you have a wide swing in your data. You just want to show a difference from baseline. reply davisp 3 hours agorootparentprevSometimes science doesn’t have to be precise to demonstrate a result. Consider trying to measure feedback from a microphone and speaker. You don’t have to be an expert to know that there’s a quick change in system behavior when the microphone gets too close to the speaker. reply stetrain 2 hours agorootparentprevIf the goal is to collect precise data and use it after the experiment to draw conclusions, update a model, etc. then sure. If the goal is to demonstrate to observers how the neutron output (reaction rate) increases as the reflectors are moved closer together over the source, then that isn't really necessary. This seems more like an incredibly dangerous version of a demonstration you might see at an interactive science museum or a classroom. You don't need precise measurements to demonstrate the relationship between two phenomenon. reply sho_hn 4 hours agorootparentprevI think it was more about being able to understand/read what the measurement devices were showing. The exact distance probably wasn't as important as the criticality could also vary with other variables (e.g. geometry). As in, you're trying to understand the situation as \"shouldn't they have precisely nailed down all the parameters, if the goal is to measure when X starts happening\". But it seems Slotin was more demonstrating \"this is what you're going to see on the monitors when stuff is close to going boom\". It wasn't about \"this specific distance is a safe gap\" and more \"here's how you can tell whether the gap is safe\". He was about to be reassigned out of the lab, and was demonstrating equipment to his designated successors. reply vanderZwan 4 hours agoprevThe author mentions 2019. That was the year that the \"Demon Core Kun\" videos were put on YouTube[0]. There's no mention of them in the article, which is a bit odd. I don't know if that was the first to \"memeify\" the demon core, but it certainly is one of the most popular memeifications, with each of the eight videos having somewhere between three to six million views. This also would explain the relatively large presence of anime memes in particular, since the \"main\" meme is a series of Japanese animations. EDIT: knowyourmeme.com actually has an article about the Demon Core and its popularity in Japan as a meme[1]. Apparently the latter predates the Demon Core Kun series by about a year at least. Still, the latter being on YT made it a lot more accessible to non-Japanese people which might explain the spike in meme popularity in 2019.

There are many examples from WW2 comedy to 9/11 memes. Sometimes the examples are more indirect, like in film: American Psycho, American Beauty, Wolf of Wall Street, The Big Short, Fargo, Don't Look Up, Fight Club, Quentin Tarantino's stuff, etc. All of them deal with dark themes in a light way. Given the prevalence of this in our culture, the author seems a bit surprised. Maybe they didn't connect it to dark comedy. reply ziddoap 4 hours agoparent>Maybe they didn't connect it to dark comedy.

With Thermonuclear War: no one is around to experience anything after a comedian bombs on the world stage. Stanley Kubrick was famous for making actors miserable, but reminded us film is ultimately a collaborative art form. =3 reply derektank 3 hours agoparentprevYeah, in spite of the author's claims to not want to be the humor police, this really just reads as someone who takes their work as a historian of nuclear weapons 'very seriously' and doesn't want it to be joked about. The SNL joke he identified as being particularly offensive (\"Having received the Novel Peace Prize, the survivors of the nuclear bombings called the award the second biggest surprise of their lives\") is ... pretty anodyne? It's not making fun of the survivors or glorifying cruelty, it's just contrasting the banal things people say when receiving awards with the extreme reality of having endured one of the most awful events in human history. That kind of juxtaposition is pretty par for the course in comedy, let alone dark comedy. And when it comes to engaging with the reality of awful events, not everyone wants to or has the capacity to treat them with the grave solemnity the author seems to expect. reply Verdex 2 hours agorootparentIIRC John Cleese has a talk from years ago where he makes a very interesting point that seriousness and solemnity are two very different things. In his opinion, killing humor is the same as killing creativity and killing creativity is the same as inviting disaster and/or failure for the sake of your ego. Not being solemn is not the same as not being serious. I think your last sentence there really is the right take away here. But even more than that, I think the right way to prevent future tragedies is with humor not solemnity. reply pawelduda 19 minutes agoprevMy favourite one is the flail with the demon core attached to it.

Dark humor, in its own strange and inverted way, is arguably a sort of coping mechanism — a defense against the darkness, a way to tame and de-fang the horrors of the world. reply moate 2 hours agoparentI am always of the opinion that as long as the joke lands with the audience or does what the teller intended, it's a good joke. Comedy is about a give and take between the comedian/artist/whatever and their audience. The problem arises when people think they are an intended audience when they are not (the pope going to a Bill Hicks show), or when a comedian thinks that they're in front of their intended audience when they are not (a conservative comic at the Appolo). A lot of people need to learn this on both sides, and more importantly need to stop complaining when they come to this realization. reply itishappy 4 hours agoprevNo mention of the earlier XKCD mentioning the demon core? It's what set in motion my particular interest in nuclear accidents. I don't agree with the author's analysis here. I think the demon core is simply memorable.

The kinder surprise one is absolute genius! reply wruza 4 hours agoprevWhat is going on here? I am not exceptionally well-versed in anime or manga tropes, but I think the “obvious” reading of this is a classic case of “unexpected juxtaposition creates humor.” That is, moving something from one context (“Demon Core,” radiation experiment, horrible death) into another (cute, anime, girls) creates something that feels novel and unusual Ah, sir, I guess you’re completely unfamiliar with anime tropes. From absurd brutality to dark drama (much worse than your Titanic Ending and Futurama Dog), everything can be found in anime. Thinking that these are cute animations for teens and children is a big mistake. I, a grown up adult, usually dread when an anime plot is too nice to its actors and think if I want to watch it further. This juxtaposition is well-expected. reply bitwize 4 hours agoparentThere's a lot of light and fluffy fare in anime. Even back in the 90s when I was used to sex, violence, drama, and strong character lore in my anime, I discovered You're Under Arrest and was a bit surprised to discover that it pretty much went nowhere, just an episodic series full of funny things for the characters to do. Especially surprising for a show about police officers, which in American media usually means it's a \"procedural\" with particularly dangerous criminals and high stakes. But in YUA the officers mainly deal with petty criminals and get up to wacky hijinks. More recent series, like Azumanga Daioh and Lucky Star, are pretty much just schoolgirls doing cute things. And maybe that's just the energy you need sometimes rather than, say, the horror and drama of Attack On Titan. To paraphrase Brad Bird, anime is not a genre. It's a broad art form that encompasses all genres. This is a common mistake for Western viewers of anime; even in the 90s it was marketed to us as being all dark, twisted Liquid Television stuff. But yeah, actually, most anime is created for and marketed to kids and teens. In Japan, if you're an adult consumer of anime, your peers may wonder what the hell is wrong with you and why won't you grow up. (Manga is different; plenty of manga are produced for adult consumption, and these are fairly serious in tone, and may lack the fantastic settings or big-eyed character designs Westerners associate with the medium.) Adult anime otaku in Japan are viewed with the same bemusement and contempt we might have for, say, the grown-ass men who are fans of My Little Pony. This may have changed more recently, as the Japanese government has leaned into the idea of anime and manga being important cultural exports through its \"Cool Japan\" publicity program. reply niemandhier 3 hours agoprev [–] Part of the reason why we slowed down in our progress in science is that we do not take risks like that anymore.

Methodology The Interactive Module The Interactive Module consists of an Embedding block and a cross-attention layer, translating keyboard inputs into natural language commands for video generation. For example, pressing W becomes “The car is driving forward” in Forza Horizon 5 or “The man is moving forward and looking up” in Cyberpunk 2077 when combined with upward mouse movement. For unlabeled data, a default description, “The camera is moving in an unknown way,” is applied. To enhance robustness, during training, we randomly replace labeled keyboard inputs with the default sentence with a probability q = 0.1. Before training, the base DiT model is warmed up using game and real-world data, fine-tuning a LoRA weight. This ensures the Interactive Module focuses on learning interactions and movement patterns, rather than simply fitting the video. The Swin-Denoise Process Model Traditional DiT models generate only short videos due to high computational costs and memory demands of attention mechanisms over extended durations. To overcome this, we propose the Shift-Window Denoise Process Models (Swin-DPM), leveraging a sliding temporal window to handle dependencies effectively and enable long or infinite video generation. As shown in the Figure, the Swin-DPM processes video tokens in a queue using denoising steps. Tokens are cached after denoising, maintaining continuity between windows. This fine-tuned model builds on pre-trained DiT, where the first window of tokens is used for warmup, and loss is computed only on subsequent tokens. At inference, warmup tokens are discarded, and video generation begins from the (w+1)-th token, enabling efficient and continuous video generation. Training Process The training process of The Matrix begins with a pretrained video DiT backbone. The Interactive Module is first warmed up with data from the GameData Platform using unsupervised LoRA to focus on movement rather than visuals. Subsequently, precise frame-level control is achieved through targeted training. With Swin-DPM enabling infinite-length generation and Stream Consistency Models (SCMs) ensuring real-time speeds, The Matrix delivers groundbreaking video simulations. Generate Infinte-Horizon The Matrix World Current state-of-the-art DiT-based video generation models (e.g., CogVideo, Open-Sora) are limited to producing videos just a few seconds long, making them insufficient for creating an infinite-horizon world. The Matrix overcomes this limitation by introducing Swin-DPM, which significantly extends the receptive field of attention computations while maintaining the same computational cost. This innovation enables the generation of high-quality, super-long-duration videos with consistent visuals, all within an achievable compute budget. 1 Min Gallery (1 min clip with 16 fps ~ 960 frames) Previous Scene Desert admin@matrix: In a barren desert, a white SUV is making its way across the rugged terrain.

How does the spatiality fit into some latent space? Or what constitutes the \"world\"? If the answer is, there is none, the world is just frames of video and any consistency quickly blurs out after a few seconds. That's not a world generation, that's just generation of video frames following frames. Not that it isn't cool, but it has almost zero usability for generating a \"world\" simulation. The key to a realistic world is that you can reliably navigate it. Visit and revisit places. If you modify anything, those modifications are persisted. If you leave a room and re-enter it hours later, the base expectation is that the same objects are in that room. Wouldn't a working approach be to just create a really low resolution 3D world in the traditional \"3D game world\" sense to get the spatial consistency. Then this crude map with attributes is fed into frame generation to create the resulting world? It wouldn't be infinite, but on the other hand no one has a need for an infinite world either. A spherical world solves the border issue pretty handily. As I understood it, there was some element of that in the new FS2024 (discussed yesterday on HN). reply jerf 1 hour agoparent\"Wouldn't a working approach be to just create a really low resolution 3D world in the traditional \"3D game world\" sense to get the spatial consistency.

And when you turn around, then turn back to where you were facing, you don't feel like you're in a fever dream, because the landscape hasn't completely shifted. The tech is neat and I'm sure worth publishing. The rhetoric accompanying it is terribly overblown. Of course that's as likely to be their University PR department as the authors. reply astrobe_ 45 minutes agoparentprev> Wouldn't a working approach be to just create a really low resolution 3D world in the traditional \"3D game world\" sense to get the spatial consistency. Then this crude map with attributes is fed into frame generation to create the resulting world? If you go \"ultra-low\" resolution, that's basically Minecraft or Luanti (formerly Minetest). There some mods for Luanti that let one generate a less \"squary\" world by adding slopes, but that's still heavily polygonal. > It wouldn't be infinite, but on the other hand no one has a need for an infinite world either. Minecraft has an infinite world (with glitches when you go very far from origin due to floating point errors). Luanti's world is finite (around 64000 m^3 because 16 bits coordinates; players move at 2-4m/s usually), some people are working to make it infinite. In my opinion, you are right that nobody needs an infinite world; the argument for an infinite world is that a finite world can be a problem on popular servers but in my eyes servers where this is a problem don't use enough the available space (in particular the huge vertical space that can be used to create multiple worlds) or shoot themselves in the foot by providing players with ways to move fast (mainly transports); increasing the player's speed actually shrinks the world. I think there is a conundrum from the players and gameplay perspective. On one hand, you want a lot of space, but on the other hand you want to be close to other players (for commerce, play together, etc.). It's not enough to have an infinite world, you also have to have the gameplay that goes with it. Another thing to consider are the interaction of mobiles (NPCs, enemies) with the terrain. Because nobody likes an infinitely empty world either. I haven't played an AAA game recently, but a decade ago even with precomputed terrain, some mobiles would look silly sometimes with steep terrains. reply roboboffin 7 hours agoparentprevNot an expert, but I think procedurally generated terrain is generally fractal in nature, and is reproducible in that sense from a seed that is used in the generation. It is therefore recursive, as fractals are recursive. A traditional neural network is a universal function approximator, however it is not recursive in nature, unless it is some sort of RNN. The transformer architecture, which this seems fairly similar to this one, is also not recursive in nature; although I believe, limited recursion can come about through CoT. Therefore, I don't believe this could match the reproducibility, in an infinite sense, of a traditional procedural generator. reply astrobe_ 31 minutes agorootparentLuanti [1] (Minetest) has a fractal map generator (\"mapgen\"). You can test it for yourself. It's funny at first but becomes eventually boring. Its other mapgens massively some kind of Perlin noise in various ways, so that you can have \"realistic\" landscapes (e.g. the Carpethian mapgen) or landscapes with impossible mountains and floating rocks sometimes (e.g. the V7 mapgen) that are good for fantasy/sci-fi worlds. Noise is a pretty efficient way to fake complexity, and it's not a coincidence [2].

The sensors are very much connected, just to whatever. Hence why you can grow dragon wings in your dreams and feel them. Memories can be made as well.

My longest dream was nine years compressed into a 12-hour sleep period. reply jebarker 1 hour agorootparent> My longest dream was nine years compressed into a 12-hour sleep period.

Because thats not how it works in the brain. We have the part which controls your muscles and we have another part which simulates the movement. Not executing on it has nothing to do with the brain stem disconnecting from the 'body'. Its the same mechanism as you thinking about a movement but not doing it. reply lxgr 4 hours agorootparentI believe it's a much more fundamental difference than just the distinction between ideating and acting. Many people occasionally experience the transition between \"conencted\" and \"disconnected\" states as a sudden jerk or loud noise just at the moment of falling asleep. Sleep paralysis is another \"failure mode\" of this mechanism that reveals what's going on. (I'm not sure if there is a reverse to it, i.e. whether sleepwalking could be explained as a drastic fail-open of the same mechanism). reply QuantumG 9 hours agoparentprevWhat you really want is a story telling engine informing the world model and the humans need to generate power. reply ilaksh 10 hours agoprevI'm into VR and mixed reality, and I think this is headed to making the Holodeck real in an immersive way. That's the concept of the Matrix and what they are demoing, just in 2d. I am guessing the main thing holding this stuff back in terms of fidelity and consistency or generalization is just compute. But the new techniques they have here have just dramatically lowered the compute costs and increased the generalization. Maybe just something like the giant Cerebras SRAM chips will get to the next 10 X in scale that smooths this out and pushes it closer to Star Trek. Or maybe some new paradigm like memristors. But I'm looking forward to within just a few years being able to put on some fairly comfortable mixed reality glasses and just asking for whatever or whoever I want to appear in my home (for example) according to my whim. Or, train it on a lot of how-to videos such as cooking. It just materializes an example of someone showing you exactly what you need to do right in your kitchen. Here's another crazy idea: train on videos and interactions with productivity applications rather than games.

Also graphhopper web has regular bike mode and \"racing bike\", they tend to come up with different routes, wondering if it's incorporated on your side somehow or if there is a way to influence RWGPS algorithm to be more \"road cycling\" vs casual cycling (I think that's what graphhopper means by \"racing\"). reply cullenking 27 minutes agorootparentWe have an update to our web and mobile route planners coming out in the next month that adds more specific bike profiles, including paved/unpaved preferences and cycling infrastructure preferences.

May be useful to you or others in this thread. We lean pretty heavily into the \"cycling power user\" market segment, the feature set isn't always the most discoverable but it's quite comprehensive if you put in the up-front time to learn the tooling (similar to a lot of other specialty mapping apps out there - caltopo, fatmap (rip) etc) reply wintermutestwin 2 hours agorootparentA subscription? $10 a month??

For example, I do bicycle touring, weeks-long or months-long trips every year, and the RideWithGps route planner/navigation tools are extremely useful when riding thousands of miles by yourself in places you aren't familiar with. reply vanilla_nut 2 hours agorootparentprevI've used ridewithGPS for multiple bike tours, the longest being a full month of unsupported riding. I also use it to scout out routes when I want to create a new ride somewhere in my area on roads I don't know already. ridwithGPS has a few features that really stand out, IMO: * excellent, almost entirely bug-free routing on mobile * heatmap data, because maps aren't entirely up-to-date * multiple map styles, so you can pick what works best for your workflow and the country you're in * easy GPX file export, I use it all the time with the bike computer (every day on tours) * collection management, especially useful when I make per-day routes for a tour * a healthy trial period so you can actually test it out and learn it Basically it's just an excellent app (and site) that works reliably across every supported platform, that isn't full of spammy upselling garbage, that is clearly made by a competent team of developers who care deeply about the product they make. Every tech product should be made like this. A lot of tech products used to be like this before enshittification really took off in the last 5-10 years. I'm more than happy to support a great product like this, as a bicycle tourist and frequent router over unfrequented trails and dirt roads in the mountains around me. For road riders in cities, it's probably a whole lot less useful. But there are a lot of bicycle riding use cases outside of 'road riders in cities' :-) reply wintermutestwin 1 hour agorootparent>frequent router over unfrequented trails and dirt roads in the mountains around me This is me as well. Thanks much for your perspective, it was helpful in me making the decision to jump in. I do like the idea of supporting products and services that are staving off enshitificaiton. reply carlosjobim 1 hour agorootparentprev$10 per month is the minimum price that you should use for any software or digital product. People who are unwilling to pay $10 per month are also unwilling to pay $5 per month or $1 per month – regardless of how much value they get from the product. Ten dollars is the bottom. Why should it be a subscription instead of a pay-once app? Maps have to update as the real world updates, and probably they have other features that can't be on-device. reply cullenking 1 hour agorootparentprevI didn't downvote you FYI, but to answer your question, I run ridewithgps and as a result have a pretty in depth understanding of all the costs involved. We have 14 machines in a rack at a datacenter in PDX, and have focused on low hosting costs since we have historically been bootstrapped and margin sensitive. Redundant switches, 2 firewall/load balancers, 4 compute machines, 3 database machines, 5 storage servers. Single upstream network provider, about to be two sometime next year. Rack space + power + redundant network is about $3500 a month. Machines have an average service life of about 5 years. Database machines cost about $45k for a set of three. Storing user data is non-trivial - GPS track files add up when you get close to a billion of them, photos are also very large. We use a self-hosted ceph object storage cluster of 5 machines, about $100k of hardware. it's cheaper than 20k a month in S3 bills. Our rack all-in is probably about $250k of equipment. 5 year service life, probably $5k a month amortized out. So, doing things as cheap as possible (I buy nvme SSDs for storage cluster off ebay, and am about to buy a couple arista 100gbe switches from ebay as well) we are somewhere around $8500 a month on hosting. We use both google maps as well as self-hosted OSM based map and routing services. About half our map usage goes to google, by user preference, and we pay them about $20,000 per month for that. Our self-hosted OSM map stuff require 1tb of ram, fast disks, a ton of CPU cores. We host 10 different planet scale routing profiles via graphhopper, which take 3 days to build every week with updated data. They also host a vector maps stack which is much more efficient, taking about 3 hours a week to build. My last estimate of an AWS bill for all the above was $30k a month, assuming some discounts. We have grown since then and I'd napkin us to be > $40k a month at this point. We strive to minimize any costs for third party platforms. We do use amplitude for analytics, that's > $30k a year at this point. We do use an external email service for easy marketing emails, but the majority of our millions of emails a month are sent from our own mail servers, using an in-house system we made a decade ago that still works well. We try to minimize vendor lockin and costs, where it makes sense. Most expensive part of the entire company of course is salaries, with of course an eye to developer and related salaries. We run pretty bare bones where possible, with a flat management structure with minimal overhead. Our total staff size is 32, of which 6 are full-time end user support. A bit of a ramble, sorry, but there's a large amount of overhead to run a system like ours. We don't just make a one-time use desktop application, we have to continually provide storage and compute for all users. If we stopped that, the entire service would fall apart. So yes, a subscription makes sense in a case like ours. You can't do what we do with a desktop app. Plus, the entire world has switched to mobile for this sort of consumer application, which is an entire rat race of it's own. You can't just release a single purchase app and expect it to be maintained, it's a massive effort to keep up with mobile development just to maintain features, much less build anything new. reply wintermutestwin 1 hour agorootparentI sincerely appreciate your serious answer to my serious question. I am quite surprised at all these costs considering that OSM is free, but you explained them very thoroughly and I am impressed. You have adequately justified the subscription requirement. This post, combined with the fact that your planner actually allows me to force a path has won me as a customer. I'll also note that setting your yearly at 75% of the monthly is wise considering very low winter time usage. For me, churn or not is going to come down to whether I can read critical details on your mobile app without having to put reading glasses on. (which is a factor that not even a $2t company like Apple can address properly) reply cullenking 1 hour agorootparentUnfortunately we still have work to do there. We have dabbled in a separate map style, but it's really difficult to get any roadnames to show up when you start increasing font sizes in map styles. It's a sort of pick-your-poison - big maps where you can see the roads with almost no road names, or maps with smaller details with road names. The app itself should mostly scale well with increased system font sizes, but we are still carving out a couple of webviews in the app which have funky behavior. I do like to joke that with our average staff age passing 40 in the next year or two, we'll solve all readability issues.... reply wintermutestwin 30 minutes agorootparentWell, at least you are aware and considering oldster eyes Apple regularly makes incredibly bad UI choices that would be easy to avoid. Serious cyclists tend to be on the older side… reply kemotep 1 hour agorootparentprevAlways great to see a successful “Single Rack of Failure” project out in the wild. And I don’t mean this as a negative. By being able to contain and control all the business into a single rack, you can more easily set up redundancy than trying to replicate your AWS environment between availability zones or worst, try recreating it in Azure or Google with all the different services, footguns, and so on. Just get another rack in a different datacenter and you’re set. Congratulations to your team on keeping costs low and running a successful business out of a single rack. reply cullenking 1 hour agorootparentWe are just about finished with a total hoist into a self-hosted k8s cluster.

We don't need crazy redundancy and are OK with a certain amount of risk to availability and a) Most people are mobile first I couldn't imagine trying to build a complex route on a tiny screen with a crappy phone UI.

But on the laptop the kid was as lost as I was when my dad showed me a slide rule (i'm 38). reply carlosjobim 3 hours agorootparentprevI think the purpose is to export the route to GPX, so that you can use it on your phone when you're cycling. reply verelo 3 hours agorootparentYeah, that's fair. I just don't have a habit of doing that so for me the GPX thing while good is a change in behaviour that limits me from adopting this app / exploring new trails. Also on further thought, i could see myself wanting to change the route mid-journey and that would be another issue with only having the GPX file. reply qwertox 3 hours agoparentprevI share your perspective. I use Komoot extensively and I use it only on the phone for recording the ride, have it route me through the trip I planned on the web interface, and also to check where some paths I find during the ride lead to. If I then decide to use that unknown path, I either add a new waypoint or just ignore it until I'm on the planned track again (just seeing the trails is then good enough). There are simply some things where a phone screen is just too small to use efficiently, and the fingers sometimes aren't just a good, precise enough input device. Though I am a bit irritated by the brightness of the route on your site, it lacks contrast with respect to the surrounding map. BTW, how is that routing done? Like which is the used routing engine and is it done server-side or in the browser? --- It does seem to have a bug, where, when deleting a waypoint, the mouse still is in \"create waypoint mode\", and any mouse-down on the map, including for panning, results in adding a waypoint. reply ickelbawd 3 hours agoparentprevPerhaps the number of mobile users would be lower than desktop, but I’ve had to reroute a planned trip from my phone a few times now due to unforeseen construction and road obstructions. reply pppone 2 hours agoparentprev+1 for mobile.

The project is in a very early stage so I didn't expect such a response. reply chainwax 1 hour agoprevI love where you're going with this, nearly all of my little side projects have something to do with maps and bikes. No comment on how the routes are as I'm not really familiar with any good routes in bigger Euro cities, but as someone who rides around NYC a lot this would be really useful in making routes for visitors who aren't as keen on riding in NYC traffic. Mobile needs some work. Are you planning on open sourcing this? I'm a mobile dev that might be able to clean that up a little. Good candidate for React Native. reply insane_dreamer 58 minutes agoprevNicely done! I use Komoot and RidewithGPS, but this is a nice tool if you want to plan a route that relies on bike trails as much as possible. Would be cool to also show the elevation for a given segment along with its distance (in the route trail list). And maybe when you click on a segment in the map, it should highlight that segment in the trial list so you see the length of that segment. I realize you're just using existing map data, but some bike routes seem to be broken up with very small (couple km) gaps (shown in grey) -- is that really the case? (see Loire a Velo 4 for example) reply Doctor_Fegg 5 hours agoprevNice! I added a similar feature to cycle.travel (my site) a few months back. 5% of the work was writing the code to route only on waymarked routes, 95% was writing code to \"heal\" the accidental breaks in OSM bike route data... reply wintermutestwin 2 hours agoparentYour site doesn't appear to have waypoints?

And same question for the OP. Doing OSM editing from Mapillary imagery in various US states, I find that the roads that have roadside signage as “official bike routes”, predate modern safe(r) bike infrastructure. These are often highways that frankly look like death traps: no shoulder, high speed limits. Especially when so many North American long-haul cyclists now are riding “bikepacking” setups, it may be preferable for a router to prioritize quiet agricultural tracks and other unpaved terrain over the supposedly official bike route. reply Doctor_Fegg 2 hours agorootparentYeah, waymarked routes in much of the US are an absolute embarrassment. Last time I went cycling in NY State the worst part of the whole route was the official State Bicycle Route. The quiet roads were lovely. cycle.travel treats routes in the States differently to those in Europe for precisely this reason, and there are some routes which get absolutely zero uplift because many of them are so bad (looking at you, East Coast Greenway). reply rafram 1 hour agoprevThis may not be the site's problem, but why is the OSM map showing some place name labels in Gaelic?

The map pulls up somewhere in Europe, even though I am in the bay area. I can’t really see for sure because the side bar covers the whole map. I cannot zoom in or out at all. When I clicked to add a point, it just adds it in a random location. The map is really zoomed out so a few pixels is like 100 km. There is metadata displayed such as the length of my route, but it seems I cannot input a length and have it create a route for me I have personally had good luck with my Garmin watch. If I start out near a major trail, it tends to suggest routes along that trail. I’m able to input a desired length such as 10 miles and then it suggests multiple routes that are close to that length and use major trails. My biggest complaint with the Garmin is that it tends to suggest the same routes every day. reply unstyledcontent 2 hours agoprevI spent a minute or two trying to create a route but couldn't figure out how to do it.

A single C-17 costs over $300 million. If you ask Boeing for soap dispenser parts for these, what should they cost? Boeing charged $149,072 for the dispensers. That's $671 per plane. Is that too much? If you had to make these dispensers, make sure they conform to rules for aircraft parts and Air Force parts, provide formal responses to bids, etc., how much could you make them for? It seems high to me. The article says 8000%, which is less than $10 per plane. So while it seems high, it's definitely not 8000% high. reply bagels 11 hours agoparentCan you imagine even being a one-man shop making 222 bespoke soap dispensers to some absurd spec AND jumping through all the documentation hoops that are required for only $150k? I wouldn't take that job. Sounds awful. reply dmurray 10 hours agorootparentSounds interesting! The first year you learn how hard it is, you spend 80% of your time on compliance documentation and 80% of your budget on tooling. You still don't have a satisfactory product or a mastery of filling out the forms. It drags on into the second year, you're living on ramen but eventually deliver it (if there's one thing the government procurement process is tolerant of, it's delays) and get paid. The third year you take on a additional contract, for 200 toilet flushes or whatever. New manufacturing challenges, but at least you're getting the paperwork down. After a few more jobs, you've cracked it. You start bidding for all the military's bathroom-related contracts. At five or six contracts a year, you have a million or two rolling in (and low manufacturing costs - remember, the spec is such that you can produce it for 80x lower) and you've hired five employees. By year five, the only thing you care about improving is sales. You still have 5 machine shop staff, paid well but not enough to make them wealthy. You focus on hiring ex-military brass and making them sales reps and lobbyists. You're into tens of millions of revenue, that is, profit. Year 8, you sell the thing to Northrop or to a private equity firm and go retire on an island. reply ryandvm 4 hours agorootparentI worked on a government software contractor that ended up growing from 10 people to 300 people in about 8 years and sold to Booz Allen Hamilton for around $50 million.

Sadly I didn't get much of a payday out of it. reply neilv 9 hours agorootparentprevIf you can pull it off as a worker-owned co-op (and don't ruin it in year 8, but keep on working at the scale you want), that's a really nice business. Though you might want to also take on some non-government contracts, both to keep everyone busy in between government contract demands on their roles, and to reduce the risk of having \"only one customer\". reply JohnBooty 11 hours agorootparentprevYeah. People who haven't done manufacturing may laugh, but depending on how many custom parts there are you could easily spend most or all of that $150K just on the molds/tooling. Now, like you said... the root cause here is probably some absurd spec that prevents them from using some existing commercial soap dispenser whose costs have already been amortized. Then again, maybe the spec isn't absurd. The C-17 may need to fly in contested airspace. Maybe damage control is a concern. Maybe they can't use commercial soap dispensers because they're plastic and they don't want the plane to fill up with toxic fumes from burning plastic. That is a random guess. I have no idea. I couldn't find pictures of the soap dispenser, but here's apparently a urinal from some version of the Globemaster. I get the feeling these parts are kinda custom... https://www.flickr.com/photos/morganone/122375474/in/photost... reply bagels 10 hours agorootparentYou probably also really don't want slippery floors at a critical (or any) time. reply XorNot 10 hours agorootparentYou also can't just drill a couple of holes wherever to mount it and you don't want it turning to a missile if the plane has to do any aggressive maneuvering. reply lazide 10 hours agorootparentprevAlso, every material that goes into them needs to be tracked (with paperwork) since it was mined/smelted. reply wmf 11 hours agorootparentprevYou also need to provide exact replacement parts for 50 years so you should probably make 666 of them just to be safe. reply cenamus 10 hours agorootparentBut you also get paid for those reply mjevans 10 hours agorootparentprevI wonder what's special enough for this to be different from certified aviation grade equipment?

Is that a rip-off, or is it a niche, custom part that has to be made from automotive grade components? You can't say it's a niche part when the item is being manufactured in the hundreds of thousands or even millions. Car companies reuse components between models and sometimes even between brands. And that's without mentioning that the average 7-8\" screen or CPU in a car's entertainment system isn't a custom made part, they are bought at bulk from other manufacturers that produce (tens of) millions of units per year. You can find entertainment system replacements for most cars that cost a fraction of what the car manufacturer charges consumers.

People talk about MIL-SPEC like its some unattainable gold-standard. I can buy a MIL-SPEC rated Thinkpad from Lenovo for less than $600. I mean, sure, it doesn't dispense soap... reply _djo_ 6 hours agorootparentMIL-SPEC is a very broad category. It just means it conforms to a military specification, which can be very simple and easy to meet in some cases. But when the MIL-SEC refers to safety-critical and flight-critical specifications it's a whole other story, and does become an extremely costly and difficult to meet set of standards for good reason. Compare the cost of a MIL-SPEC ThinkPad with that of an actual flight control computer designed to be an integral part of an aircraft's avionics. reply barbequeer 5 hours agorootparentYes, but this is for soap. reply _djo_ 5 hours agorootparentSure, and there are useful points in the rest of this conversation about whether you need something that special for a soap dispenser and what might be driving up costs, and whether a commercial off the shelf alternative really was an option. I wasn't trying to cover all that, I was just pointing out that MIL-SPEC is a very wide category and therefore effectively meaningless unless you're pointing out what type of application it is. reply dyauspitr 11 hours agorootparentprevIt’s $150k for 222 dispensers, not just one. At $671 it’s overpriced but depending on what custom spec they had, maybe not by a whole lot.

Most nouns are just one or the other, not both. Like Wiktionary has \"crime\" as both but \"grift\" as count only.

For flight-critical parts, IIRC that goes as far as to documenting the specific lot of the iron ore that was used to make the metal sheets, so in the event of something cropping up where something got fucked up in the mine or the smelter, you can recall every single part that could be affected. And there's lots of testing (and associated waste) at each part of the step. Anything that goes into an airplane or spacecraft has ridiculous rules attached to it... rules that were literally written in blood.

The very second you start making an exception because \"a soap dispenser is trivial\", other stuff will get labeled as exempt (or treated as such), eventually there will be no one knowing what is exempt and what is not, and someone will treat something as exempt that clearly shouldn't have been exempt, causing an incident.

That is also the reason why even brand new airplanes rolling off the factory line still have ashtrays in lavatories despite smoking being banned for decades now. They account for some dumbass thinking they do need to smoke and better they drop the cigarette in the ashtray (because that's what people do naturally) when the fire alarm goes off, than they dump it in the trash bin, causing the cigarette to set the trash alight and causing a bigger issue. That is \"fail-safe by design\". Even if it adds 100 grams per plane to have that ashtray and a bit of work for the attendants to check if it needs to be cleaned out and for the pilots and maintenance crew a bit of work in the MEL check, it is still worth it over losing an aircraft due to a trash bin fire (and yes, that still happens, see the source for this quote!): > As with just about everything on a plane, it's about safety. \"They're there so if someone were to break the rules, they would dispose of the cigarette in the ashtray as opposed to, say, a trash bin full of flammables,\" says Robert Antolin, chief operating officer at App in the Air.

    "title": "Europe's Internet resilience mitigates impact of submarine cable cuts",
    "originLink": "https://blog.cloudflare.com/resilient-internet-connectivity-baltic-cable-cuts/",
    "originBody": "Resilient Internet connectivity in Europe mitigates impact from multiple cable cuts 2024-11-20 David Belson 6 min read When cable cuts occur, whether submarine or terrestrial, they often result in observable disruptions to Internet connectivity, knocking a network, city, or country offline. This is especially true when there is insufficient resilience or alternative paths — that is, when a cable is effectively a single point of failure. Associated observations of traffic loss resulting from these disruptions are frequently covered by Cloudflare Radar in social media and blog posts. However, two recent cable cuts that occurred in the Baltic Sea resulted in little-to-no observable impact to the affected countries, as we discuss below, in large part because of the significant redundancy and resilience of Internet infrastructure in Europe. BCS East-West Interlink Traffic volume indicators On Sunday, November 17 2024, the BCS East-West Interlink submarine cable connecting Sventoji, Lithuania and Katthammarsvik, Sweden was reportedly damaged around 10:00 local (Lithuania) time (08:00 UTC). A Data Center Dynamics article about the cable cut quotes the CTO of Telia Lietuva, the telecommunications provider that operates the cable, and notes “The Lithuanian cable carried about a third of the nation's Internet capacity, but capacity was carried via other routes.” As the Cloudflare Radar graphs below show, there was no apparent impact to traffic volumes in either country at the time that the cables were damaged. The NetFlows graphs represent the number of bytes that Cloudflare sends to users and clients in response to their requests. Internet quality Internet quality metrics for both countries show changes in measured bandwidth and latency throughout the day on Sunday, but with no sudden anomalous shifts visible around the time of the cable cut. (The loss of connectivity associated with a cable cut potentially manifests itself as an increase in latency and concurrent decrease in bandwidth due to loss of capacity.) The latency graph for Sweden does show an increase in latency, but it began before the cable cut occurred, is similar to a pattern visible several hours earlier, and is matched by an increase in measured bandwidth, so it is unlikely to be related to the cable cut event. Visibility in BGP events, announced IP address space unaffected BGP announcements are a way for network providers to communicate routing information to other networks, and announcement activity observed on Telia Lietuva’s autonomous systems around the time of the cable cut may be related to the re-routing referenced in the article. No change in announced IP address space was visible for any of these autonomous systems, suggesting no loss of connectivity as the capacity was re-routed. Telegeography’s submarinecablemap.com illustrates, at least in part, the resilience in connectivity enjoyed by these two countries. In addition to the damaged cable, it shows that Lithuania is connected to neighboring Latvia as well as to the Swedish mainland. Over 20 submarine cables land in Sweden, connecting it to multiple countries across Europe. In addition to the submarine resilience, network providers in both countries can take advantage of terrestrial fiber connections to neighboring countries, such as those illustrated in a European network map from Arelion (formerly Telia), which is only one of the large European backbone providers. C-Lion1 Traffic volume indicators Less than a day later, the C-Lion1 submarine cable, which connects Helsinki, Finland and Rostock Germany was reportedly damaged during the early morning hours of Monday, November 18. Cinia, the telecommunications company that owns the cable, said that the cable stopped working at about 02:00 UTC. In this situation as well, as the Cloudflare Radar graphs below show, there was no apparent impact to traffic volumes in either country at the time that the cables were damaged. The Finland graphs, week-on-week, show fewer bytes transferred and fewer HTTP requests, but that difference is present before the cable cut at 02:00 UTC. However, the trend of the current line does not change after the cable cut, so the two events would appear unrelated. Internet quality By looking at volume-related metrics, alone, Internet connectivity would appear to be unaffected by the cable cut. If, however, we change perspective and look at Internet quality, a brief yet interesting change is visible for Finland around the reported time of the cable damage, though it isn’t clear whether it is related in any way. Just after midnight, median measured bandwidth, previously consistent around 50 Mbps begins to grow, peaking just over 200 Mbps around 03:00 UTC. Around that same time, measured median latency also begins to drop, falling from around 30 ms to a low of 13 ms, also around 03:00 UTC. Median bandwidth returned to normal levels around 06:00 UTC, while latency took about two hours longer to return to normal levels. These observed improvements in bandwidth and latency could have been due to traffic being re-routed to along paths with better connectivity to measurement endpoints, but because the shifts began before the cable damage occurred, and recovered shortly thereafter, that is unlikely to be the root cause. In Germany, a brief minor increase in median bandwidth peaked around 02:45 UTC, while no notable changes were observed in latency. BGP business as usual From a routing perspective, there was no notable BGP announcement activity observed for top autonomous systems in either Finland or Germany around 02:00 on November 18, and total announced IP address space aggregated at a country level also demonstrated no change. Telegeography’s submarinecablemap.com shows that both Finland and Germany also have significant redundancy and resilience from a submarine cable perspective, with over 10 cables landing in Finland, and nearly 10 landing in Germany, including Atlantic Crossing-1 (AC-1), which connects to the United States over two distinct paths. Terrestrial fiber maps from Arelion and eunetworks (as just two examples) show multiple redundant fiber routes within both countries, as well as cross-border routes to other neighboring countries, enabling more resilient Internet connectivity. Conclusion As we have discussed in multiple prior blog posts (Jersey, 2016; AAE-1/SMW5, 2022; WACS/MainOne/SAT3/ACE, 2024; EASSy/Seacom, 2024), cable cuts often cause significant disruptions to Internet connectivity, in many cases because they represent a concentrated point of vulnerability, whether for an individual network provider, city/state, or country. These disruptions are often quite lengthy as well, due to the time needed to marshal repair resources, identify the location of the damage, etc. Although it is not always feasible due to financial or geographic constraints, building redundant and resilient network architecture, at multiple levels, is a best practice. This includes the sending traffic over multiple physical cables (both submarine and terrestrial), connecting to multiple peer and upstream network providers, and even avoiding single points of failure in core Internet resources like DNS servers.

If it takes months then that is quite a wide window in which an attacker could incrementally take down cables. reply TheMiddleMan 19 hours agoparentThis is a great video on undersea cables https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFt9le2ytW0 \"Sabatoge\" and repair is discussed at 11:45 reply amelius 19 hours agoparentprevThey could even blow up all cables at once. Maybe the explosives have already been placed. reply tuyiown 4 hours agorootparentWith timers ? because undersea communication is not as solved problem AFAIK reply mcfedr 12 hours agoparentprevCertainly worth blowing up some russian ships to make sure it doesn't happen again reply oniony 9 hours agorootparentHow would blowing up Russian ships stop Chinese ships doing it again? reply timbit42 1 hour agorootparentJust the ones with Russian captains. reply booi 19 hours agoparentprevGenerally it can be fixed in days. They raise it from the sea floor and splice in a new cable section. reply scheme271 16 hours agorootparentTrue but ships and crews with the equipment to do the repairs are limited. It's possible to overwhelm the repair capacities. Also, it takes time to physically travel between cuts so while cuts in the Baltic might take a week or two to fix, a cut in the Atlantic and one in the Baltic may take a week or two just for travel. reply shmerl 15 hours agorootparentIf someone will try to overwhelm the repair capacities for integral communications, they'll be dealt with like pirates - simply sunk and be done with. reply LtWorf 13 hours agorootparentAs if they know which ship did this… reply shmerl 13 hours agorootparentThey already know. The captain will probably end up in prison for a long time, and company which owns the ship will pay for the deliberate damage. Would be good too if they can crack who from the crew works for Russian saboteurs besides the captain. Unlikely it's just one person. reply mistyvales 19 hours agorootparentprevCrazy that you can splice optical cable.. reply UltraSane 18 hours agorootparentThey actually have very cool devices that will automatically align and fuse two fibers and estimate the loss of the bond. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JP_C0XLLyR0 reply ahnick 16 hours agorootparenthow much do one of those bad boys cost? reply UltraSane 15 hours agorootparentThe cheapest ones are surprisingly cheap at less than $1,000 and the highest end ones are $10,000 reply timbit42 1 hour agorootparentprevWhy is it crazy? It's been done since there has been optical cable. reply neom 19 hours agorootparentprevToday, we're going to talk to John Owens and learn about the process of splicing fiber: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zN20ZVInfU reply dgfitz 19 hours agorootparentprevI mean… they get terminated somehow, right? reply dmoy 18 hours agorootparentTrue, but splicing without leaving behind a powered repeater is different from the final termination with active electronics on the end. It's pretty cool tech reply dgfitz 17 hours agorootparentI’m saying you can terminate cleanly without needing a repeater. To be clear, I’m saying to terminate each end of the cut cable to a terminating device that continues the flow of light, not just the termination at the beginning/end of the line. Sorry if that wasn’t obvious. reply PhasmaFelis 19 hours agoparentprevIn this particular case, it seems like the attackers were trying for plausible deniability (making it look like an accident with an anchor). A comprehensive series of \"accidents\" wouldn't fit that goal. (And if they decide they don't care about plausible deniability, they could use sub-deployed timed mines to take out every cable at once.) reply alisonatwork 18 hours agorootparentEven if these \"accidents\" are a state sponsored (or at least condoned) action, it seems certain states have realized they can happen over and over again without consequences[0]. The frustrating part of this kind of petty tactic is that bullies can do just enough to annoy and inconvenience their targets, while never quite doing enough to make it worth expending the political capital to hold them to account. From the bully's perspective there's no downside. And if legitimate accidents or rogue actions get portrayed as deliberate then all the better - that just reinforces the bully's reputation as an actor to be feared while further eroding trust in the international institutions that may one day challenge it. [0] https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/news/5677668 reply tirant 2 hours agorootparentWouldn’t the ship insurance company be responsible for the costs? At some point insurers are going to increase their costs to these Chinese companies to the point that sabotage does not become viable anymore. reply lotsofpulp 3 hours agorootparentprevHence the solution of needing a bigger bully on your side. reply chgs 19 hours agorootparentprevAnd then once they are fixed take them out again reply JumpCrisscross 19 hours agorootparent> once they are fixed take them out again In an actual war, you hit the repair equipment and personnel [1]. (As to the Geneva Conventions note, we're discussing a hypothetical war with Russia. The status quo, including rules of war, are going to be rewritten by the victors.) [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_tap_strike reply chgs 9 hours agorootparentIf you are planting one cutting device (small bomb etc), you could do the same thing 10 miles down the line and blast it again without having to revisit the area. reply lxgr 18 hours agoprevShhh, or somebody will realize how much slack there is in the system (for very good reasons, as evidenced here) and \"optimize\" it away... reply jmward01 17 hours agoparentYeah, I wouldn't be surprised if Slack took up 50% of the bandwidth on those cables considering how many notifications and channels I alone get spammed with from work. reply lexlambda 19 hours agoprevCan anyone explain why there wasn't any BGP activity on the Finland-Germany systems when the cable broke, while for Lithuania there was a massive spike? Unfortunately it's been a long time since I learned about BGP, if anyone could help out here I'd be grateful. reply wmf 19 hours agoparentEach BGP hop represents an ISP so when an ISP reroutes traffic internally there's no need for changes to external BGP announcements. Clearly ISPs in the Baltic region have multiple paths and don't depend on any one cable. reply ikekkdcjkfke 2 hours agoprev [–] Exactly what the internet was built for! reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
