Tell me if you have any questions m000 8 hours agoCongrats! The design looks nice, but I'm not very fond of the website design. There isn't a single picture of Trefolo that doesn't crop-out some part of it. Also, every picture is in a \"sterile\" environment. It would be nice to have a picture of it on a real kitchen counter or coffee corner to put its dimensions into perspective, and also demonstrate how it \"fades back into the environment\". Also, IMHO, the sustainability pitch is a nice one but needs to be put down in more precise terms. It is good as it is for people who would otherwise buy a Nespresso machine, but anyone who has bought something above that level would need more convincing. Overall, a good espresso machine already scores pretty high sustainability-wise. Apart from the used of sustainable/premium materials, a key factor to that is the replacement parts and repairability. So, how does Trefolo do in terms of replacement parts and compatibility with 3rd party parts? For me, the future lack of replacement parts is especially concerning for the Turbina coffee grinder. The use of bespoke grinding burrs adds a wow factor and may be functionally superior to other types of burrs. But this is the one part in the whole setup that is guaranteed to need replacement down the road. What are the provisions for that? How much would it cost? And if you decide to stop selling it, would you e.g. be willing to commit to releasing the burr design so owners or some independent manufacturer can machine replacements? reply ed_db 6 hours agoparentExactly this! It immediately turned me off from the product when I realised there isn’t a single practical image of it. It’s impossible to visualise how it would actually look on the counter. reply crazygringo 4 hours agorootparentAgreed. And please -- show a video of it working, start to finish! This is clearly a product designed to be a sensory experience, so let me see and hear this on a kitchen counter pulling a shot or two. reply not_your_mentat 3 hours agorootparentThe video of the device in operation with the entire device in frame please. You could still even switch between sexy angles. reply alexwebb2 36 minutes agorootparentprevYep, I looked for a couple minutes and concluded “must be ugly since they clearly don’t want to show it to me”. reply amluto 3 hours agoparentprevI would also like to see a user’s manual and a diagram of how it’s plumbed. Where does the hot water come from? Does the user supply their own kettle? Where does excess water go when pressure is released? How does the preheating cycle work? reply smeeeeeeeeeeeee 1 hour agorootparentHey there! Yep, you bring the hot water, the machine does everything else! There is a pressure seal directly in the group head that holds the water in at the end of a shot. You can preheat just by pumping water into a cup for a couple seconds, which is around the same as a purge cycle on a traditional espresso machine. The fluid path is kept as small and as insulated as possible to avoid thermal losses or unnecessary water being held in the machine. I added a pre-release version of the manual to the warranty page! Please excuse any minor errors. https://velofuso.com/warranty I definitely agree that there needs to be a simple clean 30 second video of the full workflow with every part visible - I will work on that ASAP. reply amluto 4 minutes agorootparent> There is a pressure seal directly in the group head that holds the water in at the end of a shot. Like a check valve? Does that mean that some (clean) water is trapped between the pump's output and the seal at the end of the shot? If so, this doesn't seem so terrible. One thing I've often found odd about espresso machines is that they all seem to have some mechanism to depressurize the basket when a shot ends, and that this mechanism lets water that may have been in contact with the grounds go through some portion of the machine. What's the point? The pressure will naturally dissipate quite quickly through the grounds unless like kind of pressure-retaining basket is in use. reply 0xffff2 1 hour agorootparentprevSorry I can't look at your product page from work, but am I getting the correct impression that this machine doesn't have a boiler? If so, my (meant in good fun) suggestion is that you have in fact designed half an espresso machine :) reply smeeeeeeeeeeeee 1 hour agorootparentHahahaha, that is fair, but I like to think it is the important half =] We figured out how to heat water thousands of years ago. Flow control is considerably newer reply greenthrow 7 minutes agorootparentYeah but having the water hit the grounds at the right temperature is what separates a great machine from an average machine. Yours doesn't do that. Congratz on everything you've done so far but I am your target customer and won't consider a machine that doesn't also manage the water temperature. reply manarth 1 hour agorootparentprev> you bring the hot water What type of hot water supply is needed? E.g. - Hot water poured in from a kettle? - Hot water plumbed in from a domestic hot-water supply? - Hot water plumbed in from a boiling water tap (such as Quooker?) reply roflyear 35 minutes agorootparentReading the manual, it seems like a hose is placed into a kettle, and the pump is in the machine. reply 6510 10 minutes agorootparentprevmy preference would be pictures of all angles and a single shot video start to finish. stop hiding, be proud. I've just looked at low end robot vacuum cleaners. It was hilarious, non of them are willing to show the product in action. reply smeeeeeeeeeeeee 1 hour agoparentprevThank you so much! I appreciate the advice about the potentially over stylized product pages. If you go to the store here, you can see many full profile views of the products: https://velofuso.com/store You raise a ton of good points. - It's going to ship with a full spare parts catalogue available - Full prusa-esque upgrade paths will be made available for existing customers - Every single part on either product can be changed off with the removal of 1-5 screws. - The switches, cords, buttons, and (gear)motors are all standard sizes. - and I absolutely commit to open sourcing everything if a day came where the project could not continue (I have done this for previous projects, it isn't an empty promise) You make a good point about the burrs being a non-standard size. The thing to remember is every size of burr was once a non standard size. One of the most important parts of being a good engineer is only making something new when you can truly add value, and I think the burrs are valuable enough to have them be probably the only non-standard wear item in either machine. reply sixo 1 hour agorootparentRe website, The photography is also noticeably low-resolution, which stands out immediately reply skrebbel 50 minutes agorootparentprevJust to chip in with the drive-by website feedback, I just realized that (I love everything about this and) I have no idea how big either the espresso machine or the grinder is. I think I'd really need some realistic (ish) kitchen photos with it in action to really appreciate what I'd be ordering. reply neogodless 4 hours agoparentprevI'd also like to add that everything I click seems to open a new tab/window. Can't I just view the coffee devices and store all in a single tab? Details? New window. Shop? New window! Back to the details? New window. Contact? New window!! I don't like having all these extra tabs to close without a good reason for it. reply f1shy 8 hours agoparentprevExcellent comment. I beg the OP to address the topics, specially spare parts, so I can buy it. reply hsshhshshjk 7 hours agorootparentI was also looking for a full, non edited, non animated, non faded picture of the machine. reply turnsout 6 hours agorootparentHe has \"full body\" shots in the actual store, but I agree—it would be great to see a clearer shot, maybe lower in the flow. reply krisoft 5 hours agorootparent> He has \"full body\" shots in the actual store Is this the image you are thinking about? https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/642b16caa70131... Because the problem is that it is not the \"full body\" of the coffee maker. Those pipes go somewhere. At least in the sense of how people usually think of an espresso machine the machine also contains the pump and the boiler. This apparently doesn't have those parts? Or if it has they are not good looking and minimalist enough to show. We are discussing the photos as if those are the problem, but I think the issue people are having is with the product design. If I make a picture of a laptop on a charger people don't ask where do the cable go, because they know it goes into a charger connected to the wall. But with this people have to imagine a standalone boiler/pump setup just waiting to be connected into this coffee extractor thingy which is not a thing most people have (or expect to one day have ) in their kitchen. reply taway789aaa6 3 hours agorootparentSurely that image is a computer rendering and not an actual photo though! I want to see an _actual_ photo. Like on a counter. How big is it? Wires? Power brick? Cool concept, but hard to make a decision with so little information. reply krisoft 2 hours agorootparent> Cool concept, but hard to make a decision with so little information. It sounds like it is not hard to make the decision. I made my decision and it is a no. This is a cool thing for people who want to try the latest concepts but don't worry about it being an already polished and integrated whole product. It is how some people kit build their Rutan Long-EZ to fly with, and some people just buy tickets from an airline. They are both flying but they are not the same class of thing. This is more towards the kit built airplane end of the scale for me than what I would be comfortable with. reply boneitis 1 hour agorootparent> It sounds like it is not hard to make the decision. I made my decision and it is a no. This is a cool thing for people who want to try the latest concepts but don't worry about it being an already polished and integrated whole product. I got to push back on this and align with the dozens of other comments being critical of the website. If I had the physical and budgetary space for it, I'd already be salivating at this point and wanting to hear more, polished or not. But, the website is utterly lacking in conveyance of practical use and just dressed up in marketing design. While there is a disclaimer that the (device) design may undergo further revision, it's orthogonal to the fact that this completely kills any chance of an immediate, impulse buy (again, if I had the space). I would at this point be asking other buyers to post videos of it in use long after units have already been sold into the wild. I do take my coffee somewhat seriously, with the consumption of fresh microroasted beans and a few prized pieces of brew equipment. reply boneitis 59 minutes agorootparentWant to try turning my comment more constructive (though my frustations with what passes for customer service/relations these days will bleed through) I see that the OP has already stated they will upload some videos. That would be great; many angles, both in use and not in use, both overview and zoomed in on components. I am not most people, but I would prefer the kind of videos without excessive (though not to say \"devoid of\") pre-/post-processing, editing, green-screening, video cuts every three seconds, and all that shebang. Even your teenaged child or friend/significant other conscripted for twenty minutes to hold the phone with a steady hand while you show things off, minimally rehearsed and to-the-point... would be _fantastic_. Don't even need to publish it on the official website if you deem it too tacky; but it will be infinitely more valuable to have on the ready than no demonstration at all if people are reaching out to you through channels like HN or even any address listed on the website. IMO. reply smeeeeeeeeeeeee 1 hour agorootparentprevThere are actually no renderings on the website except for that one cross-section of the grinder, the internals are rendered there. But absolutely, going to add more \"banana for scale\" photos asap reply yojo 3 hours agorootparentprevReading between the lines, I’m pretty sure the pump is integrated in the housing (that’s their custom “bespoke, brushless gear pump”), and the boiler is your electric kettle. So I think you could just drop the end of the tube into your kettle and call it a day. The kind of coffee enthusiast who is going to preorder a $650 unreviewed coffee machine probably has at least one temp holding kettle they use for pour over. But fully agreed this needs some clarity on the website. reply krisoft 2 hours agorootparentOH! I think you might be right. Oh! That explains it. Thank you. Thinking about it now, of course. What else would the power lead be for? It doesn't heat the water. The pump being in that part can be the only other explanation. > The kind of coffee enthusiast who is going to preorder a $650 unreviewed coffee machine probably has at least one temp holding kettle they use for pour over. Yeah. I think that's the key here. This is for an enthusiast who wants the latest coolest tech, and is willing to accept some amount of discomfort for it. reply XCSme 4 hours agoparentprevThis was my first impression too. On a large, 4k display, I could barely read anything, all I saw was a really zoomed-in photo of some device. reply havefunbesafe 3 hours agoparentprevThis is very good news, as designing a physical product like this is 20x more difficult than designing a website! reply cryptozeus 1 hour agoparentprevMy bad ! Should not have said my comment about the website earlier. Apologies to op, i am human, this is how communication should be. reply ajb 5 hours agoparentprevIt's interesting that he's made this visual mistake even as a person whose main concern is the product. So many photographers/videographers make the same mistake, and I guess he's copied them rather than thinking through what his market needs. The error is basically to film the product as if it was a sexy woman. I'll put it bluntly: I don't want to fuck your product. I might want to buy it but only if you show me the practical details. (Speaking generally - I'm not in the market for a coffee machine). Videos that solely try to convey allure and mistique are a net negative for the vast majority of products. reply hardwaregeek 1 hour agoparentprevYeah, I couldn't tell if the photos were real or were rendered images reply smeeeeeeeeeeeee 59 minutes agorootparentThey are all real! But I definitely need to have more photos in actual environments. reply eps 11 hours agoprevIt's a good presentation, but it's not sufficient as a sales pitch. A non-staged video of both the grinder and the machine in use would be required to place an order, at least for me. As others have mentioned it's not clear where the water pipes go exactly and how the machine is powered. Also, for $700 independent reviews are also a must. For the pump kit - this too looks interesting, but requires (way) more details. At the very least a list of supported machines and, again, a video or two of an actual retrofit. Dimensions, voltage (!), etc. reply ivanvanderbyl 10 hours agoparentGet this in the hands of James Hoffman, I’d love to hear his take on it reply simonjgreen 9 hours agorootparentIt’s fascinating how he has become to coffee as MKBHD has to technology. The kingmaker of coffee gear. reply tschwimmer 8 hours agorootparentUnlike MKBHD, James Hoffman has some slightly more objective credibility. He won some barista competitions about 15 years ago. He's been involved in the coffee industry (outside of being a content creator) for most of his life. As far as I know about Marques, his main qualification is that he was just relatively early to the tech review game. That is not to say that I personally take all or most of Hoffman's suggestions at face value. It's abundantly clear that the level of nuance he considers in coffee is not relevant to me. But I do tend to see him applying a much more objective level of rigor to his reviews than many other content creators. reply MrSkelter 3 hours agorootparentVery few tech reviewers have anything other than experience. Nilay Patel trained as a lawyer. He can’t code, can’t engineer, isn’t an industrial designer etc. it’s one reason why tech reviews are so obsessed with keyboards. For most reviewers keyboard feel is one of the few areas they have real expertise in. MKBHD is absolutely as qualified as 99% of his peers. reply ZephyrBlu 7 hours agorootparentprevThe draw of MKBHD has nothing to do with \"objective credibility\". Consumer tech reviews are more about whether the reviewer will discuss daily usability objectively, and entertainment. Coffee is more niche. It makes more sense for \"objective credibility\" to play a role there. reply VeejayRampay 8 hours agorootparentprevhe's also fair, often trashes big brands when their products are mediocre I have great respect for his integrity and body of work reply krowek 8 hours agorootparentHe's also deleted some of his videos because they had mentions to brands or companies with wrong practices (yes, plain wrong). Also has very good books. So, totally not the average youtuber/content creator out there. reply dogboat 7 hours agorootparentprevWhen he trashed the aldi espresso machine I think he was unfair. The main issues with it are probably the same issues you get on a Breville until you tune the OPV and get a seperate grinder. That said I dont think he is the screwdriver to espresso machine type. reply hunter2_ 1 hour agorootparentI've got a Bambino Plus and so far the only customizations are a bottomless portafilter, a huge single wall basket (IMS), programming the flow presets for a good ratio by weight in/out, and optimizing the grind specifically for 30s duration. I'll have to look into your OPV suggestion; anything else? reply marcellus23 2 hours agorootparentprev> That said I dont think he is the screwdriver to espresso machine type. He's mentioned modding espresso machines many times in his videos, and brings it up often during reviews. reply diob 2 hours agorootparentprevYeah, I wouldn't compare them at all. Hoffman is also by all appearances and mannerisms a standup individual, more of a Mr. Rogers of coffee than anything else, in my opinion. reply hunter2_ 1 hour agorootparentMr. Rogers is a great comparison. Something about the sweaters and always wishing viewers a good day! reply scarfaceneo 9 hours agorootparentprevMKBHD is the last person I’d go to for anything tech related. He, like many others, do little more than just read spec sheets. I like his car related content though, reckless driving notwithstanding reply f1shy 8 hours agorootparentIs there a BOLTR for general tech? For Instruments there is evvlog… but general tech? reply bubblethink 8 hours agorootparentI have found Mr. Mobile (Michael Fisher) to be quite good. He does some sort of a road trip or excursion as a real world tech review and also covers a lot of old and quirky hardware. reply TheSpiceIsLife 7 hours agorootparentprevAlec Watson of Technology Connections is my favourite for technology in general. reply MostlyStable 3 hours agorootparentYou know, I've watched basically every video of his for several years now (as well as going back in the archives for some of his older stuff), and I think this is the first time I've ever encountered his name. reply kisonecat 7 hours agorootparentprevHe has made me extremely enthusiastic for heat pumps. reply VTimofeenko 2 hours agorootparentMe too, though it turns out certain types of houses don't support just replacing furnace with a central heat pump. No free lunch in thermodynamics :( reply oigursh 7 hours agorootparentprev+1 for MrMobile (Michael Fisher), he comes across as more impartial than a lot of the other folks. reply presentation 9 hours agorootparentprevI find his channel useful just for getting an opinion from a end-user perspective of what a product is like; that's a legitimate opinion, not every data point needs to be a deep dive into the manufacturing process of a particular gadget. reply deanc 8 hours agorootparentprevRegarding grinders there's actually someone else who is considered the kingmaker: Lance Hedrick [1] [1] https://www.youtube.com/@LanceHedrick/videos reply petepete 9 hours agorootparentprevThankfully it's quite difficult to grind and brew coffee dangerously. reply tpm 9 hours agorootparentNot really, moka pots are known to explode. reply GTP 3 hours agorootparentSource? I'm from Italy, where everybody's using them, but never heard of a single one exploding. Maybe you can find an isolated case, but I'm confident it's extremely rare. There's a safety valve to release pressure after all, and if you use the Moka correctly the valve never has to engage. reply tpm 32 minutes agorootparentWell my wife had one and it exploded (and it was Italian, Bialetti I think), we have several friends with explosions etc. It's of course possible that Italians use it properly and we don't, but I'm not an expert in this topic, so I just stay away from them. reply K0balt 2 hours agorootparentprevI’m in the Dominican Republic, and moka pots are 99 percent of the market here as well. Everyone warns me about moka pots exploding, but I’ve never met anyone (15 years here now) that knows of one first hand that actually exploded. But everyone is terrified of mokasplosion. I’ll admit, the prospect of a pressurized vessel of boiling water is a potent reminder for precautionary thinking. reply basedrum 6 hours agorootparentprevWho is mkbhd? reply criddell 6 hours agorootparentProduct reviewer with a very popular YouTube channel. reply xyst 4 hours agorootparentprevmkbhd over the years has had some really bad takes on tech. I haven’t used his channel for quite awhile. I would say his success is largely due to being among the first to the market in tech reviews and having (at the time) better production quality. reply peterlada 6 hours agorootparentprevSt James, the protector saint of all things covfefe. reply rocqua 7 hours agorootparentprevHe wouldn't take it. He'll review it after it's been on the market for about half a year, without any money. Lance hedrick is also a decently respected voice who does usually take sponsored reviews, whilst being honest. reply jedimastert 3 hours agorootparentI think Lance Hedrick would like this a lot. I bet he would experiment with changing the pressure during the brewing process reply xyst 4 hours agorootparentprevI agree here. Given the bespoke design, I would love to see a comparison with other machines. reply N-Krause 10 hours agoparentprevIt seems to go where ever you like it to go. > The result is a freedom to use a far more thermally stable source of hot water - like the kettle you already have. And because no water is stored in the machine - it’s fresh every time. Seems like a interesting idea, but I feel like there is a crucial point missing. What if I do not want a random water tube hanging into my water kettle? Feels like that is a big hole in a otherwise great thought through product. reply paulluuk 10 hours agorootparentAlso, having to boil water in a water kettle first is a minor, but significant enough, inconvenience. It's why so many people now have hot water taps for tea, and use espresso machines instead of filter coffee. reply ndsipa_pomu 9 hours agorootparentHere in the UK, I only know one person who has a boiling water tap (they've been renovating an old cottage and are a fan of tech) though I wasn't a fan went I went to visit and tried it out (not why I went to visit). I'm more of a fan of the Unix/Linux philosophy of \"do one job and do it well\" as appliances are more likely to break when they have multiple jobs to do, so I was slightly against the idea of it anyhow. The main criticism I have of it is that it's far more likely to cause scalds/burns as you have to bring the container to the tap (specifically an Aeropress) and it's more difficult to control the flow of water. With a kettle, you can move the kettle to the container and it's far more controllable in terms of water flow. I'm also not a fan of the tap needing to keep pre-heated water in an insulated container all the time - only a small use of energy, but it seems unnecessary to me. reply michaelt 2 hours agorootparentAs far as I can tell, the target market for steaming hot water taps is office kitchens. When a kitchen serves 100+ people things like limescale will inevitably be a problem. If the steaming hot water tap is plumbed in, with replaceable water filters and a regular service contract - that's an advantage, not a disadvantage. Steaming hot water taps can supply lots of hot water fast, so even if a load of people are making drinks at the same time in between meetings, they can keep up. There's also a safety argument that if you've got a kettle and a mug, that's two things of boiling water you could drop, and eliminating one of the two makes things safer. And because the steaming hot water tap is directly above a drain, the impact of a spill is much reduced. And a lot of these taps make water that is steaming but somewhat below boiling, which might be safer or something? Not sure why you'd want one for home though. reply frereubu 8 hours agorootparentprevI'd be interested in an overall energy use comparison between a kettle and a hot water tap. I know lots of people who boil far too much water for a single cup of tea or coffee (partially due to kettle designs). reply alias_neo 7 hours agorootparentI don't have a comparison to a kettle because I don't have one, but our Quooker tap took a fraction of a kWh over a couple of months that I measured the energy usage, and my wife uses it daily for tea and we use it most days for boiling water for things like cooking. The 3L tank that holds the hot water, under the sink is well insulated and it takes almost nothing to keep it at temperature. Given that it uses such negligible energy that I needn't care, the benefits of instant boiling water whenever we like and not having an extra appliance no the counter-top make it a clear winner for us. reply frereubu 6 hours agorootparentInteresting, thanks. I really like the idea but the thing I'd miss from our kettle is the ability to change to lower temperatures for different kinds of tea. You shouldn't really use boiling water for some kinds of green tea, for example. I guess you can mix in some cold water to reach close to the right temperature, but I'd miss the convenience. reply ndsipa_pomu 3 hours agorootparentWhen I was trying out my friends' boiling water tap, I had to much around with putting in some cold water into the Aeropress first, before then adding the boiling water. If I had to use one for longer than a weekend, I'd probably use a small jug for mixing the water to the right temperature first. reply alias_neo 6 hours agorootparentprevI've never come across a kettle that changes temperature, or is it that you can stop it boiling when you feel it's about right? My wife drinks tea (I'm a coffee drinker) and I make tea (just simple, English Breakfast with milk) for her quite often, and we both use it for cooking. It was something she'd always wanted, and she's not much into \"gadgets\" but she's been very happy with this, so I'm happy. reply ndsipa_pomu 6 hours agorootparent> I've never come across a kettle that changes temperature, or is it that you can stop it boiling when you feel it's about right? There's several around - I've got one that allows you to choose between 70°C, 80°C, 90°C and boiling (along with a keep-warm option that's never used). I use the 80°C option all the time for making coffee (Aeropress) and use the 70°C for things like green tea (black tea should be 100°C of course). It's a mistake to use boiling water when making coffee - it'll extract a bitter flavour. reply alias_neo 6 hours agorootparent> I've got one that allows you to choose between 70°C, 80°C, 90°C That's really cool, I suppose I haven't really looked, being a coffee drinker, a kettle was never important to me. > It's a mistake to use boiling water when making coffee - it'll extract a bitter flavour.

I never understood why so many kettles always put the fill indicator behind the handle, which of course you'd be holding when filling it up.

I've used it for making Chinese tea for years. reply inferiorhuman 5 hours agorootparentprevI've got the OXO adjustable temp one. It lets you select a temperature between 40 and 100 °C in one degree increments. I wish it were a bit smaller and could heat to a lower temp (for e.g. proofing yeast), but otherwise it's pretty nice. As it's an American market product it's limited to 1500W, which is still pretty quick but nowhere near the speed of something designed for 240V mains. The biggest problem I've had so far was that Amazon seems to only stock used/counterfeit units.

Buying direct from OXO got me on that hadn't been used and didn't reek of volatile organic compounds on the first try. This is slighly terrifying; and interesting that something like this would be counterfeited. I too would make any and all efforts to ensure I was using something legit where mains (240V for me) are concerned. I once bought a knock-off hot-air soldering station without knowing, and once I looked into it, people were complaining they'd received units where the live was \"grounded\" to the case. I opened mine to check, not quite as bad, but the live in mine wasn't attached to the metal case, just bare, and within about 1cm of it. I reported it to the retailer (we all know which major online retailer this was), and they did nothing. Let's just say things changed, seriously, for me that day when it comes to buying anything mains powered with uncertain origins. reply inferiorhuman 3 hours agorootparentThis may have been the tipping point for me. I got two from Amazon. One was obviously used and had lots of hard water deposits. The other had a very strong VOC odor to it. Around this time I'd started looking more closely at items purchased from Amazon and they'd often appear to be lower quality (if not blatantly counterfeit). Even if I didn't despise Bezos this would've put me off Amazon. ThermoWorks refused to sell their products on Amazon for quite a while. Apparently they've changed their stance but I wouldn't risk it. Anyways the kettle is nice to have that I use daily for coffee even though I now have an induction stove with burners that are far more powerful than the kettle. Stateside, circuits for electric ranges are 240V, 50A (occasionally 40A on older buildings). reply TheSpiceIsLife 7 hours agorootparentprevnext [–]This problem is solved in its entirety by simply microwaving a cup of water. No wasted water. If the same / similar cup is used, one can choose the desired temperature of the resultant hot water simply by varying the time. Seasonal variation of ambient water temperature may need to be taken into account. I tend not to drink coffee, and I prefer to make tea with less-than-boiling water. YMMVso many people now have hot water taps for tea I know they exist but I've only ever seen one house with such a tap and that was a very well off family member. I don't think these are terribly common. reply noduerme 8 hours agorootparentThey're not so wildly expensive. a couple hundred bucks maybe. My mom got one years ago, and it's really convenient for quick pour-over coffee. Great if you're in a hurry. I use a moka pot at home, but the 10 minutes it takes to boil while I putter around the kitchen trying to remember my name are really the most worthless of the day. reply GTP 3 hours agorootparentMinor nitpick here, but it's a fact I found interesting when I heard about it. The water inside a Moka doesn't boil, you can indeed observe that the water coming out from the top isn't boiling. What happens is that the air that is left inside the bottom chamber expands due to the heat, pushing the water upwards. reply alias_neo 7 hours agorootparentprevWe have a Quooker and I recommend them to all our friends who ask, it's more expensive than others (starting at around £1200) but it's incredibly well built, designed/created in an era of making things to last, and they seems to stand by that; you can get spare parts and they sell a service kit for £25 (last I bought it) with the filter that you can replace every few years if you want, but you can also buy the individual parts of system like a new tank, just the core/element, etc. reply leoedin 43 minutes agorootparentMy experience of boiling water taps in offices is that they're not actually hot enough for decent tea.

It would need to bring it to my chair for that price. reply OJFord 1 hour agorootparentI wanted one but also baulked at the price, got a ~£200 drop ship special instead. I might actually prefer it to the Quooker tbh - it doesn't spit. (The spitting is apparently a safety feature, but guess which one I've burnt myself on...) reply dsego 7 hours agorootparentprevSeems like good way to get third degree burns if you're not careful? I just put my water filled mug in the microwave (with a spoon in to avoid superheating). reply alias_neo 6 hours agorootparentI've put my hand under the boiling tap once, it hurt a bit but I wasn't burned. Someone told me it has some sort of atomiser mechanism in the tap when the water is ejected to reduce the chance of burns, but I haven't looked into it and I'm not sure how true that is. It's a quite deliberate and slightly difficult action to activate the boiling water, there's a ring around the base of the spout that you have to double-press and twist on the second press, completely independent of the normal cold/hot water. I have two young children and honestly, I'm not concerned either for them, my wife, nor myself that there's any risk. Using the microwave is a perfectly good solution I think, but I don't know many people who do that, and although it's fine for tea etc for one person, it won't do a house-full of cups of tea in seconds, nor fill a pan with boiling water. I wouldn't dare to suggest that it's the best thing for everyone, but we are extremely happy with its utility in our home. EDIT: Typos reply BrandoElFollito 5 hours agorootparentprev> so many people now have hot water taps for tea I have never seen that anywhere at houses I visited in France, Germany, Italy, Poland, a few US. I am not saying that this is not a thing, it is just that \"so many\" depends on the demographics. reply tashoecraft 3 hours agorootparentprevI disagree. There's a very large espresso market for those who want a cheaper device that doesn't have the complications of a boiler. I have a flair espresso machine myself. Adding a boiler I'd guess would double the price, so I think it's a good decision to leave off. reply brynx97 9 hours agorootparentprevI wouldn't consider it an inconvenience in my kitchen. I'm highly interested in this. However, $700 is a lot. So, like others mentioned, I'd first like to see a demo video at the very least of it in action. Different teas require different and specific temperatures for optimal results. A hot water tap cannot do this.

The cheapest ones are about 10x the cheapest kettles. Can't imagine wanting to go back to a kettle personally. reply globular-toast 9 hours agorootparentprevYeah, you would have to really like espresso for this to be worth it. Personally I don't like espresso. The only thing it's good for is the milk drinks, which I also don't particularly like, and being a lazy \"push button\" coffee. If I'm going to put effort in, filter is the way to go (I use a V60). I reckon hipsters will be drinking filter in a few years' time, if they aren't already. As for hot water taps for tea, if you are brewing black/red tea that is usually not good enough as they don't produce truly boiling water, although some do claim to. reply pm3003 9 hours agorootparentCold Brew is glorified filter coffee, especially when made with ultrasonics. It can even simulate the feeling you get when you go back to work while waiting for your coffee to be at drinkable temperature only to find it cold an hour later. reply globular-toast 9 hours agorootparentCold brew coffee and cold filter coffee are two different things. Brewing at a cold temperature for a long period of time results in a very different taste which some people like and some don't. Note that the brewing temperature and drinking temperature are essentially independent; you can heat up cold brew and you can cool down hot brew. reply grues-dinner 10 hours agorootparentprevIs it still thermally stable after a low-speed journey through a long (? Hard to say how long it is, or if you just plonk it into an open kettle of water as there are only close ups) narrow plastic tube? And what about cold water already in the tube? If thermal stability is important enough to make such an advertising claim, you should probably show a comparison of input temperatures where the water meets the coffee over the course of multiple cycles against a representative competitor. With actual data rather than stylised cartoon graphs like in TV adverts for washing powder or whatever. Woolly claims like that without clear evidence really make sound like audiophile woo territory, which would be a shame if you've actually done the research! reply spressoe 9 hours agorootparentThermal stability is arguably one of the most important aspects of espresso machine. If the water in the espresso machine boiler is sitting at 95°C, by the time this hot water reaches the group head it will lose some of the temperature. Lose 2°C and you're good. Lose 5°C and you still might be good but already at the edge of getting the crap out of the machine. Lose more than that and you're not gonna want to drink it. Traditional E61 espresso machines whose water boiler is at ΔT cm's away from the group head, solve the problem of temperature surf with heavy duty pipes, boilers, isolation and materials to keep the temperature loss at the minimum. More modern espresso machines place the water boiler just above the group head so they're basically solving the problem other way around: keeping the ΔT at minimum so giving no or minimum space for temperature loss. As for this design, I am not sure how does it solve this problem. reply enjo 9 hours agorootparentprevIn addition I would need to some justification for the idea that water stored in a clean tank without access to light is somehow worse than fresh out of a filter. reply prmoustache 6 hours agoparentprev> Also, for $700 independent reviews are also a must.

Anything from Flair or the other lever machine companies is far less than that. Without actually fully heating the coffee for your and having a tank, etc, I don’t see a huge advantage here over those types of machines. reply tashoecraft 3 hours agorootparentThe flair 58 is 600+. So it's slightly more, but from a new manufacturer and has a unique design. I expected it to be at least a $1000, so I think it's definitely price competitive. Though I'd hold off until reviews come in. reply Kirby64 2 hours agorootparentSo, the Flair 58 is their 'highest end' model and sports a 58mm portafilter... this thing is a 51mm portafilter which is basically only used on smaller portable machines. Also, it's listed on their website for $580. Not sure how you get to 600+ (unless you include tax, I guess). A more comparable model from Flair would be either the Pro 3 ($325, all metal in the grouphead, pressure gauge, shot mirror... lots of included accessories) or the cheaper models they offer (Classic w/ pressure gauge, $230, Neo Flex, $99). If you wanted to compare to the Cafelat Robot, that is also only $450... and is all metal, built like a tank, and has a very charming aesthetic. reply smeeeeeeeeeeeee 1 hour agorootparentI love all these machines that we're comparing to but they're fundamentally different things - they don't have a pump to fit into their BOM. So maybe: In the category of \"machines that don't froth milk\", it might be the most expensive by $50. In the category of \"machines that have pressure control\", it might be the cheapest by $700 In the category of \"machines that have a rotary pump\", it might be the cheapest by $2000. It's sort of the curse of making something that doesn't clearly fit into a specific category. 51mm portafilters are better and some day the world will come to understand https://youtu.be/jTAkb-dCFro?si=QQ6K9l99xqOCQl5S reply Kirby64 1 hour agorootparentNo offense, but we're not really comparing different things. You're offering an espresso machine that fundamentally has: * No heating control * No tank/water storage * No milk frothing capability The obvious comparison is a manual (lever) espresso machine that does not offer its own heating capability. It offers pressure control (via your arm) just fine. Also, besides noise complaints and possibly some questionable reasoning involving vibe pump longevity, I have yet to see a compelling reason a rotary pump is better. They're 'nicer' and offered in higher end stuff, but performance wise a very good vibe pump seems just fine. Flow rates are more than adequate for pretty much any normal brewing method. Regarding 51mm vs 58mm: you might be correct technically, but the ecosystem around accessories is firmly in the 58mm camp. As far as I can tell, the difference is so marginal it doesn't really matter anyways. Puck prep and other things will matter more for the average user. reply roflyear 1 hour agorootparentprevThe Met doesn't do milk and it is way more expensive, and similar to what you are doing, I think. reply Kirby64 1 hour agorootparentThe Meticulous is a lower end competition with the Decent Espresso DE1, or a more upscale version of the DIY stuff like Gaggiuino. Given the author has given us essentially nothing regarding what is actually controllable (besides pressure control?), it's unclear to me what you even can do with it. A simple pressure control is pretty basic and not at all comparable to the Meticulous or a DE1. reply roflyear 1 hour agorootparentOP's machine features are: - Group preheat (so it has some kind of heater) - \"Fully adjustable power\" - ??? It does seem that the water tube either goes to a kettle and the pump is in the machine, or it goes to a pump, that you then need to attach to a machine, and that clear line is pressurized. It does potentially have one feature the met doesn't (hinted at by allowing for filter brews): it'll be able to use up the entire water source, not a small amount of water you pour into the machine (similar to the Decent). Edit: based on the manual just added, it seems like the pump is in the machine. reply prmoustache 5 hours agorootparentprevNot if you have used the same bialetti moka pot for decades, only replacing the rubber seal once every year. reply esperent 4 hours agorootparentA moka pot isn't an espresso machine.

Your website is very poorly designed and does not match the craftsmanship of the machine itself. The animated fonts, constant videos, lack of white space—it all adds up to something that feels like a quick design job by a mid-level design student. Any paid template from any of the big website building companies would be better than what you have at the moment. Also, photography-wise, as a lot of other people have suggested here, take a few steps back. Just show the whole product on a worktop, without videos. You're not Apple; it’s not iconic yet. A close-up won’t suffice. We need to see the whole thing static, not in a close-up video all the time. (The reason you’ve done this is that you’re very familiar with the design. Visitors are not—you’ve forgotten what it’s like to see it for the first time.) I hope this comes across in the way it’s intended.

I hope this provides some context: what I mean is \"poorly designed\" in the context of the product, which is in the second half of the sentence you omitted. There’s a mismatch between the product quality and the website quality. You’re right—it’s a 5 or 6 out of 10 website. Not a bad score at all, certainly not poor. I would enjoy and not comment on most other content using this design style. However, a 10/10 product (let’s assume it is) should not have a website that looks like this. It damages the brand.

And reading through the comments, that's true for many people. Is it pretty? Yes. But a pretty thing that harms your purpose is worse designed than an ugly thing that serves it. reply detectivestory 9 hours agoparentprevI don't think its really fair to call this site \"poorly designed\". reply krisoft 8 hours agoparentprev> The reason you’ve done this is that you’re very familiar with the design. Visitors are not—you’ve forgotten what it’s like to see it for the first time. Maybe part of the problem. I suspect that is not the whole reason. I think they are not happy (consciously or unconsciously) with the appearance of the pump and/or don't consider it part of the product. And that is why they are excluding it from the images. Sometimes literally photoshopping it out. reply smeeeeeeeeeeeee 4 hours agorootparentHey, you can actually see the pump here, in the kit you can use to put it in other kinds of espresso machines - it's inside the machine. I'll find a way to incorporate it into the product page for the espresso machine as well. https://velofuso.com/store/p/gear-pump-upgrade-kit reply huhtenberg 54 minutes agorootparentI think you might have easier time selling the pump kit than the machine and the grinder. For one, I am almost sold on trying the kit, but the description is missing necessary details - what's in the box, ideally with a photo, and which machines it can be used with (and which it cannot be). Also, related - set up a mailing list and add a subscription link at the bottom of every page.

It must be a monumental task to design and manufacture a mechanical machine. However, the website is kind of confusing regarding the operation of the machine. You say that the machine accepts hot water directly, so no boiler or thermoblock, which results in a simpler machine. But where does the water come from? I see 2 pipes leading to/from the machine in the videos, so I’m guessing the water feeds from one and drains from the other? So you need to preheat water in a container? Won’t the water cool rapidly while traveling in the pipe? reply rustman123 6 hours agoparentI have the same impression. I guess the machine is completely passive regarding temperature and requires a) a preheated water source and b) a hot-water flush before each use to heat the machine and push hot water into the hoses That means it’s a pump attached to a grouphead. reply omega3 9 hours agoprevIf I was in a market for minimalistic espresso machine I'd just get a manual espresso machine, something like the cafelat robot [1].

There is no plastic in the fluid/material path of either machine - it's virtually all stainless steel and silicone.

The pump is just a plastic tube, a sping, a valve and a huge coil around it that vibrates on mains 50/60Hz. Essentially a soap dispenser combined with a doorbell reply smeeeeeeeeeeeee 1 hour agoparentIt was this exact question that lead me down the rabbit hole to making espresso machines. The main reason everyone uses them is because they're $25, small, and can leverage the oscillation of mains voltage for their operation. The next best thing is probably $300 and quite large and heavy - and those professional gear pumps fundamentally don't scale down well. Ours operates under the same principle though with a completely different sort of motor that hasn't been common until pretty recently. reply jb1991 10 hours agoparentprevIt’s not all machines.

I used fusion to design and printed ergonomic/partial prototypes on Prusa 3d printers. Then, I fortunately had a ton of manufacturing contacts because I have worked as somewhat of a production engineer before. Some parts were definitely difficult, especially the outer burr of the grinder (there were a couple viable ways to make it, but it is sometimes difficult to find a shop that is price competitive in say wire EDM machining and 5 axis CNC, or CNC and casting, so you have to get shops to coordinate with eachother) or the wood arch (because high volume wood shops are not nearly as technologically sophisticated as metalworking shops) PCBway is a good option now, especially for 3D printed metal parts. They have CNC as well but they tend to struggle with anything that has complicated geometry or features. But 3D printing doesn't require approval, and for one offs is often cheaper. reply diob 1 hour agoprevI would really recommend having a reviewer take a look, or at least include grind analysis yourselves. Love the idea of a new type of burr beyond flat and conical, but would like to see someone actually use it and scientifically compare the profiles.

There is a bit of black magic that goes into making great espresso, and my understanding of burr design was over grinding the beans actually led to a very “flat” tasting espresso, because everything was just far to uniform. What have you seen in testing this grinder/burr design? Any numbers after screening the grinds? reply smeeeeeeeeeeeee 7 minutes agoparentThis is an incredibly complicated subject full of dissenting opinions and obviously people have their preferences especially across different brew types. In my opinion, the effect of densification within grinders with longer, or multiple cutting paths is universally positive for flavor. Fine particles accumulate with eachother and with larger particles and everything is rolled and rounded. One of the things to remember is that over-grinding coffee, I assume you mean by putting it over and over through the same burr set, is not the same as putting it once through a longer burr set. With the cylindrical burrs, the coffee is doing the same thing that any other set of burrs do, only over a longer distance period of time, so the coffee has more time to densify. Below is a great James Hoffman video comparing traditional coffee grinders to roller grinders, though the company keeps a lot of the details a secret, their grinder not only has a very long grind path, but also a dedicated densification stage. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkYqHWThIpA I have only done blind taste tests using my friends and family as unwitting participants, and they've universally preferred turbina over a 64mm flat burr grinder with titanium nitride burrs and a high-ish end conical hand grinder.

With the Fellow Ode I can easily count clicks to insure I'm at the expected position. With out tactile markings on the dial and a tactile arrow to line up with markings there's no way to make the grind size reproducible as far as I know. I've never tried using stepless grinders for this reason so I may be wrong about how hard it is to dial in when blind. reply smeeeeeeeeeeeee 2 hours agorootparentEdit: Sorry, I missed the earlier comment!

Thanks. reply GuB-42 8 hours agoprev> I also saw so many people (including myself) using a scale while making espresso, and even putting a cup below the group head to catch drips, entirely negating the drip tray The drip tray is also where the 3-way valve dumps the excess water when the extraction is compete and the system is depressurized. It is also not just for drips, it is used for flushing, though I guess you can use a bowl here. I also see that it is designed for a naked portafilter, these are great, but they can be a bit messy if your technique is not perfect, making something like a drip tray even more relevant. Maybe offer a platter as an accessory, to avoid messing the countertop. I also wonder how the system is depressurized without a visible 3-way valve chute. reply smeeeeeeeeeeeee 2 hours agoparentA color matched platter is a good idea! Essentially inside the group head, there is a silicone ring which only lets water past with a small amount of pressure. When you turn the pump off, whatever pressure has built up will still be released into the coffee (we are talking like half a gram of water maybe) and at that point, water neither can neither exit the machine from the front or the back. If you want to flush all the water out entirely, you can put a cup below and the pump will blow it all out with air pressure. reply zdzarski 9 hours agoprevAs a coffee freak my first impression is \"shut up and take my money\".

That's worrying. Google \"bottomless portafilter shot\" for how it's supposed to look. reply thomky 4 hours agoparentThat clip is showing the filter coffee brew function, not espresso. Brewing filter coffee in an espresso machine actually sounds like it'd be nice on occasion. Side note -- I find it funny that you'd assume the guy that designed an espresso machine and grinder doesn't know what espresso looks like; on the flip-side, why no espresso pull money shot??? reply IAmGraydon 14 minutes agorootparent>Brewing filter coffee in an espresso machine actually sounds like it'd be nice on occasion.

There’s a picture at the end of the page that shows coffee dripping with much lower flow rate in the „filter mode”.

Without data, I'm skeptical of the claim > that gravity does most of the work to reduce retention Naively, I'd guess that the increased surface area from the cylindrical burr increases the retention rate since it's mostly caused by static cling.

The vibratory pump from my E61 machine is incredibly loud and doesn't particularly spark joy. Looking around the market for some used Fluid-o-tech gear pumps which were not extremely expensive was quite frustrating. Also having to deal with the correct power supply for the replacement pump wasn't something I was looking forward to. Props on releasing such cool products! Order #1 for the Pump kit went through. Looking forward to try it out! reply smeeeeeeeeeeeee 2 hours agoparentThank you so much for the order! I think the trouble with using fluid-o-tech style pumps (I actually started out by buying one) is that they're really optimized for machines where the space, cost, and weight of the pump aren't a significant concern, so they can get away with using a giant slow AC motor with big gears. That sort of motor unfortunately doesn't scale down too well, so instead we use a small DC brushless motor and spin it very fast, and then even with the power supply it still ends up being a smaller and cheaper setup. reply qorrect 4 hours agoprev> Some people might say that it’s cool to open to open up a home appliance and expose yourself to high voltage AC components, but",

      "The solo project involves designing an innovative espresso machine with a unique pump and adjustable pressure, aiming to improve outdated technology like 1977 vibratory pumps.- The machine is minimalist, user-friendly, and can also brew filter coffee, addressing common issues such as the need for scales and drip trays.- The project includes a gear pump upgrade kit for other machines and features a grinder with cylindrical burrs, although it faces challenges with oily roasts. Both machines require a DC power source."

I've seen pictures of a later version, which was an IBM 3270 display with a phone handset, but no keyboard. The idea was that the executive would pick up the phone and be connected to someone in a call center who would then do spreadsheet-type operations for them. Don't know if that was deployed much. reply snthpy 13 hours agoparentVery prescient! That's pretty much how my execs work with MS Teams and my Excel models - they call me and I manipulate them on the screen for them :-D reply Animats 13 hours agorootparentI'm trying to find a reference for this. I remember it from some ancient IBM ad. The system in the article sounds fancier but more like a one-off demo. The later system was just a second remote display plus a voice line; more deployable. The concept comes from NASA's Apollo Mission Control in the 1960s. These screens on the consoles were all just TV receivers. All the display data went onto a cable TV network. Any console could view any source. The network was remoted out, and displays outside the control room could look, too. Any display could be routed to the big screens, too. The same technology was still in use in some USAF facilities well into the 1980s. (Long story. Short version: the 1970s upgrade project failed.) That kind of switching remains a feature of military command and control centers. Some display may suddenly become important, and others need to look at it. reply qwezxcrty 5 hours agorootparentMany high energy physics/accelerator institutes have public accessable status dashboards online, if one want to see this concept in action.

Not much different than the email software at university, just the pixel resolution was higher with GUI. The dev team went out \"into the field\" to help roll out the software to the company. This also allowed us to see how others used the software. At the end of the day, one of the devs reported back that one personal assistant would maximize the email app's window (back when 17\" CRT monitors were large) and after each email was processed, she'd print out the email and file it the appropriate spot in a filing cabinet. All the devs were, \"But... But... she can just file the email in an email folder in the program. Why does she need hardcopy?

They thought it was super important that their secretary had a bachelors degree for some reason. One of the chairs would read emails on his iMac, then would handwrite a return message and give it to my wife who would type it into email and send it as him. He didn’t want to type anything. This was around 2008 to give you an idea of timing. My wife didn’t stay for long, but my understanding is he was doing this until he retired sometime in the 20 teens. reply SoftTalker 1 hour agorootparentA contemporary of my parents was a research chemist, he wrote all his research papers longhand and had a secretary type them up for publication. reply ghaff 4 hours agorootparentprev2008.

Doctors consider their time too valuable to be used in slow and fiddly data entry, so they offload it to additional staff. They're not entirely wrong in this regard - modern EMR web UIs are arguably inferior in many ways to some light pen driven systems of the 1970s-80s (I'm thinking especially of the old TDS system, which nurses (and the few docs that used them) loved because it was so easy and quick - replacing or \"upgrading\" it was like pulling teeth, and the nurses fought hard to keep it in every case I ever saw.) reply ghaff 2 hours agorootparentThe younger docs seem more amenable but there still seems to be a ton of electronic paperwork for the benefit. That said, my \"community hospital\" got bought by one of the two big systems in my area and, from a patient standpoint, things like prescriptions and labs especially seem much more automated than in the past. reply ddingus 3 hours agorootparentprevOld school status statement right there. reply SoftTalker 1 hour agorootparentprev> Why does she need hardcopy? Email was supposed to save trees! Old habits take a while to change. Managers and executives were used to reports and memos on paper. So when email arrived, it was very common for secretaries to print emails for their bosses to read. Even at one of my early jobs in the 1990s, changes deployed to production had to be documented in memo form, and a copy of the memo printed, along with diffs of the code changes, and filed in a filing cabinet. We got there eventually. I'd say that for all but the oldest generation still working, printing any kind of document to hardcopy has become pretty rare, at least where I'm working. reply ido 11 hours agorootparentprevIn the early 90s (maybe '92 or '93) my elementary school had a program where we'd go to the computer room and email kids in another school.

The same arrangement was used throughout the Gemini and Apollo mission control and up to the early shuttle program - images would be rendered in the RTCC (real-time computer complex(?)) and piped to the slow-scan CRTs in the panels. At the panel the operator could select which video stream they wanted to see. One of the streams was a \"channel guide\". reply mrandish 1 hour agoprevVery interesting contrasting visions between IBM's hierarchical approach and Englebart's Mother of All Demos. The IBM vision isn't really even computing based. it's obvious from the video which shows an on-demand point-to-point analog video link between a senior executive's office and a central reference library. The video is only from the library to the executive but the audio is bi-directional allowing the researcher to receive requests, assemble materials which could include documents placed on a video camera stand, transparencies, microfilm or the display output of a video terminal and then display them on the video feed using a video source switch box. It's really more a demo of a dedicated corporate video calling system. > Dunlop’s 1968 video demonstration of the Executive Terminal and the Information Center proceeds in three acts. The article doesn't make this clear but the linked videos are not a video demonstration but instead unedited B-roll shots without audio probably captured to be cut-aways edited into a narrated video demonstration.

I will concede that the aiming specifically isn't S-tier, but then again this is an \"action-adventure\" game, not a shooter, and everything else in the combat system more than makes up for that one less-than-perfect feature. Not to mention the fact that the game is much more than just the combat system. \"Action\" was just one of the characteristics I listed. The aesthetics and paranormal lore are reason enough to play it regardless of any combat. It's incredibly satisfying to destroy the environment, throw objects and enemies around, levitate, dash in mid air... just thinking about it has me wanting to replay the whole thing even if I already know the mystery. reply KerrAvon 2 hours agorootparentprevI think you may be thinking of a different game?

The fact that late-20th-century businessmen viewed such things as typing to be subordinates' work has had a more profound effect on the adoption of computer technologies, their development, and their marketing that we in modern times could guess without having known. I'm also reminded of the Ashton-Tate software package Framework, which is one of my favorites from the 1980s. It's what they used to call \"integrated software\", which was a package of several productivity applications: word processor, spreadsheet, maybe a communications program or database or graphing capability, bundled together and sold as a unit. Unlike, say, Microsoft Works or DeskMate, Framework featured powerful versions of these tools and the ability to create composite documents, as well as a programming language with Lisp-like semantics to automate workflows. Because of this, Ashton-Tate pitched Framework as an executive decision-making tool, which was quite a bit different from how competitor programs like Lotus 1-2-3 were marketed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQMc0yIbvDg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIx-TGUkiSg reply ghaff 4 hours agoparentLotus Symphony was a (later?) incarnation. Basically things evolved to more loosely coupled incarnations of office suites which ended up being pretty much from Microsoft (OK, LibreOffice) and then Microsoft and Google online.

King Argaven considers Genly Ai's existence (and his offer of union with the Ekumen) a threat to his sovereignty as king, because of that Karhide's sovereignty as a nation, also because of that his worth as an individual. He can't separate these concepts because they are all one, they are all shifgrethor. This insight helped me understand the mindset of the IBM executives, which I wouldn't have before; just dismissed it as wrongheaded pre-boomer silliness. The executives saw demeaning themselves with the scutwork of looking things up for oneself as an attack on their position, their dignity and worth as individuals, and the organization as a whole -- perhaps even society as a whole. Those filthy hippies with their (sissy voice) \"collaborative work environments\" and their \"interactive terminals\".

I think the other part there is that it's normal people using them. What I mean by that is that in these videos, it's all very formal corporate people. And then the first people that really get interested in this kind of technology or who have an interest in futuristic stuff are / were the \"nerdy\" types. (I am probably living in a bubble though).

This was what engineers were barely capable of, with the technology that did exist, but even most executives who were the type of user it was envisioned for never knew anything about it, much less had anything like this much desktop technology ever. Everybody else in the non-executive category, even more of a complete fantasy. IOW the difference between what you see there vs now is minor, compared to the real \"backward\" state back then. Even though things like transistor radios were already common, you have to realize that in a huge percentage of dwellings in the US, and way more in the rest of the world, there was still not yet a single transistorized product. I was a young math & electronics geek and was aware of more stuff like this than average. Along with all the much more mature people, like the extremely rare engineering students who might want to work for IBM or something, this was exactly the kind of thing that was inspiring the movie \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" which came out the next year.

    "originBody": "The age of average Mar 20 Written By Alex Murrell Introduction: In the early 1990s, two Russian artists named Vitaly Komar and Alexander Melamid took the unusual step of hiring a market research firm. Their brief was simple. Understand what Americans desire most in a work of art. Over 11 days the researchers at Marttila & Kiley Inc. asked 1,001 US citizens a series of survey questions. What’s your favourite colour? Do you prefer sharp angles or soft curves? Do you like smooth canvases or thick brushstrokes? Would you rather figures that are nude or clothed? Should they be at leisure or working? Indoors or outside? In what kind of landscape? Komar and Melamid then set about painting a piece that reflected the results. The pair repeated this process in a number of countries including Russia, China, France and Kenya. Each piece in the series, titled “People’s Choice”, was intended to be a unique a collaboration with the people of a different country and culture. But it didn’t quite go to plan. Describing the work in his book Playing to the Gallery, the artist Grayson Perry said: “In nearly every country all people really wanted was a landscape with a few figures around, animals in the foreground, mainly blue.” Despite soliciting the opinions of over 11,000 people, from 11 different countries, each of the paintings looked almost exactly the same. Komar and Melamid, People’s Choice After completing the work, Komar quipped: “We have been travelling to different countries, engaging in dull negotiations with representatives of polling companies, raising money for further polls, receiving more or less the same results, and painting more or less the same blue landscapes. Looking for freedom, we found slavery.” This, however, was the point. The art was not the paintings themselves, but the comment they made. We like to think that we are individuals, but we are much more alike that we wish to admit. 30 years after People’s Choice, it seems the landscapes which Komar and Melamid painted have become the landscapes in which we live. This article argues that from film to fashion and architecture to advertising, creative fields have become dominated and defined by convention and cliché. Distinctiveness has died. In every field we look at, we find that everything looks the same. Welcome to the age of average. Let’s dive in. Interiors all look the same In 2011, Laurel Schwulst was planning to redecorate her New York apartment when she began searching the internet for interior design inspiration. Before long, the designer had stumbled on the perfect research tool: AirBnB. From the comfort of her home the app gave her a window into thousands of others. She could travel the world, and view hundreds of rooms, without leaving her chair. Schwulst began sharing images to her Tumblr, “Modern Life Space”. The blog became an ever-expanding gallery of interior design inspiration. But something wasn’t right. Laurel Schwulst: “The Airbnb experience is supposed to be about real people and authenticity. But so many of them were similar, whether in Brooklyn, Osaka, Rio de Janeiro, Seoul, or Santiago.” Schwulst had identified an AirBnB design aesthetic that had organically emerged and was quickly spreading through the platform’s properties. White walls. Raw wood. Nespresso machines. Eames chairs. Bare brick. Open shelving. Edison bulbs. The style combines the rough-hewn rawness of industrialism with the elegant minimalism of mid-century design. International Airbnb Style But Schwulst wasn’t the only one to identify the trend. Aaron Taylor Harvey, the Executive Creative Director of Environments at Airbnb had spotted something similar: “You can feel a kind of trend in certain listings. There’s an International Airbnb Style that’s starting to happen. I think that some of it is really a wonderful thing that gives people a sense of comfort and immediate belonging when they travel, and some of it is a little generic. It can go either way.” This “Modern Life Space” or “International AirBnB Style” goes by a number of other names. It’s known as the Brooklyn Look, or according to the journalist Kyle Chayka, AirSpace: “I called this style “AirSpace”. It’s marked by an easily recognisable mix of symbols – like reclaimed wood, Edison bulbs, and refurbished industrial lighting – that’s meant to provide familiar, comforting surroundings for a wealthy, mobile elite, who want to feel like they’re visiting somewhere “authentic” while they travel, but who actually just crave more of the same: more rustic interiors and sans-serif logos and splashes of cliche accent colours on rugs and walls.” Perhaps this seems inevitable. Isn’t it obvious that a global group of hosts all trying to present their properties to a global group of travellers would converge on a single, optimal, appealing yet inoffensive style? AirSpace, however, isn’t just limited to residential interiors. The same tired tropes have spread beyond the spaces where we live, and taken over the spaces where we work, eat, drink and relax. In an in-depth investigation for The Guardian, Chayka documents how the AirSpace style of interior decor has become the dominant design style of coffee shops: “Go to Shoreditch Grind, near a roundabout in the middle of London’s hipster district. It’s a coffee shop with rough-hewn wooden tables, plentiful sunlight from wide windows, and austere pendant lighting. Then head to Takk in Manchester. It’s a coffee shop with a big glass storefront, reclaimed wood furniture, and hanging Edison bulbs. Compare the two: You might not even know you’re in different spaces. It’s no accident that these places look similar. Though they’re not part of a chain and don’t have their interior design directed by a single corporate overlord, these coffee shops have a way of mimicking the same tired style, a hipster reduction obsessed with a superficial sense of history and the remnants of industrial machinery that once occupied the neighbourhoods they take over.” And this isn’t just a trend that we can see in British coffee culture. The same trend has been identified in cities from Bangkok to Beijing and from Seoul to San Francisco. AirSpace According to The Verge: “The coffee roaster Four Barrel in San Francisco looks like the Australian Toby’s Estate in Brooklyn looks like The Coffee Collective in Copenhagen looks like Bear Pond Espresso in Tokyo. You can get a dry cortado with perfect latte art at any of them, then Instagram it on a marble countertop and further spread the aesthetic to your followers.” Once this interior design style became dominant in the world’s coffee shops, it began to spread throughout the wider hospitality sector. Anne Quito, for example, writes about how the hipster makeover has made its way to restaurants in Quartz: “Established restaurants are getting the hipster makeover. Traditional restaurants like Dickey’s Barbecue in Dallas, eateries in Toronto’s Chinatown and even the 47-year-old roadside diner chain Cracker Barrel—in the guise of its new biscuit joint Holler & Dash—are embracing chalkboard menus and reclaimed wood look to attract the affluent, design-savvy millennial.” So, the interiors of our homes, coffee shops and restaurants have begun to converge upon a single style. But when we move outside, the story doesn’t get much better. Architecture all looks the same The anthropologist Marc Augé coined the term “non-place” to describe built environments that are defined by their transience and anonymity. Non-places, such as airports, service stations and hotels, tend towards utilitarian sterility. They prioritise function and efficiency over a softer sense of human expression and social connection. In 1995, the Professor of Architecture and Urban Design at Harvard University, Rem Koolhaas, published an essay titled The Generic City: “Is the contemporary city like the contemporary airport— ‘all the same’? Is it possible to theorise this convergence? And if so, to what ultimate configuration is it aspiring? Convergence is possible only at the price of shedding identity. That is usually seen as a loss. But at the scale at which it occurs it must mean something. What are the disadvantages of identity, and conversely, what are the advantages of blankness? What if this seemingly accidental, and usually regretted, homogenization was an intentional process, a conscious movement away from difference toward similarity?” That opening question takes Augé’s idea of the sterile non-place and applies it to the city as a whole. Koolhaas, in effect, is arguing that soulless is becoming the default design direction of all urban architecture. The generic city Almost 30 years after the publication of The Generic City I think it’s clear Koolhaas’ fears were well founded. Architecture’s march towards blank homogeneity is perhaps most obvious in the quick build, low-cost apartment blocks that have rapidly spread across the United States. Justin Fox writing for Bloomberg: “Cheap stick framing has led to a proliferation of blocky, forgettable mid-rises. (…) These buildings are in almost every U.S. city. They range from three to seven stories tall and can stretch for blocks. They’re usually full of rental apartments, but they can also house college dorms, condominiums, hotels, or assisted-living facilities. Close to city centers, they tend toward a blocky, often colorful modernism; out in the suburbs, their architecture is more likely to feature peaked roofs and historical motifs. Their outer walls are covered with fiber cement, metal, stucco, or bricks.” This architectural style, characterised by boxy forms and unconvincing cladding, goes by names such as Fast-Casual Architecture and McUrbanism. But perhaps most commonly, these buildings are known as five-over-ones. When Justin Fox drove across the US, he realised that they were not specific to one city or state. They were everywhere. And they were proliferating: “In 2017, 187,000 new housing units were completed in buildings of 50 units or more in the U.S., the most since the Census Bureau started keeping track in 1972. By my informal massaging of the data, well over half of those were in blocky mid-rises.” But why is this the case? Why are the majority of large American buildings succumbing to the same style? Coby Lefkowitz offers four reasons in his essay, “Why Everywhere Looks the Same”. First, unlike in the early 20th century, developers are increasingly constrained by building codes. Second, rapidly rising land costs cause developers to pack as many properties as possible into every site. Third, the rising barriers to entry have caused the industry to consolidate. And fourth, developers seek to reduce their costs by reusing the same plans across multiple sites: “It would be disappointing enough to fail in gracing a land as physically beautiful as the US with the built companions it deserves. But it’s downright shameful that we deprive ourselves of living in interesting, meaningful, and wonderful places, given the thousands of precedents for inspiration worldwide, and many hundreds within our borders. Instead, we’ve copied and pasted our society from the most anodyne, the most boring, and the most bleh. We’ve all seen them. Covered with fiber cement, stucco, and bricks or brick-like material. They’ve shown up all over the country, indifferent to their surroundings. Spreading like a non-native species.” America’s five-over-one architecture Cities once felt rooted in time and place. The Victorian grandeur of London. The Art Deco glamour of New York. The neon modernity of Tokyo. But with anodyne architecture spreading across the United States, cities are beginning to lose their contextual identities. They are all starting to look the same: “Institutional developers march forward, ignorant of what makes Portland, Maine different from Portland, Oregon, or Philadelphia from Kansas City. Unique local traditions? Completely different climates? Hah! Joke’s on us. A box fits just as well in any of these places.” And it isn’t just the design of our residential buildings but our professional ones as well. In an article for Grist, Heather Smith describes the homogeneity of the office parks she’d pass on the way to her mother’s place of work and how present day Silicon Valley feels so similar. “All the offices and factories along the way to my mom’s office were smaller versions of the same thing — set back from the road, behind deep rectangles of rolling green lawn, no sidewalks. Sometimes clusters of begonias added accent marks, or regimented little bushes pruned into spheres or squares.” Smith continues: “I thought about this recently when I went driving through Silicon Valley, because I was surprised at how similar it was to the neighborhoods that I had grown up in. Not that it was an exact replica (…). But the architecture was the same — the same low-slung buildings, set back from the street by parking lots, each complex its own self-contained bubble, separated from the road by a row of trees.” So, the places where we live and work have begun to converge upon a single style, but we’re also seeing the same trend occur in the way we travel between them. Cars all looks the same In 2015, the ex-Chairman of BBH London, Jim Carroll recalled his realisation 32 years earlier that aerodynamic tests had begun to make all cars look alike: “Some of you will recall the day in 1983 when we woke up and noticed that the cars all looked the same. There was a simple explanation. They’d all been through the same wind tunnel. We nodded assent at the evident improvement in fuel efficiency, but we could not escape a weary sigh of disappointment. Modern life is rubbish.” In Carroll’s opinion, because all vehicles underwent the same wind tunnel tests, manufacturers were independently converging on the same optimal set of forms, proportions and dimensions. And as a result, homogeneity in car design was increasing. What Carroll didn’t realise was that things were about to get a lot worse. Sat at a red light, Drew Magary took the opportunity to scope out some new car ideas. Suddenly he saw an SUV that looked attractive. But he couldn’t quite see the badge. Another car was blocking his line of sight: “Maybe it’s a Bimmer,” I said to the dog. “It kinda looks like one.” It wasn’t. It was a Hyundai Santa Fe, which kinda resembles the Acura RDX, which kinda resembles the Volvo XC60, which kinda resembles the BMW X3. (…) These four models are all 75 inches wide, 66 inches high (save for the Volvo, which is 65), and they only differ in length by a maximum of three inches. They all have rear quarter windows smaller than a porthole on a submarine. They all have chrome accents to increase the glam factor by, like, five percent. And they all abhor right angles, (…). They’re spiritual clones, and they’re not exceptions in being so.” The wind tunnel effect (Source: Adrian Hanft, User Zero) But why do so many modern cars look the same? Jim Carroll’s wind-tunnel theory is certainly one reason. Another is that the automotive giants increasingly share vehicle “platforms” between the many brands that they operate. And Ian Callum, who led design at Jaguar-Land Rover for two decades, provides a third theory. “There was a time when you could identify the country the car came from. But today, basically every company makes cars for basically every country (…). Cars are now designed for the broadest possible audience, across the broadest number of countries, to be manufactured in the most efficient possible way.” Callum continues: “Before the typical car designer can even begin sketching out a model, they’re given specs from the packaging department (…). The measurements might vary within millimetres. These strict dimensions are agonisingly chosen to please the needs of the wind tunnel, to adhere to government safety regulations, to properly accommodate the average American family’s collective weight of 78,000 lbs., and to allow for enough cargo space for all their crap.” These three theories explain why the three-dimensional design of cars has been converging over time. But they don’t explain why the colour of cars has converged as well. According to data shared by Jökull Solberg, around 40% of cars sold in 1996 were monochromatic (black, white, silver or grey). 20 years later that figure had increased to 80%. There are many suggestions for why this might be. Perhaps these colours come as standard and everything else is an optional upgrade. Perhaps brighter colours fade more quickly. Maybe people buy less vibrant colours when times are more turbulent. Maybe the resale market for monochromatic cars is more buoyant. Or maybe the pared-back design of smartphones informed stylistic trends in the auto industry. Regardless, the result is the same. Where once carparks were a kaleidoscope of reds, blues and greens, today they capture a sea of desaturation. And what’s more? The visual identities of car brands seem to be following suit. In September 2020, Vauxhall released a modernised, minimal marque. According to Henry Wong at Design Week: “Vauxhall unveiled its new logo last week, a “confidently British” look, which reworks the griffin icon and introduces a blue-and-red colour scheme. Most prominent is its new flat styling — a simplified version of the logo’s previous 3D look. Vauxhall calls the redesign the “progressive face of the brand”.” The “blanding” of automotive brand identities Vauxhall had ditched a logo that looked like a chrome sculpted bonnet badge and replaced it with a flatter, thinner, altogether simpler execution. But they weren’t the only one. As Wong says, at least five other major manufacturers had charted a similar course: “It’s a familiar story within car branding of late. Audi first unveiled a minimalist-inspired rebrand in 2018, but it’s been followed by a host of other marques in the past year. Volkswagen, BMW, Toyota, Nissan have all revealed new branding and each with a flat logo.” So, the cars we drive, their colours and their logos have begun to converge upon a single style, but we’re also seeing the same trend occur in the way we look ourselves. People all look the same In December 2019 the journalist Jia Tolentino set about investigating a troubling trend. Many celebrities and influencers had started to resemble each other. “This past summer, I booked a plane ticket to Los Angeles with the hope of investigating what seems likely to be one of the oddest legacies of our rapidly expiring decade: the gradual emergence, among professionally beautiful women, of a single, cyborgian face. It’s a young face, of course, with poreless skin and plump, high cheekbones. It has catlike eyes and long, cartoonish lashes; it has a small, neat nose and full, lush lips. It looks at you coyly but blankly, as if its owner has taken half a Klonopin and is considering asking you for a private-jet ride to Coachella.” The look that Tolentino is describing is the result of (at least) three conspiring trends. The growing market for injectable treatments is driving a trend for physical enhancements. The rise of apps such as FaceTune is driving a trend for digital enhancements. And make-up techniques such as “strobing” and “contouring” are driving a trend for cosmetic enhancements. Over the last decade, these trends have developed in parallel, each feeding and fueling the other. Starting at the top, Tolentino discusses the rising accessibility of beauty treatments such as Botox and fillers: “Twenty years ago, plastic surgery was a fairly dramatic intervention: expensive, invasive, permanent, and, often, risky. But, in 2002, the Food and Drug Administration approved Botox for use in preventing wrinkles; a few years later, it approved hyaluronic-acid fillers, such as Juvéderm and Restylane, which at first filled in fine lines and wrinkles and now can be used to restructure jawlines, noses, and cheeks. These procedures last for six months to a year and aren’t nearly as expensive as surgery. (…) You can go get Botox and then head right back to the office.” But the cost of achieving this look, which has become known as “Instagram Face”, is even lower than one may imagine. Whilst the average price per syringe of filler is $683, social sharers can now use apps to achieve similar results. Instagram Face Rebecca Jennings writing for Vox: “Instagram Face is so ubiquitous that there are now special filters that give you the look digitally if you can’t afford the real thing. (…) Almost no one is born with Instagram Face — by virtue of it being associated with a digital platform, the look is always mediated and performed — and even those who have it naturally still use tools like FaceTune to enhance their already algorithmically perfect features.” Finally, these physical and digital enhancements are complemented by a third, altogether less dystopian, trend: cosmetic enhancements. Here make-up, and an almost endless supply of YouTube tutorials, are used to alter the perceived bone structure of a face. Julia Brucculieri for the Huffington Post: “Social media influencers these days are starting to look like beauty clones. You know the look: a full pout, perfectly arched eyebrows, maybe some expertly applied eyeliner, topped off with a healthy dose of highlighter and cheek contouring. With a few makeup brushes, a contour palette and some matte lip color, you can be well on your way to looking like everyone else.” So where did all of this begin? According to the make-up artist Colby Smith, Kim Kardashian is patient-zero of Instagram face. Ultimately, he says, every social media star’s goal is to look like her. And Smith isn’t the only one to hold this opinion. Writing for The Cut, Kathleen Hou offers a similarly provocative opinion. “Instagram’s beauty posters tend to look like they’re all the same woman, and that woman is Kim Kardashian. Thanks to hundreds of “Get the Look” tutorials, it’s never been easier to strobe and contour yourself into a facsimile of the star. So, no wonder there’s a cloning effect.” This may seem like an exaggeration. There is, however, a truth at the centre of the assertion. When The New Yorker interviewed Beverley Hills based plastic surgeon Jason Diamond, he claimed around a third of all his patients aspire to become a Kardashian doppelgänger: “I’d say that thirty percent of people come in bringing a photo of Kim, or someone like Kim—there’s a handful of people, but she’s at the very top of the list, and understandably so.” And we haven’t only started to look alike from the neck up. Dame Vivienne Westwood, the late fashion designer best known for bringing the counter-cultural punk scene onto the catwalk, comments on the way clothing has started to conform: “Everybody looks like clones and the only people you notice are my age. I don’t notice anybody unless they look great, and every now and again they do, and they are usually 70. We are so conformist, nobody is thinking. We are all sucking up stuff, we have been trained to be consumers and we are all consuming far too much. I’m a fashion designer and people think, what do I know? But I’m talking about all this disposable crap.” So, the way we look and the way we dress has begun to converge upon a single style. But when we look at the content we consume, the story doesn’t get much better. Media all looks the same In the early 2010s, French blogger Christophe Courtois began curating movie posters that conformed to strikingly similar formulas. Rom-coms often used a guy and a girl standing back-to-back against a white background. Horror films featured a close up of an eye. Action films opting for a lone character, dressed in black with their back to the camera. Courtois’ series perfectly illustrates how, in the 21st Century, every genre of film sticks to a relatively narrow set of clichés, codes and conventions that promoters slavishly abide by. Christophe Courtois’ cinematic clichés In Hadley Freeman’s book Life Moves Pretty Fast, Oscar winning director Steven Soderbergh argues that this is the natural result of testing: “If you've ever wondered why every poster and every trailer and every TV spot looks exactly the same, it's because of testing. It's because anything interesting scores poorly and gets kicked out. (…) I've tried to argue that maybe the thing that's making it distinctive, and score poorly, actually would stick out if you presented it to these people the way the real world presents it. And I’ve never won that argument.” But is the homogenisation of Hollywood a new phenomenon? To find out Adam Mastroianni analysed the top 20 grossing films in every year since 1977 and coded whether each was part of a “multiplicity” (i.e. a sequel, prequel, franchise, spin-off, reboot etc.). What he found was surprising: “Until the year 2000, about 25% of top-grossing movies were prequels, sequels, spinoffs, remakes, reboots, or cinematic universe expansions. Since 2010, it’s been over 50% ever year. In recent years, it’s been close to 100%.” Mastroianni continues: “In 2021, only one of the ten top-grossing films (the Ryan Reynolds vehicle Free Guy) was an original. There were only two originals in 2020’s top 10, and none at all in 2019.” A further finding for the research was that the revenue generated by the top 20 movies was, until 2015, around 40% of that generated by the top 200. Since then however that 40% figure has begun to climb even higher, crossing the 60% threshold in 2021. In short, the top 20 films are becoming both bigger and more alike. But this isn’t just happening in film. In every corner of pop culture, a smaller number of “blockbusters” is claiming a larger share of the market. What were once creative powerhouses have become factories of the familiar. Take books. “It used to be pretty rare for one author to have multiple books in the top 10 in the same year. Since 1990, it’s happened almost every year. No author ever had three top 10 books in one year until Danielle Steel did it 1998. In 2011, John Grisham, Kathryn Stockett, and Stieg Larsson all had two chart-topping books each. (…) In the 1950s, a little over half of the authors in the top 10 had been there before. These days, it’s closer to 75%.” You can see this creative convergence for yourself when you next visit a bookstore. In fiction you’ll see many popular books following a “girl with…” naming convention. Of course, there’s Larsson’s “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo”, but we’ve also seen Paula Hawkins’ “The Girl on the Train”, M. R. Carey’s “The Girl With all the Gifts” and A. J. Grayson’s “The Girl in the Water”. In non-fiction, if you visit the self-help category, you’ll notice that every book title seems to include a swear word. We have Mark Manson’s “The Subtle Art of not Giving a Fuck”, Sarah Knight’s “The Life Changing Magic of Not Giving a Fuck” and Alexis Rockley’s “Find your Fuck Yeah.” Sweary self-help books Video games are no different. In the late 1990s, 75% or less of the best-selling video games were franchise instalments. Since 2005, it’s been closer to 100%. I’ll quote Keith Stuart, writing for The Guardian, at length: “The absence of the E3 expo in Los Angeles for the past two years has left a gigantic vacuum in the video game calendar. Last week, the industry did its best to fill that gaping content maw with three online events – the Summer Game fest, the Xbox and Bethesda showcase and the PC gaming show. They were underwhelming for many seasoned players. Major reveals included a remake of The Last of Us, a remake of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, Street Fighter 6, Final Fantasy XVI and news about the reimagining of the classic role-player System Shock.” So, our movies, books and video games have all begun to look the same. But it’s not just the content we consume. When we look at the content brands produce the story doesn’t get much better. Brands all look the same In 1982 the American fashion photographer Irving Penn shot an ad for Clinique that became known as “the shelfie”. The advert is simply a photograph of the inside of a medicine cabinet. A bright white background. Glass shelves. Bottles of pills. And a few well branded Clinique products. Since this iconic 80s ad, many other brands have created their own shelfies, including Selfridges, e. l. f. and Billie. But this isn’t the only tried and tested trope. Here’s AIGA Eye on Design: “There are many more oft-mimicked setups like the shelfie currently bouncing around the zeitgeist; one omnipresent shot includes objects placed on a mirror reflecting the sky, giving the illusion of a product floating in midair. Another example uses a dense pattern of water droplets to refract a single item into a series of psychedelic miniatures, while yet another places subjects in front of faux scenic backdrops reminiscent of a low-budget Sears photo studio. Each of these distinct setups is utilized broadly and across industries, with the same composition and concept seen on the Instagram feeds of a major beverage syndicate and an indie skincare brand alike.” Shelfies In an article for The Cut, titled The Tyranny of Terrazzo, Molly Fischer pushes this thought one step further. Whilst there is the shelfie trope and the mirror trope and the water droplet trope, these layouts all seem to share a surprisingly consistent style of art direction. They might be compositionally different, but they are conceptually alike: “And then there are advertisements, making up a visual world of their own. The products on view (cookware, supplements, stretchy clothes) occupy blank pastel landscapes manipulated by a diversity of hands. These aren’t ads that bellow or hector; they whisper, in restrained sans-serif fonts, or chastely flirt, in letters with curves and bounce. They’re ads, sure, but they’re so well designed. In this era, you come to understand, design was the product. Whatever else you might be buying, you were buying design, and all the design looked the same.” Whilst Clinique’s original Shelfie hails from the 80s, it wasn’t until the 2010s that it became a more widely adopted style. And the majority of companies who did so were digital-first, DTC brands. Elizabeth Goodspeed argues this is because these brands are more likely to draw inspiration from the same vast online sources. The result, she says, is a “moodboard effect”: “This kind of visual homogeneity is a common occurrence in the art direction world, where ubiquitous styles operate less like trends and more like memes; remixed and diluted until they become a single visual mass. In today’s extremely-online world, the vast availability of reference imagery has, perhaps counterintuitively, led to narrower thinking and shallower visual ideation. It’s a product of what I like to call the “moodboard effect”.” So, designers use the same online platforms, draw inspiration from the same sorts of imagery and, in turn, create broadly the same types of adverts. But it isn’t just advertising that is causing brands to all look the same. Their visual identities are converging as well. In December 2018, Thierry Brunfaut and Tom Greenwood published an article in Fast Company where they coined a new word: Blanding. “The worst branding trend (…) is the one you probably never noticed. I call it blanding. The main offenders are in tech, where a new army of clones wears a uniform of brand camouflage. The formula is sort of a brand paint-by-numbers. Start with a made-up-word name. Put it in a sans-serif typeface. Make it clean and readable, with just the right amount of white space. Use a direct tone of voice. Nope, no need for a logo. Maybe throw in some cheerful illustrations. Just don’t forget the vibrant colors. Bonus points for purple and turquoise. Blah blah blah.” Companies like AirBnB, Spotify and eBay have all dropped colourful logos with expressive typography for a straighter, stricter, altogether more muted, alternative. The homogeneity of modern brands Ben Schott writing for Bloomberg: “Visually, blands are simple, neutral and flat. The palette is plain and pastel (with the occasional vibrant splash); the mood is upbeat and happy, or pensive and cool, but never truly real; the dress-code is smart-casual. Bland people are stock-photo attractive (or quirkily jolie laide). (…) Complex products and technical processes are illustrated by cute cartoons or Noun Project icons. Bland logos are confident but cute, utilizing an array of tweaks and twists to provoke the all-important “smile in the mind”.” While the tech sector has led the way on blanding, we see the trend towards flatter, more lifeless, identities playing out in categories from the high-end world of fashion to the more mass world of personal care. In a November 2021 article, title Distinction Rebellion, Contagious claimed that more and more brands seem content to drift along in a sea of sameness: “Look up any new corporate brand identity unveiled over the past decade and you will almost certainly find yourself staring at a flattened and simplified version of the company’s old logo. The aesthetic has become so ubiquitous that it’s acquired its own name – blanding.” So, advertising and brand identities are becoming more and more alike. But so too are the taglines brands employ. Shai Idelson, Strategy Director at ad agency BBH, collected a list of 27 brands whose taglines follow the “Find Your X” sentence structure. These include Lucozade’s “Find Your Flow”, Rightmove’s “Find Your Happy” and Volvic’s “Find Your Volcano”. Idelson says: “I love end-lines. The delicate art of capturing a meaningful thought about a brand or a product in as few words as possible. A great end-line will touch my heart and stay in my memory forever. I still remember some from my childhood. But in the last few years, something happened to end-lines. (…) The linguistic similarity is staggering.” The same “insight” that sits behind the 27 taglines (that young consumers celebrate individuality above all else) has also led to the “X, Your Way” end line construction. We have Nespresso’s “Indulge, Your Way”, Sonos’ “Sound, Your Way”, Dunelm’s “Dun, Your Way” and many, many more. And so brand adverts, identities and taglines are all starting to look the same. But where does this all leave us? Conclusion So, there you have it. The interiors of our homes, coffee shops and restaurants all look the same. The buildings where we live and work all look the same. The cars we drive, their colours and their logos all look the same. The way we look and the way we dress all looks the same. Our movies, books and video games all look the same. And the brands we buy, their adverts, identities and taglines all look the same. But it doesn’t end there. In the age of average, homogeneity can be found in an almost indefinite number of domains. The Instagram pictures we post, the tweets we read, the TV we watch, the app icons we click, the skylines we see, the websites we visit and the illustrations which adorn them all look the same. The list goes on, and on, and on. UGC all looks the same (Source: Insta Repeat) There are many reasons why this might have happened. Perhaps when times are turbulent, people seek the safety of the familiar. Perhaps it’s our obsession with quantification and optimisation. Or maybe it’s the inevitable result of inspiration becoming globalised. Regardless of the reasons, it seems that just as Komar and Melamid produced the “people’s choice” in art, contemporary companies produce the people’s choice in almost every category of creativity. But it’s not all bad news. I believe that the age of average is the age of opportunity. When every supermarket aisle looks like a sea of sameness, when every category abides by the same conventions, when every industry has converged on its own singular style, bold brands and courageous companies have the chance to chart a different course. To be different, distinctive and disruptive. So, this is your call to arms. Whether you’re in film or fashion, media or marketing, architecture, automotive or advertising, it doesn’t matter. Our visual culture is flatlining and the only cure is creativity. It’s time to cast aside conformity. It’s time to exorcise the expected. It’s time to decline the indistinguishable. For years the world has been moving in the same stylistic direction. And it’s time we reintroduced some originality. Or as the ad agency BBH says. When the world zigs. Zag.

It is a critique that could only be written by someone who has no trouble affording their rent. Austin, for one place, has had some success in bringing down rents by building tons of blocky, forgettable mid-rises, and I'll take it, thank you. One must have a certain amount of wealth just to be able to travel to enough different places in the world to notice that they are all kind of similar. I think the world's smallest violin plays for the moneyed tourist, disappointed that he's not finding enough variety in his travels. Furthermore, as one who is fortunate enough to have been able to do some traveling like that, in southern France, Croatia, and Greece, I'll point out that the architecture in quaint villages around the mediterranean is also all kind of similar: narrow streets lined with small homes with terra cotta tile roofs and stuccoed stone walls are everywhere. To the extent that there are distinct regional motifs, they are only discernible to the trained architectural eye. As it turns out, in every age, people are less concerned with asserting their identity than with having housing that can be built with available resources and is not too expensive. In an era of global shipping and industrial production, \"available resources\" doesn't mean local materials any more, though. EDIT: Of course, one can look at pictures of places to which one hasn't traveled and notice that they're similar, but that complaint seems, if anything, even less important. reply LunaSea 0 minutes agoparent> There's a distinct snobbery to some of the architectural commentary, particularly in lamenting the sameness of stick-built \"blocky, forgettable mid-rises\" providing apartments for the masses.

This is easily invalidated by the fact that villas drawn by architects also follow this withe cubes trend in many European countries. reply klik99 22 minutes agoparentprevI, personally, hate the trend because it's visually boring, but that doesn't mean there's upsides - buildings are safer, it's cheaper to build. Even though I subjectively don't like the style, I don't believe everyone should strive for art in all things. Another optimist read about the non-architectural global monoculture the article was complaining about is it's a great sign we're becoming closer as a world, that whats hip coffeshop in NYC is hip coffeeshop in Shanghai is hip coffeeshop in Liverpool. On one hand I hate that everything looks the same, but it also gives me hope that the world is starting to unify. Also I would forgive a lot of blocky buildings if there were just bits of personality of cities sprinkled inside. For example - Amsterdam has blocky buildings like everywhere in the world, but it has these cool riverfront, bridges, and a few unique modern constructions that give it real personality. reply patrickhogan1 1 hour agoparentprevI agree—the complaint seems trivial. You could frame it as: Oh, how mundane—so many homes now feature open floor plans that let more people enjoy sunlight and fresh air, with well-lit spaces, functional plumbing, antibacterial stainless steel fixtures, easy-to-clean hygienic floors, cheap yet comfortable furniture, and the charm of indoor plants.

You don't need to travel in person to see things. I like watching videos of foreign countries, and part of the appeal is seeing different architecture. I don't want every country to look the same, even if I never travel there.

Just like speciation requires isolation, perhaps our cultural globalization is preventing weird uniqueness from developing? reply stringsandchars 8 hours agoprevThe article mentions cafés and restaurants looking the same, but a more significant change in my opinion is that regional recipes are disappearing and all food is beginning to taste the same. I've seen this gradually happening in the towns in Spain where I've visited my family since a child: for instance in Bilbao the traditional pintxos/tapas are gradually becoming erased and substituted with a more 'international' style of elaborate mayonnaise combos that are photogenic for spread on social media. And in a weekly newsletter I get about Spanish culture this was the latest topic: specifically how traditional Mallorcan restaurants are disappearing and being replaced by more generic 'Spanish' tourist-pleasers. As I've seen this happen in pretty much every city I've visited over the last decade (including Stockholm where I live now), I imagine it's a generalized phenomenon that will be hard or impossible to reverse. reply glitchc 2 hours agoparentPart of it stems from the fact that wholesalers, in addition to raw ingredients, also sell partially prepared pre-packaged meals to restaurants. A number of restaurants resort to this model, in particular major chains (Applebee's, IHop, Waffle House, etc.) as it means less kitchen staff to hire. This is at least very common in North America, where Sysco is the goliath and has cornered the market on this front. Perhaps the same thing is happening in Spain? reply Xcelerate 54 minutes agoparentprev> all food is beginning to taste the same This is the one that makes me sad. I lived in a variety of places while growing up (countries, states, etc). Different countries had very distinctive types of food in the 1990s. Living in the U.S., I still visit Europe quite frequently, and it seems like all food is converging toward sameness, and not in a good way. About a decade ago when my income began increasing I started going to Michelin star restaurants for the \"novelty\", but now that I've been to enough of them they all seem more similar to each other than different. It's much more challenging to find an authentic old restaurant in e.g., Lyon, that has quality food that hasn't changed over the decades (hint: these restaurants typically have ratings between 3.9 and 4.1 on Google — Americans tend to drag the score down because some aspect of the food or culture is unappealing to them, reinforcing the article's point). reply kykeonaut 8 hours agoparentprevit is not all bad :) look at latin america where colonization has erased a lot of the regional dishes. yet new combinations have arisen from a mix of pre-columbian and european dishes. tacos in mexico combining corn tortilla with cow and pork based fillings, or ceviche in peru are just a few examples of \"comida criolla\". right now, it might be a swing in the direction of sameism, but i assure you that eventually new dishes will arise. reply stringsandchars 7 hours agorootparent> right now, it might be a swing in the direction of sameism, but i assure you that eventually new dishes will arise. I do hope you're right, and I agree that there are some fusions that are quite exciting and add diversity to some cuisines that are otherwise quite bland and monotonous (Swedish food has definitely got a massive lift from introduced diversity, for instance). But what I've mostly seen so far, is convergence towards the vaguely 'international' and inoffensive. In this process, items like blood pudding (a sausage made mostly from blood and fat) or pork wrapped in cabbage with almonds and raisins get phased-out, in favor of homogenous crowd-pleasers that taste the same across Europe. reply d3VwsX 5 hours agorootparentSome nice things have been introduced to Sweden, definitely, but unfortunately also garlic+onion has gone completely out of control. For instance going to France or Greece or India, countries known for their garlic, and I assume most countries in the world, they still know to not ONLY serve food where the difference in taste is the ratio of garlic to onions. They do still have dishes that use other spices. I asked in a few restaurants in Sweden and they literally did not serve a single garlic-free dish. Swedes went from zero to \"old Nordic food is tasteless, so we should put as much garlic+onions as possible in everything to fix that\" in ~60 years, and much of that happened in my lifetime in this century. reply kilpikaarna 6 hours agorootparentprev> add diversity to some cuisines that are otherwise quite bland and monotonous (Swedish food has definitely got a massive lift from introduced diversity, for instance).

Historically the need to preserve food through the long winter, or even make scarce food appetizing during the summer, means that Nordic food has always been much more processed (salting, pickling, smoking, smothering with dill or mustard, and so on) than the much more fresh and unadulterated recipes of the Mediterranean, where fresh fish, fruit and vegetables have always been more plentiful, and a greater part of traditional recipes (together with the sausage and other 'winter' food I mentioned). I'm also sad to hear that you think my comment amounted to a \"lazy dig\". reply carlosjobim 6 hours agorootparentprevIf the subject is restaurant food, French style cooking is standard in all Nordic restaurants above the lowest level. Before it was introduced, I guess you had more like eateries with stew and porridge, or an oven baked chicken, smoked fish and such. The French techniques have really had a huge importance for Nordic cuisines. Combined with traditional Nordic ingredients, you get something truly excellent. It's a pity that the only food that gets international success is mostly pizza, burger, döner kebab and taco. If restaurants world wide started learning and integrating the French cuisine, they could make some great combinations with local traditions and also let local ingredients shine in a way that you can never do with a god damned burger or kebab. reply kykeonaut 6 hours agorootparentprevyou are right in the fact that some dishes will be phased out, but new dishes will spring up. they might not be the old ones, but that is the way of human evolution :) one example that springs up to mind is in dutch cuisine. take for example the \"kapsalon\" which is a mix of surinamese, dutch, and middleastern dishes. this is a new dish created in 2003 but which enjoys of massive popularity; you cannot find a snackbar in the netherlands that does not prepare kapsalon. reply 0xDEAFBEAD 7 hours agoparentprevMy first thought was that if I was a tourist in Mallorca, I'd much prefer an \"authentic\" traditional Mallorcan restaurant over a generic Spanish restaurant.

How many people have tried every single one? How many people have gotten tired of a substantial fraction of that 100+, and are seeking further novelty? Probably not very many. Mallorca is one of the most tourist-heavy parts of Spain. If I'm already tired of generic Spanish cuisine, I'm probably already going off the beaten path to less-visited parts of Spain, where the niche cuisines are incidentally still preserved.

I bet every medieval peasant's home looked the same, but the homes of the aristocracy were different and varied. Novelty is expensive and/or time consuming. The same is true in industrial design too. If you use common designs you can often build your product from off the shelf parts, reuse already deployed manufacturing processes, etc. A fully unique and novel design would require retooling, re-testing for things like product safety, etc. What we are seeing is perhaps a post-industrial, clean, technologically advanced peasantry. Of course my observation may be baloney... do all super rich peoples' homes look the same? What does Jeff Bezos' house look like?

Probably. The French revolution actors were inspired by his work, and the French revolution led to the declaration of the human rights, which states that all people are born free and equal. If you take this claim as universal, then your moral duty is to make it happen. So yes, do free people even if they believe their situation is fine. Perhaps for instance because they've been brainwashed into believing it is, or perhaps they don't even know what freedom is. Unfortunately countries/organizations/persons that claimed to do that too often also had ulterior motives. The phrase \"looking for freedom, we found slavery\" is interesting because if there's slavery, then there's a master. The master we are talking about is \"norm\" or \"convention\". The term \"slavery\" can be apt in some cases, but generally is excessive. \"Anticonformity\" was somewhat a dismissive word in my country up to some point, but I have not heard it in that way for while, which suggests that people accept more easily \"abnormal\" people. When you want your freedom and you can have it, then there's no slavery nor tyranny. reply nonrandomstring 3 hours agorootparentYou've inspired me today. It's odd that in almost all walks of life, freedom comes from non-conformity. In arts, and in science, \"progress\" is a movement away from wherever we are.

By design they limit options at the margins while enabling those in the middle of the mediocrity curve. Slavery is freedom. And thus, since time stops for no man or machine, systems invite their own inevitable destruction.

When selection is personal, you have a smaller set of choices and will respond to how things feel. If you're walking down a street looking at 3 restaurants, a surprising element in one might speak to you in a way you can't even explain. On the other hand, if you're just browsing in maps, you'll be going by ratings that reward a more generic notion of quality. That type of selection is algorithmic rather than personal. More parts of our lives have been algorithmized than even before, and we generally like this because selecting things is hard. But algorithmization can drive us toward local maxima, where the pleasantness of familiarity draws us away from selecting or creating something truly personal. Of course, it can also draw people into arcane and corrupt niches like conspiracy theories. The algorithmizations of physical spaces and social connections are probably the newest and most distressing. These realms used to be almost entirely localized; the idea you'd pick your friends or spouse by algorithm used to be rare and is now dominant.

I once heard that the 90s were the decade of references, and that might have just stuck a bit for too long: The boom of second-hand, mid-century furniture, the \"industrial\" look, rounded edged everywhere.

I feel while there has been an perceived increase in quality for each individual at first, all these things helped everything to converge into \"the average\" for everyone. We still see originality here and there, but you can just feel their competition against big budget productions.

The Frankfurt school in general deals with this problematic of Capitalism losing its revolutionary potential and becoming a stagnant, homogenous, unchanging system.

Disagree with Marx if you want but he did believe that capitalism, if left to run wild, would produce a new form of hypermobile, freely associating society, but when that gets close to happening in times of crisis a certain section of elite seize power for themselves and prevent the revolutionary social changes from occuring, thus producing this endless mediocrity. reply EarthBlues 4 minutes agoparentEven before them, in Guénon and Vico.

But as we become more efficient at building just the function of things, adding diverging flavor takes up a higher proportion of cost even if the cost of it itself absolutely stayed the same. I do think broadly we're probably oversaturated with the flavor of high definition and 'realness' in the mainstream. But I don't think this is the end of taste evolution. Recently I've been looking back on movie posters from past decades. I think movie posters and advertisements are decent to examine here as they play to the mass taste of their time. In isolation of their moment and market there was a uniformity in style, yet over time it still progresses despite keeping it's core features.

For example, laptops and the \"thin and light\" fad. I may have different needs from the average person, but why does nobody else have these needs? Am I the only autistic person on the planet, the only software developer on the planet, the only person on the planet who likes to be productive on a laptop? The only person on the planet who practically lives in their laptop? I think hopefully not, but this is like... probably under 1% of people. And you know, almost nobody caters to this niche because if you cater to the 99% (or more) instead, you make so much more money!

I, as a developer, really want \"thin and light\" laptop to make it as efforless as possible to carry it around and use anywhere. I've made the mistake of buying a heavy powerful one, and I basically never carry it around, because it's just too impractical. reply thom 10 hours agoparentprevWhat features are you seeking that aren’t available? There are many powerful, heavy laptops. There are many 16+ inch form factors. My current laptop has dual screens! I agree it can be frustrating when the mainstream focuses on things you don’t like, but that doesn’t always exclude the things you do.

There are many powerful, heavy laptops. There are many 16+ inch form factors. My current laptop has dual screens! Sure, there are many powerful, heavy laptops. Almost none with a HiDPI screen, though. And almost none that lack a numpad (and off-center trackpad). And almost none with half-height arrow keys, even among the ones without numpad. To find one with all three of those? You may as well not even try. I have more requirements, but nobody really cares even about the most basic ones, so there's no point in hoping for the more complex ones. Even among laptops with 4K screens they're bound to have \"full-size\" keyboards with a numpad. If no numpad, the arrow keys are still likely to be full-size, and there are probably dedicated Home/End/PgUp/PgDn buttons, which are always stupid compared to putting them into Fn+Arrows. I get it, portable workstations are designed to be desktops in a laptop form factor. They're not designed to be laptops. But maybe something out there should be. Maybe there should be even a single laptop on the planet that is actually designed like a premium laptop, with workstation-class power inside. There probably won't be, though - far more likely for everybody to tell me my expectations are completely unrealistic. (It'll happen any second now, probably.) > I agree it can be frustrating when the mainstream focuses on things you don’t like, but that doesn’t always exclude the things you do. The Framework Laptop 16 is one of the first Windows laptops I have ever seen that checks many of those boxes, but unfortunately it's still thin and light (and also AMD). I recently got a Apple 16\" MacBook Pro and it's okay. Really many of my requirements were inherited from the Mid-2015 MBP being possibly the best machine I'd ever used, but then Apple became terrible for a while, and nobody else (not even Razer) did a good job of replicating what I liked about that machine. reply nottorp 3 hours agorootparentWait.

For you to think in computing, for the performance of your computer to be central to the performance of your thought. Access to powerful computers has shaped the way I think and work to the point where I practically live online. I'm not a hacker in the traditional sense, but the computer is my world, the internet is my home. Not in the shallow, social-media sense, like today's \"influencers\", but in a deep fundamental way. I don't even identify with humanity; being online allowed me to create my ideal self from scratch. There are so many niches here I don't even know how to start listing them all. I am a unique type of person. I have not yet found even a single other person like me in this way. I have found a total of two other people who share my neurotype but none that share my attitude. That is how lonely it is. Sure looking for certain things in a laptop is not necessarily autistic. But think of the reasons why people would look for these things. Normal people don't care as long as it works and is good enough for them. Because I live on this computer, every detail of how it works needs to be right. I need something that is perfect for me. I need a perfect screen, perfect keyboard, and high performance, all at the same time. Every machine with that perfect screen and perfect keyboard tends to get it mixed up with being \"thin and light\" and all that performance goes away. I hate that. I can get used to some deviation. A lot of my preferences are simply resistance to change. But a lot of them are because I've tried anything else (possibly for years) and I hated it. There are things that I genuinely consider better and they're practically not available in a package that works for me. reply tayo42 11 hours agoprevIve never stayed in an airbnb that looked like any of those. Ive heard of this phenomenon but never experienced it. In the last few years ive been in airbnbs in Italy, hawaii, puerto rico, colorado, el salvador and none look like that style. Some of this article seems to be about trends, which we always had? They come and go don't they? No ones doing barn doors anymore are they? reply armchairhacker 10 hours agoprevThere's something profound in that people like almost average, but don't like average. There are two ways this is true: categorization and imperfection. Everything subjective has genres, then sub-genres, that a smaller group of people like, down to the individual. If something is very popular and/or mainstream in its sub-genre it becomes popular in its genre, and if very popular and/or mainstream in its genre becomes popular mainstream. Everything subjective has \"guidelines\" it must follow in order to be popular, and the genres and sub-genres have further guidelines. But it can't follow every guideline or it won't be popular. At minimum people become desensitized, also some stated \"guidelines\" are wrong and the inherent \"guideline\" is different, because people don't completely know what they like. Because people don't completely know what they like, there are also \"rare guidelines\" that nobody follows or states but would create something especially popular, and rare guidelines create new genres. For example, music. Almost every song (even non-traditional) has these common components: 12-tone equal temperament, simple time signature, \"melody\" \"harmony\" and \"rhythm\", etc.. Jazz, rock, electronic, etc. and have their own guidelines. Perhaps jazz was created because jazz chords used to be a rare guideline. But no song, even pop music, follows 100% of the guidelines. At minimum, instruments don't produce pure sine/square/triangle waves, melody has accents or modulation, etc. And the most popular songs do something novel (either completely novel, or they take something novel from a less-popular song and do better in other areas). So how does this relate to the age of average? People know what I said above. AirBnB hosts, directors, etc. whose art is a business know the guidelines, both reported from others and inherently. But they don't know everything, and in particular, they either don't know how to break the guidelines in order to create something better, or they do know a way but don't believe it will work. So in order to create something that is the most likely to be the most popular, they follow the guidelines. What they create is at a local maxima, OK but bland, because it fits nobody's niche genres and there is no imperfection. Over time, it becomes less OK and more bland because everyone else follows the same guidelines, until some trend-setter reveals new guidelines that break the old ones and are more popular, then everyone follows those. In order to be more successful than \"OK\" you have to know how to break the guidelines and follow rare ones, and the less other people who know the rare guidelines the more you'll be successful. But this requires 1) rare knowledge and 2) risk. If everyone broke more guidelines, the world would be better, because to any individual, even though there would be more ugly AirBnBs and movies, there would be a few that are better than those we have today. And anyone who followed all the guidelines would create something that nobody wants, because although if you averaged everyone's ratings it would rate the highest, it would always be below first place. But since most people are following most of the guidelines, if one person breaks them, they get a few happy customers and less customers overall, so they give up or go out of business. The former system, where everyone is following different guidelines, exists when people first discover an entirely new genre, and don't even know what the common guidelines are. But it transitions into the latter system, because every time someone discovers a rare guideline that captures enough of the market, the option that captures the most of the market is to follow the remaining common guidelines. We as a society can transition back into the former system and would remain until someone discovers a new rare guideline, but that takes cooperation which we don't have. reply rob_c 7 hours agoprevSorry to call it out but this is such a strong valley centric view of things as to be painful.

The most efficient way to optimize is to homologate. Funnily enough that’s an endgame that resembles closely what realist socialism would impose from the start, in order to distribute equally (whereas in capitalism this also led to increasing inequality). Globalized capitalism now resembles a lossy compression algorithm applied to the world. That said, the one shown by this article is also a very, very Western view of this issue. A stroll through Asian smaller places and you’ll see the difference popping up. There are also interesting Western holdouts, where usually tradition still defies optimization. Italy is a good example of that. Edit: every time I mention a critique of capitalism on this forum it gets absolutely zero traction and even downvoted.

Why is this the reaction, instead of maybe even telling me why this analysis is completely worthless or wrong in a proper argumented comment? I'll break the silence to give you at least my view on it. I find the \"blame it on the capitalism\" rhetoritc somewhat annoying, to be fair. It sounds like an escape hatch you can always invoke, and since we don't really have a significant example of a non-capitalist society, it's unfalsifiable. It often seems to me, that people use this argument as psychological escapism - a simple solution to a complex problem. Specifically, I see the \"capitalism is bad\" argument often used on examples that are not really specific to capitalism and are instead a result of some general principles. For example, it seems to me that this article just describes preferential attachment process (rich get richer) in various fields.Another common one is multipolar trap (or tragedy of the commons or collective action problem). Those things tend to happen absolutely everywhere, because the conditions for them are very simple to satisfy. We shouldn't be suprised to see them in capitalism, and we should expect them to arise in different forms in practically every system. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

Assuming that to be true, that is where I'd expect to see a lot of social sciences research to be carried out. Some disciplines in the social sciences in recent years have taken a pretty hard turn towards qualitative methods and epistemologies that are either misaligned with or explicitly reject the scientific method. I think dropping funding for social sciences is a mistake, but at the same time (and I'm tipping my hand a bit here), the social sciences might benefit from a renewed emphasis on methods that can result in generalizable findings. I've read some case study / qualitative papers in recent years that, uh, do not give me the strong impression that some parts of the academy are serious stewards of the funding society entrusts to them. In short, I think a correction is warranted, but I hate to see it happen as part of a charged ideological / political process. reply bb86754 4 hours agoparentAgreed. But I don’t think economics is off the hook here either. To me it’s the social science that best masquerades as a “hard” science while still make huge jumps in logic that are rarely justified in the papers I’ve read. reply peatmoss 3 hours agorootparentI studiously avoided making a normative statement that economics should take over this role. Any personal preferences I have here are separate from my beliefs about what I predict to happen. :-) I ~agree with you about the quality of econ papers. In some cases, I see the quantitative facility of econ papers as being better than similar studies executed by e.g. sociologists. But in some cases, flashy quant skills are used to distract from more fundamental issues. Assuming my prediction that social science research shifts to econ comes to pass, I think the natural pressure will be to drag econ's present quality bar downward. reply UweSchmidt 2 hours agorootparentprevWhile we're bashing economics, something I truly miss is that no new high level economic systems are being discussed prominently. As important as fusion in physics or cancer treatment in medicine, we badly need to explore and discuss something beyond the heavily ideologized systems of capitalism, communism and feed this to politics to communicate these potential options to the voters. Say, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism, which is old and half forgotten. It appears as economics is kind of muted, students and professors beholden to an ideology themselves or feeling the need to appease potential employers who are usually politicized institutions with no room for intellectual curiosity. What else remains in terms of practical economics besides determining the inflation rate (oops, that one is also politicized)? reply amelius 2 hours agorootparentYes economic system is highly flawed. Elon Musk owns $400B. Earth will become uninhabitable after 1 billion years from now (when the heat of the Sun becomes too large for us). This means that Musk, if he lived that long, would be able to spend $400 every day until the death of all life on Earth. This is 15 times the current average daily income worldwide. If this is not insane, then what is? reply kiba 57 minutes agorootparentI think access to that much capital as assess to strategic resource, not as wealth for individuals. At that level of wealth, it doesn't make sense to think about fancy cars and mansions and living an extravagant and luxurious lifestyle. At that point, you got it made. However, if you're talking about building something meaningful, that's a different matter entirely. That requires far more capitals than what is required to sustain a person indefinitely. There are shows that I would love to revive and reboot, such as Stargate. There are researches I want to do or fund, such as research into 3D printing, or do long term research grants so that people can do meaningful work. The money's not for living. It's for projects.

If you ask people this, the off-the-cusp estimates are usually something like a thousand years, a century, some huge number like that... reply kiba 52 minutes agorootparentPretty sure it's not going to be 300 billion dollars if you try to cash it out. reply JohnCClarke 14 minutes agorootparentprevthat's a thousand dollars each Even in this populist age, math still counts. reply lupusreal 0 minutes agorootparentIt was an illustrative example of the way people botch this sort of math problem. Steve Mould has a video about it IIRC. hnbad 1 hour agorootparentprevSure but those hypotheticals are just poorly thought out ways to visualize the imbalance. Another way to do it would be saying \"Jeff Bezos has 300 billion dollars, that is 300 thousand millions. There are 300 million people in America, so $1000 has been taken out of every American's share of the national wealth and reserved exclusively for Jeff Bezos\". Repeat that for every billionaire in the US and you should be able to demonstrate quite the imbalance. Of course that assumes you think Earth's and society's (or at least the US's and Americans') resources should exist for all humans (or Americans) and the ideal balance would be based on as little as one needs and as much as one can contribute, i.e. literally how early human communities operated and how human communities still often operate outside economical contexts (e.g. after a natural disaster). You can say that model doesn't scale but I don't see a good argument for why that should be a reason to use a completely different model unless you're literally among the few people it disproportionately benefits (if you ignore how ruinous it usually is to them too at a human and interpersonal level because of how much it alienates them from almost anyone else around them). reply naming_the_user 40 minutes agorootparentThat’s also misusing maths though because Amazon is a global company so really you should divide by 8 billion or at least a couple of billion. As a Brit I think I’ve derived significantly more than $1000 in value through Amazon’s existence as compared with the status quo beforehand, and that’s exclusively counting the shopping part and not anything else they do. You can ask the question about whether it would have happened anyway in a communist paradise or whether Bezos gets the correct percentage of the reward but I mean, it actually is a very useful thing. Similarly with Apple and Google and so on. These companies make things that people for the most part choose to use. reply d3ckard 2 hours agorootparentprevExcept he does not.

Just because an orderly liquidation would take some time does not mean it would be impossible for him to sell. As a case in point, when he decided to invest in twitter, he was able to use his wealth pretty easily. reply Cpoll 1 hour agorootparentHe can only share his shares and assets at 400B if the market thinks they're worth 400B, and if there are enough buyers for all 400B. And once he starts selling, the market might re-evaluate the worth of the shares. Isn't Twitter a good counterpoint? I vaguely recall Musk had a hard time liquidating shares to buy it? reply pyrale 31 minutes agorootparentThat is the meaning of what I call orderly liquidation. Sales are usually structured in order not to crash the market. That being said, just because you need to structure a big sale does not mean it can not be done, or that you can not leverage your asset to have cash available at short notice. For instance, a loan with your actions as collateral will let you structure your divestment over years for a very moderate price. Again, what I’m describing is not science fiction, it’s litterally what happened with twitter. Imo it would be a harder challenge to find valuable stuff to buy than to divest orderly. > Isn't Twitter a good counterpoint? I vaguely recall Musk had a hard time liquidating shares to buy it? From what I remember, the issue was more along the lines of him making an offer without thinking it would be accepted, and then be under the gun because he was not prepared. Even then, he eventually found a reasonable financing scheme. reply JAlexoid 52 minutes agorootparentprevI'm pretty sure that he didn't liquidate $50bn in stock to get the money for buying twitter. (That $50bn includes the 20% capital gains tax, that leaves $40bn in cash) reply pyrale 26 minutes agorootparentYeah, that is my point: you don’t need to fire-sell to get fast cash, you can just use your capital as collateral. reply efitz 34 minutes agorootparentprevThis is not true and is a very common misunderstanding of modern wealth. Elon Musk owns hundreds of billions worth of stock. First, the value of those stocks varies from day to day. He can gain or lose billions of dollars in \"net worth\" on any given business day. Second, he is not free to sell that stock however and whenever he wants; he has to get approval from the boards of his various companies and is limited in the timing and amounts he can sell. Additionally, selling large amounts of stock causes the price to drop, AND dilutes his ownership in, and therefore control of, those companies. I think a lot of people have this stupid idea of Scrooge McDuck swimming in pool of cash, when they think about billionaires. That's not how it works, for most billionaires (I'm not sure about middle eastern oil royalty). In reality, businessman billionaires have most of their wealth in stock, and it is not liquid, and they borrow against the stock (i.e. use the stock as collateral for personal loans) and sell small percentages of it to finance their lifestyles. If you created a company, and it became wildly successful, and it was publicly traded, who should \"own\" the company? Should you be forced to divest, and therefore cede control to people who had no involvement in the company's initial success? Is that good for founders or for companies? How does it benefit society? Also note that profitability influences stock price, so taking away control from the people who made a company profitable, has a high likelihood of making the company less profitable, which in turn will almost certainly result in each stockholder becoming poorer. Remember that most stockholders aren't Elon Musks, they're John Q.

If you had Elon's brilliance you'd probably quit after you made $5 million dollars or so and definitely after you sold Zip2 back in the 1990s and spent the rest of your life on the beach. The only reason he's still working as hard as he does is not because he wants to spend that on himself. He wants the glory of going to Mars and having a positive impact on humanity and that requires control of the activities of large companies like SpaceX, etc. which requires ownership stakes in those companies that are valued in the billions. One of the reasons that he campaigned so hard for Trump is that Kamala's proposed wealth taxes on unrealized capital gains were going to take his companies from him and he'd have to sell to Vanguard or Blackrock, who would give control of the companies to Boeing-tier mediocrity which would mean that we'd never get to Mars. There have been so many companies where the founders sold out and retired because they had enough money and they got bought by big conglomerates who destroyed those companies with mediocre management and neglect. This is the great thing about Elon, he just keeps building and leveraging all that money to create bigger and bigger companies using his creativity and management ability to achieve his goal of launching an era of space exploration. reply macintux 1 hour agorootparentThat is a wildly generous interpretation of his behavior and motivations. reply fdschoeneman 1 hour agorootparentIt's the most likely interpretation toe because it fits the known facts.

SpaceX is impressive, and I'm a big fan of NASA's research, but let's look past the marketing of him trying to save the human species or whatever. I do think humanity may have to settle another world (or move to a post-biological existence where we can just park our satellite brains around a star for energy), but this is going to take a lot of scientific advancement over many centuries. Elon's plan would make a lot more sense if Mars was an Earth 2.0 and we just needed to move a bunch of people there, but it's not and even if we do find something really close to Earth with JWST, it would take centuries to get there.

Is there such a thing as an unideological economist? reply orange_joe 3 hours agorootparentI think your idea of economics is more informed by online debate than actual research. Contemporary economists mostly try to articulate things through econometrics, which is a fairly data driven field. It’s fair if you have issues with the rigor of these studies but a discussion of schools is fairly off base from my experience. reply thefaux 3 hours agorootparentMy objection is to the idea that everything true and important can be captured in metrics and quantitatively modeled. Then there is the fact that even to the extent that things like macroeconomics can be modeled (which is never at a level of accuracy that would be accepted in any scientific discipline), it still often fails to capture the social/political dynamics of the moment such that the theory matches felt experience. I believe that economics has largely captured power in social science by essentially stealing scientific authority and falsely claiming it as their own. Then they dismiss other fields of social inquiry as soft and unworthy of equal status even though their own insights are often of lesser value than the supposedly soft social sciences. reply peatmoss 3 hours agorootparentI'm an acolyte in the church of bounded rationality and the fallibility of institutions that practice science. I studied journalism as an undergraduate, and my beliefs here are like in journalism. Objectivity is impossible, like a Platonic ideal. But, it's an excellent thing to strive for. \"Fuck it, it's impossible\" is the wrong answer in my opinion. Qualitative methods and pure theory scholarship have their place, but most useful qualitative research at least hints at some testable hypotheses. I feel that an underemphasis on generalizability is what happens when disciplines give up. And at worse, theory-based scholarship as it's applied in some social sciences is really no better than really obtusely worded political punditry. reply klabb3 2 hours agorootparentExact numbers are easy to measure but not the only way to measure something. Data-driven is the new statistics but 10x worse because it has more sources of obfuscation, and bean counters (including super “smart” and analytically minded) obsess narrowly over models. Add ML/AI and you got an order of magnitude again. There’s an impedance mismatch where we have enormous amounts of useless data and a small amount of useful data. Best we can do is use and create more of the useful data instead of obsessing over P>.99 on something useless that will be misinterpreted anyway. The problem, in my view, isn’t qualitative per se, but rather unfalsifiability. Ideology is when the solution is always more of the same no matter what the outcome is. Communism/socialism and neoliberalism all fall in this category. I believe this holds true if you go more academic into Keynesianism and say Chicago school - models that have become truisms to their followers. reply LargeWu 3 hours agorootparentprevCorrect. A graduate degree in economics is much closer to an applied math degree than something that resembles what we would traditionally consider social sciences. reply lordnacho 3 hours agorootparentTo me it seemed like there were two kinds of economics degrees. One was a math degree pretending to be about the economy. At the graduate level, it could be a science: actually going out and measuring things with some pretty hardcore tools, and then publishing a theory that nobody who ought to use it (AKA politicians) would ever be able to understand. There's real findings here on stuff like the minimum wage, which you'd think someone would care about. It could also be just some extremely complicated derivations that pretended they were related to the real world, but with ridiculously mathematical assumptions. The other was a softie-softie \"talk about how the world works\" degree with barely any mathematics, just lots of readings and essays. You could choose what you wanted to do.

But it’s not like physics It’s conclusions are often catastrophically wrong because all the mathematics relies on shaky qualitative assumptions: people are perfectly rational, etc. For example we have published economic research that forecasts that severe climate change will only damage global GDP by 1%. They conclude that farming productivity will be reduced by 25% and farming is 4% of global GDP, so it’s 1%. Then they model some effect on the consumer because food prices go up. It does not occur to the authors to model impact of physical result of that, which is, famine and political instability that comes with it. reply confidantlake 53 minutes agorootparentIt is not just that they are wrong, they are intentionally wrong.

So now things like History, Literature and many STEM subjects feel completely ungrounded.

Also, ROI is the wrong frame to use for government activity. If something has significant short-term ROI, then normal commercial capital's a good match.

There are few environments that provide the right combination of time, close involvement of experts and peers, the latitude to direct your research in a way that you find interesting and useful within the larger constraints of a project, the positive and negative feedback systems, the financial resources from grant funding, etc. The negative feedback loops are particularly hard to set up by yourself. At some point if you're going to be at the researcher level (construed broadly), you need help from others in developing sufficient dept, rigor and self-criticality. Others can poke holes in your thoughts with an ease that you probably can't muster on your own initially; after you've been through this a number of times you learn your weaknesses and can go through the process more easily. Similarly, the process of preparing for comprehensive exams in a PhD (or medical boards or whatever) is extremely helpful, but not something most people would do by themselves--the motivation to know a field very broadly and deeply, so you can explain all of this on the spot in front of 5 inquisitors, is given a big boost by the consequences of failure, which are not present in the local library. The time is also a hard part. There are relatively few people with the resources to devote most of their time for learning outside of the classroom. I spent approximately 12,000 hours on my PhD (yes some fraction of that was looking at failblog while hungover etc. but not much). You could string that along at 10 hours a week, 50 weeks a year, which is a 'serious hobby', but it would take you 24 years. How much of the first year are you going to remember 24 years later?

Will Hunting had book smarts but required significant effort from several people to get him to the point where he was ready to meaningfully apply his intelligence. I've hired a handful of folks who learned solely by self-study and while none of them required the level of support Will did, they all took significantly more effort to get to the point where they contributed productively than hires who attended university or had previously collaborated with experts.

Which is exactly why I ended up hiring a tutor. Philosophy in specific is one long argument, 2500 years of new people showing up and saying, \"Well that guy's wrong and I'm right.\" So much of what I needed to know to make sense of philosophical arguments is either hugely scattered or not written down at all.

On to Deluze: A body without organs is an excellent frame through which to understand a modern corporation (dendritic) or a hippie commune (ideally rhizomatic). That’s the point — it’s an organization operating without biological structures. Is this useful? Well, the primary goal of any organism is to continue existing… Biopolitics is how politics affect biology: abortion and forced sterilization and healthcare.

These frameworks can be anywhere from fully explanatory to having no value at all for a given scenario, but their importance is through their engagement — and refutation is equally as important!

It would be better to have fewer scientists with adequate and consistent funding, than lots of underemployed scientists fighting for funding and living under constant uncertainty. Scrapping all support for any particular branch of science is an overreaction, but cutting number of graduates in these fields and focusing funding only on the studies with most practical benefits could make sense. As an example, social scientist studying poverty, unemployment or crime could produce useful information for policymakers to reduce these phenomena, and cutting all funding from such research is probably a bad idea. reply lolinder 5 hours agoparent> too many graduates from certain social sciences and humanities compared to the actual need of employers / academia. The real problem is that college was never designed to be job preparation and (with limited exceptions) it does rather poorly at that. The idea was never that you'd go to college to research a subject at the bachelor level and then go into a career that directly uses what you learned—it wasn't always a white collar trade school. Back when college was the privilege of the elite, it was about learning for learning's sake and about making connections and meeting people. It didn't especially matter what subject you chose to learn about—you're a member of the elite after all, and you either have money already or have the family connections to get it whatever you studied. It seems to have only been once college started to democratize that we started expecting every subject to be job prep for something specific. On one level this makes sense—you can't actually democratize the experience of learning for learning's sake alone until you democratize being guaranteed sufficient money to live on. But only a few departments in most universities are even capable of reshaping themselves into job training programs, leaving the rest to now frantically justify their existence. This is a huge problem because the knowledge produced by those departments—even while they were only the privilege of the elite—has been invaluable. But they don't meet the modern economics of the university. reply confidantlake 1 hour agorootparentColleges started out as vocational schools for priests. For much of American history colleges were places for farmers or engineers to learn their crafts. For my entire lifetime colleges were places you went to prepare you for a career.

I'm guessing you are basing this claim on the Morrill Act, which was to \"provide colleges for the benefit of agriculture and the Mechanic arts.\"[0] It certainly doesn't describe the earlier American colleges like Harvard, Princeton, Yale, King's College (later Columbia), etc. But even the state colleges that were founded with the help of the Morrill Act typically had loftier ambitions than acting as craft schools. e.g. from the inaugural speech of the founding of the University of California: \"The University is the most comprehensive term which can be employed to indicate a foundation for the promotion at diffusion of knowledge--a group of agencies organized to advance the arts and sciences of every sort, and to train young men as scholars for all the intellectual callings of life.\" [1] But surely schools like Texas Agricultural and Mechanical were founded from the beginning with a focus on those practical skills? Nope: \"Despite its name, the college taught no classes in agriculture, instead concentrating on classical studies, languages, literature, and applied mathematics.\" [2] [0]: https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/morrill-act [1]: https://oac.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb267nb0qk&brand=oac4&doc.v...

As college attendance rates went higher and higher the job preparation need became the primary one the school is serving, which changed the economics in a way that simply having a few job preparation programs didn't. reply maxerickson 5 hours agorootparentprevThe US state college system was pretty much never for elites, it was always about increasing the capacity of the country. reply bluGill 4 hours agorootparentThe US is a young country for this discussion.

I can believe that it was put together with the intention of strengthening the new country and building up institutions that it felt it needed, but that's not at all the same thing as being not for the elite (at the time of the founding of the first state schools we still had property requirements to vote!), much less that they conceived of it as job training. For a primary source on how they conceptualized the role of the university, see the charter for the University of Georgia (1785) [0]. It essentially says that universities are really important and it would be unacceptable to have to send youths to foreign countries, so we're starting one here.

Academic outcomes are nonlinear. Outside of the job-training-ified fields like engineering, there is seldom a direct \"I studied X and then made a ton of money doing exactly that\". The success stories, like Tolkien, are more like, \"I studied X, then I lost a finger in the great war, then I typed up a manuscript of a children's fairy tale, fast forward 100 years and it's worth untold millions.\" It is a winding road.

You can't replace the depth of consideration and knowledge needed to write an academic paper with hosting a podcast or self-publishing a book. Writing for an audience of leading experts is inherently different from writing for consumption by non-experts. And you can't just equate societal value with \"how many people consume it\".

The esoterism is due to the fact that there is a body of research that you need to know to understand the new research. Just because you can't understand the topic in a short sound bite does not mean it is not worth researching. Not all of the research is intended to be consumed by a lay public either. Many podcasts and Patreon exclusives are behind paywalls and there is no expectation of peer-review.

If we're making the claim that these things should be funded by the state, and that they're important for a happy society, then those claims should be backed up by some fairly strong evidence. reply derbOac 2 hours agorootparentSo, the problem with these types of arguments is the evidence is often obscured by shell games with labels, or ignoring the elephant in the room. My research sort of straddles statistics, epidemiology, neurogenetics, and social sciences, and my impression is there's a great deal of stuff that doesn't become interesting to people until it involves social sciences. I say this from the perspective of someone who often wants the math and whatnot to be more appealing to people when it's not. You can take some model, or method, or advance, and if it sits somewhere in a wetlab or physics building, no one cares. But if you make it about relationships, or money, or happiness, or children's social development, it becomes interesting. The value is so built into the fabric of these things we don't even recognize it half the time. It becomes another physics grant, or engineering grant, or medicine grant. They're social science in nature, but god forbid you call it that because it's seen as soft or irrelevant even though that's the thing people are actually most interested in. People don't give a damn about memory models in bare-metal programming, or electrical engineering, but they do care about being able to talk to their relatives on the other side of the globe. The other thing that always strikes me as odd about these discussions and decisions is we as people are, well social beings. So do you want to leave the study of our social behavior and experiences to ... what exactly? Religious theory? Astrology? What else is there than scientific study of psychosocial phenomena? Are you saying that social phenomena shouldn't be studied at all? That it should be studied nonscientifically? Within the social sciences there's a well-known phenomenon of people coming in from elsewhere and thinking they can solve all the problems because they're physicists, or chemists, or whatever, and that you can just slap whatever paradigm works in that to study psychological or socioeconomic phenomena. It's seen as naive, and it inevitably fails because it doesn't scale up to the population level, or doesn't address the difficulties of the real-world phenomenon as it is, or whatever. There's also the problem that some of the biggest contributions of social science aren't what people think they are. Modern meta-analysis and preregistered replication research both came from psychological research for example (meta-analysis from clinical and educational psychology), and I doubt people realize that. But it's widespread in biomedical research, and should probably be applied more widely in many other fields. In certain ways it's more scientifically rigorous than what happens in a lot of biophysical science. But it goes against the stereotype of what \"psychosocial research\" is. reply demarq 10 hours agorootparentprevSo how do you get that evidence? reply gonzobonzo 10 hours agorootparentShouldn't this be asked of someone making the claim, and not of someone who says that the claims should be backed up by evidence? If someone claims that Apple cider vinegar cures cancer, they should be the ones providing the evidence. You shouldn't be asking people who didn't make the claim how to find evidence for it. Though after decades of funding the social sciences I would have hoped that someone would have looked into whether or not they're actually accomplishing anything. If not, it would speak volumes. reply ashwoods 9 hours agorootparentI think you didn’t get the question. If we were to seek that evidence, who would turn to? reply amarcheschi 4 hours agorootparentEconomist! /s reply notxpert14827 9 hours agorootparentprevI think you’re missing their very good point. ”Social science” is how you get the evidence. reply gonzobonzo 9 hours agorootparentAs I mentioned previously, if after decades of funding social science we don't have an answer to that, then it's simply incorrect to claim that continuing to fund social science is going to give us an answer. If you want to argue that we should put into funding a specific project to look into the benefits of social science, you can do that. But saying that we should do widespread funding of a discipline in order to find out if a discipline is actually worth it, and then after decades of doing widespread funding of that discipline you say \"well, I don't have any evidence that it's worth it, because you have to keep finding it to find the evidence,\" is, to be frank, bizarre. Imagine if we did this for other fields. We putting funding into homeopathy for decades. Someone comes along and makes the claim that we need to continue doing this, in order for society to be healthy. Someone asks what the evidence for this is, and the reply is \"we have to keep funding homeopathy to get the evidence!\" reply benterix 6 hours agorootparentThe difference being for homeopathy we actually do have the research priving it's a scam whereas for social studies we only have the research showing that some proiminet studies are a scam (or are unpreplicatable for other reasons). That's a far cry from \"social studies are proved not to benefit society at all\" and cutting all funding for them. reply robertlagrant 4 hours agorootparentWell, we don't have studies proving it's a scam. We have papers that show that specific homeopathic remedies don't work. That doesn't disprove homeopathy in general. So - we should fund it until funding it is fully disproven from all angles? reply notxpert14827 8 hours agorootparentprevThere are many questions we may want to ask about society. For example, \"Does funding social sciences make a society happier?\" is one of them. Social sciences give us the general capability to ask those questions and understand the answers. Whether you see value in that is of course up to you. (I never said, claimed or argued any of the things you mention in your reply, so I'm not addressing those points) reply confidantlake 1 hour agorootparentWhere is the evidence that social sciences give us the capability to ask those questions and understand those answers? I would argue that only I have that ability and instead you should direct that money towards me. reply hebocon 5 hours agorootparentprevI think you're both still talking past one another. > Social sciences give us the general capability to ask those questions and understand the answers. This is almost tautological depending on where those fields lie between physics and philosophy. Chemistry is just applied Physics. Biology is just applied Chemistry. Neurology is just applied biology. But psychology (and by extension, sociology) is firmly on the Philosophy side of the fence in my uneducated opinion. reply mike_hearn 9 hours agorootparentprevWell, you could ignore the naysayers and divert hundreds of billions of dollars into funding a vast social science apparatus for decades, and then see if the results have clearly made people happier in ways that couldn't have been done without the state. Which is what has been done, and why NZ is defunding it. reply camillomiller 10 hours agorootparentprevI'm absolutely not for these cuts, and I believe that social sciences are important. Nonetheless, the politicization and radicalization of social sciences in the last 15 years is undeniably problematic, and plays a role in the balcanization of society. Academic detachment from reality is a problem even smart academics can joke about, as they know it is somewhat of a true trope. The ones that certainly laugh about that the least are a lot of social scientists, in my experience. They are also often very far from considering the complexity of economics in their fields of studies, and that's also an issue. Sprinkle some identity politics dust on it, and you have the perfect recipe for disaster, offering conservatives and anti-progressists your academic head on a silver platter. I believe that social sciences (yep, it's a generalization, I know...) have failed to play academic politics properly in the last two decades, mostly due to radicalization of ideas and topics. reply thinkingemote 9 hours agorootparentThe irony is that it's the same non-academic organisations that are deciding those topics to get funded and who now are deciding to cut the funding. Academics have to apply for funding and one big criteria over the years has been it's \"social impact\". So there's three things. The politics of those in charge of funding. The change of academia to only allow research deemed socially useful (utilitarianism). And the third is the co-adoption of researchers themselves. As politics change the response should be to change the criteria and agenda of funding to make it less radical not to cut the funding. Furthermore these organisations have, over the years enlarged and entrenched themselves. This is why millions are spent on thousands of people to monitor DEI of the academics. reply mike_hearn 9 hours agorootparentImplicit in the request for research with social impact was that it should be positive social impact, as perceived by most people not just one partisan wing. > As politics change the response should be to change the criteria and agenda of funding to make it less radical If it were that easy it'd have been done already. You can't tell radical activists to just be reasonable. reply gilleain 9 hours agorootparentprevNot particularly important, but it is 'balkanization' with a k. reply dragonwriter 13 hours agoparentprev> social science (which isn’t a science) This",

    "title": "Carta is making it too difficult to cancel subscriptions, some founders say",
    "originLink": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/12/carta-is-making-it-too-difficult-to-cancel-subscriptions-some-founders-say/",
    "originBody": "Running a startup can be expensive, requiring a multitude of different subscriptions. Cap table management software, which helps founders organize their funding, can cost thousands of dollars a year. San Francisco-based Carta is the market leader in this industry. But some startup founders say Carta is making it too hard to cancel their subscriptions. The issue first surfaced on X after founder Sudarshan Sridharan of Pipeline posted about his struggles trying to cancel, writing, “I’m speechless at how anti-founder @cartainc is. They make it impossible to cancel your subscription or speak to a human support agent.” Carta required a “cancellation request” meeting with a customer success manager to end his subscription, he wrote. But slots were only available starting December 26, well past his December 17 renewal date, the founder posted: Adam Ryan, the CEO of startup Workweek, also posted about only being able to schedule a cancellation request well past his renewal date. “A calendar pops up after you check a box to cancel. The next available date is 26 of December. Our renewal date is [December] 17,” Ryan told TechCrunch. “I never completed the process. I just emailed them and told Amex it’s not approved and showed the screenshots so they can deny the vendor.” Carta told TechCrunch these issues booking a meeting to cancel were due to a “one-time staffing challenge.” “This was a one-time staffing challenge that resulted in a calendar availability issue that is currently getting addressed,” a Carta spokesperson said. “Customers who need support during this time can connect with our live Support Team via chat or phone during extended business hours.” But several of Carta’s competitors told TechCrunch that they don’t require meetings to cancel service. “Customers can fully cancel their subscription directly in the software by clicking a few buttons or by sending us an email,” said AngelList’s Sumukh Sridhara, the Founder Products lead. “In my opinion, there is no good reason for a cap table vendor to force you to get on a call.” Pulley, another competitor, said the same thing. “At Pulley, our cancellation process is straightforward. Customers can cancel their subscription by emailing support@pulley.com. There is no requirement to book an appointment or attend a cancellation meeting (that is not a standard industry practice),” Alison Gonzalez, VP of marketing at Pulley, said. “The cancellation request is processed upon receipt of the email, and we handle these requests as quickly as possible to ensure customers can cancel before their renewal dates.” Requiring these types of meetings runs the risk of staffing shortages delaying when a founder can cancel. In a video on Carta’s website, such meetings are shown as available the next day. But two screenshots shared by founders show such appointments as only being available in 17 days’ time for this month. Another screenshot shared exclusively with TechCrunch shows a meeting about renewal pricing (not cancelling) being available only at one highly inconvenient time this month: 6:00 a.m. on the day after Christmas, December 26. Carta says its appointments system is made to ensure its customers fully understand the process and migrate securities data as smoothly as possible. “We offer appointments to ensure our customers have a clear understanding of the cancellation process, best practices to mitigate impact on their shareholders and investors, and initiate for the secure and proper transfer of securities data (as customers lose Carta platform access once they no longer contract with Carta for services),” it told TechCrunch. “We understand that some customers might prefer a less tailored approach. As such, we are always open to feedback and will take feedback into account going forward.” Carta also said that its equity administration is “not solely a SaaS product” and as an SEC transfer agent, there are “different steps required than for a typical SaaS company.” But Pulley, which doesn’t use cancellation appointments, is also an SEC transfer agent, according to its own website. Lots of founders still use Carta, and the original viral post has comments from people praising the company’s product. “We switched from Carta to Diligent to try to reduce cost and it was a disaster. Switched back to Carta and will never leave again. It’s a 100x better product and keeps getting better,” posted Bill Smith, founder of Landing. Katie Jacobs Stanton, whose firm is a “small investor” in Carta and who also uses the software, posted “Gotta be a bug! They’ve been really great to our teams (and us).” Carta’s practices have come under scrutiny before. In January 2024, coding startup Linear’s founder, Karri Saarinen, accused Carta of sharing private cap table data, claiming that a Carta employee contacted one of his angel investors claiming to have an offer for his shares without notifying Saarinen first. Carta ended up exiting the secondary stock trading market, selling it this August to stock trading startup Public.

Obviously not giving legal advice to anyone's specific situation here (and I don't have a current bar card, though I am a law professor), but generally there's an implied contract law duty of good faith.[1] Dirty tricks like writing a contract that says something like \"you can cancel at the end of a term, but you have to have a meeting with us,\" and the contract doesn't say anything about availability of meetings... then the company only offers meeting times after an automatic renewal in order to cheat people into giving them more money... well, that smells like a really good excuse for a lawyer to argue that the duty of good faith has been breached. And even if the company is honest that they were just unable to schedule a meeting beforehand, a decent lawyer might be able to come up with enough of a theory for recovery to negotiate something fair. [1] https://www.americanbar.org/groups/business_law/resources/bu... reply hn_throwaway_99 17 hours agoparentI really, really think folks are overthinking this. This isn't a Comcast subscription. This is an enterprise software deal that costs many multiple thousands of dollars. Anyone that thinks that Carta was ever going to go \"Oh, sucks to be you, you couldn't schedule your cancellation meeting before the renewal date, well, tough cookies, you have to pay us $18k for your next contract year\" simply doesn't know how enterprise software deals work. There is no need to get a lawyer involved because all you have to do is call up Carta and say \"Your shit is broken, there are no cancellation meetings for weeks.\" To emphasize what I put in some of my other comments, sure, Carta needs to fix their shit, and I think the Techcrunch article is making it more about the fact that you have to have a cancellation meeting in the first place (which is a valid compliant), but this idea that it's some deliberate form of \"dark pattern gotcha\" just belies a misunderstanding of how enterprise software subscriptions work. reply StressedDev 16 hours agorootparentNo one is overthinking anything. Carta's behavior is poor, self-serving, and definitely using a dark pattern. If they cannot promptly schedule a meeting, they should wave the meeting requirement. Here are some other thoughts: 1) Canceling a subscription should be easy and take less than 3 minutes. There is nothing special about enterprise software subscriptions. 2) Requiring a meeting to cancel and then scheduling the meeting after the customer is charged a renewal fee is outrageous. This should never happen. 3) Customers tried to contact Carta and could not get help. This means they could not just \"call up Carta\" and tell them \"Your shit is broken, there are no cancellation meetings for weeks.\" reply hn_throwaway_99 16 hours agorootparentIt seems you've misunderstood my comment, as I mostly agree with your points. I'm just saying that the idea that startups need to get a lawyer involved to cancel your subscription is unnecessary. This seems like a pretty clear case of a fuck up on Carta's side, and usually when fuck ups are this obvious if you just point them out the company goes \"Oh shit, sorry, we fucked up\", which is essentially what happened here. reply yawaramin 16 hours agorootparentDid it? The response from Carta, as quoted in the article, was basically 'You still need the meeting, but the scheduling is was a one-off and we should be good now, otherwise you can always chat with us online'. I definitely don't see any 'Oh shit, sorry, we fucked up', it's definitely still 'That was just a glitch, all is well, continue to trust us'. reply conductr 16 hours agorootparentprevAs a purchaser of a lot of enterprise software, I typically start thinking about renewal/cancellation 3-4 months ahead of the contract expiration. Sometimes earlier if we know we want to cancel. But honestly, I always redline the auto renewal clause anyway so they want to speak with me. reply thelock85 13 hours agorootparentThis is it. I’m not sure what manner of business you work in/at/for but I do feel that there is a set and forget expectation with enterprise software in startup land. Once you’ve been around the block a few times on finance/operations, you just expect that things might not work efficiently/automatically and build in safeguards. That isn’t to say that Carta can’t do better… reply sharkweek 16 hours agorootparentprevThis is correct. While there are certainly dark patterns and pain in the ass retention process hoops the company might try and make you jump through, putting in email that you want to cancel, calling and escalating until you talk to someone who will cancel your account, etc. will get your subscription cancelled. Should we have to do this as customers? No, but vote with your wallet and make a note you’d never renew until this kind of shit is fixed and they’ll at some point get the message. Worked at a few SaaS companies and there are playbooks for retention, upselling, renewals, etc but if a customer wants to cancel, the company will cancel. I’d put more weight on Carta in this example just having a broken process that I’m sure this negative press will incentivize them to respond and fix. reply nailer 6 hours agorootparentprev> This is an enterprise software deal that costs many multiple thousands of dollars. Really? I have some small angel investments and use Carta. The companies are seed stage. I’ve never considered it enterprise software. reply saghm 17 hours agoparentprev> This is the sort of thing that a decent corporate lawyer ought to be able to handle. I'm not saying you're wrong, but given that plenty of quite small companies seem to use Carta for handling their shares, it seems pretty ridiculous to have to pay for a lawyer to be able to cancel a subscription. Do early startups really need to keep a lawyer on retainer or be forced to pay by the hour for something like this? reply malyk 5 hours agorootparentYes. Startups need and should be accustomed to working with a lawyer. They are needed very frequently in any real business. reply saghm 50 minutes agorootparentI guess my disconnect isn't that I think startups shouldn't be accustomed to working with a lawyer, but that I expected they shouldn't need one for something like this. Maybe there are enough areas where a lawyer is needed that having one on retainer already should be something startups do, so asking them to help with this wouldn't be onerous. reply terminalbraid 5 hours agorootparentprevI agree and I'm consistently flabbergasted at how many \"entrepreneurs\" see this as controversial or even wasteful. It's like the same take that \"insurance is a scam\". (I would not be surprised of these opinions were strongly correlated) reply Spivak 4 hours agorootparentWhat kind of insurance because both health and auto insurance absolutely are. I don't think it's a coincidence that these two forms are also mandatory by law. Insurance where there's a well defined insurable event that has a known in advance payout are great, life insurance for example. \"Insurance\" where the insurance company gets to decide if and how much to pay out is flat out bullshit. Everyone with auto insurance has experienced the— we decided the value of the car we declared totaled is $x where the cost of buying your exact car same year same mileage is at least $2x, usually $3x. My favorite health insurance story is the one time I had to have an operation out of network because there were no in-network doctors that could do it. I got all the right paperwork, insurance said they would cover it, got it done and the cost was well beyond my out of pocket max. I called up insurance asking where my check was for the difference between my oopm and what I paid. Well guess what, the insurance company \"decided\" that the operation actually cost exactly my deductible so they owed me $0. The breakdown was hilariously bad, they claimed an anesthesiologist costs $17. reply paultopia 1 hour agorootparentauto insurance definitely isn't a scam. it's not to protect the policyholder, it's to protect the people who the policyholder might run over. reply chatmasta 13 hours agoparentprevDecent corporate lawyers are exactly the lawyers who are effectively bundling Carta into their services when you onboard with them. You get some VC investment, you meet with a lawyer from Cooley, and they set everything up for you. Part of that is Carta and it’s pitched as “everyone does it, it’s what investors expect.” I don’t know if they get kickbacks for this, but they really push hard for it. And then when you’re closing down your company, the Cooley lawyers are nowhere to be found unless you’ve set aside $30k for closing costs. So I wouldn’t expect them to come to your rescue when your bank account is nearly empty and you’re trying to cancel your Carta subscription. Oh and don’t forget you signed the rights of “transfer agent” over to Carta when you onboarded with them, so they control your shares. reply thephyber 19 hours agoprevExecs blaming the timing issue on a staffing change, but those same execs approved the workflow that requires the meeting before cancellation and didn’t have a redundant position in case the primary “customer success manager” was unavailable. This is the same any-consumer behavior that makes people hate companies. Gotta love that Carta’s competitors are selling that they don’t have the same cumbersome cancellation policy in the article. reply thot_experiment 19 hours agoparentExecs should be to blame for everything a company does. That's how leadership is supposed to work. Culturally we should not be okay with someone having power without the consequent responsibility. Hopefully we see that shift. reply hn_throwaway_99 19 hours agorootparentI actually think the opposite should happen. I think currently that much too much success of a company is attributed to its leadership, which is why execs are paid so insanely disproportionately compared to everyone else. When you start saying \"You have to take the blame for everything that happens in a company\", it actually ends up concentrating even more wealth at the top of the pyramid. As a somewhat macabre example, with CEOs now literally becoming targets after the UHC assassination, I read an article on how many top execs now deliberately take themselves out of the running for CEO. Why put a giant target on your back like that, when you'd still be paid incredibly handsomely to be SVP or whatever but be 10 times more anonymous? So what that does is shrink the potential CEO pool even further, and then these folks demand even more compensation. To emphasize, I think what we have at present is close to the worst of all possible worlds if CEOs are paid a king's ransom but then escape responsibility when shit goes bad. But I think a better answer is to more evenly distribute both the spoils of success and the responsibilities in a business. reply thot_experiment 18 hours agorootparentI don't think that's the opposite? Seems like you also want the responsibility to match the power, I agree that in general it should be more evenly distributed, I want a system that can correctly capture outliers. I think that flattening would be the consequence if the power-responsibility curve became more linear, our current reality is nowhere near that. It's broken at the most baseline level where an individual stealing $1k will face much harsher consequences than an employer stealing $1k of wages. reply nickff 18 hours agorootparentWhat happens when the employee steals $1k of wages (by slacking off or lying about sick days)? Even fewer consequences than occur when the employer fails to pay wages that are due. reply Loughla 18 hours agorootparentprevThe problem is you're not going to fix the obscene compensation scheme for the CEO position. There is no stomach for that. So, I'm with OP. They're going to have ridiculous compensation, therefore they should have personal responsibility if something goes wrong. Justify that big paycheck and put your money where your mouth is if your want it. reply waterhouse 16 hours agorootparentprevI don't think that's the primary reason for CEOs being paid a lot. I think a much bigger reason is: For large companies that manage large amounts of resources, company-scale decisions are extremely impactful, and therefore it may be net beneficial to pay tens of millions to get someone whose decisions are slightly better. For example, someone who on average makes 0.01 fewer billion-dollar mistakes per year is worth $10 million per year on that count alone. reply asdasdsddd 18 hours agorootparentprevThe risk/reward scale with the stakes. If billions are at stake, then it's fine if CEOs make millions. But yea, if you lose billions and destroy the company, the C suite should personally get cleaned out and creditors should be able to garnish their wages for the rest of your life like alimony. This stuff should be written into contracts to weed out grifters. reply ethbr1 17 hours agorootparent> If billions are at stake, then it's fine if CEOs make millions. Not least, because the incentive to steal from your employer scales with the difference between your compensation and potential gains. Do we really want someone making $50k a year also making decisions that could easily be corrupted to get millions in kickbacks? reply kstrauser 18 hours agoparentprevThat's right. \"We didn't have enough people to schedule a meeting\" is identical to \"we failed to employ enough people to have the meeting\". Lack of staff isn't an excuse, it's a root cause analysis. reply az226 14 hours agoparentprevOr a workflow that pauses charging a customer when a cancellation meeting has been scheduled. And lets the customer know it won’t be charged. reply stanfordkid 29 minutes agoprevThe answer is to work with your bank to block payments. Equity is a legal contract, it's not going to evaporate because Carta says so. Carta isn't going to hire a debt collector against a well funded startup and get counter-sued / risk the bad PR. reply burcs 19 hours agoprevI don't know why anyone would willingly sign up for Carta these days. Between this and the fact they got caught sharing private cap table data, it's like they're actively being hostile to their users. reply hn_throwaway_99 18 hours agoparentThe article pretty much explains why: > “We switched from Carta to Diligent to try to reduce cost and it was a disaster. Switched back to Carta and will never leave again. It’s a 100x better product and keeps getting better,” posted Bill Smith, founder of Landing. The 2 main issues that are discussed here actually don't seem like a big deal to me in the grand scheme of things: 1. While I think having to schedule a meeting to cancel is annoying, I think the issue in the article about not being able to have a meeting until after the renewal date seems like a pretty obvious bug to me in the sense that someone's calendar was hosed which is why cancellation meetings weren't available for so long. An f up to be sure, but this feels to me very like an unintended event that then gets amplified on Twitter/social media because the optics are so bad. 2. The cap data data issue was bad, but by all accounts Carta did an appropriate mea culpa, and in any case have gotten completely out of the \"secondary market\" market which was so problematic to begin with. I don't mean to make this sound like I'm \"letting them off the hook\", but I'm just emphasizing that, in the business world, business leaders tend to look at things from much more of a direct cost/benefit analysis, and the pain points above just really aren't that big of a deal to most business leaders. Note that's considerably different compared to consumer products where people are much more likely to \"rage quit\". And the fact is, everyone I know says Carta is excellent at their core functionality. As an employee with ISOs from multiple different companies that used Carta, I'd say that at least from the perspective of an employee equity holder that their product is very good. reply orionsbelt 19 hours agoparentprevThey are still the most mature platform. Pulley seems to be catching up and is decent, but Carta has just been around longer. reply itake 18 hours agorootparentPulley had a big layoff recently. not sure what their finances are like or how long they will be around. reply br13n444 18 hours agorootparentBad leadership and rudderless product. I’d avoid like the plague if I were SWE/potential client. reply yesimahuman 18 hours agoparentprevAgreed. We deliberately avoided them and just used an old fashioned spreadsheet plus lawyers and it worked perfectly fine and wasn’t that expensive. Maybe if you’re huge but at 120 employees this still worked perfectly fine for us. I got really turned off when they started hinting they would use customer data to offer services on top. Sorry but I have no interest in sharing incredibly sensitive data like that to help possible competitors. reply bloodyplonker22 18 hours agoparentprevCap table data is one of those things that turns grown men into a bunch of high school gossipers. It is even more juicy information than salary data because most people know around how much money each position is paid in terms of salary. Stock ownership is a completely different story. Stock can be given to different employees at orders of magnitude differences depending on the position or stage that the employee joined at. I knew an employee who found out about another employee's stock grant amount. Once he found out, he refused to work hard at all because the other employee was \"not as intelligent\" or as senior as he was, yet he was granted 5x the stock because he joined earlier. It is no surprise that even outsiders of the company illegally share the data like high school gossipers. reply walrus01 19 hours agoparentprevCan you provide a reference to some news articles or other details on Carta sharing private cap tables? How did this data leak? reply mandevil 18 hours agorootparentIt leaked to other people in the company, who were looking to use that information for a secondary market product that Carta had. Since they know everyone who owns stock in company X, they know exactly who to approach about selling stock in company X on their brand-new privately held company marketplace (without the companies permission). https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/07/carta-the-cap-table-manage... for more. After this was discovered and widely reported they sold their private secondary market to another company, because it was impossible to regain trust.

I left my last company and had 90 days to buy my options. The day after I left the company (January) I exercised. The total I had to pay was about $20k. I didn’t think a lot about it after that. 6 full months later I get an email from Carta. It says my bank account transfer was unsuccessful. They had tried to pull the $20k from my account 6 months after I authorized it with absolutely no warning, and it had overdrafted my checking account by $1k (I don’t keep a ton of cash around). Ok no big deal, I’ll move the money around and try again. Nope, Carta decided that after a single failed attempt at payment my options were PERMANENTLY canceled. Like, I no longer have the right to exercise them ever. No equity in the company for me, sorry. After going back and forth with Carta they insisted they “had” to do this even though that’s BS. There’s no reason they couldn’t have attempted a second time to draw payment, they’d already waited 6 months. To get the equity I had worked multiple years for I had to go to the CEO of my former company and beg personally. He got the board to back-date an equity offer for me of the same amount so I could exercise again. If I had left under left friendly terms I’d have been screwed. So yeah, don’t use Carta. reply Sohcahtoa82 33 minutes agoparent> The total I had to pay was about $20k. I didn’t think a lot about it after that. You must be living in an entirely different world to me that you don't think about an upcoming $20K pull. I would have been calling up Carta after ~10 business days, if not sooner, if they were making me sit on $20K in cash. > and it had overdrafted my checking account by $1k (I don’t keep a ton of cash around). If a $20K overdrafted by $1K, then you had $19K in cash. I can't imagine what your monthly spend is like to feel the need to keep that much. I only keep $5K. First paycheck of the month comes in on the 1st, mortgage payment comes out on the 2nd, and I pay off the credit card. Anything over $5K left goes into savings. Second paycheck comes in on the 15th, pay off the credit card again, pay utility bills, car insurance, make my monthly IRA contribution, and then again throw everything over $5K into savings. reply robocat 3 hours agoparentprev> 6 months That is one seriously fucked up delay.

It’s ridiculous that having only a physical mailing address and/or phone number is still legal and acceptable in the US. Can’t be bothered to build a single-click cancellation button (which by the way is also a great regulation where it already exists)? Spend more time going through legally binding cancellations in your email and potentially retroactively refunding charges etc. It should not be my problem if a website is clunky, does not work on my browser, is inaccessible from abroad (and I want to cancel now) etc. – email always works. reply dogboat 19 hours agoparentThere needs to be a rule that any recurring revenue service can be cancelled on the bank side. Then to cancel you contact you card provider not the company. A UK direct debit is like this I think. If this breaches contract then the service provider needs to get a lawyer. The finance system should serve people first - and then tax and law follow. Obviously KYC AML excepted. Such a system might knock 5% off the SP500 but we will live :) reply lxgr 19 hours agorootparentSuccessfully cancelling/reversing a payment does not automatically extinguish any debit incurred, though. It's a great backstop to a company ignoring a cancellation, but I don't think it should be the default. It would be great to integrate a cancellation mechanism into the payment rails though, i.e. allow sending a proactive signal \"your customer wants to cancel their service and next payment will fail\". But that's definitely not the case for direct debits, currently. reply ImPostingOnHN 16 hours agorootparent> Successfully cancelling/reversing a payment does not automatically extinguish any debit incurred, though. The company could just not apply the debit, and instead send their customer a friendly message like, \"Heya! We regret to inform you that your payment method on file failed.

Offboarding isn't necessarily as simple as shutting off the company's account. reply dogboat 17 hours agorootparentOk then ask for that shutdown money in advance. (Or write it off if someone churns). Or make the recurring payments quarterly or annual. reply Narkov 16 hours agorootparentIt's not a money thing. It is a process thing. They have regulations that they must follow to off-board you. reply gamblor956 1 hour agorootparentIt's a process thing but it's not a regulatory thing. There are no regulations governing the transition of cap table management, as generally this thing is handled by most companies internally by their Legal and/or Finance departments. It's just tech that felt the need to create software for something that can be done in Excel. reply duskwuff 17 hours agorootparentprevI'm not sure you understand what I'm getting at here. Carta manages things like employee stock options. If a company has issued equity to employees or investors, they can't just shut off their Carta account and be done with it - those obligations need to be managed somewhere, and part of the offboarding process needs to be a managed handoff of that information. reply dogboat 16 hours agorootparentI understand what you are saying. They should still offboard of course! They should design their service (as in customer service experience) to decouple cancellation from offboarding. I cancel. I stop paying. Now do your offboarding process. If that loses them too much money then ask for that upfront as effectively a retainer. Now you go in to the relstionship eyes open. You pay 3 months upfront then you pay monthly. When you want to stop you click \"unsubscribe\" with a few are you sures. Then you stop paying and they offboard you when they get their shit together. After cancellation and prior to that offboard meeting you are getting some bonus free subscription time. If the offboarding dude is on paternity leave then treat it as extra free subscription as it is on the company not the customer. Fighting to unsubscribe and chasing companies up sucks. reply StressedDev 16 hours agorootparentprevWhat makes Carta different? Why is offboarding more complex? reply duskwuff 15 hours agorootparentAs mentioned elsewhere in this thread, Carta can manage assets such as employee stock options. A company can't simply close their Carta account and declare that their corporate equity is now managed elsewhere; there's regulations that govern how everything has to be handed off. reply gamblor956 1 hour agorootparentThere aren't regulations on this. Cap tables at most companies (including nearly all publicly traded companies) are handled internally by the Legal department or Finance department. While they may or may not use software more advanced than Excel to manage the cap table, they generally don't put all of their eggs in one basket and rely on a third-party SaaS to do this critical work for them. reply Pikamander2 6 hours agoparentprev> This is r/assholedesign Don't bother posting it there though, or the mods will remove it because \"umm well actually it could have just been an honest mistake therefore it's not asshole design\". reply noobermin 7 hours agoprevGood thing Lina Khan is getting replaced so this can become the norm again. reply ibero 18 hours agoprevit always annoys me how much will larsen is looked up to as a progressjve technical thought leader but carta is consistently just borderline antagonistic to its own user base. reply kgeist 18 hours agoprevCan't you ask your bank to blacklist transactions with a specific entity? reply benatkin 16 hours agoprevBest to never subscribe.

    "originBody": "UPHOME Elixir/Erlang Hot Swapping Code Table of Contents Hot Code Swapping: Basics Example Example: iex Relups Erlang Applications Erlang Releases Appups and Relups Generating Releases and Upgrades with Elixir Summary One of the untold benefits of having a runtime is the ability for that runtime to enable loading and unloading code while the runtime is active. Since the runtime is itself, essentially, a virtual machine with its own operating system and process scheduling, it has the ability to start and stop, load and unload processes and code similar to how \"real\" operating systems do. Warning, there be black magic here. This enables some spectacular power in terms of creating deployments and rolling out those deployments. That is, if we can provide a particular artifact for the runtime to load and replace the running system with, we can instruct it to upgrade our system(s) without restarting them, without interrupting our services or affecting users of those systems. Furthermore, if we constrain the system and make a few particular assumptions, this can all happen nearly instantaneously. For example, Erlang releases happen in seconds because of the functional approach taken by the language, this compared to other systems like Docker and/or Kubernetes which may take several minutes or hours to transition a version because there is no safe assumptions to make about running code. This post will be a small tour through how Elixir and Erlang can perform code hot swapping, and how this can be useful for deployments. Hot Code Swapping: Basics There are several functions defined in the :sys and :code modules that are required for this first example. Namely, the following functions: :code.load_file/1 :sys.suspend/1 :sys.change_code/4 :sys.resume/1 The :sys.suspend/1 function takes a single parameter, the Process ID (PID) of the process to suspend, similarly, :sys.resume also takes a PID of the process to resume. The :code.load_file/1 function, unfortunately named, takes a single parameter: the module to load into memory. Finally, the :sys.change_code function takes four parameters: name, module, old_version, and extra. The name is the PID or the registered atom of the process. The extra argument is a reserved parameter for each process, it's the same extra that will be passed to the restarted process's code_change/3 function. Example Let's assume we have a particularly simple module, say KV, similar to the following: defmodule KV do use GenServer @vsn 0 def start_link() do GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, [], name: __MODULE__) end def init(_) do {:ok, %{}} end def get(key, default \\\\ nil) do GenServer.call(__MODULE__, {:get, key, default}) end def put(key, value) do GenServer.call(__MODULE__, {:put, key, value}) end def handle_call({:get, key, default}, _caller, state) do {:reply, Map.get(state, key, default), state} end def handle_call({:put, key, value}, _caller, state) do {:reply, :ok, Map.put(state, key, value)} end end Save this into a file, say, kv.ex. Next we will compile it and load it into an iex session: % elixirc kv.ex % iex iex> l KV {:module, KV} We can start the process and try it out: iex> KV.start_link {:ok, #PID} iex> KV.get(:a) nil iex> KV.put(:a, 42) :ok iex> KV.get(:a) 42 Now, let's say we wish to add some logging to the handling of the :get and :put messages. We will apply a patch similar to the following: --- a/kv.ex +++ b/kv.ex @@ -1,7 +1,8 @@ defmodule KV do + require Logger use GenServer - @vsn 0 + @vsn 1 def start_link() do GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, [], name: __MODULE__) @@ -20,10 +21,12 @@ defmodule KV do end def handle_call({:get, key, default}, _caller, state) do + Logger.info(\"#{__MODULE__}: Handling get request for #{key}\") {:reply, Map.get(state, key, default), state} end def handle_call({:put, key, value}, _caller, state) do + Logger.info(\"#{__MODULE__}: Handling put request for #{key}:#{value}\") {:reply, :ok, Map.put(state, key, value)} end Without closing the current iex session, apply the patch to the file and compile the module: % patch kv.ex kv.ex.patch % elixirc kv.ex You may see a warning about redefining an existing module, this warning can be safely ignored. Now, in the still open iex session, let's begin the black magic incantations: iex> :code.load_file KV {:module, KV} iex> :sys.suspend(KV) :ok iex> :sys.change_code(KV, KV, 0, nil) :ok iex> :sys.resume(KV) :ok Now, we should be able to test it again: iex> KV.get(:a) 21:28:47.989 [info] Elixir.KV: Handling get request for a 42 iex> KV.put(:b, 2) 21:28:53.729 [info] Elixir.KV: Handling put request for b:2 :ok Thus, we are able to hot-swap running code, without stopping, losing state, or effecting processes waiting for that data! But the above is merely an example of manually invoking the code reloading API, there are better ways to achieve the same result. Example: iex There are several functions available to us when using iex that essentially perform the above actions for us: c/1: compile file r/1: (recompile and) reload module The r/1 helper takes an atom of the module to reload, c/1 takes a binary of the path to the module to compile. Check the documentation for more information. Therefore, using these, we can simplify what we did in the previous example to simply a call to r/1: iex> r KV warning: redefining module KV (current version loaded from Elixir.KV.beam) kv.ex:1 {:reloaded, KV, [KV]} iex> KV.get(:a) 21:52:47.829 [info] Elixir.KV: Handling get request for a 42 In one function, we have done what previously took four functions. However, the story does not end here. This was only for a single module, one GenServer. What about when we want to upgrade more modules, or an entire application? Although c/1 and r/1 are great for development. They are not recommended for production use. Do not depend on them to perform deployments. Relups Fortunately, there is another set of tooling that allows us to more easily deploy releases, and more pointedly, perform upgrades: Relups. Before we dive straight into relups, let's discuss a few other related concepts. Erlang Applications As part of Erlang \"Applications\", there is a related file, the .app file. This resource file describes the application: other applications that should be started and other metadata about the application. Using Elixir, this file can be found in the _build/{Mix.env}/lib/{app_name}/ebin/ folder. Here's an example .app file from the octochat demo application: ± cat _build/dev/lib/octochat/ebin/octochat.app {application,octochat, [{registered,[]}, {description,\"Demo Application for How Swapping Code\"}, {vsn,\"0.3.3\"}, {modules,['Elixir.Octochat','Elixir.Octochat.Acceptor', 'Elixir.Octochat.Application','Elixir.Octochat.Echo', 'Elixir.Octochat.ServerSupervisor', 'Elixir.Octochat.Supervisor']}, {applications,[kernel,stdlib,elixir,logger]}, {mod,{'Elixir.Octochat.Application',[]}}]}. This is a pretty good sized triple (3-tuple). By the first element of the triple, we can tell it is an application, the application's name is octochat given by the second element, and everything in the list that follows is a keyword list that describes more about the octochat application. Notably, we have the usual metadata found in the mix.exs file, the modules that make up the application, and the other OTP applications this application requires to run. Erlang Releases An Erlang \"release\", similar to Erlang application, is an entire system: the Erlang VM, the dependent set of applications, and arguments for the Erlang VM. After building a release for the Octochat application with the distillery project, we get a .rel file similar to the following: ± cat rel/octochat/releases/0.3.3/octochat.rel {release,{\"octochat\",\"0.3.3\"}, {erts,\"8.1\"}, [{logger,\"1.3.4\"}, {compiler,\"7.0.2\"}, {elixir,\"1.3.4\"}, {stdlib,\"3.1\"}, {kernel,\"5.1\"}, {octochat,\"0.3.3\"}, {iex,\"1.3.4\"}, {sasl,\"3.0.1\"}]}. This is an Erlang 4-tuple; it's a release of the \"0.0.3\" version of octochat. It will use the \"8.1\" version of \"erts\" and it depends on the list of applications (and their versions) provided in the last element of the tuple. Appups and Relups As the naming might suggest, \"appups\" and \"relups\" are the \"upgrade\" versions of applications and releases, respectively. Appups describe how to take a single application and upgrade its modules, specifically, it will have instructions for upgrading modules that require \"extras\". or, if we are upgrading supervisors, for example, the Appup will have the correct instructions for adding and removing child processes. Before we examine some examples of these files, let's first look at the type specification for each. Here is the syntax structure for the appup resource file: {Vsn, [{UpFromVsn, Instructions}, ...], [{DownToVsn, Instructions}, ...]}. The first element of the triple is the version we are either upgrading to or downgrading from. The second element is a keyword list of upgrade instructions keyed by the version the application would be coming from. Similarly, the third element is a keyword list of downgrade instructions keyed by the version the application will downgrade to. For more information about the types themselves, see the SASL documentation. Now that we have seen the syntax, let's look at an example of the appup resource file for the octochat application generated using distillery: ± cat rel/octochat/lib/octochat-0.2.1/ebin/octochat.appup {\"0.2.1\", [{\"0.2.0\",[{load_module,'Elixir.Octochat.Echo',[]}]}], [{\"0.2.0\",[{load_module,'Elixir.Octochat.Echo',[]}]}]}. Comparing this to the syntax structure above, we see that we have a Vsn element of \"0.2.1\", we have a {UpFromVsn, Instructions} pair: [{\"0.2.0\",[{load_module,'Elixir.Octochat.Echo',[]}]}], and we have a single {DownToVsn, Instructions} pair: [{\"0.2.0\",[{load_module,'Elixir.Octochat.Echo',[]}]}]. The instructions themselves tell us what exactly is required to go from one version to the another. Specifically, in this example, to upgrade, we need to \"load\" the Octochat.Echo module into the VM. Similarly, the instructions to downgrade are the same. For a semantically versioned project, this is an understandably small change. It's worth noting the instructions found in the .appup files are usually high-level instructions, thus, load_module covers both the loading of object code into memory and the suspend, replace, resume process of upgrading applications. Next, let's look at the syntax structure of a relup resource file: {Vsn, [{UpFromVsn, Descr, Instructions}, ...], [{DownToVsn, Descr, Instructions}, ...]}. This should look familiar. It's essentially the exact same as the .appup file. However, there's an extra term, Descr. The Descr field can be used as part of the version identification, but is optional. Otherwise, the syntax of this file is the same as the .appup. Now, let's look at an example relup file for the same release of octochat: ± cat rel/octochat/releases/0.2.1/relup {\"0.2.1\", [{\"0.2.0\",[], [{load_object_code,{octochat,\"0.2.1\",['Elixir.Octochat.Echo']}}, point_of_no_return, {load,{'Elixir.Octochat.Echo',brutal_purge,brutal_purge}}]}], [{\"0.2.0\",[], [{load_object_code,{octochat,\"0.2.0\",['Elixir.Octochat.Echo']}}, point_of_no_return, {load,{'Elixir.Octochat.Echo',brutal_purge,brutal_purge}}]}]}. This file is a little more dense, but still adheres to the basic triple syntax we just examined. Let's take a closer look at the upgrade instructions: [{load_object_code,{octochat,\"0.2.1\",['Elixir.Octochat.Echo']}}, point_of_no_return, {load,{'Elixir.Octochat.Echo',brutal_purge,brutal_purge}}] The first instruction, {load_object_code,{octochat,\"0.2.1\",['Elixir.Octochat.Echo']}}, tells the release handler to load into memory the new version of the \"Octochat.Echo\" module, specifically the one associated with version \"0.2.1\". But this instruction will not instruct the release handler to (re)start or replace the existing module yet. Next, point_of_no_return, tells the release handler that failure beyond this point is fatal, if the upgrade fails after this point, the system is restarted from the old release version (appup documentation). The final instruction, {load,{'Elixir.Octochat.Echo',brutal_purge,brutal_purge}}, tells the release handler to replace the running version of the module and use the newly loaded version. For more information regarding burtal_purge, check out the \"PrePurge\" and \"PostPurge\" values in the appup documentation. Similar to the .appup file, the third element in the triple describes to the release handler how to downgrade the release as well. The version numbers in this case make this a bit more obvious as well, however, the steps are essentially the same. Generating Releases and Upgrades with Elixir Now that we have some basic understanding of releases and upgrades, let's see how we can generate them with Elixir. We will generate the releases with the distillery project, however, the commands should also work with the soon to be deprecated exrm project. This has been written for the 0.10.1 version of distillery. This is a fast moving project that is in beta, be prepared to update as necessary. Add the distillery application to your deps list: {:distillery, \"~> 0.10\"} Perform the requisite dependency download: ± mix deps.get Then, to build your first production release, you can use the following: ± MIX_ENV=prod mix release --env prod For more information on why you must specify both environments, please read the FAQ of distillery. If the environments match, there's a small modification to the ./rel/config.exs that can be made so that specifying both is no longer necessary. After this process is complete, there should be a new folder under the ./rel folder that contains the new release of the project. Within this directory, there will be several directories, namely, bin, erts-{version}, lib, and releases. The bin directory will contain the top level Erlang entry scripts, the erts-{version} folder will contain the requisite files for the Erlang runtime, the lib folder will contain the compiled beam files for the required applications for the release, and finally, the releases folder will contain the versions of the releases. Each folder for each version will have its own rel file, generated boot scripts, as per the OTP releases guide, and a tarball of the release for deployment. Deploying the release is a little out of scope for this post and may be the subject of another. For more information about releases, see the System Principles guide. However, for Elixir, it may look similar to the following: Copy the release tarball to the target system: ± scp rel/octochat/releases/0.3.2/octochat.tar.gz target_system:/opt/apps/. On the target system, unpack the release: ± ssh target_system (ts)# cd /opt/apps (ts)# mkdir -p octochat (ts)# tar -zxf octochat.tar.gz -C octochat Start the system: (ts)# cd octochat (ts)# bin/octochat start This will bring up the Erlang VM and the application tree on the target system. Next, after making some applications changes and bumping the project version, we can generate an upgrade release using the following command: ± MIX_ENV=prod mix release --upgrade Note, This will also generate a regular release. Once this process finishes, checking the rel/{app_name}/releases folder, there should be a new folder for the new version, and a relup file for the upgrade: ± cat rel/octochat/releases/0.3.3/octochat.rel {release,{\"octochat\",\"0.3.3\"}, {erts,\"8.1\"}, [{logger,\"1.3.4\"}, {compiler,\"7.0.2\"}, {elixir,\"1.3.4\"}, {stdlib,\"3.1\"}, {kernel,\"5.1\"}, {octochat,\"0.3.3\"}, {iex,\"1.3.4\"}, {sasl,\"3.0.1\"}]}. ± cat rel/octochat/releases/0.3.3/relup {\"0.3.3\", [{\"0.3.2\",[], [{load_object_code,{octochat,\"0.3.3\",['Elixir.Octochat.Echo']}}, point_of_no_return, {suspend,['Elixir.Octochat.Echo']}, {load,{'Elixir.Octochat.Echo',brutal_purge,brutal_purge}}, {code_change,up,[{'Elixir.Octochat.Echo',[]}]}, {resume,['Elixir.Octochat.Echo']}]}], [{\"0.3.2\",[], [{load_object_code,{octochat,\"0.3.1\",['Elixir.Octochat.Echo']}}, point_of_no_return, {suspend,['Elixir.Octochat.Echo']}, {code_change,down,[{'Elixir.Octochat.Echo',[]}]}, {load,{'Elixir.Octochat.Echo',brutal_purge,brutal_purge}}, {resume,['Elixir.Octochat.Echo']}]}]}. Similarly, to deploy this new upgrade, copy the tarball to the target system and unpack it into the same directory as before. After it's unpacked, upgrading the release can be done via a stop and start, or we can issue the upgrade command: (ts)# bin/octochat stop (ts)# bin/octochat start Or: (ts)# bin/octochat upgrade \"0.3.3\" When starting and stopping, the entry point script knows how to select the \"newest\" version. When upgrading, it is required to specify the desired version, this is necessary since the upgrade process may require more than simply jumping to the \"latest\" version. Summary Release management is a complex topic, upgrading without restarting seemingly even more so. However, the process can be understood, and knowing how the process works will allow us to make more informed decisions regarding when to use it. The tooling for performing hot upgrades has been around for a while, and while the tooling for Elixir is getting closer, we are not quite ready for prime time. But it won't remain this way for long. Soon, it will be common place for Elixir applications to be just as manageable as the Erlang counterparts. © 2014-2024 Kenny Ballou. Some rights reserved. Powered by GNU/Linux",

Has the community moved away from it? Is it just not that useful? reply thibaut_barrere 7 hours agoparentA lot of web apps are just well-enough served with a blue-green deployment model. It is less risky. But if you really need it, it's really great to have that option (e.g. very long running systems which are split in front/back etc), and it can be used in creative ways too (like the Drone example). Here is a lightning talk I gave about how to use hot-reload for music / MIDI interactions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8sGQM6kLvo reply modernerd 7 hours agorootparentGreat talk, thanks, nice to see other creative uses. Great idea to add LiveView and SVGs for the keyboard UI. \"…thanks to hot reloading, which — for once — is useful…\" That seems to sum up the sentiment that hot swapping in Erlang has uses but they're generally not aligned with what Erlang is typically employed for. It seems like it would be great for tight game dev loop feedback and iteration too, for example, but that's not a traditional use of Erlang either. reply thibaut_barrere 6 hours agorootparent> That seems to sum up the sentiment that hot swapping in Erlang has uses but they're generally not aligned with what Erlang is typically employed for Actually, I think it is much more common in original Erlang scenarios (including \"non-web\") where high availability is a useful pre-requisite. It is in my experience less common in Elixir, which is often more web-oriented (although not exclusively). reply epiccoleman 3 hours agorootparentprevExtremely cool, thanks for sharing! reply chefandy 3 hours agoparentprevHuh, really? I feel like I see Elixir folks sing the praises of beam pretty regularly. Specifically the OTP supervisor stuff for fault-resistant server deployments. I haven’t looked specifically for that though recently so maybe people are taking it for granted? reply cess11 7 hours agoparentprevA lot of the GenServer-information floating around explains code_change/3, no? That's commonly what you want, a way to handle state propagation when process code is updating in a running system. Most people are probably running some web services or something and might as well shift machines in and out of a cluster or can wait for old processes to disband on their own, because the new code is backwards compatible with the one in already running processes, and so on. It can also be relatively hard to do without causing damage to the system. Those who need and can manage it probably don't need it marketed. reply Muromec 4 hours agorootparentThis is also a reply to that deleted comment, because I had to type it all and also got to go outside and have my European 2 hour long lunch break while doing it. If you have any kind of state in gen_server and the state or assumptions of it have changed, you need to write that code_change thingy that migrates the state both ways between two specific versions. If by some chance this function is bugged, then the process is killed (which is okay), so you need to nail down the supervision tree to make things restartable and also not get into restart loops. Remember writing database migrations for django or whatever ORM of the day? Now do that, but for memory structures you have. Now, while the function is running it can't be updated of course, so you need gen_server to call you back from the outside of the module. If you like to save function references instead of saving process references in your state, you need to figure out which version you will be actually calling. If you change the arity of your record, then the old record no longer matches your patterns. Since updates are not atomic, you will have two versions of the code running at the same time, potentially sending messages that old/new stuff does not expect, and both old and new code should not bug out. And if they do bug out, you have been smart enough to figure out how to recover and actually test that. Than there is this thing, if somehow something from the version V-2 still running after update to V-1 and you start updating to the latest V, then things happen. You can deal with all that of course and erlang gives you tools and recipies to make it work. Sometimes you have to make it work, because restarting and losing state is not an option. Also it's probably fun to deal with complex things. Or you could just do do the stupid thing that is good enough and let it crash and restart instead of figuring out ten different things that could go wrong. Or take a 15 minutes maintenance window while your users are all sleeping (yes, not everybody is doing critical infra that runs 24/7 like discord group with game memes). Or just do blue-green and sidestep it all completely. reply cess11 4 hours agorootparentprevSomeone put a reply and then deleted it while I wrote a response, and it irks me that it might have been a waste so here's the gist of it: \"Is it just that people are more comfortable with blue-green deploys, or are blue-green deploys actually better?\" It depends. If you can do a blue-green shift where you gradually add 'fresh' servers/VM:s/processes and drain the old, that's likely to be most convenient and robust in many organisations. On the other hand, if you rely on long running processes in a way where changing their PID:s break the system, then you pretty much need to update them with this kind of hot patching. \"Does Erlang offer any features to minimize damage here?\" The BEAM allows a lot of things in this area, on pretty much every level of abstraction. If you know what you're doing and you've designed your system to fit well into the provided mechanisms the platform provides a lot of support for hot patching without sacrificing robustness and uptime. But it's like another layer of possible bugs and risks, it's not just your usual network and application logic that might cause a failure, your handling of updates might itself be a source of catastrophe. In practice you need to think long and hard about how to deploy, and test thoroughly under very production like conditions. It helps that you can know for sure what production looks like at any given time, the BEAM VM can tell you exactly what processes it runs, what the application and supervisor trees look like, hardware resource consumption and so on. You can use this information to stage fairly realistic tests with regards to load and whatnot, so if your update for example has an effect on performance and unexpected bottlenecks show up you might catch it before it reaches your users. And as anyone can tell you who has updated a profitable, non-trivial production system directly, like a lot of PHP devs of ye olden times, it takes a rather strong stomach even when it works out fine. When it doesn't, you get scars that might never fade. reply dszoboszlay 1 hour agoprevHot code upgrades on the BEAM are awesome, but they're not a piece of cake. If you're also interested in the challenges of making them production safe, I gave a talk about this topic on CodeBEAM Sto earlier this year: https://youtu.be/epORYuUKvZ0?si=gkVBgrX2VpBFQAk5 OP talks in the summary about the importance of understanding the process. It's very much true, but you need to understand not only the process your tooling provides, but also what's going on in the background and what hasn't been taken care for you by your tools. I'm afraid these things are rarely understood about hot upgrades, even by experienced Erlang engineers. reply Volundr 17 hours agoprevIt's worth noting that distillery is deprecated in favor of mix releases, which don't support relups out of the box, and specifically warn against them due to the complexity involved in writing code to support them correctly. It's a cool feature that's no doubt amazing for applications that need it, but it brings a fair amount of complexity vs other deployment strategies. reply thibaut_barrere 6 hours agoparentGood point.

I distinctly remember during that time that these hot-swap deployments were all the rage in the Elixir community, and then fell out of fashion with time. reply hauxir 17 hours agoprevAt kosmi.io we use elixir hot swapping for every small patch/bugfix on the backend. This allows us to deploy updates multiple times a day with 0 disruption. Allows the clients to remain connected and be none the wiser that there was an update at all. For larger updates we just do hard restarts when in-memory data structures or supervision tree are changed. reply deathtrader666 11 hours agoparentWould love to know more how you go about it. reply hauxir 6 hours agorootparentIt's a little hacky but I'll try to explain: * The server runs in a docker container which has an ssh server installed and running in the background. The reason for SSH is simply because that's what edeliver/distillery uses. * The CI(local github runner) runs in a docker container as well which handles building and deploying the updated releases when merged on master. * We use edeliver to deploy the hot upgrades/releases from the CI container to the server container. This happens automatically unless stopped which we do for larger merges where a restart is needed. * The whole deployment process is done in a bash script which uses the git hash for versioning, edeliver for deploying and in the end it runs the database migrations. I'm not going to say it's perfect but it's allowed us to move pretty damn fast. reply GCUMstlyHarmls 15 hours agoprevThis is a talk about a large scale, resilient elixir/erlang deployment in healthcare.

In Lisp, you can just compile a function, or load a file and it just works. It's not even sold as a hot feature, not the way Erlang sells it. It's just a feature. I manage a few websites written in Lisp, and updating them is as simple as push code, recompile and it works. reply davidw 16 hours agorootparentBut what if the system is running and the new function takes different arguments or something? What if there is data loaded in the system, what happens to it? Simply loading new code is easy, ensuring the whole system works seems to require a bit more effort. reply fiddlerwoaroof 15 hours agorootparentCommon Lisp has a bunch of features designed to enable migrating the system. e.g. update-instance-for-redefined-class ( https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_upd... ) lets you write code to update instance data between class versions when a class definition is reloaded. It turns out, though, that making hot-code reloading work well is mainly a question of how you design your system: designing for hot code reloading isn't all that hard for 90% of cases once you figure out the relevant techniques. reply leprechaun1066 8 hours agorootparentprevWe do this in q/kdb+ systems often for patches. An important thing about these languages is that this kind of workflow is part of the core for solving problems. So when you are building a system one of the aspects of its design will always allow for this update method. Then when you push a patch you both know the impact of the change (because you've tested the exact same steps in a dev/QA/UAT/Beta environment) and the work required to do it safely. Major releases do go through a full shutdown and release cycle though. reply osmano807 4 hours agorootparentprevThose sites have something like Phoenix LiveView or it's something ad hoc like a simple SSR template engine? Would be nice to have something to handle migrations in the client side code to match the server side API. reply anonymousDan 18 hours agoprevI'm a distributed setup I imagine there could be cases where you want to atomically hot upgrade multiple VMs at the same time. Is this common in practice and if so are there recommended patterns/techniques for doing it? reply AlphaWeaver 18 hours agoparentErlang does have a mechanism that allows a module to control when it moves from the \"old version\" to the \"new version\" of its own code. Calls to the module with the fully qualified name (e.g. `module:function()`) will invoke the \"new code\" once it's loaded, but calls within that module using only function names (just `function()`) will continue to invoke the \"old code\". If the portion of the app you were hot upgrading was an OTP process like a GenServer, you could theoretically wait for some sort of atomic coordination mechanism to make that fully qualified function call after the new code has loaded, at least in theory. We use hot code reloading at my work, but haven't had a reason to atomically sync the reload. Most of the time it's a tmux session with `synchronize-panes` and that suffices. If your application can handle upgrades within a module smoothly, it's rare to have a need for some sort of cluster-level coordination of a code change, at least one that's atomic. reply Muromec 18 hours agoparentprevThere can't be anything atomic in a distributed system. You can't even atomically hot upgrade it on a single VM anyway -- you instead load the new version of the module and let dispatcher know to route new calls into it, the same as you would do with a load balancer and a bunch of load bearing docker hosts, just inside your app. reply knome 5 hours agorootparenterlang has a code_change function in the otp that allows the gen_server to update its current state and start using new code. No connections need be broken with clients, no long running processes need be stopped. Just updated in place. It's not just a routing change. https://www.erlang.org/docs/24/man/gen_server reply Muromec 3 hours agorootparentIt's a routing change in a sense that gen_server is routing function calls to the new module definition. I know about gen_server and code_change, the point was that conceptually the same mechanism, just on a different level of abstraction. reply toast0 10 hours agoparentprevI mean, yes, there's cases where you want that. But there's no mechanism for it, because you would have to stop the world, do the load, and then resume. Even within a single VM, hot loading doesn't stop the world, during the load some schedulers will switch before others. Although there are guarantees that mean when a process runs new code and sends a message to another local process, that process will have the new code available when it reads the message. (It may still be running the old code, depending on how it's called though) Dealing with multiple versions active is part of life in most distributed systems though. You can architect it away in some systems, but that usually involves having downtime in maintenance windows. A typical pattern is making progressive updates, where if you want to change a request, first you deploy a server that can handle old and new requests, then you deploy the client that sends the new request, then you can deploy a server that no longer accepts old requests. For new replies, if the new reply comes with a new request, that works like above... a client that sent a new request must handle the new reply. Otherwise, update the client to handle either type of reply, then update the server to send the new reply, finally remove handling of the old reply in the clients. It gets a bit harder if your team dynamics mean one person/group doesn't control both sides... Then you need stats to tell you when all the clients have switched. Sometimes you do need more of a point in time switch. If it needs to be pretty good, you can just set a config through a dist 'broadcast'. If it needs to be better than that, you can have the servers and clients change behavior after a specific time... but make sure you understand the realities of clock synchronization and think about what to do for requests in flight. If that's not good enough, you can drop or buffer requests for a little bit before your targer time, make sure there are no in progress requests, then resume processing requests with the new version. reply amelius 18 hours agoprevDoes this hot swapping also work for closures? reply Muromec 18 hours agoparentErlang doesn't have closures, because erlang doesn't have variables. The compiler simply desugars it to partially applied function referenced by it's name (yes, those inline functions in fact have names). If you have something_function, then first inline function used in it will be -something_function/1-fun-0- with zero being the index and captured variable being another argument. Now if you will change the host function to have more inlines before it, the indexing will drift. So I would expect the body of inline function will still be resolved from the old version of the module, but I didn't actually try. Source: I did run erlc -S at least once. Add: now thinking of it, will the call to a local function from the old version of the module ever escape into the new one without first returning back to gen_server and letting it call the new version? Another comment says that calls withing the module never do, so the assumption was correct. reply bitwalker 16 hours agorootparentErlang absolutely has closures, you are mistaken. What you are referring to are \"function captures\", which bind a function reference as a value, and there is no environment to close over with those. However, you can define closures which as you'd expect, can close over bindings in the environment in which the closure is defined. The interaction between hot reloads and function captures in general is a bit subtle, particularly when it comes to how a function is captured. A fully qualified function capture is reloaded normally, but a capture using just a local name refers to the version of the module at the time it was captured, but is force upgraded after two consecutive hot upgrades, as only two versions of a module are allowed to exist at the same time. For this reason, you have to be careful about how you capture functions, depending on the semantics you want. reply toast0 13 hours agorootparent> but is force upgraded after two consecutive hot upgrades, as only two versions of a module are allowed to exist at the same time. Force upgraded is maybe misleading. When a module is loaded for the 3rd time, any processes that still have the first version in their stack are killed. That may result in a supervisor restarting them with new code, if they're supervised. reply bitwalker 27 minutes agorootparentAh right, good point - I was trying to remember the exact behavior, but couldn't recall if an error is raised (and when), or if the underlying module is just replaced and \"jesus take the wheel\" after that. reply Muromec 11 hours agorootparentprevWhat does is it look like? I was talking about this thing: Val = 1, SumFun = fun(X) -> X + Val end, SumFun(2). It looks like you define arity 1 function that captures Val, while in fact you define arity 2 function and bind 1 as a first argument. Since you can't redefine Val anyway, it's as good as a closure, but technically it doesn't capture the environment. Maybe I'm mistaken and there is another way to express it? reply slt2021 18 hours agoprevhot reload of code is nothing new nowadays, but people use it only locally during development for REPL like development style. in actual production, people prefer to operate at the container level + traffic management, and dont touch anything deeper than the container reply diath 18 hours agoparent> in actual production, people prefer to operate at the container level + traffic management, and dont touch anything deeper than the container How do you think video games like World of Warcraft or Path of Exile deploy restartless hotfixes to millions of concurrent players without killing instances?

Not sure that’s better than zero downtime deployments reply diath 18 hours agorootparentThat's just how it works when your backend is a hybrid software that utilizes a low-level compiled programming language and a high-level language that runs in its own VM. You can use the latter for gameplay features, and can hotfix on the go, and then for core changes you have to restart, which is also why WoW will hotfix the latter on the go, usually every day on an expansion launch, whereas they defer the bulk of backend changes for the next weekly restart without continuously disrupting the game for players. reply AnotherGoodName 18 hours agorootparentprevThat’s a very big assumption that they do code hotpatching. It would seem far more likely they seperate the stateful (database) and stateless layers (game logic) and they just spin up a new instance of the stateless server layer behind a reverse proxy and spin down the old instance. It’s basically how all websites update without down time. reply diath 17 hours agorootparentA website that just proxies to another server does not need to do much to restore the previous state to make it look seamless to a user, the client will just perform another GET request that triggers a few SELECT queries, it's far more complex in the context of a video game. reply Muromec 18 hours agorootparentprevGames do in fact have downtimes on major releases and you have to restart the client too before connecting. reply diath 18 hours agorootparentFor major patches/backend changes that require recompiling - yes, for gameplay tweaks/hotfixes - no, hot reloading is preferable where possible. reply aeturnum 16 hours agoparentprevI work at a company that deploys Elixir/Erlang and while we do /prefer/ to push a fully tested build in a new container, sometimes things get nasty and we need to console in and re-define a module in production.

Or you can define a process as something having qualified name and a mailbox and is sending messages to other processes. Now reasonable people may disagree about what's wasteful, but the market seems to tolerate places where adding a checkbox to a form is a half a year process involving five different departments and the market can't be wrong. reply foota 18 hours agoparentprevAmusingly, this reminds me sort of about the story of a person who joins a new company only to discover that their programming framework is intricately linked to their version control system. reply toast0 10 hours agoparentprev> in actual production, people prefer to operate at the container level + traffic management, and dont touch anything deeper than the container I mean, this seems to be \"best practices\" these days, but I certainly don't prefer it. At least the orchestration I use is amazingly slow. And cold loading changes is terrible for long running processes... this makes deployment a major chore. It's less terrible if you're just doing mostly stateless web stuff, but that's not my world. In the time it takes to run terraform plan, I could have pushed erlang code to all my machines, loaded it, and (usually) confirm I fixed what I wanted to fix. Low cost of deploy means you can do more updates which means they can be smaller which makes them easier to review. reply simoncion 15 hours agoparentprev> in actual production, people prefer to operate at the container level + traffic management, and dont touch anything deeper than the container Fred Hebert (and many of the folks he has worked with) do not operate that way:One nice quote (out of many) from the article: > The thing that stateless containers and kubernetes do is handle that base case of \"when a thing is wrong, replace it and get back to a good state.\" The thing it does not easily let you do is \"and then start iterating to get better and better at not losing all your state and recuperating fast\".

To which, from my experience using it in Erlang, I heartily agree is fraught. Inconsistent state across nodes is much harder to reason about. When you _must_ ensure consistency, hot swapping is reckless, especially as org size and product complexity increases. Leave hot loading to local/development environments, not production deploys. Loading configs on the fly can also have some of this risk, but it is much easier to reason about typically. reply Muromec 17 hours agorootparentprevI heard the quote that some 50% of the mobile traffic is handled by erlang.

Given that you can implement OTP in any language (albeit with varying degrees of difficulty), that's not surprising.

Perhaps somewhere in the world there is some developer out there hot on Erlang but just hates OTP and doesn't use it, but they must be fairly frustrated at how hard it is to keep OTP out of their code base if they ever need any libraries. Restarting is arguably the definitive thing that makes Erlang stack the 9s out past what most languages and runtimes can achieve... the thing is, it's more complicated to use in practice than a web page like this makes it look, and it's beyond what most products need. Few applications need the fifth or sixth or seventh nine, and it gets to the point that you can't have it anyhow because your Erlang cluster, no matter how well distributed, itself probably doesn't have 99.99999 availability, and your users probably don't have 99.99999 availability on their own network connection. It's not impossibly complicated, but it is the sort of thing where you if you want to use the feature you need to have it sort of constantly in mind as you write the rest of your system, and it's a lot easier even in Erlang to just design the system to take entire nodes down and bring them back up, if not the entire cluster down, rather than fuss with hot reloads. I wish Erlang advocates would be more upfront about pitching this as an interesting niche feature, but not really a reason to consider Erlang. Unless you absolutely need it, in which case it can indeed be the thing that puts it on the short list of choices... but as evidenced by the vast, vast majority of software and systems not being on Erlang and managing to get along, there aren't really that many things that need it. reply Muromec 18 hours agoparentprevThe black magic comes at the cost of not having one streamlined procedure to release stuff.

Yeah, we talk here about more complicated things here.

About 99%. We need to restart servers maybe once a year. Maybe next year we will finally migrate from erlang 21 to latest. Most \"stopping everything\" deployments take max 1s of downtime, like this month when we needed to upgrade postgresql database by switching it over to new machine, having zero downtime here would take a little longer to get the consistency, but we could spare a second to make it much simpler task on database side (it was a restart of database module, rest of erlang server was unaffected and clients were not disconnected). Otherwise, most deployments are not visible as disconnections, we have a lot long-running connections. > At the very least you will have a different procedure to upgrade the erlang itself, right? Yes. > I think on a spectrum of difficult things there is an area between hosting static file on rpi at home and running massivele distributed system full of long running stateful processes.

The point I'm trying to make is -- for most of the web stuff, making transactional response from a short-lived http handler is good enough and you can do it even in PHP (which is not a praise for PHP as a great tool I enjoy using, but the opposite).

(opens a new tab) Comments Read Later Read Later number theory Mathematicians Uncover a New Way to Count Prime Numbers By Joseph Howlett December 11, 2024 To make progress on one of number theory’s most elementary questions, two mathematicians turned to an unlikely source. Read Later Mathematicians discovered how to pick out a particular form of prime number from the garden of all primes. Samuel Velasco/Quanta Magazine Introduction By Joseph Howlett Staff Writer December 11, 2024 View PDF/Print Mode mathematics number theory prime numbers All topics (opens a new tab) A new proof has brought mathematicians one step closer to understanding the hidden order of those “atoms of arithmetic,” the prime numbers. The primes — numbers that are only divisible by themselves and 1 — are the most fundamental building blocks in math. They’re also the most mysterious. At first glance, they seem to be scattered at random across the number line. But of course, the primes aren’t random. They’re completely determined, and a closer look at them reveals all sorts of strange patterns, which mathematicians have spent centuries trying to unravel. A better understanding of how the primes are distributed would illuminate vast swaths of the mathematical universe. But while mathematicians have formulas that give an approximate sense of where the primes are located, they can’t pinpoint them exactly. Instead, they’ve had to take a more indirect approach. Around 300 BCE, Euclid proved that there are infinitely many prime numbers. Mathematicians have since built on his theorem, proving the same statement for primes that meet additional criteria. (A simple example: Are there an infinite number of primes that don’t contain the number 7?) Over time, mathematicians have made these criteria stricter and stricter. By showing that there are still infinitely many primes that satisfy such increasingly rigid constraints, they’ve been able to learn more about where the primes live. But these kinds of statements are very difficult to prove. “There are not many results like that out there,” said Joni Teräväinen (opens a new tab) of the University of Turku in Finland. Now, two mathematicians — Ben Green (opens a new tab) of the University of Oxford and Mehtaab Sawhney (opens a new tab) of Columbia University — have proved just such a statement for a particularly challenging type of prime number. Their proof, which was posted online (opens a new tab) in October, doesn’t just sharpen mathematicians’ understanding of the primes. It also makes use of a set of tools from a very different area of mathematics, suggesting that those tools are far more powerful than mathematicians imagined, and potentially ripe for applications elsewhere. “It’s terrific,” said John Friedlander (opens a new tab) of the University of Toronto. “It really surprised me that they did this.” A Trying Set Mathematicians tend to study families of primes that are just complicated enough to be interesting but still simple enough to make progress on. They might try to prove, for instance, that there are infinitely many primes that are 500 units apart. Or that we can build infinitely many primes by adding up the squares of other numbers. Mehtaab Sawhney realized, to his surprise, that work he’d done earlier this year was key to resolving a major, seemingly unrelated problem in number theory. Courtesy of Mehtaab Sawhney This last constraint has been particularly useful, guiding centuries of mathematical progress. In 1640, Pierre de Fermat conjectured that there are infinitely many primes that can be formulated by squaring two whole numbers and adding them together. (The prime number 13, for instance, can be written as 22 + 32.) Leonhard Euler later proved it. But tweaking the question just a little bit — by insisting that one of the numbers you’re squaring be odd, perhaps, or a perfect square — makes the problem much harder. “The more you constrain a set, the harder it is to find primes in it,” Green said. In the 19th century, research on these kinds of statements led to the development of much of modern number theory. In the 20th century, it helped inspire one of the most ambitious mathematical efforts to date, the Langlands program. And in the 21st, work on these sorts of primes has continued to yield new techniques and insights. In 2018, Friedlander and Henryk Iwaniec (opens a new tab) of Rutgers University asked if there are infinitely many primes of the form p2 + 4q2, where both p and q must also be prime. (For example, 41 = 52 + 4 × 22.) The constraint turned out to be particularly challenging to deal with. But if mathematicians could solve the problem, they’d succeed in exerting a new level of control over the primes — exactly what they’d hoped to do all along. A Fruitful Visit Neither Green nor Sawhney had played this type of prime-counting game before. But they both had experience in studying the strange patterns the primes give rise to. In July, the two mathematicians met at a conference in Edinburgh. Sawhney, who had just finished graduate school, had always admired Green. A seminal result Green had proved 20 years earlier was “one of the things that brought me into the subject,” Sawhney said. “I was like ‘Oh man, how could you do this?’” Green was impressed by the younger mathematician, too. “Mehtaab is an exceptional, exceptional mathematician,” he said. “He knows everything somehow.” The two decided to collaborate. They just had to find the right problem to work on. After some discussion, they settled on Friedlander and Iwaniec’s conjecture. Ben Green, a mathematician at the University of Oxford, is fascinated by the mysterious patterns that characterize the prime numbers. Liubov Yevenok Green invited Sawhney to Oxford for a week. They knew that to prove similar conjectures, mathematicians usually relied on a particular suite of counting techniques. But because the primes in their problem were so strictly defined, Green and Sawhney couldn’t figure out a way to get this traditional tool kit to work. Instead, they hoped to prove the conjecture in a more roundabout way — by making a mathematical chess move of sorts. But first, they’d have to prove that they were allowed to make the move in the first place. By the end of Sawhney’s visit, he and Green had figured out how to do that — which allowed them to prove the conjecture. To do so, they ended up making a surprising connection to another area of math. Try Another Set It wasn’t possible for Green and Sawhney to directly count the number of primes made by squaring two other primes and adding them together. But what if they loosened their constraint just a bit? They realized they could solve a slightly weaker version of their problem — one where the numbers getting squared only had to be “roughly” prime. Rough primes are much easier to find than primes. Say you want to count all the rough primes between 1 and 200. First, consider a handful of the smallest primes — like 2, 3, 5 and 7. Then list all the numbers that aren’t divisible by those primes. These numbers are the rough primes. In this case, you end up with 50 rough primes: 46 of them are actually prime, while the remaining four (121, 143, 169 and 187) are not. Because the rough primes are much less randomly distributed than the primes are, they’re significantly easier to work with. “The rough primes are a set that we understand much, much better,” Sawhney said. Tamar Ziegler’s seminal work on prime numbers allowed researchers to port a mathematical technique called a Gowers norm into a new field. Andrea Kane/Institute for Advanced Study Green and Sawhney proved that there are infinitely many primes that can be made by squaring two rough primes and adding them together. They now just had to show that this statement would imply the problem they actually wanted to solve: There are also infinitely many primes that can be written as the sum of squares of actual primes. But that wasn’t obvious. They’d have to analyze a special set of functions, called Type I and Type II sums, for each version of their problem, then show that the sums were equivalent no matter which constraint they used. Only then would Green and Sawhney know they could substitute rough primes into their proof without losing information. They soon came to a realization: They could show that the sums were equivalent using a tool that each of them had independently encountered in previous work. The tool, known as a Gowers norm, was developed decades earlier by the mathematician Timothy Gowers (opens a new tab) to measure how random or structured a function or set of numbers is. On its face, the Gowers norm seemed to belong to a completely different realm of mathematics. “It’s almost impossible to tell as an outsider that these things are related,” Sawhney said. But using a landmark result proved in 2018 by the mathematicians Terence Tao (opens a new tab) and Tamar Ziegler (opens a new tab), Green and Sawhney found a way to make the connection between Gowers norms and Type I and II sums. Essentially, they needed to use Gowers norms to show that their two sets of primes — the set built using rough primes, and the set built using real primes — were sufficiently similar. As it turned out, Sawhney knew how to do this. Earlier this year, in order to solve an unrelated problem, he had developed a technique for comparing sets using Gowers norms. To his surprise, the technique was just good enough to show that the two sets had the same Type I and II sums. Related: ‘Sensational’ Proof Delivers New Insights Into Prime Numbers The Hidden Connection That Changed Number Theory Teenager Solves Stubborn Riddle About Prime Number Look-Alikes With this in hand, Green and Sawhney proved Friedlander and Iwaniec’s conjecture: There are infinitely many primes that can be written as p2 + 4q2. Ultimately, they were able to extend their result to prove that there are infinitely many primes belonging to other kinds of families as well. The result marks a significant breakthrough on a type of problem where progress is usually very rare. Even more important, the work demonstrates that the Gowers norm can act as a powerful tool in a new domain. “Because it’s so new, at least in this part of number theory, there is potential to do a bunch of other things with it,” Friedlander said. Mathematicians now hope to broaden the scope of the Gowers norm even further — to try using it to solve other problems in number theory beyond counting primes. “It’s a lot of fun for me to see things I thought about some time ago have unexpected new applications,” Ziegler said. “It’s like as a parent, when you set your kid free and they grow up and do mysterious, unexpected things.” Share this article Copied!

[...] By insisting that one of the numbers you’re squaring be odd, perhaps [...] makes the problem much harder. Does it? For any number a, a^2 = a (mod 2), and primes greater than 2 are all odd, so if a prime p = a^2 + b^2, doesn't one of a or b have to be odd? Reducing mod 2, p = 1 (mod 2), a^2 + b^2 = 1 (mod 2), a + b = 1 (mod 2), so either a = 0 (mod 2) and b = 1 (mod 2) or vice-versa? edit: If Euler proved infinitely many such primes exist then \"With this in hand, Green and Sawhney proved Friedlander and Iwaniec’s conjecture: There are infinitely many primes that can be written as p^2 + 4q^2.\" makes no sense without a further condition of p or q, let (in my notation) a=p be odd and b=2q be even.

It is a search for a divide and conquer algorithm. So when people learn how to decompose and put together new problems there is a source for new knowledge. One of the most trivial examples is how if you can factorize a polynomial into factors you have a simple way to solve for the roots of that polynomial by solving the smaller problem of finding the roots of the factors and the union of all roots is the root of the initial polynomial. In that example the three parts: decompose, solve subproblems and finally compose the final solution are clearly exposed. Nowadays we are wondering if LLM are going to be the next prime numbers. The question is if solving the language problem is going to provide us the key for solving the AGI problem. We still don't know what is the equivalent of a prime for a LLM, that is the smaller independent part that allow it to express some knowledge, the pieces could be embeddings or the topology of the layers or some new insight. Some more random ideas, just like Norvig see python as a more practical Lisp, the basic ideas from prime numbers impregnate a great part of mathematics. You can be really far from the root but the principles are always with you, primes are a second nature, you have internalized all their properties and dynamically you learn to see primes like features in many fields (prime ideals, spectrum of a ring, points in commutative algebra). The problem of how many primes (in relation to positive integers) is like wondering whether a given decomposition exists in a general sense that could allow us to solve the general problem. So few primes implies that the theory could solve some kind of problems but not many. What are LLMs number?, that is the question if solving the language problem will allow us to solve some very general problems, like a good approximation to AGI. The problem of whether LLMS will open the way to AGI could be the next Riemann hypothesis once we succeed in defining what is a prime number in relation to a LLM. We are trying to prove escalating laws for how LLM improve when increasing the number of parameters, this is like trying to guess the convergence of an infinite serie by using a finite sum. The analogous of a Riemann hypothesis could be defining certain kind of LLM and conjecturing if it could obtain AGI pass some threshold for the number of parameters. Edited: Sorry for being overly verbose this mornig! reply DemocracyFTW2 10 hours agoprev> the primes aren’t random. They’re completely determined I wonder how true this statement is but it probably also relies on the understanding of the word 'random'. In the colloquial sense, it is certainly true in the sense that (truly) 'random' means 'occurring without (discernible) rules'. However, in a stricter definition 'random' means (if I'm not mistaken, hobby-thinker here) just \"a given set of numbers S is called random with respect to a set of binary tests T when all individual procedures in T yield a positive outcome\". That is, you can only ever a finite set S and test against a finite set T, meaning the algorithm that generated your random-looking set S can, potentially, always be amended to creep closer to overcome the failed tests (and the reverse is also true: one can, potentially, always move the goalposts and add another test to T to make a set fail that used to pass). Ultimately, then, randomness—where it is not occurring eo ipso as in radioactive decay—is always a relative (S WRT T), social (people must agree), and finite (can't test against unseen members of S and, per precondition, can't give a rule to cover infinity as in 'divisible by eleven') procedure (that may or may not practically terminate). In other words, once we settle on a given set of tests T to determine what is random, one can (potentially) always come up with an algorithm that passes the tests, thus looks random though it is determined. reply griffzhowl 8 hours agoparentI think that just shows that those tests for randomness can just tell you when something is not random, not when it's actually random. There are problems, I think, about giving a rigorous definition of random, but I think most would agree that if you have an algorithm that predicts with certainty what the next element in a sequence will be, then that sequence isn't random. reply DemocracyFTW2 54 minutes agorootparentThen what about the digits of π? Wikipedia says that \"The decimal digits of π appear to be randomly distributed,[a] but no proof of this conjecture has been found\"; note [a]: \"In particular, π is conjectured to be a normal number, which implies a specific kind of statistical randomness on its digits in all bases.\" So that sounds pretty random to me, yet there are algorithms that give you π in its decimal form, and as far as I can remember there are even ways to compute the n-th digit of π without having to compute the preceding ones—which sounds pretty determined to me. reply fruit_snack 14 hours agoprevAll this research into prime numbers and for what?

I know many nowadays believe that the sole goal of humanity ought to be the increase of shareholder value, even if said increase is at odds with human survival on this planet.

Investigating primes is nearly as old as mathematics itself and its reasonable to assume other ideas where discovered in the hopes of applying them to various problems incorporating prime numbers. From a practical, applied, perspective, “understanding” primes, that is making their “hidden” structure a known “truth”, would either confirm or deny the Riemann hypothesis wherein many other conjectures that assume the hypothesis to be true would also be “truely” known. Or from TFA: > …In the 19th century, research on these kinds of statements led to the development of much of modern number theory. In the 20th century, it helped inspire one of the most ambitious mathematical efforts to date, the Langlands program. And in the 21st, work on these sorts of primes has continued to yield new techniques and insights. > …Their[the article’s sunbjects’] proof, which was posted online (opens a new tab) in October, doesn’t just sharpen mathematicians’ understanding of the primes.

Something about it I find humbling and makes me think about the archetype of mathematicians that lose their minds to numbers. reply ykonstant 9 hours agorootparentIt is mesmerizing, but do note it was not a single mind that produced this insight. It was centuries of work. It involved, among many others: 1. Newton and the Bernoulli family developing the theory of infinite series and connecting them to discrete sequences, 2. Wallis developing the first notions of infinite products and demonstrating the first non-trivial convergence of such, 3. Euler solving the Basel problem and linking the zeta function to the prime numbers (giving a new proof of the infinitude of primes), 4. Gauss and Eisenstein further using Euler's ideas and their own unique algebraic insights to understand primes in arithmetic progressions, and finally 5. Riemann taking the zeta function, putting it in the complex plane, revealing the unifying theme connecting the previous discoveries and making his own fundamentally new discoveries with the explicit formula. And of course the development only accelerated from that point on. reply throwawaycities 1 hour agorootparentThat’s exactly how I begin to put it into context and rationalize this kind of work - he was a mathematician so this the kind of thing he worked on, and he was also working on a body of maths and knowledge.

Any maths-y field of study that has the concept of decomposition also has the concept of primality, usually in a way that relates to primality in the natural numbers. This means anything we learn about prime numbers also extends to those other fields of study. reply puzzledobserver 10 hours agoparentprevI am not a mathematician, but here is a motivation I read somewhere some years ago. There are basically two ways to produce big numbers: add two small numbers, or multiply two small numbers. You can produce all positive integers by starting with zero and repeatedly adding one. You can almost do the same thing with multiplication too, except for these pesky primes, which are somehow atomic. Naturally then, one might ask: (a) How many primes are there? (b) How frequently do they occur? (c) Can we look at a number and determine whether it is a prime? Now consider: Despite being among the oldest of the mathematical disciplines, there are still open problems about primes that can be explained to high school students. Also, multiplication and addition are not simply operations that are of interest with respect to integers, but similar ideas apply to a bunch of other domains too. Polynomials, for example. So primality and primality-like ideas are like catnip for mathematicians. reply philipov 13 hours agoparentprevIf I told you that all the world's cryptographic security is founded on the study of prime numbers, would it be impressive enough? reply gpm 12 hours agorootparentI'd point you at AES :P (Not to say that the study of prime numbers isn't hugely important to most of cryptography) reply adrian_b 7 hours agorootparentActually AES, unlike more ad-hoc block ciphers, is based on the theory of finite fields, including GF(8) that is used for its non-linear component. The theory of finite fields is based on the theory of prime numbers, because the finite fields are sets of residues modulo a prime number or modulo a power of a prime number. The theory of finite fields is involved in the design of many other block cipher functions or secure hash functions and also in the design of the most important message-authentication methods, like GCM, which is used to authenticate this HTML page on the HN site. So prime numbers are important in most cryptographic applications, not only in asymmetric cryptography, like Diffie-Hellman or RSA. Prime numbers are used in one way or another for the transmission of any HTTPS data packet, not only in the key establishment phase of a TLS connection. reply thorel 3 hours agorootparent> The theory of finite fields is based on the theory of prime numbers, because the finite fields are sets of residues modulo a prime number or modulo a power of a prime number. It is note quite correct that the finite field of order p^k is the set of residues modulo p^k when k > 1. Instead this field is obtained as a splitting field of the field of order p (which is the set of residues mod p). reply nostoc 4 hours agorootparentprevAES is kinda useless for securing communications without assymetric crypto, unless you want to be sending keys by courrier. reply SAI_Peregrinus 1 hour agorootparentFine, ECC doesn't care much about primes, and is asymmetric. reply adrian_b 2 hours agorootparentprevWith asymmetric crypto, you must also send by courier the root certificates (downloading Chrome or Firefox just fulfills the role of a courier that is not very trustworthy). There exists absolutely no method of secure communication that does not depend on a piece of information that is transmitted separately, through a presumed trustworthy courier. All the existing methods only attempt to minimize the amount of information that must be sent through the secure courier. With symmetric crypto without digital signatures but with some kind of Diffie-Hellman, you must send by courier only a pre-shared key that is used only for computing message-authentication codes that are used only in the couple of packets used in a key-exchange algorithm, when establishing a secure connection. Using only symmetric crypto, secure communication can be performed in pretty much the same way as with asymmetric crypto, by generating fresh random session keys for every connection. The only difference is that the key exchange packets are authenticated with a MAC using a pre-shared key, instead of being authenticated with digital signatures and a chain of certificates going to trusted root certificates. If for some weird reason one would not want to use a Diffie-Hellman variant (e.g. with elliptic curves) to protect the session keys, one could use another pre-shared key only for encrypting the key-exchange packets. There are only two advantages for asymmetric crypto, when used for secure communication connections. The first is provided by Diffie-Hellman in any of its variants, which ensures perfect forward secrecy, i.e. even knowing all the content of some sessions, including their secret keys, that does not allow the decryption of other sessions. Without Diffie-Hellman, if the pre-shared encryption key that is used to protect the key exchange packets is captured, all recorded sessions could be decrypted. This can be only partially avoided by changing that key frequently, which would prevent the decryption of past sessions, but not the decryption of future sessions. The second advantage is provided by the authentication of the key exchange with digital signatures instead of MACs based on pre-shared keys, which is the possibility of half authentication, where the server is authenticated based on the certificates provided by it, but the client is not authenticated, which is the most frequent kind of secure communication used on the Internet. For communication inside a closed environment, i.e. a private network, using key exchange authentication based on pre-shared keys (but with elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman for protecting the session keys) can be simpler, faster and more secure than using digital signatures and certificates. While in the beginning I have used your metaphor about sending a pre-shared key or the root certificates by courier, the normal mode of transferring pre-shared authentication keys is by initial physical pairing (e.g. cable connection) of the devices that must be able of communicating securely between themselves. reply tgv 12 hours agorootparentprevAnd https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography reply chr1 11 hours agorootparentPrime numbers and elliptic curves are much more connected than one might expect.

That is to say, we adopt the shorthand '466', because we don't want to write down almost 500 1's each time we reference it. (think of it like very bad roman numerals..) In this perspective, where we ignore 'ordinary' numbers like 466, you might argue that prime numbers are more real, because they really 'do' something (that is, construct composite numbers, like the example with 1 above.) You could have a thought experiment of a world, in which we never developed arabic numerals or roman numerals, but instead did all our math directly on prime numbers. It would be a weird world, but still, you might imagine it :-) reply covofeee 9 hours agoparentprevFor the researchers - because it is fun most likely, and they get paid for it. For society, I am glad we live in a society where some money is skimmed off for curiousity. But for a pratical reasons - this stuff (or some other bet) rears up as useful years down the line for something practical. Maybe some kind of cryptography or making quantum computing feasible... who knows! Imaginary numbers are pretty useful in science, and they probably seemed exotic when they first were talked about. reply Jevon23 7 hours agoparentprevWhy bother with research into fundamental physics? Is there some deeper truth about the prime numbers hidden in the universe? reply lubujackson 12 hours agoparentprevSome good answers here, but I hate that this has been downvoted. It is a valid and reasonable question - we shouldn't be downvoting questions like some echo chamber Reddit thread. Prime numbers are a core and mysterious numeric progression that has the unique property of being very taxing to determine the factors of any sufficiently large number. This is why they are used in cryptography. Investigations into the nature of primes has produced many mathematical tools and they have bridged many different areas of mathematics together. But the simplest answer is that prime numbers are a tantalizing mystery that is easy for anyone to understand. The deeper you dig, the deeper the hole gets and it almost doesn't matter if a satisfying \"answer\" is ever found. Primes are a McGuffin that has led to countless discoveries. reply keepamovin 12 hours agoparentprevYes. You shouldn't be downvoted because it's a reasonable question and opens things up for fascinating exploration. I guess there's many things interesting about it, but I see it like: prime numbers are the fundamental pattern of magnitudes, where the next prime is the first place that no multiples of any previous magnitude (prime or not) would ever land on. In other words, if you took any previous magnitude (ie, any number less than that next prime), and copied it over edge to edge, the edge would never line up with that next prime. Because counting and magnitude is so simple and fundamental to the space of concepts and even to reality, it's pretty fascinating that this extremely simple to describe pattern, is nevertheless hard to create a description for that's more concise than including all previous primes. And I think people like finding that kind of 'shorter' description, as it indicates a deeper understanding, a new way of looking at reality that you didn't see before. And when we see that, it will probably be very useful to many other things. It's fascinating to reflect on all that, and also on how this fundamental pattern of magnitudes, their 'self-similar but scaling' structure, also relates to the 'compressibility' of the number line and information theory. That's what I think. I think everyone can find their own interest in there, there's probably a lot of ways to look at it. :) reply reedf1 9 hours agoprev [–] >> But of course, the primes aren’t random.

What surprises me is that it sounds like being generated with AI. Am I the only one who thinks so? Just read this paragraph: \"In conclusion, while managing output size limitations in LLMs presents significant challenges, it also drives innovation in application design and optimization strategies. By implementing techniques such as context chunking, efficient prompt templates, and graceful fallbacks, developers can mitigate these limitations and enhance the performance and cost-effectiveness of their applications. As the technology evolves, advancements in contextual awareness, token efficiency, and memory management will further empower developers to build more robust and scalable LLM-powered systems. It is crucial to stay informed about these developments and continuously adapt to leverage the full potential of LLMs while addressing their inherent constraints.\" reply simonw 18 hours agoprevIt feels a little risk to me to construct a book like this with so many LangChain examples - my impression of LangChain is that it's still a project with a quick rate of development that might not stay stable, though maybe I'm wrong about that. reply zbyforgotp 17 hours agoparentLangChain is great for finding out who has a clue. reply WesleyJohnson 4 hours agorootparentHow is this helpful? Not everyone can keep up with the rapidly shifting world of AI; it's worse than JavaScript. People have day jobs that don't revolve around AI and don't have the bandwidth to devote endless hours trying to keep up, while still getting work done that makes money for the business they're in. I read through the article and it provided a lot of helpful information on the pitfalls with LLMs which, based on the title, is its intended purpose. I didn't take it as a shining recommendation for LangChain. If your point is that suggesting LangChain means they're not keeping up, as someone else stated, and because of that the other information is probably dated as well - that's far more helpful. I wouldn't mind seeing a current guide on pitfalls and practical examples of interacting with LLMs with raw python - from someone who \"has a clue\". reply knowsuchagency 1 hour agorootparentprevAgreed. I wrote my own LLM abstraction library in a few hundred lines of code: https://github.com/knowsuchagency/promptic reply factormeta 13 hours agorootparentprevFrom a developer with extensive database ETL experience, is it still necceary to learn or use LangChain? Would it be just easier to load directly to vector db? reply lgas 12 hours agorootparentIt was never necessary to use it. It's handy for exploratory work and studying thee patterns of how they glued stuff together behind the scenes, but once you know what you want to build it's another bloated abstraction that's just in the way. reply mritchie712 1 hour agorootparent> bloated abstraction that's just in the way I agree with this, but would argue it's not even useful for exploratory work. Most of it's function can be generated in a single prompt for your use case. reply gr3ml1n 12 hours agorootparentprevLangChain was the first big attempt at a cohesive LLM application framework. As a result, it's terrible. If someone is seriously suggesting using it, they aren't keeping up. reply Uehreka 11 hours agorootparentSo what are the people who are “keeping up” using? No one ITT is saying what the thing that replaced LangChain is. reply jackmpcollins 11 hours agorootparentIf you are using Python, check out the package I've been building, magentic https://github.com/jackmpcollins/magentic It supports structured outputs and streaming, and aims to avoid making unnecessary abstractions (but might require some more understanding of LLM patterns as a result). Also recently released is pydantic-ai, which is also based around pydantic / structured outputs, though works at level of \"agents\". https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai reply baobabKoodaa 2 hours agorootparentprev> No one ITT is saying what the thing that replaced LangChain is. LangChain never solved a real problem to begin with, so there's nothing that needs to be replaced. Just write your own Python code that does the same thing that LangChain needs 10 layers of abstraction to do. reply oersted 8 hours agorootparentprevFrankly, just Python. LLM generation is just a function call, fetching from a vector db is just a function call. LLMs are hard to tame at scale, the focus is on tightly controlling the LLM inputs, making sure it has the information it needs to be accurate, and having detailed observability over outputs and costs. For that last part this new wave of AI observability tools can help (Helicone, Langsmith, W&B Weave...). Frameworks like LangChain obscure the exact inputs and outputs and when the LLM is called. Fancy agentic patterns and one-size-fits-all RAG are expensive and their effectiveness in general is dubious. It's important to tightly engineer the prompt for every individual use-case and to think of it as a low-level input-output call, just like coding a good function, rather than a magical abstract intelligent being. In practice, I prefer to keep the control and simplicity of vanilla Python so I can focus on the actually difficult part of prompting the LLM well. reply spacemanspiff01 8 hours agorootparentWhat are your thoughts on dspy? reply oersted 8 hours agorootparentIt has caught my attention, I keep hearing about it as a new industry standard, I keep meaning to try it. The reason why I keep procrastinating it is that, again, experience has shown me that LLMs are not really at a point where you can afford to abstract away the prompting. At least in the work I have been doing (large-scale unstructured data extraction and analysis), direct control over the actual input string is quite critical to getting good results. I also need fine-grained control over costs. The DSPy pitch of automagically optimizing a pipeline of prompts sounds costly and hard to troubleshoot and iteratively improve by hand when it inevitably doesn't work as well as you need it to out-of-the-box, which is a constant with AI. But don't get me wrong, I know I sound quite skeptical, but I intend to keep giving all these advancements a serious try, I'm sure one will actually be a big upgrade eventually. reply NeutralCrane 5 hours agorootparentprevIn my opinion, utterly useless and I put it in the same bucket as Langchain. Lots of grandiose claims but doesn’t actually solve any problems people have. I think we are at a stage where people are so eager to build something around LLMs to become the next shovel-maker, that a lot of what is being built doesn’t actually serve anyone’s needs. reply NeutralCrane 5 hours agorootparentprevTo be honest, I think a lot of people realize that what Langchain is doing is providing a small amount of value in the form of a huge amount of abstraction, which means it can be convenient for very simple off the shelf solutions, and a huge headache for anything else. Most people realize the value add if Langchain can be recreated with a few lines of code, and end up just building their own. reply pkkkzip 16 hours agorootparentprevi think this is an excellent litmus test. Anyone caught pushing langchain signals pedantry and should be completely ignored. reply d4rkp4ttern 5 hours agorootparentIndeed, it has become the LLM equivalent of IBM, as in -- \"No one ever got fired for choosing LangChain\". A certain well-known ML person even runs a course on LangChain, as if it's a \"fundamental\" thing to know about LLMs. I was also surprised/disappointed to see that the otherwise excellent \"Hands-on Large Language Models\" book from O'Reilly has extensive examples using this library. In Apr 2023 we (CMU/UW-Madison researchers) looked into this lib to build a simple RAG workflow that was slightly different from the canned \"chains\" like RetrievalQAConversation or others, and ended up wasting time hunting docs and notebooks all over the place and going up and down class hierarchies to find out what exactly was going on. We decided it shouldn't have to be this hard, and started building Langroid as an agent-oriented LLM programming framework. In Langroid you set up a ChatAgent class which encapsulates an LLM-interface plus any state you'd like. There's a Task class that wraps an Agent and allows inter-agent communication and tool-handling. We have devs who've found our framework easy to understand and extend for their purposes, and some companies are using it in production (some have endorsed us publicly). A quick tour gives a flavor of Langroid: https://langroid.github.io/langroid/tutorials/langroid-tour/ reply a_bonobo 16 hours agorootparentprevCould you both expand on what you mean? I've built some useful stuff with langchain v1 but gave up on porting it to v2, looked like too much work. reply tonyoconnell 16 hours agorootparentLangchain abstracts too much and you can't really see what's going on or control the flow of data with real precision. They are fixing that though and now you have much better visibility into what's being inferred. I think Langchain is pretty useful though, especially if you want to integrate with something quickly. reply _neil 15 hours agorootparentI think this is the reasonable answer. Langchain gets a lot of derision and rightly so but it does have uses for prototyping. It’s also a good resource for learning the landscape specifically because of the integrations. I haven’t used it in a while so I’m not familiar with the most recent updates. reply mavelikara 11 hours agorootparentprevThanks for explaining. reply 3abiton 14 hours agorootparentprevIt's unreasonable to expect that everyone is on top of every latest LLM advancement. reply agnishom 16 hours agoprevSo this is the modern day equivalent of an O'Reilly book with the title \"Mastering LLMs\"? reply msp26 19 hours agoprevLooks fantastic, thanks for the deep dive on structured output.

    "commentBody": "What every systems programmer should know about concurrency (2020) [pdf] (bitbashing.io)140 points by ibobev 15 hours agohidepastfavorite63 comments w10-1 9 minutes agoThis 2020 review carefully summarizes the overly complex and error-prone outcome of programming language memory model changes in the early 2010's. It's tempting to master such tricky details, but doing so almost inevitably leads to the costliest bugs ever: rare data corruption that's impossible to detect and reproduce. Russ Cox in 2021 offered a higher-level insightful history of evolving hardware and software support for concurrency, discussed just yesterday https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42397737 His take (as I take it): systems programmers should only use sequentially-consistent atomics (and only via well-tested concurrent data structures). Easy peasy! ;p reply zelphirkalt 5 hours agoprevHm. Seems very C++ oriented. Talks about specific keywords of C++ and their semantics. Not even mentioned \"actor\" in the whole document. \"immutable\" not found. Seems rather like an very incomplete view of a C++ programmer, wanting to raise it to \"systems programmer\". reply mattgreenrocks 2 hours agoparent> Seems rather like an very incomplete view of a C++ programmer, wanting to raise it to \"systems programmer\". I'm not sure I understand this comment. C++ is one of the very few languages that can be used for programming everything from a web server to a garbage collector to firmware. There's no \"raising\" going on here. reply cjfd 4 hours agoparentprevThis document seems to be at a lower level. An actor model would be implemented in terms of these primitives. These primitives are available in many languages. Immutable is kind of irrelevant in a discussion of multi-threading because immutable data has no problems in this regard. Which, of course, in a way also makes it relevant because one prevents issues. Ultimately one cannot have just immutable data because the computer would not be allowed to do anything. This document would be about data that cannot be immutable. But the complaint sounds a bit like an article about assembly language getting the complaint that it does not explain how to implement a word processor. reply adrianN 3 hours agorootparentOf course you can have only immutable data, you just need suitable monads. reply kccqzy 1 hour agorootparentPlenty of languages have immutable data without monads or even being statically typed. Clojure is a fine example. And there is also the somewhat popular https://immutable-js.com/ that brings the benefits of immutable data to JavaScript. reply hyperpape 1 hour agorootparentprevThere's disagreement about what exactly makes you a systems programmer, but dealing with the reality that memory is finite is definitely a requirement. You need mutation or garbage collection (and systems programming is the kind of environment where that's not just \"someone else's problem\"). reply swatcoder 1 hour agoparentprevIn this context, \"systems programmer\" means someone who writes software with tight, direct affinity to the underlying system (i.e. hardware, OS). C and C++ still dominate that world by huge measure. Presumably, you're thinking of systems in the more abstract sense: systems of more or less pure software components that model some domain. That's just not what this article is about. reply motorest 2 hours agoparentprev> Hm. Seems very C++ oriented. Talks about specific keywords of C++ and their semantics. Not even mentioned \"actor\" in the whole document. \"immutable\" not found. The term \"systems programmer\" is right there in the title. They are also the very first words in the article. The examples are in C++, but the whole document focuses on both C and C++. The article clearly focuses on the primitives, as it should. It's undoubtedly a great article on the subject, but nitpickers have to nitpick, and one-uppers have to one-up. I look forward to read your article on the topic. reply ajross 5 hours agoparentprevTo be fair most of the consensus-imposed[1] interface to memory ordering semantics was developed as part of the C++ memory model standardization process. GCC/clang have imported them as extensions for C code, etc... [1] Which is not to say \"best\". My standard complaint in these threads is that the C++ ordering semantics are a mess designed to make things easier for compiler writers to target architectures with variant ordering guarantees and not for algorithm developers to create correct code. But lockless code is much harder to write than compilers! It's a bad trade. ARM had this right decades ago with simple read/write barriers, which are vastly easier to understand when reading code. reply packetlost 3 hours agorootparentRust also adopted the C/C++ memory ordering semantics, for better or worse. reply ajross 2 hours agorootparentEveryone has, even the hardware vendors are treating these rules as the golden standard to which they can optimize and conform. So it's too late. But it's still a shame. The acquire/release semantics make perfect sense for locks, because that's what it was designed for. Designing anything else with them is extremely difficult, and in practice such work tends to lean heavily on the full-barrier \"sequentially consistent\" primitive instead. The older read/write barrier instructions were much simpler. (And x86 is simpler still, with just one reordering rule to worry about and a single idea of serializing instructions to regulate it). reply menaerus 18 minutes agorootparentHardware vendors adhering to C++ memory model to design their chips? I think you got it backwards or I misunderstood your point. Memory barriers exist because of how cache memory hierarchy and coherency protocols are implemented in multi-core chips. And not to \"optimize and conform to C++ memory model\". C++ memory model is there to make life of a programmer easier across different micro-architectures because memory model of the micro-architecture is what differs. reply gpderetta 1 hour agorootparentprevI think it is just a generational/educational difference. I learned lock-free programming around the time c+11 was being standardized, and the acquire/release model seems very natural to me and easier to understand and model algorithms in it than the barrier based model. reply immibis 59 minutes agorootparentprevC tries to be everything to everyone. It has to be able to target every architecture, within certain limits. It took them a long time to standardize on two's-complement signed integers - they could only do that after the whole industry had migrated to two's-complement signed integers as they are the technically best way to represent signed integers. The x86 is the weird architecture that tried to keep existing programs working when they moved to multicore. Most other architectures implemented whatever is easier to implement in hardware, and compilers have to target that. And the compiler can't simulate a strong memory model on top of a weak one, because that means lots of overhead for every memory operation and that's not what C does. reply msanlop 6 hours agoprevSpent 4h yesterday looking for a bug in my atomics, and probably 4 more today :^) reply david-gpu 5 hours agoparentBeen there. I don't have advice, only commiseration. reply sebtron 2 hours agoparentprevLast time this happened to me it turned out I made a logic error, the algorithm required a lock but I erroneously thought atomics would do. reply tobyhinloopen 11 hours agoprevEvery time I dip my toes in multithreading in C++, I just get into a world of random crashes and segfaults. It seems unreasonably hard, hah. reply bitbasher 2 hours agoparentIf C++ makes it possible to blow your leg off, multithreading with C++ makes it possible to blow yourself up, along with half your neighborhood and some homes halfway around the country, unexplicitly. reply commandersaki 1 hour agorootparentReally? I don't share either sentiment. I found multithreading in C++ to be pretty mundane, and in fact a lot easier than it probably once was with lambdas. You definitely need to be on top of the multithreading primitives such as atomics, mutex, condition variables, shared_ptr, etc. But otherwise it's pretty straightforward. reply pionaryon 6 hours agoparentprevYou can get pretty far with keeping sharing to an absolute minimum and when you do need to share data, slap a lock free ringbuffer between them to communicate. Pretty simple to get right. reply adrian_b 2 hours agorootparentYou are right, but what you call \"lock free\" is not the same as many other things that are called \"lock free\", even if indeed a ringbuffer needs no locks, so this may be confusing for newbies. I strongly dislike the term \"lock free\", which is really just a marketing term invented by people trying to promote the idea that some algorithms are better than those \"lock-based\", when in fact those \"lock-free\" algorithms were only choosing a different trade-off in performance, which can be better or worse, depending on the application. Even worse is that after the term \"lock free\" has become fashionable, it has also been applied to unrelated algorithms, so now it has become ambiguous, so you cannot know for sure what is meant by it, unless more details are provided. When accessing shared data structures, the accesses are most frequently done in one of three ways. The first is to use mutual exclusion, when the shared data structure is accessed within critical sections and only one thread can execute the critical section at a given time. This method is usually called as lock-based access. The second is to use optimistic access, when the shared data structure is accessed concurrently by many threads, but they are able to detect interference from the other concurrent accesses and they retry their accesses in such cases. This is what is most frequently referred as \"lock free\" access. Compared to mutual exclusion, this access method may be faster in the best cases, but it is much slower in the worst cases, so whether this is a good choice depends on the application. The third method happens when it is possible to partition the shared resource between the threads that access it concurrently, so their concurrent accesses can proceed without fear of interference. This partitioning is usually possible for arrays and for buffers a.k.a. FIFO memories a.k.a. message queues (including one-to-one, many-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many message queues). So your \"lock free ringbuffer\" refers to the third method from above, which is very different from the \"lock free\" algorithms of the second kind from above. Whenever concurrent access to partitioned shared resources is possible, it is much better than accesses with mutual exclusion or optimistic accesses, which require either waiting or retrying, both of which are wasting CPU time. Therefore using correctly-implemented message queues or other kinds of shared buffers is usually the best method to achieve high levels of concurrency, in comparison with other kinds of shared data structures, because it avoids the bottlenecks caused by mutual exclusion or optimistic accesses. reply gpderetta 1 hour agorootparentFWIW, lock-free is an academic term and it is not really about performance. reply revskill 44 minutes agorootparentprevThanks. reply anal_reactor 5 hours agorootparentprevStep 1: use concurrency on a very high level. For example, write an app, and then run 4 instances of it, each working on a quarter of your data. Step 2: when you absolutely need concurrency within one app, try using some library that already solved the issue. For example, there are lots of databases with pretty strong concurrency contracts while still being efficient. Step 3: if you absolutely need custom solution, use a library/language that provides reasonable tools out of the box and keep your logic to minimum. Following the first two steps will solve 95% of your concurrency issues, if you include step 3 it goes to 99%. reply mattgreenrocks 2 hours agoparentprevThe standard library concurrency primitives are still too low-level for a lot of general purpose concurrency needs. IMO, the minimum level of abstraction that you should start with for many apps is a thread-safe queue that dispatches messages with immutable data to one or more worker threads (e.g. actor-like model). You can go lower-level, but it needs to be deliberately chosen. reply Jtsummers 1 hour agorootparentPeople keep reinventing those and thread pools over and over in C++. I've been researching one of our older systems (slated for decommissioning in 2021, as is typical that did not happen). In trying to understand it I have found many areas of concern around how they deal with concurrency, in particular they created their own queue and thread pool. Based on past experience, there's 50/50 chance for each that they were created correctly (with proper concurrency controls), and less than that that the tasks submitted to the thread pool themselves make use of proper concurrency controls rather than assuming that they can read/write whatever they want as if the system were single-threaded. reply rramadass 1 hour agoparentprevThat is just not true and you are being unnecessarily hyperbolic. Even when i was learning/doing concurrency/multi-threading (using pthreads) long ago, i never got \"into a world of random crashes and segfaults\". It was of course challenging but not too difficult. You structure your application following standard usage patterns given in a good book (eg. Butenhof's) and then plug in your app logic in the thread routines. With some experience things get clearer over time and you begin to have an intuitive feel for structuring multi-threaded code. The key is to stay at a high enough level of abstraction appropriate for your usecase (eg. mutexes/semaphores/condition variables) before diving into compiler and hardware level intrinsics/atomics/etc. A good book to study and get a handle on all aspects of Concurrent Programming is Foundations of Multithreaded, Parallel, and Distributed Programming by Gregory Andrews - https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/~greg/mpdbook/ reply nocman 1 hour agorootparentIn fairness the person you were responding to was referring to their own personal experience. They certainly are not the first person to conclude that doing non-trivial concurrent programming is too difficult for them. I agree that it is achievable with an appropriate level of care and experience, but I know there are many very smart people that conclude that multithreaded programming in C++ is too difficult for their taste. Even Rich Hickey, when discussing concurrency in Java/C#/C++ said \"I am tired of trying to get right, because it is simply far too difficult.\" > In particular, talk about shared state, how we do it today, how you do it in C#, Java, or C++, what happens when we get into a multi-threaded context, and specifically what are some of the current solutions for that in those spaces. Locking, in particular. That is something I have done a lot of, over a long period of time, and I am tired of trying to get right, because it is simply far too difficult. ( https://github.com/matthiasn/talk-transcripts/blob/master/Hi... ) reply neonsunset 1 hour agorootparent> Java/C#/C++ These three have different memory models, concurrency primitives and adopted practices...it's odd that they are lobbed together. reply nocman 1 hour agorootparentIt's not odd at all. The underlying problems to be solved are identical. reply nocman 1 hour agorootparentAlso, Rich has many years of experience using all three of those languages. reply neonsunset 1 hour agorootparentThe two out of three have evolved in this area since. reply saagarjha 10 hours agoparentprevConcurrency is hard, unfortunately. C++ just makes it even harder than that. reply sumtechguy 5 hours agorootparentWe had multi CPU stuff in the 90s. C/C++ was dead set on ignoring it for a long time. Every OS had its own way of handling it and all with subtle weird bits that did not act like other OS's. You could not even trust the stdlib or crt to get it right with their globals that could change underneath you. So it was left to the developer. It is much better now but for so long the problem was ignored and now we have decades of 'not sure if I can touch that code'. Also by default C/C++ are fairly open about sharing memory. So it is very easy create race conditions on memory. It would be nice if the base language had a concept of 'locked to a thread' or 'i want to share this with other threads' then the compiler can flag where I have wandered into the weeds for a class so we could catch the race conditions at compile time, at least some sort of warning. Sharing semantics were awful for a long time. stdlib has done some very good things to help clean that up but it is still very easy to share between threads and cause yourself a headache. reply menaerus 9 hours agorootparentprevCPU design makes it inherently hard. C or C++ is just a thin layer above it making no tradeoffs. If you can live with the tradeoff then Rust land or VM-language land is more appropriate. reply jazzypants 9 hours agorootparentprevI hear you have to be pretty tall to be able to do it right.

This isn’t to say that a CS degree is the only path to competence, but it provides structured exposure to concepts like concurrency through coursework, exams, and practical projects.

A programmer that does anything but CRUD for web apps. In the before times the terminology came from system 360 and descendent mainframe systems where the system programmers tended to be intimately involved with the deployment and programming of the operating system and associated \"exits\", and such tasks tended to presume some working knowledge of assembly language (operating systems were very crude at that time...and many shops tended to \"customize\" them if that makes sense...you would sometimes have serious problems with operating system level things and at that time the generic response would be \"contact your systems programmer\", who would either fix it or get in touch with IBM...so TLDR is basically a sysadmin that is good at assembly). Big companies could afford to have systems programmers on staff and needed them because every shop was different and computers were very custom and crude at that point in history. That's where the terminology came from originally but now it has expanded and can mean different things. The \"systems programmers\" terminology was mainly just a differentiation from the more generic \"application programmers\" (who would probably program in COBOL or something similar, doing business related tasks) or \"system operators\" (who would not usually be programmers at all, and would do a lot of what we would now consider sysadmin work). Nowadays it just means anything that isn't bog standard CRUD or frontend web app stuff. The terminology has evolved but has a somewhat similar meaning to when it originated. It's tough to understand exactly without the historical context which is why I have included that. For obvious reasons, this has some overlap with the more modern definition of \"programmers that build systems that other programmed then use\". Because the application programmers on those mainframe systems would be relying on the systems programmers to not screw up their assembly wizardry or else everything would fall apart. reply mdaniel 2 hours agorootparent> so TLDR is basically a sysadmin that is good at assembly So \"devops\" existed even in the mainframe era! :-D reply LAC-Tech 6 hours agoparentprevThe high priest of a low cult reply mattgreenrocks 2 hours agorootparentI cannot fault this remark, however biting it may be. reply crabbone 7 hours agoparentprev [–] For the purpose of job interviews (and not necessarily any kind of sound definition), this means that the position you are looking at will have you dealing with software that implements some operating system services. To give you some examples: you might be working on an SDS product (software-defined storage), perhaps a filesystem, or maybe a network-attached block device etc. that operating system has a way of interacting with and exposing to other software as it's own service. To make it even more concrete: you can write a filesystem in a way that it interfaces with Linux kernel, and, once installed, users will interact with it through VFS interface (so, they don't even have to know they are interacting with your specific product). ZFS is a good example of this kind of software. Similarly, it could be SDN (network), eg. various VPN software s.a. OpenVPN. Or a users / permissions management software (eg. LDAP server, s.a. slapd). Software to manage system services (eg. systemd). Software to manage specialized hardware (on top of drivers) that, again, provides its services through the operating system (eg. nvidia-smi). Or, maybe it's a software that manages memory, terminals, virtualization, containers (eg. DMA over IB, tmux, QEMU, containerd). Sometimes this category is extended to system monitoring or higher-level management tools that still give some kind of general service similar to the one provided by the operating system. Think about SAR or mdadm kind of tools. Or, this could also be testing of operating system services (eg. FIO). Sometimes, this can also mean some kind of administrative tools that perform either more high-level management of operating system (eg. yum, the RHEL package manager), or management of groups of operating systems. Cloud tools can fall into this category (eg. boto3 AWS client). But, this is kind of stretching the definition. ---- So, as per usual in the field of programming... we don't have an authoritative source and a definition for a widely used term. You just have to accept (at least for now), that different people mean different (but often significantly overlapping) things when they use the term and ask more questions to refine what they mean by it. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

AP The health insurance industry’s dirty secret is that it’s no longer selling insurance: It’s selling a crapshoot. The risk of having your health insurance claim denied is roughly 10 times what it was a decade ago. Back then, insurers seldom rejected claims. My health insurance is: UnitedHealthcare nixed 1.1%, Humana 1.9%, Aetna 1.5% in 2013, per the American Medical Association. By 2022, major insurers were refusing to pay, on average, 15% of claims, according to a national survey of hospitals and health-care providers by Premier, an insurance consultant.

But you can’t find out which companies, and that makes choosing a plan a high-stakes gamble. If you’re seriously ill and need costly care, a denied claim could push you into bankruptcy. The Affordable Care Act of 2010 requires the Department of Health and Human Services to monitor claims denials and provide the information to the public. But government officials — coopted by the industry — simply don’t do it. Consumers be damned. Uncle Sam is allowing claims denial to become a major profit center for insurers. The assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson is igniting an outpouring of vitriol against insurers. Alleged killer Luigi Mangione railed in a manifesto against the “corruption and greed” of the industry. No industry malfeasance could ever excuse murder. Period. Even so, it’s past time for companies’ denial rates to be made public. You aren’t really insured if your insurer can deny valid claims with impunity. That is what’s happening, based on information that Kaiser researchers were able get about plans sold on the Affordable Care Act exchanges. ACA plans on average refuse to pay 17% of claims. But the researchers found that numerous insurers nix 30% or more, including Meridian Health Plan of Michigan, United Healthcare of Arizona, and Optimum Choice in Virginia. Celtic Insurance Company in Florida refused 42% of claims in 2021. You can’t really call that insurance. The problem is not unique to ACA plans. Premier’s March 2024 survey found that insurers overall denied 15.7% of Medicare Advantage claims, 15.1% of Medicaid managed care claims and 13.9% of claims from non-government plans. That staggering denial rate should be the first fact any consumer sees when choosing a plan, and plan ratings should include denial rates. Hiding them is an outrage. Insurers cite lack of medical necessity for under 2% of denials, lack of prior authorization for 8%, and about 13.5% for the service not being covered under the plan. But the major reason for denials — “other,” accounting for 76% of them — is a big black hole. Anybody’s guess. Patients rarely appeal — only 0.2% of the time, per Kaiser. An appeal means coaxing your doctor and staff to spend hours filling out forms and making repeated phone calls to joust with an insurance company employee. Few doctors are eager to take on this ordeal. But appeals pay off. In the ACA plans, Kaiser reports that 41% of turn-downs get reversed — an indication that plenty of necessary care covered by plans is being denied. Employers and their workers should be able to get information on how often insurers deny claims, and so should Medicare Advantage plan users. But federal regulators have capitulated to pushback from the industry, and refuse to collect the information. State regulators aren’t any better. State insurance commissioners collect denial data, but with the exception of Connecticut and Vermont, they don’t disclose that information, a ProPublica investigation found. New York state publicizes the number of complaints against insurers, but not actual denial rates — which would be more telling. Nationwide, health coverage for a family of four topped $25,000 this year — a staggering amount. Young families will likely never meet their annual deductible. All they’re getting for their premium is peace of mind — the knowledge that if a terrible illness or accident happens, they’re covered. Truth is, they may not be covered. They may be insured by a company that denies a third or more of all claims. And they won’t know it until it’s too late. Transparency is the only way to make the insurance market fair. President-elect Trump’s health nominees have argued that there’s too much coziness between industry and the federal bureaucracy, with the public paying the price. They’re right — and this is an odious example. Federal regulators need to do what the law requires: Expose companies that take our money and then deny legitimate claims. No new law is needed. Just an order from the top. President Trump, are you listening? Betsy McCaughey is a former lieutenant governor of New York and co-founder of the Committee to Save Our City.

    "commentBody": "Feds help health insurers hide their dirty secret: denials on the rise (nypost.com)136 points by mancerayder 4 hours agohidepastfavorite220 comments foundart 2 hours agoThis is an opinion piece. Its main claim is that the ACA requires denial rates to be available to consumers but they aren't. Additionally, it reports that denial rates have increased 10x in 10 years, based on the following chain: - \"UnitedHealthcare nixed 1.1%, Humana 1.9%, Aetna 1.5% in 2013, per the American Medical Association.\" - \"By 2022, major insurers were refusing to pay, on average, 15% of claims, according to a national survey of hospitals and health-care providers by Premier, an insurance consultant.\" - \"The figure continues to shoot upward, with some companies today denying almost _half_ of all claims, according to researchers at the Kaiser Family Foundation.\" Furthermore, \"few people appeal, but of those that do 41% obtain a reversal\", which suggests the denials may be unfair. I certainly would like to know the denial rates when selecting an insurance provider. As the article says, \"You aren't really insured if your insurer can deny valid claims with impunity.\" Given that the ACA requires this information be provided, it certainly ought to be provided. Then we'd have a much clearer picture. It's an opinion piece on a news site known for inflammatory articles but it reports some interesting information. It would be much nicer if it included references to the research it's based on, but it seems pretty reasonable to me. reply leereeves 2 minutes agoparentExcellent summary. I'd like to address the denials in particular. As the article says: \"No industry malfeasance could ever excuse murder.\" With that in mind, we should remember that every death that happens because a valid lifesaving claim was denied is a kind of murder. The stakes are too high: all claims should be approved, then adjudicated later. Fraud should of course be punished severely (with prison, not merely returning the money), but no one should die to protect insurance companies from fraud. If \"No industry malfeasance could ever excuse murder\" then no amount of fraud could ever excuse denying valid lifesaving claims. reply ethbr1 2 hours agoprevThere's an easy solution to this that the Federal Employee Program (aka FEP) [0] uses -- regular, external accuracy audits. The relevant metric to customers isn't \"What percentage of claims are denied?\" given the substantial amounts of medical claim fraud. It's \"What percentage of claims are denied... that should have been approved?\" So you regularly audit a random sampling of denials, publish the results of that audit transparently, and provide a financial incentive for insurers to keep their numbers below a certain threshold. It's worked pretty well for FEP -- to the extent that FEP insurers typically have segregated operations from the rest of the company and do much better on denial accuracy and other metrics. [0] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Employees_Health_Ben... reply adleyjulian 4 minutes agoparentIt's a question of what we want to measure. There's a metric that represents how much a claimant sees in unexpected costs due to denied claims vs impact on care from the insurer. A denied prior auth results in no unexpected costs but perhaps a change or delay in care. A denied claim to an in network hospital may result in the provider losing revenue but nothing for the claimant. reply toast0 3 hours agoprevI think we need more thorough analysis. Are the denied claims denied in error? The appeals success rate probably indicates that most of the appealed denied claims were denied in error... but appealed claims are a biased sample of denied claims, so it doesn't tell us much about the overall denied claims. In my experience, I've seen some denied claims, because the provider submitted a wrong code. Then the provider submits a new claim with the correct code and it goes through. Given the proliferation of plans, and their sometimes conflicting requirements on medicial coding, I could see that being a big driver of denials increasing over time. As well as a driver of increased administrative costs for providers and insurance companies. reply timmytokyo 3 hours agoparent\"A key congressional committee asked insurance giant Cigna on Tuesday to provide corporate documents so that lawmakers can examine the company’s practice of denying health care claims without ever opening a patient file.\" https://www.propublica.org/article/cigna-health-insurance-de... reply wat10000 3 hours agoparentprevFrom the patient’s point of view, it all looks the same. Treatment that should be covered gets denied. It sounds like the insurance companies have a strong incentive to make their coding and requirements as complicated as possible to increase the error rate so they can deny coverage. I don’t think they should get a pass for those denials. reply OutOfHere 3 hours agoparentprevThat's just code gaming. It's not necessarily an error. Also, numerous legitimate legitimate claims are denied no matter their code. reply toast0 2 hours agorootparentI don't doubt that numerous doubly legitimate claims are denied. What I want is a sense of what the breakdown of the denied claims. Ex: company sends a list of all denied claims. Auditor picks 100 randomly, gets the files for each and researches those denials to classify the denial as reasonable or not and whatever other categories apply. reply johnohara 2 hours agoprevIn December 2021, the American Hospital Association issued the following statement regarding United Healthcare's plans to closely scrutinize medical claims for ER visits. [0] UHC subsequently reversed itself and delayed the plan for 6 months. That was in 2021-2022. It's now 2024-2025. Around that time many insurers, not just UHC, began implementing AI-assisted claims adjudication. It was a bumpy ride with a steep learning curve and probably took a couple of years to fine-tune the algorithms and learning models. Especially as the Covid-19 claims tsunami subsides. No matter tho', every claim paid is considered a loss by insurers. Every claim denied is considered a small step towards mitigating those losses. In the U.S., medical reimbursement is a push and shove, shove and push battle fought inch by inch with high-speed data systems. It has been that way for a long time.

France, Germany, and Japan have health systems similar to the ACA, with the following differences: insurance is nonprofit with an effective mandate, there's a national price list for medical services, and claim denials are prohibited for anything on the list. Germany has an especially effective digital system that guarantees payment within a week. All three systems get better health results than the US, by measures like survival time after diagnosis of major disease. And all three spend a significantly lower percentage of their GDP on healthcare. Source: The Healing of America by T.R.

This is true to some extent, but the share of medical providers that over-bill and over-treat really doesn't justify the way the insurance industry does business. It's a false equivalence. reply mancerayder 49 minutes agorootparentprevYes, but in my opinion it falls to the patient to figure out the details and absorb the risk. That's the messed up part. That insurance providers and medical services might disagree on pricing or whatnot is an inevitability. What's not fair is throwing ordinary people under the bus to deal with it, which for many reasons is risky and can ruin lives. reply fny 2 hours agorootparentprevYes, insurance companies deny claims, but this is mostly because they don't have the money to pay for things most of their money is spent on care in the first place: they're forced to optimize and people get hurt in the process. Providers do far more damage. UHCs profit margins are only 6%, their operating costs are extremely low[0], and if you look across G7 insurers in the US pay more than the government does in every country but France![1] Compare this to HCA which makes an average margin of 10% with far higher administrative costs. The CEO of HCA makes $20M, Brian Thompson made $10M by contrast. This is not to say we (and insurance companies) don't spend astronomically more than other countries: providers are to blame for this, and I have seen their nonsense first hand: - They keep people alive overnight to charge insurance more - Some hospitals use ML (!) to optimize ICD codes for billing. Most do this by hand: there's literally a job and training to be an ICD coder. - They allow people to deteriorate (e.g. dialysis) to charge more (no preventative care.) I have seen a hospital only provide preemptive care to patients at risk of dialysis because they were part of their own insurance pool - Their administraive expenses are far higher. - They test and provide unnecessary care. - Physician shortage is in part caused by limited residency spots, a dumb bachelors requirement, and high tuition costs. These barriers to entry are imposed by physicians. - Uneccesary tech and equipment upgrades (e.g. we need to replace your knee with a new knee) - Having to deal with tons of different insurance companies: not their fault but they don't know how to handle this efficiently.

Because customer-insurer relationships are the only side of the healthcare system that most people see, they're oblivious to what are actually pass-through insurer-provider issues. As you said, the reality is that insurers operate with pretty reasonable margins and incredibly meager per-claim overhead costs. They're stuck trying to make 2 + 1 = 2. If the finger should be pointed at root causes in the US health system, it should be at: - Providers overbilling (particular in certain specialties) - Medical schools, for charging too much and under-expanding capacity - The federal government/Congress, for failing to expand residency funding to increase supply (especially in generalist provider categories) reply relaxing 1 hour agorootparentWhat’s the source of limited supply of doctors meme? Is there a good rundown somewhere? Because anecdotally, among my friends, I’ve never known someone to not make it through the system to practicing medicine who wanted to, but I do know several who persevered despite being real idiots. I don’t see how opening the pool wider would lead to better care. reply fny 1 hour agorootparent1. There is a cap on the number of doctors that the US can churn out since Medicare funds most of their training. That number is 140,000. This inherently limits supply. This is the biggest issue.[0] 2. There are limited spots in certain residency programs due to how competitive they are. Ergo those specialties are artificially more lucrative. Dermatology is a good example. 3. Becoming a doctor is temporally arduous: 11 to 15 years! Why the hell do people need to spend four years of time and money on a bachelor's degree instead of entering a medical program directly? 4. Becoming a doctor is financially arduous. You will be in debt for four years of undergrad, then four years of medical school, and then you'll be paid garbage for 3-7 years of residency. High interest rates exacerbate this. 5. Residency is hell. 6. Working in a hospital is often hell. Burn out is very real. 7.

I mean, actually it makes sense. Their job is to pay for expensive procedures, sometimes quite urgently needed. They can’t really ethically insert themselves into the decision making process, so if these companies were run ethically they’d be signing themselves up for unlimited risk. Maybe they shouldn’t exist. reply kstrauser 1 hour agorootparentprevPlease allow me to counter, from the perspective of someone who owned a medical practice for much of my adult life: - The ACA limits the amount of money, as a percent of revenue, that insurance companies collect as profit. If they wish to increase profit, their primary option is to collect higher premiums and pay more benefits. - (No experience with keeping someone alive overnight. I'm sure it's happened and couldn't disprove it in any case.) - Of course they have optimized billing. The current fiasco has byzantine rules for payment. For instance, you know how your dermatologist offers you smoking cessation and weight loss classes? That's because if they offer it to you, insurance rules allow them to bill the encounter as an enhanced care visit which pays more. This isn't an exaggeration. The insurance rules say \"we'll pay you an extra 30% if you ask about their smoking and weight\". The doctor can earn more simply by following those rules. Again, of course providers do this! If my boss gave me a 20% raise for asking him each morning if he'd like me to make him a sandwich, even knowing he hates breakfast sandwiches, you bet I'm doing it. - That's complicated. If a hospital violates the insurer's rules, they don't get paid for seeing the patient. Yes, the situation you described is horrid, but no provider can afford to write off every patient. It's the insurers who said they wouldn't pay until the patient is seriously sick. - Surveys have shown that as much as 60% of small practices' management overhead involves staffing people to deal with insurance companies, process claims, optimize billing (see above), negotiate pre-approvals, and so on. They have higher overheads because the insurers require it, not because they want to. - Well, according to the insurers trying to weasel out of paying for it. For example, a patient came to my wife with an obvious soft tissue injury. She ordered an MRI to diagnose it. The insurer refused the approval until my wife took an X-ray first because it's cheaper. X-rays also don't show soft tissue injuries. (Don't correct me; I know the exceptions here and they're not relevant to this.) So it was the insurer who demanded my wife perform a wholly useless test before they'd pay for the effective one. - I'm not willing to lower the quality of physicians. Other studies have shown that the lack of upcoming doctors is due to fewer people willing to put up with the insane stress levels for mediocre pay. The stereotype of a doctor heading out at noon for an afternoon of golf are largely over for nearly all specialties. Frankly, there are many jobs that pay better with less stress and less personal responsibility. - That's laughably wrong. No one gets a new knee for the fun of it. It's a major surgery with long and challenging recovery that people get because they're otherwise unable to function normally. - There is no way to handle this efficiently. It's an utter morass. reply maxerickson 39 minutes agorootparent- I'm not willing to lower the quality of physicians.

What they denied was paying me to do it. You can still get \"moderate sedation\" from a nurse - a benzodiazepine and opioid. Patients strongly prefer having what amounts to a general anesthetic; your chances of recalling anything are low either way, but propofol results in a much faster recovery to full consciousness afterward.

I know people who have had a colonoscopy without it, and have regretted it due to significant pain. Note that they approved the colonoscopy, just not the anesthetic.

I had a friend die at 52 two years ago after he was diagnosed with stage IV during his first colonoscopy. Without wading into the specifics of your situation, there's not great evidence justifying colonoscopy for normal people without family history at age 45. The USPSTF just kinda lowered the threshold based on crappy (pun not intended) observational data. And if you look at their recommendations, they actually don't recommend colonoscopy, specifically -- they just recommend \"screening\" [1] which includes FIT, DNA testing (again: not great evidence here), or flex sig, which is done without anesthesia, and all of which are cheaper than colonoscopy. It's a huge debate. Anyway, I absolutely don't want to reflexively defend the health insurance industry in the US, but one the reasons we have skyrocketing health care costs in this country is because people are doing expensive procedures when cheaper ones would suffice.

Because this study was a retrospective study, the authors could not rule out the alternative but unlikely explanation that the practitioners could be rounding down. The reason for caution by the authors is that the CMS has differentiated fraud from abuse by emphasizing that fraud is intentional, whereas abuse is the result of poor medical practices.2 This differentiation is important because sometimes the rounding in digits ending in 0 or 5 minutes in anesthesia time is part of the organization culture of operating rooms in which rounding is performed systematically by the operation room circulating nurse along with the anesthesia practitioner. Sun et al8 recognized this issue as being related to institutional factors, which was one of the reasons they performed a 2-step regression analysis; long anomalous times were not sufficient to establish inappropriate discretion.8\" So Anthem based on the article it might be overpaying for at worst 5% of the operations BUT the big but is that in some hospitals it is routine to round digits.

I worry that the future for the U.S. is the malaise that appears to have taken hold of the Russian people. reply forgetfreeman 3 hours agorootparentprevI find absolutist stances based on ideology distasteful. History has pretty vividly shown that sometimes killing people is in fact the answer. Something something Nuremburg trials. reply LiquidSky 3 hours agoparentprevYou can't just shoot people and kill them in the street! That's barbaric! You need to do it from behind a desk through a corporate bureaucracy like a civilized person. reply refurb 3 hours agoparentprevOne issue is that if denying medical care is murder then every healthcare system is guilty. In the US it’s insurance companies (or the government through Medicare or Medicaid) but in the UK it’s NICE, in Canada it’s CADTH and the provincial health authorities. Since there are finite resources spent on healthcare, trade offs are made all the time. If spending $10M on treatment A saved 10,000 lives and $10M on treatment B saves 1,000 lives, then treatment A gets funded and treatment B doesn’t. The difference is that patients in the US have an up close and personal experience with denial. In Canada and the UK they don’t because doctors knows what is covered and what isn’t so never bring up life saving options if they aren’t paid for. In rare circumstances like cystic fibrosis in the UK, patients become aware that they are being denied a life saving drug and protest, but generally it’s pretty rare because patients just don’t know the option exists. reply wat10000 3 hours agorootparentThe difference is that patients in the US are being denied by people lining their own pockets with the savings. In sane countries, there’s at least some basis of trying to do the most good with the resources at hand, which sometimes means denying care for person A because those resources would be better spent on person B. With private insurers in the US, it means denying care for person A because they think they can get away with it and it will increase their profits. reply stuaxo 3 hours agorootparentprevThe US spends the most budget per patient for the least amount of care, the rest goes into inefficiency and profit (a second kind of inefficiency). Medicare per-capita spending is more than NHS per capita spending, but the NHS covers everyone. Of course healthcare is denied in any system (in other systems this is triage), but nowhere to the level United Health does it: over 30%, it's on a completely different scale. reply OutOfHere 3 hours agorootparentprevYour argument is completely bogus for multiple reasons. Firstly, people are paying here for insurance, a lot. Secondly, it's the FDA's job to approve treatments which it does. Thirdly, we do not have a uniform privatized determination across the country of what is approvable or not by insurance companies. They deny numerous legitimate treatments and procedures at their whim. reply amarcheschi 3 hours agoparentprevBut now you have another ceo.

The media pearl-clutching is extremely heavy this time around, painting Luigi as an unhinged lunatic and all the rest.

Everyone wants to change it. But I don't see how it can change as long as both parties are on the payroll https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/unitedhealth-group/recipien... reply jimbokun 3 hours agorootparentEveryone wants to change it...until you propose a concrete new system including payment mechanism. \"Give me universal health care...but don't increase my taxes!...and don't take away my current insurance plan!\" reply toast0 3 hours agorootparentHere's my semi-cooncrete mechanism. Seniors seem to love Medicare... Every year for 10 years, reduce the age of eligibility by 1 year. At N+10, it will cover 55+. For the next 10 years, reduce the age of eligibility by 2 years per year. At N+20, it will cover 35+. You can also set up Medicaid to cover all children in a similar way (after all, most children have no income, so should qualify if judged on personal income rather than family income). Set a date and if you're born after that date, you get medicaid until you're 20. At year N+20, there will be a 15 year gap for young people. Which is hopefully time enough for them to earn enough social security credits to qualify for Medicare. And yes, medicare and medicaid taxes would have to go up. But private healthcare premiums should go down. Rolling it out over 20 years allows for adjustments to be made as things go along. Criteria based on years is for simplicity... A better method would be increasing eligible population by 1% the first year, 1.1% the second, and so on until you're done. If people really don't want to just pay for it socialized. Just make it possible to self pay for medicare at more ages; this is something that seniors without enough social security credits can already do. Again modulating the eligible age over time to allow for a transition without overwelming the system. reply tjpnz 3 hours agorootparentprev\"Why should I have to pay for my neighbor's hip replacement?!!\" reply runnr_az 3 hours agorootparent\"Why should my treatment be limited?\" reply shdksjxbcb 3 hours agorootparentprevThe American people need to stop seeing the other party as the enemy. As long as that’s in place, the parasites at the top will remain in power. Unfortunately, it’s easy for them to create conditions to perpetuate and widen the American political schisms. And they’ve convinced both sides the common historical solutions (nationalism, limited democracy, religion) are for low IQ bigots. Things are likely too far gone. reply wat10000 3 hours agorootparentConsider what happened with the public option in Obamacare. Both parties played a part in defeating it. The Democrats’ part was that they had 59 Senators in support, and one single dude opposed. The Republicans’ part was that they had 40 opposed and none in favor. Because a 60% majority was required, it failed. That does not look to me like both sides are at fault and we need to think of it differently. That looks to me like Democrats are imperfect but largely aligned with what I want, whereas Republicans are resolutely in opposition. reply staticautomatic 3 hours agorootparentprevThe republican corporatist leaders are indeed the enemy. Their voters are not. reply pphysch 3 hours agorootparentThe slain CEO was a Democrat, like many of his peers. Again, it's not about political party. Red vs Blue partisan theatre is a tool used by the united ruling class to divide the exploited classes. reply staticautomatic 2 hours agorootparentThe person I replied to didn't assert that he was a Republican. Your comment is inapposite. And the Democrat elite is also the enemy. reply tossandthrow 3 hours agorootparentprevWell, the events you are seeing unfolding is change around the established systems. Civil disobeyance is nothing new. The fact that is is so little pronounced currently is probably a signal that there has been alignment for quite a while. Bit when politicians do not take their jobs seriously, change finds other ways. reply paulproteus 3 hours agorootparentprevConfusing statement when Republicans are the reason Obamacare shipped without a public option reply mtalantikite 3 hours agorootparentI thought it was because of Joe Lieberman, a Democrat turned independent, from a state that tries to bill itself as the \"Insurance Capital of the World\" [2] [1] https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/16/joe-lieberman-... [2] https://connecticutifs.com/home/ reply jimbokun 3 hours agorootparentSo 40 Republicans and 1 Democrat. reply pessimizer 3 hours agorootparentIf it had been 39 Republicans, it would have been 2 Democrats. Obama campaigned for Joe Lieberman afterwards as an independent against Ned Lamont, who had won the Democratic primary. Lieberman tanked the public option for the Democrats, and Obama was paying his debt. Democrats would have paid the price at the polls for getting rid of the public option. Lieberman took the hit for the rest of them; he was the cheapest, because he already publicly held right-wing positions. If they had needed another vote, they would have had to find another Democrat to risk their political career to do it. Probably with a cushy lobbyist job at a health insurer after getting voted out. reply tboyd47 3 hours agorootparentprevIt can change once Americans break their addiction to \"health care.\" reply ElevenLathe 3 hours agorootparentDo not, my friends, become addicted to water.

I don't know a single person who ENJOYS going to the doctor, or needing medical treatment. What are you on about? reply tboyd47 3 hours agorootparentThere are lots of people who get freaked out and go to the hospital for every little thing. We used to have a term for that: \"hypochondriac.\" Now it's become socially acceptable, so you don't hear the term as much. Everyone knows Americans pay the most for medical treatment, but the life expectancy is not that high.

Sure. > If you know your behavior isn't good for you This doesn't follow. Our healthcare system might be worse than some but that does not imply it's bad for you. That same logic would imply getting punched in the face is good for you because it's better than getting shot. reply tboyd47 2 hours agorootparent> Our healthcare system might be worse than some but that does not imply it's bad for you. Well, if you have that mindset, then you'll never achieve anything better, will you? It's not necessarily bad for us, so we'll just keep doing it. It's like the people who vote for the same set of loser politicians every 4 years and then complain that nothing ever changes. reply AdmiralAsshat 3 hours agorootparentprevOn the contrary, if the healthcare system in the US weren't such shit, more people would probably be going to primary care doctors and getting Preventative Care before it becomes an emergency, and requires a trip to the hospital. But many people don't, because visiting a primary care / walk-in clinic / urgent care is expensive, so they ignore it, until it becomes un-ignorable. Now it's an ER visit. reply tboyd47 3 hours agorootparentThat's pure speculation on your part. My stance is common sense: if it doesn't work, don't do it. reply JKCalhoun 3 hours agoparentprevAligning with the other reply, yes, I think it's time US leaders realize how bad the medical system is. reply kstrauser 3 hours agorootparentRoger that. I’m against vigilante killings because I don’t want to live in that kind of a society. But a couple days later, Anthem decided to end their insane time limits on anesthesia. I’m hoping the public’s reaction to all these events has put a bug in the ear of politicians who ran partly on the idea of “repeal the ACA”: maybe this isn’t a great time to start slashing coverage. People seem pretty upset about it right now. reply DennisP 3 hours agorootparentI agree with your general points, but if we can trust Vox, the Anthem situation wasn't quite what people thought. The policy was to prevent overpayment to anesthesiologists, because they get paid partly by the hour and there's evidence that they tend to inflate their times. The policy would not have increased costs to patients, because of this: > “Say there is a contract between an insurance company like Anthem and an anesthesiologist,” Garmon told Vox. “What is always in that contract is a clause that says, ‘You, the provider, agree to accept the reimbursement rules in this contract as payment in full.’ That means the provider cannot then turn around and ask [the patient] for money.” There was also a process for anesthesiologists to apply for extra payment if surgery went extra long. https://www.vox.com/policy/390031/anthem-blue-cross-blue-shi... They make a larger point that the main reason Americans pay so much more for healthcare is that we pay our providers a lot more. Nations with more reasonable costs and high-quality results have controls in place to keep costs down at the provider level. reply SauciestGNU 2 hours agorootparentVox might be right but under no circumstances would a company admit \"hey we're changing this unpopular decision because we're personally afraid of being killed\". Tying good patient outcomes to dead CEOs would be literally suicidal for Anthem execs. reply wat10000 3 hours agorootparentprevThey know. They don’t care because they think it doesn’t affect them. They’ve largely been right so far. But this should be their sign to fix it before discontent boils over. reply nradov 3 hours agoparentprevMost people in positions of power realize that it's bad in some ways and good in others. It's bad in cost effectiveness and universal access to affordable primary care. It's (relatively) good at other things like 5-year cancer survival rates, waiting times for elective treatments, trauma care, and drug development. There is little agreement on how to fix the bad while preserving the good. reply amarcheschi 2 hours agoprev [–] I don't know what happened but this super duper upvoted post disappeared from the home of hn. perhaps moderators temporarily shadow content that is upvoted too much?

It just seems too slow for a high power density - need high surface area. The air cathode in this experiment is a gas diffusion layer embedded with trimolybdenum phosphide nanoparticle (seems common with these, others use platinum and iridium), with a current density of 0.1 mA/cm2. Need 1m2 of air cathode for 10 amps. I wonder how that ORR can be sped up or use smaller surface area. Could some kind of forced induction supercharger type thing work for these? I'm not a chemist. reply fs_tab 22 hours agoprevFrom the abstract: A lithium-air battery based on lithium oxide (Li2O) formation can theoretically deliver an energy density that is comparable to that of gasoline. reply timerol 21 hours agoparentThis particular Li2O battery is a little under 700 Wh/kg, with the theoretical maximum being 11k Wh/kg, compared to gasoline's 13k Wh/kg. It's an incredible accomplishment that they have managed to get such a reaction reasonably stable. Minor improvements to the battery cited in the paper would be beyond the theoretical limits of existing commercial lithium chemistries. > The results shown in fig. S9 indicate that this solid-state Li-air battery cell can work up to a capacity of ~10.4 mAh/cm2, resulting in a specific energy of ~685 Wh/kgcell. In addition, the cell has a volumetric energy density of ~614 Wh/Lcell because it operates well in air with no deleterious effects (supplementary materials, section S6.3) reply jillesvangurp 10 hours agorootparentEspecially when considering that most of that 13 Wh/kg for petrol is typically delivered as waste heat. You can get a decent estimate of how bad it is comparing miles per kwh for an EV to miles per gallon for a typical petrol car. It's about 3-4 miles per kwh vs. about 20 miles per gallon. EVs just use their kwh a lot more efficiently than petrol cars. Because batteries and electrical motors are just really efficient. An 11 wh/kg battery would result in a battery that delivers about 5-6 times more miles per kg of battery than petrol. You get weight parity around 3-4 kg. If you factor in the weight of the engine (they can be quite heavy) it gets a little better. Of course the weight matters far less than people think. The amount of energy needed to move a vehicle does not necesseily scale linearly with weight of the vehicle. Which is why a heavy cyber truck and much lighter / smaller EVs can have miles per kwh metrics that aren't that far apart. Same with petrol cars. Halving the weight doesn't given them twice as much range. Heavy batteries are not that big of a deal. Unless you put them in a plane. Weight matters a lot in planes. So, a battery like this would be amazing news for battery electric planes that currently fly with 200-300 wh/kg batteries (at best). 11kwh/kg would be a 70x improvement in energy density. That's a lot of range. Even a small fraction of that would be a massive improvement. 700wh/kg more than doubles the range already. I think we'll see batteries break 1kwh/kg next decade or so. 500 wh/kg is already on its way to production. So, a doubling is only a modest step up. At 1kwh/kg, most GA flight will become electric. 3-6 hours of range with dirt cheap electricity turns a 100$ hamburger into a Starbucks coffee run. That's game over for ICE engines in small planes. reply norrsson 21 hours agorootparentprevUsual disclaimer regarding the energy density of gasoline: current gasoline engines have an efficiency of 10-30% while EVs are around 90%. So to reach similar kWh/g we're looking at ~3k Wh/kg reply thot_experiment 19 hours agorootparentI think your point still stands but modern engines cluster toward the higher end of that range and some do exceed the 30% efficiency mark, hybrid drivetrains can approach 40%. reply fpoling 12 hours agorootparentIndeed. Tesla Model 3 consumes about 50MJ of battery energy per 100 km. Toyota Prius consumes about 4.5 liters of gasoline. That gives roughly 150 MJ. So a electrical car consumes 3 times less or about 33% of energy of one of the best hybrid drivetrain. reply jillesvangurp 10 hours agorootparentIs that fresh out of the factory or after a few years of service? I think a lot of the metrics around hybrids are a bit optimistic. In the same way that official metrics for EV ranges are usually a bit more than is realistic. Hybrids running on battery are about as efficient as an EV. When you enter the highway, they turn into ordinary ICE engines. If you use your prius exclusively for traffic in your neighborhood, you only use petrol to charge the battery, which is efficient and about as good as it gets with a hybrid. Unless you can plug it in of course. It won't use any petrol at all in that case. reply Tade0 9 hours agorootparentI've been driving my hybrid(compact estate) for over 7 years now and there's no noticeable change in fuel economy. That being said, both the figures mentioned are to me a little bit optimistic. I don't know about Teslas, but my fuel economy presents itself like this(figures are in litres per 100km): -City driving: ~5 + ~100ml to bring the engine to working temperature. Checks out to 7 on a 7km drive and falling with distance. -Highway, so maintaining real 120-140km/h (speed limit around here), 6.3-6.5. Absolute worst was 7.8 during a snowless -20°C night. -Backroads doing 70-90km/h, average trip speed 50km/h, and here is where I think hybrids shine - 4.0-4.2. -Hypermiling record: 3.7 as I was steadily rolling at 20-30km/h to a highway onramp a few kilometres away. Overall fuel economy is nice, but what I like about this car the most is the ease of manoeuvring on the parking lot and very little vibration when the engine is running. reply AtlasBarfed 10 hours agorootparentprevIce hybrids can run on the Atkinson cycle, which fas been explained to me as diesel range from gasoline. I believe this is because the electric motor can handle the torque variation so the engine runs in a more consistent optimized torque band reply jillesvangurp 7 hours agorootparentThe most optimal thing is to just use ICE engines as a generator/range extender that tops up the battery. Most hydrogen vehicles actually work like that as well: the fuel cell is basically used as a generator to top up the battery. Some of the Chinese plugin hybrids are starting to do this. Those basically are EVs with a generator bolted on to extend the range to something crazy like well over 1000 miles. These vehicles are far simpler to build and mechanically a lot simpler. And the generator is of course an optional extra if your battery is big enough. More like a safety blanket for the range anxious. Edison trucks (a Canadian startup) is doing putting generators on their trucks. They've built and designed their own electrical logging truck designed for the extremes of that business. Pretty awesome vehicle. Effortless pulls huge loads over unpaved roads. Basically, it has no gears so it is super simple to operate and it drives like a car. A pretty sporty one even. The generator is just there for when they go out into the middle of nowhere where they can't charge the truck. It's purely a range extender. If you think about it, you could just buy an off the shelf generator, shove it on a trailer and hook it up to your EV. If you have a EV pickup, you can just sacrifice some space in the back. This isn't that hard. You only need a few kw of output from the generator. A simple, small, and cheap one would be good enough. The reason companies like Toyota are trying to sell you a much harder to maintain and much more complicated solution instead is not because they haven't thought about it but because they have a large sunken investment in ICE engine manufacturing that they want to milk for a bit longer. reply to11mtm 23 minutes agorootparent> The most optimal thing is to just use ICE engines as a generator/range extender that tops up the battery. Not necessarily. A pure Series hybrid, at least so far, haven't been able to match up to the series-parallel setup Toyota and Ford is using. And part of the reason for that, is they typically have a 'direct drive' mode, such that the engine is directly connected to the wheels; at that point you can have far less energy lossage via the mechanical drivetrain compared to the loss of mechanical->electrical, even if that electrical was getting dumped straight into the electrical motor. > If you think about it, you could just buy an off the shelf generator, shove it on a trailer and hook it up to your EV. If you have a EV pickup, you can just sacrifice some space in the back. This isn't that hard. You only need a few kw of output from the generator. A simple, small, and cheap one would be good enough. The relative efficiency of your typical generator is probably not on the order of most car engines, I'd wager. Especially, again, going back to Toyota/Ford hybrid designs, the engine is can do an atkinson cycle which is more efficient (at the expense of larger engine size to power ratio.) Willing to bet most generators don't have nearly as much/good 'scrubbing' equipment for the exhaust compared to a modern car either. > The reason companies like Toyota are trying to sell you a much harder to maintain and much more complicated solution instead is not because they haven't thought about it but because they have a large sunken investment in ICE engine manufacturing that they want to milk for a bit longer. I do still agree with most of this, but TBH a series-hybrid setup (at least for the single speed Aisin units and Ford's HF transmissions to date) can be in many ways wayyy simpler than most modern cars. Lots of em don't even have direct injection, let alone turbochargers, and the gearbox itself is simpler than any modern automatic. reply Tagbert 2 hours agorootparentprevWhat you are describing are series hybrids where the power source generate electricity and the wheels are driven from the electric motor. Nissan sells this as their E-Power system Hybrid. The Chevy Volt plug-in hybrids were primarily series hybrids when in hybrid mode. Running the gas engine to charge the battery and drive the wheels is not as efficient as just using a large EV battery but the trade offs in cost, weight, and range may make it worthwhile for now. reply 0cf8612b2e1e 2 hours agorootparentprevI previously wondered about the generator trailer. Hook it up for long trips and travel without fear. Can a typical EV battery charge while driving or would they need to be redesigned for this purpose? reply lmz 6 hours agorootparentprevBut running such a series hybrid with minimal charge of the batteries means almost all power is from the engine. And if that is undersized that won't end well. reply bagels 14 hours agorootparentprevNot that any of the tech is practical for every day cars or how they're used, but F1 engines with the multiple energy recovery systems are up to 52% efficient if they are to be believed (we'll ignore the rules subterfuge around tricking the fuel sensors, injecting oil, and who knows what else). reply lukevp 21 hours agorootparentprevIs there a similar volumetric equivalent measurement or is it all about energy density by weight? Like, if the batteries are lightweight but massive, that would also be a bit of a problem since the structure to safely transport a large volume could be expensive and heavy. reply sn0wf1re 20 hours agorootparentLooks like the created cell is 614 Wh/L from the above comment. Gasoline is ~2.2kWh/L [0]. So my take is that even with the created cell the density is not going to be an issue with car or grid batteries -- onlyA lithium-air battery (in general all metal-air batteries) is likely to have lower efficiencies for a complete cycle than other lithium-based batteries, perhaps not much above 80%, if not even less. This paper directly contradicts this claim with actual measurements of efficiency. > The energy efficiency of the first cycle was 92.7%, and it gradually dropped to 87.7% after 1000 cycles. Which is centered just above the 90% mark the person you are replying to gave. reply grapesodaaaaa 18 hours agorootparentprev> The claim from the parent article is wrong and it is based on an incorrect method for computing the ideal energy per mass ratio for lithium-air batteries. Can you elaborate for laypersons such as myself? reply adrian_b 7 hours agorootparentThe parent article has claimed that lithium-air batteries can have an energy per mass close to gasoline. That claim is based on dividing the stored energy by the mass of lithium, which is incorrect. The product of the reaction, i.e. lithium oxide, is stored in the battery, so a lithium-air battery can never be lighter than the lithium oxide. Because the mass of lithium oxide is what counts, the energy per mass of pure lithium, which is indeed not much less than for gasoline, must be divided by a factor that varies between 2.14 and 5.57, depending on the construction of the lithium-air battery. The best value of 2.14 is when the discharged battery contains only Li2O. The worst value of 5.57 is when the discharged battery contains only lithium superoxide, LiO2. In the parent article, they claim that their discharged battery contains mostly Li2O, with only small quantities of peroxide Li2O2 and superoxide LiO2, but the exact amounts of peroxide and superoxide have not been measured. So when computing correctly the energy per mass ratio, for lithium-air batteries it is limited to a value less than half of that for hydrocarbons. In practice batteries need a lot of materials besides the active reactants, so the achievable energy per mass ratio will be several times lower. The advantage of hydrocarbons, regardless whether they are used in living cells, thermal engines or fuel cells, is that their reaction products are eliminated into the atmosphere, so their mass does not matter. The energy per mass for carbon atoms in hydrocarbons and for lithium atoms in lithium metal is approximately the same, but with lithium it is impossible to neglect the mass of the oxidant, like with carbon, because the reaction products cannot be dumped outside. So for any battery except for fuel cells, what counts is the sum of the masses of the reactants, e.g. lithium + oxygen in the best case, or e.g. zinc + manganese in the cheap non-rechargeable batteries. It is wrong to compute the minimum mass of a battery by using only the mass of one of the reactants, like in the parent article, instead of both masses. reply cyberax 17 hours agorootparentprevBasically, Li-Air elements are wasting the energy from the phase change of oxygen. When a Li-Ion battery is discharged, you get the gaseous oxygen and bind it into a solid state molecule. To do that, you need to expend roughly the same amount of energy that is needed to first liquify and then solidify the oxygen. In fancy chemistry-speak it's called \"entropic loss\". You do gain some of that energy back when the battery is charged, as oxygen goes from a well-ordered solid state into the gaseous state. But it's not 100%. reply adrian_b 19 hours agorootparentprevThat theoretical maximum for a lithium-air battery seems much too high, so it is likely to be computed in the wrong way, in order to provide an optimistic but false value. The mass that must be used for computing the theoretical maximum is that of Li2O, not the mass of lithium. Per atom of lithium, the mass of Li2O is 2.14 times greater, so it is likely that the number quoted by you must be divided by 2.14. Indeed, computing very approximately 1 electron x the value of the elementary charge x 3 volt x the number of Avogadro (per kmol) / 15 kilogram / 3600 seconds, gives about 5500 Wh/kg, so the value quoted by you is indeed wrong. reply adrian_b 19 hours agoparentprevThis statement about energy density is false, the result of an incorrect computation. The correct ideal energy density of lithium-air batteries is less than half of that of gasoline. See other comments for the correct computation. reply shsudhdudi 21 hours agoparentprevLi Air battery for the wings?? reply sbensu 2 hours agoprevIf you are interested in alternative lithium chemistries, Ouros is developing and commercializing one: https://ouros.energy/ reply Xamayon 21 hours agoprevIf it can be made small enough for use in mobile devices, I wonder whether the need for air/oxygen might require compromising on water-tightness.

No it won't. At most, the battery might need a small fan. Turbochargers are needed for regular cars because internal combustion engines just suck. reply actionfromafar 8 hours agorootparentThey suck air just fine even without the turbocharger. reply sroussey 18 hours agoparentprevSo probably not for water tight devices, but perhaps for laptops. reply aetherspawn 20 hours agoprevDoes it use external air? Would this technically make it a fuel cell and not a battery, since some of the reactants are discarded :) reply adrian_b 20 hours agoparentNot really. In a fuel cell the reaction products are discarded (the reactants cannot be discarded, as they are needed for the reaction to take place). In a metal-air battery, air from the atmosphere is taken into the battery and the oxygen from it becomes bound to the metal, in a metal oxide. So unlike for a fuel cell, where the vehicle becomes lighter after the fuel is consumed and the reaction products are discarded, a metal-air battery becomes heavier when the metal fuel is spent, because the reaction product is stored inside the battery. The metal-air battery becomes lighter again when it is charged and the oxygen stored inside it is released into the atmosphere. A lithium-air battery can have a much better energy per mass than any other kind of lithium battery, but it cannot reach the energy per mass of hydrocarbons. The reason is that for hydrocarbons the mass that counts is just the mass of the hydrocarbons, while for lithium-air batteries the mass that counts is not the mass of lithium, but the mass of the lithium oxide, i.e. the mass of the battery when it is mostly discharged. A carbon atom from hydrocarbons can provide 6 electrons per atom, while a lithium atom provides only 1 electron per atom, albeit at a voltage more than 3 times greater than carbon atoms. The mass of a lithium atom is half of that of a CH2 group from hydrocarbons, so if the mass of lithium would have been the one that mattered, the ideal energy per mass would have been about the same for hydrocarbons and for lithium. However the additional mass in lithium oxide reduces the ideal energy per mass more than 2 times (when Li2O is the reaction product) or even 3 to 5 times (when peroxide or superoxide of lithium are the reaction products). reply BWStearns 16 hours agorootparentInteresting. So if it was used for aviation then your takeoff weight would be lower than your landing weight. That'll be counterintuitive. reply thomasmg 12 hours agorootparentUnless if the spent battery calls are released during the flight, via parachute, to be recharched later. We currently call spent batteries \"empty\" but in this case spent = \"full\" (of oxygen). reply BWStearns 3 hours agorootparentI imagine the extra complexity, parachute and release system weight, and risk would nix that. reply lupusreal 4 hours agorootparentprevTotally impractical for virtually any application. reply sroussey 18 hours agorootparentprevHow would an aluminum-ion battery work out as for as theoretical charge per weight or volume? I know that is decades out, of course. reply adrian_b 8 hours agorootparentPer each electron provided in the circuit, the mass of aluminum is 9/7 of lithium and the maximum voltage is around 93% of that of lithium, which results in an energy per mass for aluminum of around 73% of that of lithium, when only the mass of the metal is considered. In an aluminum-air battery vs. a lithium-air battery, the mass per electron is, in the most favorable case for lithium, of 17 for aluminum vs. 15 for lithium, which results in an energy per mass for aluminum of around 82% of that of lithium. However lithium forms by oxidation not only Li2O, but also peroxide Li2O2 and superoxide LiO2, which may worsen a lot the energy per mass. In the parent article, they have succeeded to produce mostly Li2O, but even so their batteries have still produced some amounts of peroxide and superoxide during deep discharges. So the energy per mass for aluminum-air batteries could be up to 80% to 85% of that of lithium-air batteries. Most other oxidants besides the oxygen from air are heavier, which would reduce the advantage of lithium vs. aluminum (because the oxidant mass would be a greater fraction of the battery mass), so aluminum-ion batteries, if possible, could have an energy per mass very close to that of lithium-ion batteries. On the other hand, aluminum metal and aluminum oxides are much denser than lithium metal and lithium oxides, so aluminum batteries could have much better energy per volume than lithium batteries. Unfortunately, until now the problems caused by aluminum as a cathode material have not been solved. reply Drunk_Engineer 18 hours agoprevPrevious discussion (2016): https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12240000 reply ralfd 8 hours agoparentHeadline by the economist in 2016: \"Their time has come\" Well. No. Not yet. reply thehappypm 14 hours agoprevThis type of tech is clearly the future. There’s oxygen everywhere, and oxygen is ready to bond with everything. reply giantg2 18 hours agoprevI'm a bit excited but also a bit tired of hearing about all these batteries. I just want someone to wake me up when we have a commercially available 1kwh+/kg with decent durability, decent price, and good safety. Maybe this is a good idea for an ammoseek website but for batteries that can send alerts. I'm honestly surprised a quick search didn't turn one up. reply audunw 7 hours agoparentThat feels like a very high bar. A really good 500Wh/kg battery would already be completely revolutionary. That’s when you start to unlock practical short range electric flights for instance. It’d probably be enough for all forms of land transportation as well (except very small niches, like if you need to cross a huge desert off-road) If you get to 1kwh/kg I don’t think you even need good durability and low price to have a revolutionary battery. At that energy density it could make economic sense to do medium range battery electric planes, even if you need to replace the battery every year. The operational costs related to using jet fuel (both fuel costs and engine maintenance) are huge. So the airplane industry can work with batteries that are more expensive and that requires more maintenance than what the EV market would accept. I’m sure there’s a bunch of other niches for such a battery. reply giantg2 8 minutes agorootparentIt's definitely a high bar. I set it that way because there have been a handful of battery announcements claiming they can get to that number over the past 5 years. I want it and I want it now. Haha reply hiddencost 7 hours agoparentprevhttp://batteries.parametrek.com/index.html?size=18650 reply Matterless 20 hours agoprev [–] /Up to 1000 charge cycles/ is a big damper on the excitement, for me. Does anyone know if a limitation like that is inherent to the chemistry here or is this something that they could potentially (hopefully, vastly) surpass? reply bryanlarsen 20 hours agoparentThat's a comparable rating to the NMC Lithium cells used in an electric car, yet an EV can typically get > 200,000 miles from their cells. A charge cycle is defined as 0% -> 100% -> 0%. If you never do that, you get a lot more effective charge cycles. Edit: That's not the full explanation. 300 miles of range for a typical EV * 1000 cycle rating gives 300,000 mile rating. You likely charge a lot more than 1000 times over those 300,000 miles, but a partial charge counts as a partial cycle. reply beAbU 19 hours agorootparentTo add on to that, battery \"lifetime\" is typically defined as 80% of original capacity. So after 1000 full cycles, you still have 80% capacity left! reply audunw 7 hours agorootparentIt should be said that at that point you don’t have very many charge cycles left after the capacity drops below 80%, and the capacity will drop a lot faster for every charge cycle after that point. I don’t have exact numbers.. based on graphs I’ve seen I would guess that if the original cycle life was 1000 cycles you may have another 500 cycles until the battery is actually unusable. But it probably depends a lot on the specific chemistry and how the car is used. reply bryanlarsen 2 hours agorootparentIf 1000 cycles is 250,000 miles, then an additional 500 cycles also seems like a large number. reply magicalhippo 9 hours agoparentprevA study[1] was recently posted[2] which found that for lithium-ion batteries, dynamic use lead to much better battery life compared to fixed-current discharges which is typically used in labs to determine battery life. From the paper: Specifically, for the same average current and voltage window, varying the dynamic discharge profile led to an increase of up to 38% in equivalent full cycles at end of life. This tracks well with actual real-world data on BEV battery performance in cars with decent battery management.
