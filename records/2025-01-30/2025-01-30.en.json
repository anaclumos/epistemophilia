    "originBody": "JavaScript Temporal is coming Brian SmithJanuary 24, 20255 minute read Implementations of the new JavaScript Temporal object are starting to be shipped in experimental releases of browsers. This is big news for web developers because working with dates and times in JavaScript will be hugely simplified and modernized. Applications that rely on scheduling, internationalization, or time-sensitive data will be able to use built-ins for efficient, precise and consistent dates, times, durations, and calendars. We're a long way away from stable, cross-browser support, and there may be changes as implementations develop, but we can already take a look at Temporal as it stands now, why it's exciting, and what problems it solves. To help you get up to speed, there are over 270 pages of Temporal docs on MDN added this week, with detailed explanations and examples. What is JavaScript Temporal? To understand Temporal, we can look at JavaScript's Date object. When JavaScript was created in 1995, the Date object was copied from Java's early, flawed java.util.Date implementation. Java replaced this implementation in 1997, but JavaScript is stuck with the same API for almost 30 years, despite known problems. The major issues with JavaScript's Date object are that it only supports the user's local time and UTC, and there's no time zone support. Additionally, its parsing behavior is very unreliable, and Date itself is mutable, which can introduce hard-to-trace bugs. There are other problems like calculations across Daylight Saving Time (DST) and historical calendar changes, which are notoriously difficult to work with. All of these issues make working with dates and times in JavaScript complex and prone to bugs, which can have serious consequences for some systems. Most developers rely on dedicated libraries like Moment.js and date-fns for better handling of dates and times in their applications. Temporal is designed as a full replacement for the Date object, making date and time management reliable and predictable. Temporal adds support for time zone and calendar representations, many built-in methods for conversions, comparisons and computations, formatting, and more. The API surface has over 200 utility methods, and you can find information about all of them in the Temporal docs on MDN. Core concepts In Temporal, the key concepts are that it has instants (unique points in history), wall-clock times (regional time), and durations. The APIs have this overall structure to handle these concepts: Duration: Temporal.Duration the difference between two points in time Points in time: Unique points in time: As a timestamp: Temporal.Instant A date-time with a time zone: Temporal.ZonedDateTime Time-zone-unaware date/time (\"Plain\"): Full date and time: Temporal.PlainDateTime Just the date: Temporal.PlainDate Year and month: Temporal.PlainYearMonth Month and day: Temporal.PlainMonthDay Just the time: Temporal.PlainTime Now: using Temporal.now to get the current time as various class instances, or in a specific format Temporal examples Some of the most basic usages of Temporal include getting current dates and times as an ISO string, but we can see from the example below, that we can now provide time zones with many methods, which takes care of complex calculations you may be doing yourself: jsCopy to Clipboard // The current date in the system's time zone const dateTime = Temporal.Now.plainDateTimeISO(); console.log(dateTime); // e.g.: 2025-01-22T11:46:36.144 // The current date in the \"America/New_York\" time zone const dateTimeInNewYork = Temporal.Now.plainDateTimeISO(\"America/New_York\"); console.log(dateTimeInNewYork); // e.g.: 2025-01-22T05:47:02.555 Working with different calendars is also simplified, as it's possible to create dates in calendar systems other than Gregorian, such as Hebrew, Chinese, and Islamic, for example. The code below helps you find out when the next Chinese New Year is (which is quite soon!): jsCopy to Clipboard // Chinese New Years are on 1/1 in the Chinese calendar const chineseNewYear = Temporal.PlainMonthDay.from({ monthCode: \"M01\", day: 1, calendar: \"chinese\", }); const currentYear = Temporal.Now.plainDateISO().withCalendar(\"chinese\").year; let nextCNY = chineseNewYear.toPlainDate({ year: currentYear }); // If nextCNY is before the current date, move forward by 1 year if (Temporal.PlainDate.compare(nextCNY, Temporal.Now.plainDateISO())d.toString())); // [ 'PT1H', 'PT1H30M', 'PT1H45M', 'PT2H' ] Trying Temporal and browser support Support is slowly starting to be included in experimental browser releases, and Firefox appears to have the most mature implementation at this point. In Firefox, Temporal is being built into the Nightly version behind the javascript.options.experimental.temporal preference. If you want to see the full compatibility story, you can check the (quite epic) Temporal object Browser Compatibility section. Here are the main browser bugs that track Temporal implementations: Firefox: Build temporal in Nightly by default Safari: [JSC] Implement Temporal Chrome: Implement the Temporal proposal Additionally, you can visit https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/ which has @js-temporal/polyfill available. That means, you can open the developer tools on the TC39 docs page, and try some of the examples in the console in any browser without changing flags or preferences. With experimental implementations landing, now is a good time to try out Temporal and become familiar with what will be the modern approach to handling dates and times in JavaScript. Acknowledgements Thanks to Eric Meyer for his work on the topic.

    "commentBody": "JavaScript Temporal is coming (developer.mozilla.org)723 points by SigmundurM 7 hours agohidepastfavorite241 comments phiresky 6 hours agoTemporal is great. I've been using it for a while in production using a polyfill [1], and it solves all issues I've encountered with the old Date() API (which is a lot). It clearly takes inspiration from other high-quality time libraries such as chrono in Rust and Joda Time in Java and combines them into a nice API that's pretty comfortable to use. Yes, it is a bit more complex to handle since it separates time into naive time, instant and zoned time. But by experience, developers only confront complexity when they are forced to, and time _is_ complex. If you want to do the operation \"add one day to this timestamp\", you _must_ decide whether that timestamp is local to a specific timezone and which one. Otherwise you'll get a bug twice per year due to DST, or when the user switches time zones, or when you deploy on a server with a different timezone. It even solves the serialization issue of the difference between a \"fixed-offset\" timestamp (e.g. 2025-01-01T00:00+02:00) and one in a specific timezone (e.g. Europe/Paris). [1]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/temporal-polyfill reply burntsushi 6 hours agoparent> It clearly takes inspiration from other high-quality time libraries such as chrono in Rust You might be interested in Jiff (a crate for Rust), which is inspired by Temporal. And here is a comparison I did with other datetime crates (including `chrono`): https://docs.rs/jiff/latest/jiff/_documentation/comparison/i... I actually don't think Temporal takes a ton of inspiration from the `chrono` crate personally. I think it's definitely more from Joda (as you mentioned) or `java.time` these days, and some of the other Javascript datetime libraries that have cropped up over the years (thinking about date-fns and Moment.js). reply michaelcampbell 2 hours agoparentprev> Otherwise you'll get a bug twice per year due to DST Those of us of a certain age learned long ago never to schedule cron (etc.) jobs in a production environment between 01:00 and 03:00 local time. reply tomtomtom777 6 hours agoparentprev> It even solves the serialization issue of the difference between a \"fixed-offset\" timestamp (e.g. 2025-01-01T00:00+02:00) and one in a specific timezone (e.g. Europe/Paris). Could you elaborate on that? What is the issue? reply amiga386 5 hours agorootparent+02:00 is not political. It's an offset from UTC and will be the same offset in the past and future. Europe/Paris is political. It defines that offsets change at certain times of the year, but that could change tomorrow, or the political boundary that the timezone applies to could split such that the person or entity needing a time in their \"local\" timezone finds another one needs to be picked (see various US states/counties applying/disapplying daylight savings). It's impossible to be 100% confident what the offset from UTC will be at any time in the future. You also need to be a historian to correctly apply it to times in the past take https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_the_Republic_of_Irelan... as an example! reply phiresky 4 hours agorootparentThat but also and for me more importantly it does not tell you how to add time If you add one month of hours to a date in October, it depends on the timezone whether you will end up one hour of local time earlier or not (due to DST), because then +02:00 might be +01:00 reply roywashere 4 hours agorootparentWhile this is true, most often if you want to do \"now plus a month\" you'll mean \"at the same time on the local clock\", and disregarding timezone changes, while most often if you want to do \"now plus four hours\" you'd actually mean four real hours, and you want to calculate in the DST changes to make sure you have four actual hours in your duration reply burntsushi 3 hours agorootparentThat's how Temporal works: >> zdt = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from(\"2024-03-09T17:00-05[US/Eastern]\") >> zdt.add(\"P1d\").toString() \"2024-03-10T17:00:00-04:00[US/Eastern]\" >> zdt.add(\"PT24h\").toString() \"2024-03-10T18:00:00-04:00[US/Eastern]\" If you don't have the time zone and instead just an offset, then Temporal can't do this: >> zdt = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from(\"2024-03-09T17:00-05[-05]\") >> zdt.add(\"P1d\").toString() \"2024-03-10T17:00:00-05:00[-05:00]\" >> zdt.add(\"PT24h\").toString() \"2024-03-10T17:00:00-05:00[-05:00]\" Adding 1 day still works the same with respect to civil time but the offset is wrong since it doesn't account for the DST change. And adding 24 hours leads to a different result as well. This is one of the reasons why RFC 9557 is so important for serializing zoned datetimes when you want your arithmetic to be DST safe. Previously, to get this right, you had to include a time zone out of band somehow along with your RFC 3339 timestamp. reply btown 2 hours agorootparenthttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9557/ for folks' reference about the new [] suffix syntax. It's a really well thought out RFC: the offset, the civil time zone name, and a flag for whether that civil time zone is critical information can all be stored, and an inconsistency marked critical MUST be acted upon by the application explicitly, either by rejecting or requesting user interaction. This may seem redundant, but it's really important to answer \"what happens if I have a future timestamp stored, and the USA suddenly rejects daylight savings time. Do I honor the absolute point in time, or do I honor the notion of 5pm?\" Unfortunately, there's going to be a lot of chaos if this happens. Systems like Postgres only store the absolute point in time, normalized to UTC, despite what the name \"timestamp with time zone\" might imply; an application team or DBA making a decision about this might need to look at other domain-specific metadata e.g. the physical location of the associated asset to determine whether to add or remove an hour. I shudder to think about what this might imply for e.g. HIPAA protected medical systems; the impact of the ensuing bugs might be measured in lives. reply burntsushi 2 hours agorootparentYeah the PostgreSQL situation is just utterly appalling. The fact that there is a type called \"timestamp with time zone,\" that specifically calls out the fact that it has a time zone, but actually doesn't have a time zone is absolutely crazytown. > This may seem redundant, but it's really important to answer \"what happens if I have a future timestamp stored, and the USA suddenly rejects daylight savings time. Do I honor the absolute point in time, or do I honor the notion of 5pm?\" Yeah! It's great that Temporal rejects by default, but does let you override that and choose whether to respect the instant or respect to the civil time. And it lets you do that with a high level configuration knob. You don't have to code up the logic yourself. reply gmac 1 hour agorootparentI agree, but I believe Postgres is just following the SQL standard here? What's even crazier is that writing plain TIMESTAMP gets you TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE, as is also mandated by the standard (the Postgres docs call this one out specifically). And that behaviour can be summarized as: not only don't store the timezone, but also ignore the timezone you get given. For example, I'm on GMT/UTC right now, and I see this: select '2025-01-30T12:00:00-0800'::timestamp with time zone; 2025-01-30 20:00:00+00 select '2025-01-30T12:00:00-0800'::timestamp; 2025-01-30 12:00:00 reply burntsushi 1 hour agorootparentThere are many valid and justifiable reasons to do crazy things. But it's still crazy. :-) I don't think that completely absolves PostgreSQL though. It seems like they could add things to improve the situation and de-emphasize the use of TIMESTAMP and TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE. But I am not a database or PostgreSQL expert, and there are assuredly trade-offs with doing this. But yes, absolutely, the fact that TIMESTAMP is not just a timestamp without a time zone, but is actually a civil time is also equal parts crazytown. Like, a timestamp is 100% an instant in time. It is physical time. A number of seconds since an epoch. But PostreSQL (or the SQL standard) interprets it as a civil time? It's ludicrous and has assuredly confused countless humans. Especially those among us who don't know enough to question that PostgreSQL (or the SQL standard) might have gotten it wrong in the first place. reply Cthulhu_ 5 hours agorootparentprevI wonder what happens when a timezone ceases to exist, e.g. what if Paris is renamed to New New York after the British take revenge and take over France. reply WorldMaker 1 hour agorootparenthttps://www.icann.org/en/blogs/details/how-time-zones-are-co... Hopefully the British would be kind enough to email the TZ DB group at the IANA (tz@iana.org) a couple years in advance of the legislation to change the name so that the group can get started on collecting the DST rules for Europe/NewNewYork. Some people and devices will probably stick to Europe/Paris out of habit and/or resistance to the change, so the TZ DB would probably be unlikely to remove it, but they may point references from it to Europe/NewNewYork as the new \"canonical\" name. Plenty of the DB entries are just pointers to other entries already today, for one instance it was decided that America/City and Europe/City maybe is too conflicted a namespace and we see increasingly more \"the canonical name is America/State/City\" or \"the canonical name is Europe/Country/City\". reply mikepurvis 39 minutes agorootparentAs a Canadian, I would love for my timezone to be Americas/Toronto or Americas/Canada/Toronto rather than America/Toronto, but that's pretty far down my register of first world problems. reply tomhallett 4 hours agorootparentprevYour example of “New X” is spot on, because there was a timezone with that name, “US/Pacific-New”, which was different than “US/Pacific”. Bit of history: it was added to some timezone libraries because there was a bill in congress to add it, but it never passed. I had to fix a bug because users were getting set with that timezone and then other systems/libraries were barfing on it… https://github.com/moment/moment-timezone/issues/498 reply jitl 4 hours agorootparentprevA timezone changing or being eliminated doesn’t erase the history of that timezone. So you can still use the last definition of such a timezone if the date is still in the future, or use the appropriate definition of the timezone at the time of a date marked in the past. reply williamdclt 59 minutes agorootparent> you can still use the last definition of such a timezone if the date is still in the future but that'll possibly give you an incorrect time! If you want to store \"8am in Paris on the 2026-01-01\", then you store \"2026-01-01T08:00:00 Europe/Paris\". Great, if Paris decides to change their offset rules, that's fine. Currently, that would be `2026-01-01T08:00:00+01:00` but if Paris decide to ditch DST, it could become `2026-01-01T08:00:00+00:00`. All good, you stored a timezone rather than an offset, so you're decoupled from the timezone->offset changes. But if tomorrow `Europe/Paris` cease to exist, and is replaced with Europe/NewNewYork? The last definition of Europe/Paris would make this date `2026-01-01T08:00:00+01:00`, but if Europe/NewNewYork ditched DST then it wouldn't be 8am for the people living there, it'd be 7am. You're decoupled from the timezone->offset changes, but not from location->timezone changes. reply mason55 3 hours agorootparentprevHere are a couple starting points https://medium.com/servicios-a0/on-solving-the-tzdb-changes-... https://github.com/tc39/proposal-canonical-tz appropriately to these comments, a proposal to handle tzdb changes, built on top of JS Temporal, includes some great examples of all the ways this can happen reply Macha 2 hours agorootparentprevThen Europe/Paris will become an alias for Europe/NewNewYork reply williamdclt 55 minutes agorootparentWhat if England and Germany fight for France, half the country being occupied by Germany using `Europe/Francefurt` and the other half by England using `Europe/NewNewYork`? Then you can't know for sure how to interpret a \"Europe/Paris\" date without knowing the exact geographical location reply burntsushi 5 hours agorootparentprevThe issue is that if you have a timestamp (e.g., `2025-06-20T17:00:00+02:00`) and a time zone (e.g., `Europe/Paris`) and you go to serialize it, are you explicitly including the time zone in that serialization? And when you deserialize it, are you checking that the offset is still valid for that time zone at that time? Temporal fixes this by using RFC 9557[1], which includes the time zone in the serialized representation. RFC 9557 is a superset of RFC 3339. So where as previously you might just emit `2025-06-20T17:00:00+02:00`, using RFC 9557, you would emit `2025-06-20T17:00:00+02:00[Europe/Paris]`. For example, using Temporal: >> instant = Temporal.Instant.from('2025-06-20T17:00:00+02') >> zdt = instant.toZonedDateTimeISO(\"Europe/Paris\") >> zdt.toJSON() \"2025-06-20T17:00:00+02:00[Europe/Paris]\" And when you go to deserialize an RFC 9557 timestamp, Temporal will do some validation to help ensure it's still correct. For example, you might serialize a RFC 9557 timestamp that is in the future, but at some later point, that region might abolish DST. At which point, your RFC 9557 timestamp might or might not resolve to the intended time. If it was in DST, Temporal will reject it at parsing time. You can read more about this at https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/zoneddatetime.html and search for \"conflict\". There's an example about Brazil abolishing DST in 2019 that should lay it out for you. Separately from even this, there are other concerns. If you forget to include the time zone in your serialization and then just deserialize it as a simple timestamp, then it makes it very easy for arithmetic on that value to be wrong because it won't be DST safe (unless you're careful to reconstitute its time zone somehow). With Temporal and RFC 9557, all of that is handled for you automatically. [1]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9557/ reply vlovich123 4 hours agorootparentI get that it’s more correct, but it assumes that Europe/Paris is a constant representation of how to apply the timezone-specific stuff but that’s incorrect. For example, ‘2025-06-20T17:00:00+02[Europe/Dublin]’ is a very different time if it’s created today vs if it were created in 1760 [1]. That’s a very extreme example, but timezone rules change and dates created from before the change was announced would be interpreted differently from ones created after they were announced. It’s interesting to me the standard doesn’t embed the creation time of the timestamp in UTC as well. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_the_Republic_of_Irelan... reply burntsushi 4 hours agorootparentCan you provide a concrete example? Ideally using Temporal to show where it's going wrong. Like, if you created `2025-06-20T17:00:00+02[Europe/Dublin]` (the instant) in 1760, then its civil representation would be different, to account for the rules in place at the time. And then if you went to deserialize it today, Temporal would reject it. You'd get an error, because the rules in place when the string was serialized don't match the rules in place today for that instant. To be clear, I might be misunderstanding what you're saying. So that's why I'm asking for a concrete example. That will cut through everything. And if you didn't, I would strongly suggest you take a look at https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/zoneddatetime.html and search for \"conflict\". I think that will help explain things. > I get that it’s more correct We can chase perfection, but perfection isn't the goal. All models are wrong, but some are useful. In other words, the question isn't whether Temporal's model of interaction with time is wrong (it is!), it's how wrong it is and what its impact is that matters. reply vlovich123 3 hours agorootparentI must be misunderstanding what you’re saying. How does Temporal know to reject something serialized from before a rule was changed when the creation time of the serialized representation isn’t encoded? You’re saying in 1760 [Europe/Dublin] would be a different string vs today? A more concrete example is normal time-zone rule changes `2025-06-20T17:00:00+02[Europe/Dublin]` would represent different instants if Dubling passed a new DST rule adjusting the clock back by 15 minutes at 2025-06-20T16:50:00+02[Europe/Dublin] then the meaning of the instant is different because now there’s 2 different `2025-06-20T17:00:00+02[Europe/Dublin]` and which one you get will depend on when you deserialize. reply burntsushi 3 hours agorootparentCan you check out the Brazil example in the docs I linked? That really should clear everything up. It explains how a datetime in the future gets serialized, but after a DST change, that serialized datetime becomes invalid. The way this works is by looking at offsets. Think of a time zone as a function mapping between civil time and physical time. Or, another way to think about it is a mapping from a civil time to an offset (which may not exist for gaps or may not be unique for folds) and a mapping from physical time to an offset (of which there is a bijection). With RFC 9557, you encode both the offset and the time zone into the serialized representation. Consider a case when you encode an offset corresponding to DST, and then DST is abolished. Your tzdb is updated. Then you go to deserialize this datetime. Its offset no longer matches the rules. This can be detected and Temporal reports an error. This is all explained in the docs. Note that DST is only an example here, because it's a common manifestation of how this error arises. But it can happen with any change in offset. So if you're in 1760 and you write down a datetime in the future using the rules of that time (of which, I'm not even sure that's a sensible question to ask), then you'd have a particular offset encoded in that future datetime. Now fast forward to the future and the rules have changed and are no longer consistent with the offset encoded in the datetime. Thus, you get an error. Here's another take on the idea that I wrote for Jiff: https://docs.rs/jiff/latest/jiff/tz/enum.OffsetConflict.html Think of it like this. In an RFC 9557 timestamp, you have an offset and you have a time zone. Those two pieces of information may be inconsistent with one another. For example, `2025-01-30T17:00+10[US/Eastern]`. When that happens, you can report an error. That's pretty much it. > then the meaning of the instant is different because now there’s 2 different `2025-06-20T17:00:00+02[Europe/Dublin]` and which one you get will depend on when you deserialize. If the region adjusted their close back by 15 minutes, then the offset would change. As for `2025-06-20T17:00:00+02[Europe/Dublin]`, it can only feasibly have two different interpretations: you can either interpret it as the instant `2025-06-20T17:00:00+02`, or you can interpret it as the civil time `2025-06-20T17:00:00` in the time zone `Europe/Dublin`, ignoring the offset. Or you can reject it. Temporal supports all of these modes, and it will by default reject such strings when the offset and time zone are inconsistent. (There's a fourth mode, \"prefer offset,\" that I won't get into here... It's not usually used for deserialization/parsing.) reply Macha 2 hours agorootparentSo in my use cases, there's three types of dates that matter: 1. Past dates. These can be stored UTC, and just rendered in the appropriate timezone as a matter of formatting. 2. Future non-human dates: e.g. the next execution time of a job that runs every hour. These can just be UTC 3. Future human dates: I care about the human selected timezone so that events happen on the wall clock time the user expects. The UTC time and UTC offset are meaningless. So in cases 1 and 2, having a non-UTC date is not required, while for case 3, the only thing that UTC offset is doing is adding information that could be inconsistent or confusing. e.g. If the concert is on at 2026-01-31T18:00:00[Europe/Dublin] , that's all that matters, whether that ends up being 2026-01-31T18:00:00+00:00 or 2026-01-31T18:00:00+01:00 is unimportant for whether the building is going to be open at the time. So the system failing to give customers on the day of the concert a countdown because `2026-01-31T18:00:00+00:00[Europe/Dublin]` has become inconsistent because e.g. the EU actually did go ahead and abolish DST is suboptimal. reply burntsushi 1 hour agorootparentFor that specific use case, sure! But Temporal isn't for Macha's 3 use cases. Not all future datetimes are only concerned with civil time. Some are concerned with the precise instant in time. So how do you choose which one? There is no one universal right answer, so IMO, the right default is to reject. But if you know your use cases and know you always want to adhere to civil time even if it means a change in the precise instant, then Temporal supports that too: >> zdt = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from(\"2025-06-20T17:00+08[US/Eastern]\") Uncaught RangeError: Offset +08:00 is invalid for 2025-06-20T17:00:00 in US/Eastern InterpretISODateTimeOffset ecmascript.mjs:1467 ToTemporalZonedDateTime ecmascript.mjs:1531 from zoneddatetime.mjs:478debugger eval code:1 >> zdt = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from(\"2025-06-20T17:00+08[US/Eastern]\", {offset: 'ignore'}) >> zdt.toString() \"2025-06-20T17:00:00-04:00[US/Eastern]\" > So in cases 1 and 2, having a non-UTC date is not required If the only operation you need is formatting, then I agree, you can apply the time zone to the instant right before it's displayed. But there are many other operations (such as arithmetic or computing durations between datetimes) you might want to do that do required a time zone. You might still be able to get away with only storing a UTC date, but it really depends on what you're doing. reply jrochkind1 3 hours agorootparentprevIt does not assume that implementing libraries need to and do, in practice right now implement the rules for jurisdictions change the rules for offsets. That's part of why they are tied to a certain city time zone rules are unlikely to bisect a city, although if they did I guess they'd have to deprecate it as a timezone name and use something else! Not sure if this has ever happened. All of this is kept track of in the IANA Time Zone database, and labels like `Europe/Paris` are from keys into that database, not arbitrary. https://www.iana.org/time-zones Sometimes when jurisdictions do weird stuff like changing their rules for (say) when Daylight Savings starts with no notice (effective tomorrow!), the libraries can take a bit of time to catch up and be correct again (and have the new version be distributed to all users). But keeping track of (say) that America/New York on March 25 2024 is UTC-4 but March 2025 1990 is UTC-5 hours (they changed when Daylight Savings started in between those years) is absolutely something current (eg OS) time libraries do. As well as keeping track of the gregorian correction in (depending on country) October 1582 (skipping over 10 days in the calendar!), when calculating historical intervals. They really do this, already! That's why you say \"Europe/Paris\" or \"America/New York\" instead of \"UTC-5\", to let the library figure out the rules for offsets at that location on the time specified. I assume Temporal will do the same. JS environments are usually running on OS's that will already provide this service, the browser or other execution environment won't have to implement it from scratch.

They really do this, already! Which libraries do this? Libraries usually implement proleptic calendars, including Temporal[1], which specifically do not account for shifts like this.

Not sure if this has ever happened. It's actually easier to create this problem than by bisecting a city, and the easier way is even more complex than bisecting a city. You obviously can't put every hamlet, town and village into tzdb, for a lot of reasons. So, if you're trying to represent a time in a place that isn't in tzdb, you have to pick the nearest location that is in tzdb. And it's quite possible that between when you enter your time and when that time comes to pass, the location you were specifying for changes it's rules in a way that's different from the original place you chose. If you bisect a city, you could create two new names, so that if you encountered the old name you'd know that something needed to be reconciled. But if you chose the nearest place and then your rules changed, you'd have no way to know automatically that it needed to be revisited. For example, parts of Chile decided not to do DST any more. To support this, a new timezone, America/Punta_Arenas, was added to tzdb. Before this, if you were in Punta Arenas, you would just put all your times as America/Santiago. And now you have no way of knowing if those times are really supposed to be Santiago or if they were Punta Arenas and Santiago was just the best you could do at the time. Location-based tz's are the best we can do right now but even still they have intractable problems when things change. reply MobiusHorizons 3 hours agorootparentprevPlaces like Europe/Paris or America/Los Angeles can participate in daylight savings, and if they do, they may have different schedules, and those schedules may change at different points in history due to the passing of laws. Europe and the us already have a different schedule for daylight savings, and the whole west coast is trying to opt into permanent daylight savings for the last several years. But that would require an act of congress. Programmatically it mostly means you have to ship metadata about how the offsets change over time, which needs to be updated periodically. Browsers already ship that metadata, so it is really nice to finally have a way to access it from JavaScript without shipping the extra few tens of kilobytes. reply SonOfLilit 6 hours agorootparentprevEurope/Paris might change between now and the referenced time. reply Piskvorrr 5 hours agorootparentIn other words, 2025-01-01T00:00+02:00 was NOT Europe/Paris (as it was CET at that time, GMT+1), 2024-08-01T00:00+02:00 could have been Europe/Paris (CEST, GMT+2), 2030-08-01T00:00+02:00 may be Europe/Paris (CEST, GMT+2), or perhaps not (CET, GMT+1).

Granted, I still hold the silly view that we should probably change daylight savings time to be a 10 minute change of the clock every month. Up for six months, down for 6 months.

In the meantime new node versions constantly break backwards compatibility. Upgrading packages is a mess.

I actually don't know if browsers use that or if they ship their own copy. But Temporal definitely uses the IANA tzdb. > If a user visits my website and this user has not updated their browser with the new data, will they see incorrect hours? Yeah I think this is generally correct. But I don't think that's a departure from current norms? I think this is also just true in general. If the user doesn't update to their system to account for new time zone transition rules then that's just kinda how the cookie crumbles. The alternative is that every application ships their own tzdb. And to be clear, some do that and sometimes it is warranted. But in general this would be wasteful and likely lead overall to inconsistency between applications and likely a slower cadence of updates.

My understanding is that browser vendors already have pretty strong opposition to introducing new primitives at this point. Reading this thread[1] will give some explanation as to the hiccups with how equality would behave. It sucks, because while I wouldn't have expected BigInt to have gotten much adoption in the first place, I constantly run into cases where I'd want collections with structural equality.

I don't think any of them has seen any significant progress in the past year, except maybe pattern matching. According to an issue in the records and tuples repo, there's been pushback on the value semantics of it (i.e. whether === can be made to work).

This gives a good description of how working with mutable timestamps can cause problems, because methods like $newInstance = $instance->addDay() modify the original instance and return it, rather than returning a copy that's a day later: https://carbon.nesbot.com/docs/ So it's best to mostly use CarbonImmutable so that a new instance is always returned, which works better for higher-order programming style that's closer to pure functional programming. I do wish that Carbon was immutable by default, with CarbonMutable as a fallback when necessary, but it's too late for them to change it now.

If you're in a plane with no internet, or if you're privacy conscious and you have location services turned off, there's no way for the JS engine to know you're in a different timezone. I mean your argument has some merit but I'd argue that \"you get the new timezone if you create a new date after your system updates its local timezone\" is good enough. Furthermore, most applications will just use UTC; local timezone is more used to adjust the displayed time, and even then it's opt in (e.g. someone reading a log will want server time or UTC, someone using a calendar will want to see their local time OR the time at the location of an event, etc). reply TheAceOfHearts 4 hours agorootparentThe operating system is responsible for tracking timezone changes. If you turn off automatic timezone switching or you're in an airplane without internet then the timezone change just won't be detected, which is perfectly fine. That isn't an argument against supporting a timezonechange event. Every major operating system has had a way to keep track of timezone changes going back over 25 years. This was during the era where most people were on desktops, but now most people are on mobile devices so it's more relevant than ever. Chromium already has a time_zone_monitor service in place, which I linked in a different reply. Currently, if you want to detect that the timezone has changed you have to poll `Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone` and `new Date().getTimezoneOffset()`. An event would just let you get notified without requiring polling.

Java replaced this implementation in 1997, but JavaScript is stuck with the same API for almost 30 years, despite known problems. I'm not a JavaScript or web developer, and I was surprised by the above. Can anyone comment on why the language was stuck with an inadequate api for so long? What are the forces at work here? reply DanielHB 5 hours agoparentWell browser standards were pretty much gimped by microsoft during the IE5/IE6 era, so from 1998 until around 2010 there was no progress on standards and Microsoft was actively trying to prevent web applications from becoming a thing in order to not damage Windows market share. From 2010 until about 2020 I would say the standard committee took hold and they have been quite busy with other things. Since JS is a language defined by committee it can take quite some time for people to agree on APIs which is a subjective topic. The last thing the standards body want is to introduce an API and then deprecate it in favor of another API slightly later. reply WorldMaker 35 minutes agorootparent> during the IE5/IE6 era During that era was a peak of browser innovation. IE5 and IE6 contributed a lot of things to web standards. They contributed a bunch of things that web standards eventually rejected too, but that was the risk of innovation at the time. It was the period between IE6's last feature update and IE7's first release where Microsoft declared the browser wars \"finished\" and disbanded the IE team entirely that was the Darkest Age. So about 2001-2006 were the darkest few years. It certainly had repercussions until around 2010, but the worst \"sabotages\" were done and gone by then. \"Legacy\" problems. reply harrall 2 hours agorootparentprevMicrosoft was MASSIVELY trying to make web applications a thing. They introduced HTML Applications[1] in 1999 (e.g. Electron). In 2001, they added the JavaScript features that let us have Gmail and Google Maps (XMLHttpRequest). They let you rebuild your Windows desktop or any folder as a HTML in Windows 2000/ME. They created a ton of APIs from web components[2] to CSS effects[3] in 1998. However, when Netscape died, Microsoft did a 180 and went from the leader in promoting the web to the absolute worst obstruction. It seemed like they completely de-funded their IE development team.

There were so many bigger issues like that I think that made this not a high priority in the grand scheme of things. I think a good example of this is jQuery while jQuery is a good tool, a huge part of its usage was the quirks between browsers. Selectors and the class of problems jQuery solved had more immediate impact to web applications, so fixing and taking from it became a more immediate concern.

Use momentjs today and you're behind the times, but use the new standard library date functions and you're pretty much guaranteed that code that works today will still work in 20 years. reply trescenzi 4 hours agorootparentprevOne reason Temporal is a huge deal is because it differentiates between Date, Time, and DateTime. All of the libraries building on top of jsDate couldn't really do this effectively. I've been using Temporal in production now for about 2 years with a polyfill and while this distinction can be annoying at first, the ability to be so much more specific is very helpful. reply deltarholamda 4 hours agoparentprevIt is great news. I was not aware this was in the works. Using other libraries for something as fundamental as this always seemed odd. reply ARandumGuy 1 hour agoprevMy work does a lot of stuff with time and scheduling, and let me tell you having timezone-unaware date/time objects distinct from specific points in time will be so damn useful. The old Date class made it really easy to accidentally screw that up. Third party libraries help, but something as important and fundamental as time really should have a good built-in implementation. reply codeflo 6 hours agoprevAt first glance, this seems to be in the JodaTime/NodaTime/Js-Joda tradition of representing different \"granularities\" of date and time information with distinct types, e.g. with and without timezone information. I'm not sure if there's a formal relationship, since this seems to use different names. I personally like that approach, but I'm not sure how much sense that makes without static typing. (Maybe TypeScript is established enough that JavaScript APIs are now designed with TypeScript in mind?) From experience with js-joda, there's a definitely learning curve compared to moment's \"one size fits all\" type for all things date related. But I found that a lot of stupid mistakes of the kind \"a person's age is wrong for an hour after midnight during daylight savings time\" are prevented by default. reply baq 6 hours agoparentThere’s a learning curve for developers who thought time is easy.

    "originLink": "https://www.wiz.io/blog/wiz-research-uncovers-exposed-deepseek-database-leak",
    "originBody": "Wiz Research has identified a publicly accessible ClickHouse database belonging to DeepSeek, which allows full control over database operations, including the ability to access internal data. The exposure includes over a million lines of log streams containing chat history, secret keys, backend details, and other highly sensitive information. The Wiz Research team immediately and responsibly disclosed the issue to DeepSeek, which promptly secured the exposure. In this blog post, we will detail our discovery and also consider the broader implications for the industry at large. Executive Summary DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, has recently garnered significant media attention due to its groundbreaking AI models, particularly the DeepSeek-R1 reasoning model. This model rivals leading AI systems like OpenAI’s o1 in performance and stands out for its cost-effectiveness and efficiency. As DeepSeek made waves in the AI space, the Wiz Research team set out to assess its external security posture and identify any potential vulnerabilities. Within minutes, we found a publicly accessible ClickHouse database linked to DeepSeek, completely open and unauthenticated, exposing sensitive data. It was hosted at oauth2callback.deepseek.com:9000 and dev.deepseek.com:9000. This database contained a significant volume of chat history, backend data and sensitive information, including log streams, API Secrets, and operational details. More critically, the exposure allowed for full database control and potential privilege escalation within the DeepSeek environment, without any authentication or defense mechanism to the outside world. Exposure Walkthrough Our reconnaissance began with assessing DeepSeek’s publicly accessible domains. By mapping the external attack surface with straightforward reconnaissance techniques (passive and active discovery of subdomains), we identified around 30 internet-facing subdomains. Most appeared benign, hosting elements like the chatbot interface, status page, and API documentation—none of which initially suggested a high-risk exposure. However, as we expanded our search beyond standard HTTP ports (80/443), we detected two unusual, open ports (8123 & 9000) associated with the following hosts: http://oauth2callback.deepseek.com:8123 http://dev.deepseek.com:8123 http://oauth2callback.deepseek.com:9000 http://dev.deepseek.com:9000 Upon further investigation, these ports led to a publicly exposed ClickHouse database, accessible without any authentication at all – immediately raising red flags. ClickHouse is an open-source, columnar database management system designed for fast analytical queries on large datasets. It was developed by Yandex and is widely used for real-time data processing, log storage, and big data analytics, which indicates such exposure as a very valuable and sensitive discovery. By leveraging ClickHouse’s HTTP interface, we accessed the /play path, which allowed direct execution of arbitrary SQL queries via the browser. Running a simple SHOW TABLES; query returned a full list of accessible datasets. Tables output from ClickHouse Web UI Among them, one table stood out: log_stream, which contained extensive logs with highly sensitive data. The log_stream table contained over 1 million log entries, with particularly revealing columns: timestamp – Logs dating from January 6, 2025 span_name – References to various internal DeepSeek API endpoints string.values – Plaintext logs, including Chat History, API Keys, backend details, and operational metadata _service – Indicating which DeepSeek service generated the logs _source – Exposing the origin of log requests, containing Chat History, API Keys, directory structures, and chatbot metadata logs This level of access posed a critical risk to DeepSeek’s own security and for its end-users. Not only an attacker could retrieve sensitive logs and actual plain-text chat messages, but they could also potentially exfiltrate plaintext passwords and local files along propriety information directly from the server using queries like: SELECT * FROM file('filename') depending on their ClickHouse configuration. (Note: We did not execute intrusive queries beyond enumeration to preserve ethical research practices.) Key Takeaways The rapid adoption of AI services without corresponding security is inherently risky. This exposure underscores the fact that the immediate security risks for AI applications stem from the infrastructure and tools supporting them. While much of the attention around AI security is focused on futuristic threats, the real dangers often come from basic risks—like accidental external exposure of databases. These risks, which are fundamental to security, should remain a top priority for security teams. As organizations rush to adopt AI tools and services from a growing number of startups and providers, it’s essential to remember that by doing so, we’re entrusting these companies with sensitive data. The rapid pace of adoption often leads to overlooking security, but protecting customer data must remain the top priority. It’s crucial that security teams work closely with AI engineers to ensure visibility into the architecture, tooling, and models being used, so we can safeguard data and prevent exposure. Conclusion The world has never seen a piece of technology adopted at the pace of AI. Many AI companies have rapidly grown into critical infrastructure providers without the security frameworks that typically accompany such widespread adoptions. As AI becomes deeply integrated into businesses worldwide, the industry must recognize the risks of handling sensitive data and enforce security practices on par with those required for public cloud providers and major infrastructure providers.

Like, when a DeepSeek dev uses these systems as intended, would they also be seeing the columns, keys, etc. in English? Is there usually a translation step involved?

That is precisely what happens. It is not unusual for code and databases to be written in English, even when the developers are from a non-English speaking country. Think about it: the toolchain, programming language and libraries are all based on English anyway. reply londons_explore 18 hours agorootparentInterestingly, in the world of electronics this used to be true too. The first Diode on a circuit board would be marked \"D1\", no matter which country produced it. Datasheets for components would be in english. Any text on a circuit board would be in english (ie. \"Voltage Select Switch\" or \"Copyright 2025\".). However, a few years back it became common for most datasheets to be available in mandarin and english, and this year most PCB fabrication houses have gained support for putting chinese characters onto a circuit board (requires better quality printing, due to more definition needed for legibility). Now there are a decent number of devices where the only documentation is only available in mandarin, and the design process was clearly done with little or no english involved. Not everything changes though gold plating thickness is measured by the micro-inch. Components often still use 0.1 inch pin spacing.

All the tooling uses it, standardized components use it (I can drop a 74-series TTL chip from the 1970s in a modern board), and everyone learns it when they start using EDA.

Bonus point when the people who decided to use English words are also all proud of their \"DDD\" architecture. reply throwaway1053 6 hours agorootparentI agree. It makes sense when the code needs to handle domain specific words. Based on my experience in Norway, it is common to use English but there is also not a complete surprise to find code in Norwegian either. I remember looking at code written by a Norwegian government agency many years ago, and asking why they used Norwegian names for functions and variables. Didn't everyone use English? The answer was that they had so much domain specific terminology that it is not only hard to find English equivalents, it was so ingrained in the business logic that they don't want to risk any confusion and legal consequences. If a function was named validateFoo, then \"Foo\" had a single shared understanding. reply lawn 6 hours agorootparentprevOh I'm working on a local only project right now and I also feel the pain of badly translated Swedish words. I've spent this week trying to decipher a section of code, trying to map then back to the Swedish concepts. I've also experienced a similar situation in an English context where the concept is renamed on UI, while everywhere in the code it uses the old name. Then things are starting to mix with each other and then a new concept is introduced with the old name... Fun times. reply edudobay 5 hours agorootparentprevConsidering Brazil and the Spanish-speaking people whom I've worked with, it's common for English coding to be the norm for the company/project, but many people are far from being proficient in English, so we end up with funny names that are often confusing or nonsense I've seen an \"evaluation service\" that is actually a \"rating service\" (both could translate to the same in Portuguese). They often translate to false cognates too. There are some business concepts that are very unique to a place (country-specific or even company-specific) with no precise translation to the English-speaking world, and so I sometimes prefer to keep them in their native language. reply impulsivepuppet 18 hours agoparentprevIt might seem less credible to encounter English in a place where it’s less expected, but think of it this way: would a Yandex-developed ClickHouse database be adopted by Chinese devs if everything in it were written in Russian? There is some merit in asking your question, for there’s an unspoken rule (and a source of endless frustration) that business-/domain-related terms should remain in the language of their origin. Otherwise, (real-life story) \"Leitungsauskunft\" could end up being translated as \"line information\" or even \"channel interface\" (\"pipeline inquiry\" should be correct, it's a type of document you can procure from the [German] government). Ironically, I’m currently working in an environment where we decided to translate such terms, and it hasn’t helped with understanding of the business logic at all. Furthermore, it adds an element of surprise and a topic for debate whenever somebody comes up with a \"more accurate translation\".

Now that I think about it, german is especially good at creating words by concatination. So \"arrival time\" should just be the single word \"Ankunftszeit\" \"ankunftZeit\" feels a bit off. reply TeMPOraL 8 hours agorootparentYup. If languages were characters in a computer RPG, they'd have \"special skills\" listed on their character cards. Off the top of my head: English: verbing and nouning. All languages have ways of introducing new words, but only in English I've seen it accepted as something anyone can casually do in a throwaway manner. Have a noun but want to talk about the (contextually) default action related to the noun? No big deal, just stick an \"-ing\" or \"-ed\" to its end and carry on. I adore this feature. German: word concatenation you mention, it's a killer feature. And then there's the peculiar grammar that puts the most important verb at the very end of a sentence, giving you stuff like \"Gegen die hohen Preise für Gas, Strom und Treibstoff will die Regierung etwas machen\", meaning \"The government wants to do something about the high prices for gas, electricity and fuel\", but structured as \"do something\". So not only you need to listen to the end of a sentence to know what it's about, but you can actually zone out a bit early on, catch the last few words, and still recover the meaning.

The whole concept of these \"patterns\" are actually an arbitrary style that got invented in the English speaking world. In non-english countries people program in ways that are more straightforward. reply etrautmann 14 hours agorootparentCan you provide an example? reply ninetyninenine 14 hours agorootparentFirst, we create an AbstractFactory to generate objects that conform to our standardized output structure, ensuring extensibility in case \"Hello, World!\" ever needs additional variants. The Singleton manages our PrintManager, enforcing a single, controlled point of access to the output stream while Double-Checked Locking ensures thread-safe initialization. Dependency Injection provides our PrintHandler with a flexible logging system, allowing it to notify an Observer whenever \"Hello, World!\" is printed. The Mediator coordinates between components to ensure the PrintHandler doesn’t have direct dependencies on the OutputStrategy. To maintain optimal efficiency, a Flyweight is used for the \"Hello, World!\" string, preventing redundant memory allocation. The Proxy regulates access to the print function, ensuring only authorized modules can invoke it. The Composite structure organizes potential multiple output streams, making it easy to expand the system beyond just console printing. A Factory of Factories, or MetaFactory, oversees creation of our AbstractFactories to maintain consistency and scalability. Before execution, Encapsulation hides implementation details while Cohesion ensures the PrintHandler remains single-responsibility. Loose Coupling ensures that changing one component won’t break the system. Interfaces dictate behavior, and Abstract Classes provide reusable codebases. Dynamic Dispatch selects the appropriate OutputStrategy at runtime. To enhance modularity, a Decorator wraps the PrintHandler for additional formatting options, an Adapter ensures compatibility with different logging frameworks, a Memento preserves state in case a rollback is needed, and a Facade simplifies access for higher-level modules. The Chain of Responsibility delegates different logging levels, while the Command Pattern encapsulates the printing request for possible queuing or delayed execution. By adhering to Open-Closed, we can extend our print functionality without modifying core logic. Liskov Substitution ensures all output strategies remain interchangeable. Interface Segregation ensures smaller, focused contracts. Dependency Inversion prioritizes abstractions over concrete implementations. Finally, SOLID principles uphold scalability, reusability, and maintainability. UML diagrams map out relationships, Sequence flows depict interactions, and Design Contracts enforce constraints, ensuring the system remains adaptable. After all this, we simply call PrintManager.getInstance().print(\"Hello, World!\"); and marvel at our masterpiece. reply pjc50 8 hours agorootparentThis is very much a Java phenomenon.

In the current competitive environment, even with DeepSeek's work, it's near-impossible to imagine OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or Meta deciding to cut the compute budget for training their next model by an order of magnitude. They will still incorporate DeepSeek's techniques into their next model, but use them to squeeze even more performance out of the compute they have, and will keep purchasing as much compute as NVidia will sell them. Expect this trend to continue until there are no more returns to scale anymore. reply robomartin 15 hours agorootparentIt's even more fundamental than that. Any data center project currently under way or with plans to open within the next year or two has already place orders with NVidia or will do so very soon. Due to demand and lead times, you have to order to critical parts and systems today if you want to have half a chance of receiving them a year from now. Hardware supply lines are long and complex. I like to say that you cannot run a compiler and end-up with a warehouse full of chips. The next fundamental reality has to do with competition. Suppose company A foolishly decides to build a data center with only 10% of the chips they originally wanted based on the hype around DeepSeek. In the meantime, company B sticks to the plan and, perhaps, decide to take add the 90% of chips data center A did not take. The net result will be the company A will be absolutely destroyed by company B. They will have nearly twice the compute capacity, which will translate to a huge competitive advantage across many fronts. In other words, the selloff is, at best, ill informed. Market forces caused FUD. The smart one's took it as an absolutely massive buying opportunity. All you have to do now is wait. reply dutchbookmaker 5 hours agorootparentBecause all this with the stock price has nothing to do with reality. Everyone just starts repeating the same things until people believe them as fact. The \"sell off\" was basically nothing. Who cares that the NVDA went back to the price it was in October then bounced in the after market one day. It is a complete non-story. Even at the bottom of the \"sell off\" it was still up 20% from the end of summer. Listening to any news makes people less informed about the world in 2025. We are way past Gell-Mann amnesia. That was for the newspaper. \"The news\" in 2025 is really a strange kind of mass confusion engine. The more news a person consumes the more confused they are about the world. reply robomartin 1 hour agorootparentTo be fair, the problem (if we are going to call it a problem) might be more fundamental than that. The reality is that your average \"civilian\" stock investor, speaking in very generalized terms, is supremely ignorant. I don't say this as a pejorative BTW. I am supremely ignorant of the inner workings of the pharmaceutical industry. Because of this, I do not invest in that sector. I have no way to understand any of it at a depth sufficient for me to make informed decisions. I'd be throwing darts at a board. That is precisely the situation with lots of investors in the chips, electronics and software worlds. They don't know what they are doing. They have no clue whatsoever about the business cycles and realities of making these things, selling them, bringing them to market, competitive landscapes, implementation, etc. And so, they are blind and reactive. If they stay in panic mode, we might very well see NVidia stock get down to $100. Frankly, I am actually rooting for that. I want all of these fools to get off the stock. And I want to load-up on it some more. They don't understand business (in general) enough to understand the relationship between DeepSeek and data centers, planned and future. They don't even stop to think about the reality that nobody in business who isn't a fool is going to use an AI service in China or developed by China. If they are hyperventilating about TikTok, I cannot even imagine what it would be like if all AI queries go to servers in China or are answered by models trained in China. I love China for all they have achieved, but it is no secret that they are not an open society at the level of most western societies.

It's sad to watch. reply gleenn 16 hours agorootparentprevThe stock price had assumptions baked in about the number of units expected to be sold. DeepSeek cut that hardware estimate by as much as 45x. That is that absolute obvious correlation between that model being very efficient to train and NVDA dropping 18%. reply aoanevdus 15 hours agorootparentI don’t get it. The labs have regularly made improvements that dramatically lower the cost of training an equal-performing model. When they do this, they also train a larger model with even higher performance. This time, DeepSeek did the first part but didn’t do the second. Now every lab in the world will throw their compute into the effort to replicate and beat DeepSeek’s model with larger scale. It’s not like everyone is just going to say “well I guess AI is smart enough now, no point improving it anymore!” and stop building bigger training clusters. If anything, r1 makes even more GPU demand likely, since it mitigated or at least delayed the risk AI hit a dead end (in which case, ceasing development may actually make sense). reply sampullman 16 hours agorootparentprevIt still doesn't make sense to me. If the money for training is still there, wouldn't companies that can afford it use the efficiency gains and also scale up models? Unless AI is a bubble, and it pops, I can't see the demand for compute going down. reply EGreg 15 hours agorootparentI think AI is a bubble. The amount of compute for inference is vastly overestimated, because a lot of caching is coming. It's driven by maniacal statements like Sam Altman's insistence that we must spend Trillions on compute, to achieve AGI, and it's more important than anything else. Project Stargate is some large fraction of that, and of course Softbank is no stranger to losing money on overestimating demand (for example, WeWork). To be fair, China has a lot of overestimation of demand too (for example Evergrande).

I'm not sure what result you expected. True or not, claims of atrocities committed by your government are always uncertain in practice people will argue whichever way depending on their goals and beliefs (like we're doing here just now), so even if you believe them, unless you've actually seen them first-hand, they're always somewhat abstract considerations. Meanwhile, the fundamental reality for people in Gaza is that they're being bombed left and right by some outsiders. So when more outsiders come asking them whether they still like their government government who, other than committing atrocities in what they sell as defensive war, are also responsible for keeping food, water and power flowing while bombs dropped by outsiders keep raining down your streets, does anyone expect majority to say \"no, we don't like our government please keep bombing us until we find a better one\"? I bet if you polled the population of Iraq of Afghanistan in the middle of US invasions of either, you'd get similar results supporting the evil government too.

Often people claim the residents of Gaza didn’t vote for Hamas since the last election was in 2006. But the surveys reveal that most of them do support them and their religious terrorism. > \"Surveys\" cannot make collective punishment legal, or annexation and ethnic cleansing for that matter. What do you mean by annexation given that the entire region, including Jerusalem, the West Bank, and Gaza were occupied by Jewish people long before Islamic Arabs were in the area? What do you mean by ethnic cleansing given that Gaza’s population has grown rapidly over time, given Israel announces targets ahead of time, and given that most of Gaza’s residents still live? Israel could level all of Gaza but they haven’t done anything even remotely close to that. Even the highest claimed counts of deaths in Gaza would amount to a couple percent of the population. That doesn’t seem very successful for an ethnic cleansing. > outright cutting off a whole population from food Food and aid which Hamas stole and sold for money to fund terrorism to kill Israelis, all aided by UNRWA. > Each person is responsible for their actions.

On the one hand, the slaughter of teenagers today in Gaza is justified because of the sins of their forefathers in electing Hamas, on the other, it's a genocidal atrocity that beards can only be so long in Xinjiang.

But my immediate thought is to note that the two situations are very different to me. Uyghurs are indigenous to Xinjiang (more than anyone else), and Islamic Arabs in Gaza or the West Bank are not indigenous to the region around Israel (Jewish people are, while Gaza's residents are outsiders since Islamic Arabs aren't indigenous to the region). The CCP/PRC is erasing Uyghur life in Xinjiang and forcing their population growth downward, while Islamic Arabs living in Israel have full protection of the law, can practice their religion and culture freely, gain wealth, have families without forced sterilization or abortion, and live without the threat of the state kidnapping their children. There's no evidence of Uyghurs broadly supporting terrorist attacks, while there's evidence of Gaza residents overwhelmingly supporting things like repeated rocket attacks. There's more but basically there are enough differences that the situations can be treated differently. But at the same time, I do hope for a different, peaceful solution. Surveys show Islamic Arabs are generally quite happy under Israel, but that won't work for those in West Bank or Gaza perhaps. You are right that teenagers who aren't supportive of terrorism don't deserve violence. A two state solution still seems like the best idea, but Hamas has still not shown support for it, even though it would mean peaceful coexistence and could lead to a rebuilding of Gaza and West Bank. reply nakeru 3 hours agorootparentWhat you call \"Islamic Arabs\" makes no sense.

You need to examine you own massive biases here, adjust your view to international law and human rights and you'd see the massive injustice here that is fueling the conflict and will continue to until its addressed. Israel is not securing its own safe future here, there is no military solution here. Hamas will rebuild itself if it hasn't already because the crime they have committed and the people they have murdered will only boost the recruitment of Hamas and other paramilitary groups. This has always been the way the world over. Jewish history is itself has examples of this.

They are massively repressed around the world try support Palestinian rights in the US right now. Anyone can be labelled a terrorist. I would label the IDF a terrorist organisation due to their methods, their justifications for the many human rights abuses and killings ring very hollow. They also encourage and support their own fundamentalists aka settlers to commit crimes. Lastly I think anyone who commits war crimes should be brought to the ICC; Israel has shown it is incapable of broadly prosecuting theses crimes and obviously the PA cant either. It is Israels fault if they kill civilians and I don't buy any of their justification as they've been shown again and again to be untrustworthy. I believe they will be found guilt of genocide in the end, and the countries who supplied them with the weapons and tech will be guilty of enabling a genocide there's plenty of evidence that the state department in the US has brushed knowledge of human right abuses and war crimes under the carpet for political and ideological reasons. reply blackeyeblitzar 1 hour agorootparent> You mentioned America as an examplar of demcracy further up, while in truth it is an extremely flawed model of democracy I disagree with your framing, as does your source. The index you shared does not paint America as \"extremely flawed\", but just flawed (and even so, almost at the score of getting their highest rank). So adding the word \"extremely\" is your editorial take. However, their rating system is not transparent it's not clear who they surveyed or what questions they asked. It's also clear this rating system is only somewhat correct in scoring countries for example both Canada and Australia are democracies but have notable restrictions on free speech, a core principle of a free society and any democracy but they were ranked higher than the US. > Anyone can be labelled a terrorist. Labels can be misused, but what actually happened? Has Israel been shooting rockets indiscriminately into Gaza? No, but people in Gaza have been doing that for a few decades now. In fact, the rocket attacks got a lot worse after Israel left Gaza in 2005. Is that not terrorism? > It is Israels fault if they kill civilians How can it be when they're pursuing terrorists who choose to use human shields on purpose? Israel has been careful to announce targets ahead of time and has gone above and beyond what any other country would to avoid civilian casualties.

It's delulu to think otherwise. It's more kids gloves than US prison industrial complex. And it more or less comprehensively solved the Uyghur extremism and attacks in PRC (100s of attacks over the years with 1000+ fatalities). Muslim world is far better off that PRC has successfully implemented securitization technology to deradicalize, because they have the most to gain from it, that's why there's broad support from Muslim leadership.

There's more Uyghurs now then when campaign started (and ended)... at most it's cultural genocide, which unfortunately (or fortunately for everyone including west) ... is internationally permissible (no law against). Frankly some overdue cultural genocide to eliminate fundmentalism on 1% population to end decades of fundmental islamic terrorism is completely justifiable. It would be downright negligent and immoral not to, certainly more ethical than what US or ISR methods which you seem to play down. There aren't 100,000s children seperation. Parents rotate through reeducation for a few months, temporary seperation in interim, family reunited after. Entire program lasted ~4 years, even if you take peak US propaganda, 1/12 of Uyghurs is roughly life time internment for US blacks, except US minorities will end up up rotating through prison industrial complex for longer. Flip side of PRC enforcing family planning on previously exempt minorities is US banning abortions. No labour camps, just very generous rural labour transfer programs where they make multiple times current income. It's like if US had a jobs program that gave bottom quantile 50th percentile wages. Nor large number of deaths... barely any. Even peak retarded US propaganda doesn't pretend so. So yes, compared to Israel or US military actions, it's downright magnanimous. >euphemism It's not euphism, it's \"safe city\" technology, i.e. huawei surveillance for export.

Entire excuse MENA leaders in PRC pocket is economically illiterate and geopolitcly stupid. There's isn't a quote of Arab leaders supporting genocide of Uyghurs, because none of them except occasionally Turkey recognize is Genocide. They recognize XJ securitization as deradicalization and antiterrorism effort, which it is, because it stopped both. And they endorse it, because they have most to gain from working deradicalization efforts. Which US does not have model for. Nor Israel. Well maybe Israel if they just keep murdering kids every few leap years. >thousands of times worse and larger My guy if you think US only responsible for a few drones, and Israel killed less Muslisms that PRC did in XJ, or if you think top is worse than bottom in pic below then you have some screws loose.

Which PRC policy isn't. It's just boring family planning that always applied to Han, that minorities historically got to opt out due to affirmative action, now equally applied to Uyhghurs with 3+ kids. Meanwhile Uyghur population contiues to increase, and family planning still limits Uyghurs and minorities to 3 kids like every other ethnic group, aka positive TFR / mathematically impossible to actually eliminate a minority. Hence it's retarded to think this satisfies definition for genocide, and why US propaganda campaign failed so hard. Because anyone except the most brain rot liberal world ordertard realize it's coercize integration/sinicization but not genocide. If PRC wanted to actually genocide Uyghurs, with their industrial capacity, they can do it in a weekend, instead they spent trillions retraining the populous and subsidize regions QoL. It's stupid to think it's genocide for the simple reason reducing 55 PRC minorities to 54 looks bad for Xi's hagiography. >few months claim is false Except it's true, most gets put through a few months of patriotic education to scare them from fundemental salafisim/salafijihadism. PRC doesn't have the money to waste interning million+ like US prison industrial complex forever because jailing people is profitable. I didn't say it was \"OK\", I just said a few months of scaring people straight at \"don't be bad muslim camp\" is much better/expedient/ethical than bombs. It's not minimizing, it's acknowledging that's better than kids spending years being afraid of the blue sky because some drone operator on CONUS can end you any time. And frequently do. Besides Han migrant parents are away from their kids for years, Uyghur kids can handle a few months living with relatives while their parents learn how to raise them to not commit terroism or go do a factory rotation in another province and bring home a years wage in a few months. >Barely any Barely any that US intelligence or anyone can find, barely any that even US propaganda under Pompeo didn't try to spin mass deaths because again it would have been absurd to even try. By survivors you mean atrocity propagandist begging for VISAs, idiots like Sayragul Sauytbay who \"did not personally see violence\" at the camps in 2018 to \"inmates were flayed, raped by guards in front of other prisoners, and given injections that made them infertile\" in 2019. You would have be naive to believe obvious attrocity propaganda. And even more delusional than a CIA shill to believe there were extreme deaths like scale of Gaza or GWOT since even POMPEO's CIA propaganda DOESN'T try to spin mass death. Like the most retarded anti-CCP/PRC \"thinktanks\" estimate for deaths is single digit thousands throughout XJ internment phase... for reference ~4000 prisoners die in US prisons every year i.e. the 4 years of XJ \"reeduction\" statistically killed less than US prisons during same time period. So let that settle in, your positions are literally more ridiculous than what lying Pompeo is willing to propagandize. Claiming otherwise is not just not factual but delusional beyond even already delusional propaganda. It's outing the sheer unhingedness of your worldview, which TBH explains how you think XJ is worse atrocity than GWOT or Gaza when XJ is objectively one of the most \"humane\" integration campaigns in human history. Humane =/= clean, just historically when integrating a minority, much more blood was shed and destruction was wrought over much longer period of time, and the minority populations generally weren't still growing while per capita GDP roughly doubles, oh and terrorist attacks basically eliminated for 1350 million people... which you seem to think is important enough for 10 million large Israel to rationalize their response. reply blackeyeblitzar 19 minutes agorootparentI am not convinced by your framing and some of the factual claims you have made.

Flights at the airport have been halted while search and rescue teams survey the area for survivors in the Potomac River. CNN reported that there were 60 passengers and four crew members aboard the plane, which is at least partially submerged. Fox News reported that there were three soldiers aboard the helicopter. Officials say at least 18 bodies have been recovered. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, preliminary indications are that the plane involved was a PSA Airlines Bombardier CRJ700 regional jet. PSA is a regional carrier that operates flights for American Airlines. A user posted webcam footage of the explosion shot from the Kennedy Center.

I can see a world where the fault is on the VH-60, but absent more information, it would surprise me less to hear that it's the fault of the tower. Knowing where AA5342 was in its approach, I see no possibility of the jet being at fault. https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/AAL5342 I'm drawing a lot of early conclusions but it's mostly because I'm just not surprised. Angry as someone who flies a bunch, but not surprised. reply sib301 15 hours agoparentI just listened to the ATC recording from immediately before the collision. ATC instructs the helicopter to pass behind the CRJ. I’m fairly certain a few minutes before that, ATC instructed the helicopter to maintain visual separation, which is common. They typically ask, “do you have the aircraft in sight” and if you respond in the affirmative they rely on you to maintain safe distance. I should mention that in the recording you can only hear one side of the conversation, so I don’t know whether or not the helicopter said whether or not they had visual contact with the plane they collided with. Either way it doesn’t seem to be the fault of ATC. Of course we’ll know more as additional information becomes available. reply blantonl 13 hours agorootparentHere is the ATC audio between the Tower and PAT-25. Helos that transition DCA's airspace use a separate VHF frequency from traffic landing and departing, but talk to the same tower controller. https://archives.broadcastify.com/44114/20250129/20250129200... * At 5:41 5342 is given instructions for circling to 33. * At 6:45 PAT-25 reports Memorial * At 7:06 tower gives PAT-25 traffic advisory about 5342 and PAT-25 reports traffic in sight and requests visual separation * At 8:12 tower asks PAT-25 if they have the CRJ in sight and tells him to pass behind the CRJ. PAT-25 again reports traffic in sight and again requests visual separation. * At 8:28 crash occurs, exclamations, go arounds issued reply fblp 11 hours agorootparentThis is wild to listen to. A) this is a busy atc channel and it's amazing how much complexity is coordinated over noisy radio. B) within minutes of the accident happening (at 11:48) the ATC controller is calmly asking helicopters in the air if they can assist in search rescue operations asking, if they have search lights and direction them. This is whilst diverting and grounding flights. reply consp 10 hours agorootparent> over noisy radio I've been told the noise on the recordings is always a lot worse than in practice due to the location of the recording antenna not being ideal. I have no idea if this is correct or not. Maybe someone can enlighten this. reply FL410 3 hours agorootparentYep. Radios are much clearer in the air. VHF is mostly line of sight and planes have the benefit of altitude. Approach/center comms can get a bit scratchy at times mostly due to distance, but approach/tower is almost always perfectly clear. reply thowawatp302 9 hours agorootparentprevYes, having tried to listen to ATC with an SDR— the public recordings are made from antenna that placed near the airport, while the official recordings are made from the feeds that the ATC is listening to— and those antenna have their lobes pointed toward the sky. reply jillesvangurp 2 hours agorootparentprevI watch a lot of pilots on Youtube. Most of them use some kind of audio splitter to record sound. You hear what the pilot hears. But minus the plane noise, vibrations, etc (unless that's mixed in via some open microphone). So, it's actually better. So, it really is that bad. Especially when flying low, on the edge of the range of the radios, etc. VHF radio is ancient technology. It's not great even under ideal conditions. If your phone calls sounded that bad, you'd want to upgrade your phone or switch operator. Really not acceptable for consumer grade communication. Not even close. This is how phones sounded half a century ago. \"can you hear me .... are you there ..... can you talk louder ....\". My grand mother never really unlearned 1930s phone etiquette. Phone calls with her were short (cause expensive) and she'd be shouting at you because that's what you did. Be brief, loud, hang up as soon as possible. That's what pilots still do. My grand mother was born during WW I (not II) and she's been dead for nearly 20 years. The aviation world is very conservative with new/better/any technology. They stick with \"what works\". Even if arguably it barely works. Like pretty much the vast majority of radio exchanges between pilots and controllers over VHF radio. Learning how to talk on the radio is the second hardest part of getting an instrument rating. The only thing that's harder is flying a plane with zero visibility ... while suffering extreme information overload because of the constant radio chatter and dealing with confused/stressed/pissed off controllers who have to juggle you and 20 other planes. A lot of radio exchanges are routine exchanges that involve very basic information: call signs, transponder codes, codes for approaches/departures, courses, altimeter settings, altitudes, weather information, etc. And then a lot of double checking the other side heard correctly, repeating back what you heard, etc. Radio communication compensates for the lack of a more robust/sane way of exchanging information. There literally is no way for a controller to send you information in written format. Other than using their private phones. So, it all gets spelled out over low quality VHF radio. There's no good technical reason to not do something vastly more reliable, less intrusive, and less error prone. Some might say safer. Many planes have star link connections these days. The passengers get better connectivity than the pilot. They could be having video calls with the controller with crystal clear audio from anywhere on this planet instead of yelling to them over VHF only when they are in range. They could be sending each other emails, documents, digital maps, and lots of other machine readable information, etc. Not a thing. It's more a challenge of agreeing on what such a vastly better thing would be and then updating each and every plane and tower, airport, controller world wide with equipment that supports that. Add design by committee to the mix and the \"state of the art\" is something that would make any competent engineer born after 1970 blush. reply FL410 10 minutes agorootparentYouTube is not a good representation of what you hear in a headset. Half the time the mic taps aren't impedence matched and sound like shit. Besides that, most \"controlling\" (i.e. instructions that require action) comms have a handshake of sorts the pilot repeats back the instruction for the controller to confirm. They don't just bark out instructions and hope you heard it, they listen for you to read them back, and will keep doing so until successful. So, even in cases when the comms are degraded, you will go back and forth until there has been positive confirmation (readback) you heard the instruction correctly (or they'll just give you a new frequency). reply jcrawfordor 1 hour agorootparentprevHonestly a lot of those recordings probably do sound a lot worse than the radio audio. I rarely see YouTube recordings that are as audible as the radio is in person. Here's what seems to be the reason: The common splitters you can buy to break out your headset connector to a recorder don't account for the signal level, which is very high on the headset connectors as aviation headsets are traditionally pretty high impedance. I've struggled with the headset audio blowing out even a fairly nice recorder (a Zoom) with the gain turned all the way down. Phones and pocket reporters don't even offer a gain adjustment and the recording can end up almost unusable. In a lot of YouTube videos of pilots, even most, it's pretty obvious that it's clipping at the recorder the whole time. Perhaps even worse, a lot of people are using like a GoPro with auto-gain, so you get the worst of both worlds: it ramps up gain until the noise is loud, and then when someone starts talking, it ramps down the gain, but a little too slowly, and it's still clipping even when it hits minimum. It's not very common to have trouble understanding the controller when in the air. AM radio at line of sight (as is the case when you're flying) is pretty robust. Maybe the hardest thing to understand are helicopter pilots because there's often rotor noise on their end. reply throw0101c 1 hour agorootparentprev> A lot of radio exchanges are routine exchanges that involve very basic information: call signs, transponder codes, codes for approaches/departures, courses, altimeter settings, altitudes, weather information, etc. They are also in a fairly standardized format with reserved \"keywords\" for many important aspects of operation (\"hold short\", \"line up and wait\", \"cleared to X\"): * https://skybrary.aero/sites/default/files/bookshelf/115.pdf English is the lingua franca of ATC, but it is recognized it is obviously not everyone's first language. reply lawlessone 37 minutes agorootparentprevI think the crash was at 8:22 or 8:21, you can hear sudden commotion at that time. reply wyldfire 15 hours agorootparentprevIn the video from the webcam there's another plane which is much easier to see. Could they have asked about \"the aircraft\" and the helicopter pilot mistook which one they referred to? \"yes I can see the plane flying much higher\" reply unsnap_biceps 14 hours agorootparentIt's possible but generally there's implied context to ATC. ATC would only instruct you to watch out for possible vector interceptions. flying over an approach path, the context would be that you would look for aircraft on approach, not ones in holding or other patterns above. That said, it's possible they mistook which aircraft to look for, but it's unlikely imho and we will likely never know for sure, as I would presume the pilots are deceased. reply dylan604 14 hours agorootparentI got a lesson in how ATC works with helicopters up close and personal on a helicopter tour. ATC had the helo pilot hold position while an airplane was on final approach. I asked the pilot why we needed to hold as we could clearly see the aircraft and were to my lack of knowledge on the subject \"plenty\" far away. (It actually took me a second to locate the airplane as my sense of scale was not expecting the plane to be so small which is part of why I made the assumption we were plenty far away.) That's when the pilot told me we were not in the way of the approach but if the pilot had to declare a miss (or whatever they call it) and climb to circle around. The helo was near the path for the plane on the abort flight path. Once the plane was on the ground, ATC allowed us to continue. It was my first experience in an aircraft seeing how ATC controlled the airspace directly. Lots of respect to the folks in ATC with a fraction of understanding in just how much they have to deal with other than the obvious take-off/landings. reply mlyle 13 hours agorootparentprevIt's pretty dang easy to misjudge distances and closing rates in a plane or helicopter, especially at night. reply ketanmaheshwari 4 hours agorootparentIs this true for the trained pilots as well? reply paulddraper 3 hours agorootparentIt's next to impossible to know at night. The only thing you have visually is direction / angular velocity. reply pfdietz 56 minutes agorootparentAnd if you're on a collision course the other vehicle will appear motionless, with no change in direction.

One has radars even on recreational boats. That was a military helicopter. At night. It would be hard to believe that it doesn't have nor radar nor IR cameras, and the plane would be lightened up like X-mas tree in both. reply hammock 3 hours agorootparentprevI was a controller at DCA for 8 years and this is a normal operation with Helicopters using the Helicopter routes. The problem I see is the controller asked the Helicopter if they had the CRJ in sight, but he never said WHERE HE WAS OR WHAT HE WAS DOING! The controller should have told the Helicopter that the CRJ was circling to RWY 33. The helicopter said he had him in sight, but he really had the Jet in sight that was landing on RWY 1. Had the controller told him: Traffic ahead and to your left landing runway 33 is a CRJ report him in sight, then the helicopter crew would have LOOKED to their left and saw him. They unfortunately were looking straight ahead at a different plane. The controller is going to take a major blame for this one unfortunately for not being more detailed. Those Helicopters literally fly directly in the path of those RWY 33 arrivals so as a controller you have to be EXACT!!!! Another problem I see is the expectation bias. As controllers in that scenario, we want to hear the Helicopter say \"traffic in sight and we will maintain Visual Separation. These Helicopter Pilots know we need to hear them say that (it's required), so they will say this just because even though they might not really have the aircraft in sight. They are just saying what we want to hear. If they don't, then we stop their forward progress or make them turn out.

Note that just because FAA had a program to hire people with disabilities, does not mean that they made any changes to the medical standards for air traffic controllers there are many jobs at FAA besides air traffic controllers, and there are also plenty of disabilities that would not effect a person's ability to be an air traffic controller. FAA does not allow people with psychiatric disabilities to work in ATC. > “I do want to point out that various articles that appeared prior to my entering office.

And here’s one: the FAA’s diversity push includes focus on hiring people with severe intellectual and psychiatric disabilities,” Trump said. When he was asked to clarify why he thought a diversity push played a role, he said, “It just could have been. We have a high standard. We’ve had a higher, much higher standard than anybody else.” Trump did not cite any evidence. He also placed blame on the Biden administration’s transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, using an expletive to describe Buttigieg’s time in office. “He’s a disaster now. He’s just got a good line of bulls—,” Trump said of Buttigieg. “Well, he runs it, 45,000 people, and he’s run it right into the ground with his diversity.” Trump’s pick for transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, who just started the job, also spoke during the press conference. “When Americans take off in airplanes, they should expect to land at their destination — that didn’t happen yesterday,” Duffy said. “That’s not acceptable, and so we will not accept excuses.

Given the release of this memo[1] offering the buyout of any federal employee who wants to step down, what I think we are looking at is the Musk-Vance-Thiel axis of the MAGA movement is implementing Curtis Yarvin's \"R.A.G.E.\" plan to install a king dictator atop a neo-feudalist executive branch. I wish those words weren't as crazy as they are, but I mean, what else am I supposed to believe when the crazy plan Yarvin is pushing[2] is coming out of the Office of Personnel Management, which is being run by a billionaire who just gave a neo-Nazi salute behind the presidential seal? Under his Moldbug pseudonym, Yarvin gave a talk about \"rebooting\" the American government at the 2012 BIL Conference. He used it to advocate the acronym \"RAGE\", which he defined as \"Retire All Government Employees\". He described what he felt were flaws in the accepted \"World War II mythology\", alluding to the idea that Hitler's invasions were acts of self-defense. He argued these discrepancies were pushed by America's \"ruling communists\", who invented political correctness as an \"extremely elaborate mechanism for persecuting racists and fascists\". \"If Americans want to change their government,\" he said, \"they're going to have to get over their dictator phobia.\"[39] They're trying to do a greenfield government like it's a startup, turning the US government into a company where they are the shareholder lords who own everything and get to decide who the king dictator is, while we are the employee peasants who don't own shit and have a say in nothing. I really wish that weren't my conclusion but those are the literal words of the guy whose plan they are doing. Quote: \"get over their dictator phobia\". So what else am I supposed to conclude?

It's not a huge time-saver (any more, used to be more) but gets you out of a few annoyances like removing shoes, unpacking toiletries, and a few other things.

This makes take offs and landings at DCA challenging since all this restricted air space has to be avoided. DCA also has not space to expand to try to mitigate the risks. Congress has interfered over the years by attaching riders to legislation requiring the number of flights allowed in and out of DCA to be increased over the objection of the Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority (MWAA) who runs both DCA and IAD (Dulles). This despite decades of warnings that the number of flights posses a significant safety risk. Regional airport authorities which run multiple airports such as MWAA generally spread the cost of improvements out across the multiple airports by increasing gate fees at all the airports they control to cover the cost of improvements at any one airport. Congress has forbidden MWAA to do so which has limited their ability to expand and improve IAD to lure airlines to shift domestic flights from DCA to IAD. IAD remains primarily an international airport with domestic flights in and out supporting that role. This is largely due to the higher gate fees at IAD. reply jonstewart 13 hours agorootparentprevDCA is great to fly in and out of (I live in DC proper), as it's close, isn't hard to get to, and has a Metro (our subway) station right in front of the terminal, and the airport is fairly easy to navigate once you're in. Dulles now has a Metro station, but it's still far away from the terminal and it's hard to navigate, with gates very far away from the terminal; other than the Saarinen architecture, everything else about Dulles is awful. BWI is even further from most parts of DC; there's an AmTrak station where you can catch a bus, but pretty much you're driving an hour+ and it's in the middle of exurban hell. DCA is challenging for flights, though, as the approach from upriver over the Potomac requires a sudden bank to the right just before landing and the runway's a bit short (tonight's flight was coming in from the southern approach). The Potomac also has a lot of helicopter traffic, between the military (including POTUS/VPOTUS), US Park Police, DC Police, and civilian flights. DCA's natural advantages have put the screws to Dulles the last 20 years, and Dulles's inability to not suck hasn't helped. As a result, people (including Members of Congress) want more flights out of DCA, so flight traffic has steadily increased. There were two near-misses last spring: https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/faa-investigating-colli.... Tonight's crash seems like a colossal screwup by the helicopter. DCA is too popular for flight traffic to cease, but I wouldn't be surprised by further restricting the flight corridors and helicopter traffic, more funding/staffing for ATC, and maybe a small reduction in flights. reply MattSayar 2 minutes agorootparent> the airport is fairly easy to navigate once you're in.

But agreed, it's a huge pain in the butt to navigate. reply ghaff 2 hours agorootparentFor all the hate EWR (Newark) gets, I much prefer to connect through from there to Europe from Boston than Dulles.

It was discussed post 9/11 about closing National Airport, but congress wouldn't hear it. It was too convenient from DC. (At a time when IAD was way the hell out there, rather than being 1/2 the way out the sprawl.) I won't fly through DCA in the winter, because when I was a kid there was the Air Florida crash.

MLAT [1, 2] works by having multiple ADS-B feeder stations cooperate in real-time and deduce an aircraft's position based on timestamps of when the signal is received. it allows tracking aircraft that only broadcast the more limited Mode S data, instead of the newer and more detailed ADS-B. because it requires multiple cooperating receivers, the start of the track in suburban McLean does not mean it took off from there. it just means that was the point in its flight where it became visible to enough receivers that MLAT was able to pin down a position. you can also see this difference just by looking at the tracks the plane is broadcasting its own position continuously, so its track is nice and smooth. meanwhile the helicopter's flight looks \"jagged\" in a way that does not match what its actual flight path would have been. this is an artifact of the small errors introduced by MLAT. 0: https://globe.adsbexchange.com/?icao=ae313d,a97753 1: https://www.flightaware.com/adsb/mlat/ 2: https://adsbx.discourse.group/t/multilateration-mlat-how-it-... reply alistairSH 2 hours agorootparentAnd just to be clear, the POTUS/super-special VIP transport is run by the USMC out of Quantico[1], a bit further to the south along the Potomac.

Edit: it looks to me like the black hawk was coming from somewhere else with its ADS-B turned off entirely, and then turned on ADS-B once it reached the potomac to approach DCA. The first two datapoints of that flight already show it going 110mph, which its unlikely to be able to accelerate to in just 0.2miles after take off.

I don't know how to look up historical flights to see if this is a commonly-flown route.

The longer runway is aligned with the river’s north/south direction at that point, so planes flying the approach to this runway from the south track along the western shore of the river, leaving the eastern shore clear for other aircraft like helicopters. The vast majority of flights on approach from the south [1] use this longer runway. The secondary runway is set at a diagonal NW/SE. Planes flying an approach from the south follow the river at first, but then loop out over the eastern shore of the river to line up on that runway. To my eye the radar track of the downed flight follows this path. It’s possible since it was a small plane and only small planes can use the diagonal runway—it’s shorter. I mention this because this track takes planes into airspace that is a) usually clear of commercial airplane traffic, and b) directly over military facilities like Naval Research Lab and Joint Base Bolling, which have significant military helicopter travel. Basically, I wonder to what extent the helicopter pilot was surprised to find an airplane descending in that location. [1] When flights are approaching from the north, the main runway requires a pretty sharp right turn seconds before touching down. Approaches to the diagonal runway from the north take planes almost directly over the Pentagon. reply GlenTheMachine 2 hours agoparentI work at NRL, east of DCA and about 500 yards south of the crash. Can confirm that it is not unusual for flights to pass directly overhead of us, however I don’t understand the statement that this was a new flight path. reply dboreham 1 hour agorootparentWhat it means is that the aircraft was on approach into runway 1 (ILS) and then on ATC instruction changed runway to 33 (no ILS).

A friend's daughter just went through the hiring process. She graduated from college with an appropriate degree right as COVID hit. Her FAA application wasn't accepted for four years. This past summer she did the four-week interactive online courses. Applicants must pass this and may not re-enter the program if they do not. After that she did the six-week courses in Oklahoma City. Again, applicants must pass this and may not re-enter the program if they do not. She passed. Only half her class of 20 passed. In the prior class, only 4 of 15 passed. She declined the position when they could not offer a position within reasonable proximity of her family. She, too, may not re-enter the program. On top of all that, the program has strict age requirements because there's a mandatory retirement age (55, I believe). There isn't a large pool of applicants and the percentage of successful ones is not high. Considering the amount of lives on the line, it's understandable the hiring criteria is strict.

These were candidates who had already completed multiple years of schooling and explicitly wanted to be ATCs, so you are talking about a pipeline problem which may or may not exist but is irrelevant to the article I am responding to in the link above my comment. Per that article, candidates who accepted the pay terms and wanted to become ATCs were /rejected/ explicitly because they were not minorities or otherwise able to produce a biographical or demographic reason for acceptance, even when they scored a perfect score on the standardized aptitude assessment. If you have something to refute the article the person above me linked, I'd love to see it because I'm incredibly disappointed in what I read about in that article. reply kbaker 13 hours agorootparentprevAnother problem is the maximum entry age for the ATC school if you are over the age of 31 you can't apply. reply UltraSane 5 hours agorootparentprevNot being allowed to re-enter the program is just insane. reply kemayo 3 hours agorootparentParticularly not for the last reason mentioned declining an offered position because it's not in a place you want to live. reply perihelions 4 hours agorootparentprevIsn't it a reasonable filter? I'd (naively) assume that all things being equal, a person who passes a test on the first attempt, is more likely to have a higher innate ability than one who doesn't. Is this wrong? reply michaelt 3 hours agorootparentThat depends on the test, and the training surrounding it. If I'm hiring for a job where there's a strict requirement to be 6 feet tall and there's nothing candidates can do to get taller then once you've measured under 6 feet there's no point in re-testing you. If I'm hiring for a job where there's a strict requirement that you be able to lift a 90 lbs weight, a lot of people will fail but if they hit the gym, in a month or two they'll be able to pass easily. If I'm hiring for a job where there's a strict requirement that you be able to lift a 90 lbs weight, but before the test every applicant goes through a 6 month strength training program, so we test them at absolute peak strength? Re-testing would be a waste of time, except in a few cases like if someone had a loved one die just before the final test. If I'm hiring for a job with a written test, the test draws a random selection of questions from a question bank, and some questions are much easier than others? There might be a substantial random element to the results. If re-testing people produces substantially different scores, probably that indicates I need to improve the design of my test. reply UltraSane 4 hours agorootparentprevImagine if they only let people take the bar exam once. reply pirate787 3 hours agorootparentprevThe program needs to have high standards and I imagine some of the reasons for failing are related to ability under pressure. reply UltraSane 3 hours agorootparentImagine if they only let people take the bar exam once. reply RandomBacon 54 minutes agorootparentWhile missing a comma can have great impact, it isn't the same as missing traffic, and ATC doesn't have the luxury of rough drafts. reply fernandopj 4 hours agorootparentprevIndeed.

    "originBody": "January 30, 2025 Mistral AI team Today we’re introducing Mistral Small 3, a latency-optimized 24B-parameter model released under the Apache 2.0 license. Mistral Small 3 is competitive with larger models such as Llama 3.3 70B or Qwen 32B, and is an excellent open replacement for opaque proprietary models like GPT4o-mini. Mistral Small 3 is on par with Llama 3.3 70B instruct, while being more than 3x faster on the same hardware. Mistral Small 3 is a pre-trained and instructed model catered to the ‘80%’ of generative AI tasks—those that require robust language and instruction following performance, with very low latency. We designed this new model to saturate performance at a size suitable for local deployment. Particularly, Mistral Small 3 has far fewer layers than competing models, substantially reducing the time per forward pass. At over 81% accuracy on MMLU and 150 tokens/s latency, Mistral Small is currently the most efficient model of its category. We’re releasing both a pretrained and instruction-tuned checkpoint under Apache 2.0. The checkpoints can serve as a powerful base for accelerating progress. Note that Mistral Small 3 is neither trained with RL nor synthetic data, so is earlier in the model production pipeline than models like Deepseek R1 (a great and complementary piece of open-source technology!). It can serve as a great base model for building accrued reasoning capacities. We look forward to seeing how the open-source community adopts and customizes it. Performance Human Evaluations We conducted side by side evaluations with an external third-party vendor, on a set of over 1k proprietary coding and generalist prompts. Evaluators were tasked with selecting their preferred model response from anonymized generations produced by Mistral Small 3 vs another model. We are aware that in some cases the benchmarks on human judgement starkly differ from publicly available benchmarks, but have taken extra caution in verifying a fair evaluation. We are confident that the above benchmarks are valid. Instruct performance Our instruction tuned model performs competitively with open weight models three times its size and with proprietary GPT4o-mini model across Code, Math, General knowledge and Instruction following benchmarks. Performance accuracy on all benchmarks were obtained through the same internal evaluation pipeline as such, numbers may vary slightly from previously reported performance (Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct, Gemma-2-27B-IT). Judge based evals such as Wildbench, Arena hard and MTBench were based on gpt-4o-2024-05-13. Pretraining performance Mistral Small 3, a 24B model, offers the best performance for its size class and rivals with models three times larger such as Llama 3.3 70B. When to use Mistral Small 3 Across our customers and community, we are seeing several distinct use cases emerge for pre-trained models of this size: Fast-response conversational assistance: Mistral Small 3 excels in scenarios where quick, accurate responses are critical. This includes virtual assistants in many scenarios where users expect immediate feedback and near real-time interactions. Low-latency function calling: Mistral Small 3 is able to handle rapid function execution when used as part of automated or agentic workflows. Fine-tuning to create subject matter experts: Mistral Small 3 can be fine-tuned to specialize in specific domains, creating highly accurate subject matter experts. This is particularly useful in fields like legal advice, medical diagnostics, and technical support, where domain-specific knowledge is essential. Local inference: Particularly beneficial for hobbyists and organizations handling sensitive or proprietary information. When quantized, Mistral Small 3 can be run privately on a single RTX 4090 or a Macbook with 32GB RAM. Our customers are evaluating Mistral Small 3 across multiple industries, including: Financial services customers for fraud detection Healthcare providers for customer triaging Robotics, automotive, and manufacturing companies for on-device command and control Horizontal use cases across customers include virtual customer service, and sentiment and feedback analysis. Using Mistral Small 3 on your preferred tech stack Mistral Small 3 is now available on la Plateforme as mistral-small-latest or mistral-small-2501. Explore our docs to learn how to use our models for text generation. We are also excited to collaborate with Hugging Face, Ollama, Kaggle, Together AI, and Fireworks AI to make the model available on their platforms starting today: Hugging Face (base model) Ollama Kaggle Together AI Fireworks AI Coming soon on NVIDIA NIM, Amazon SageMaker, Groq, Databricks and Snowflake The road ahead It’s been exciting days for the open-source community! Mistral Small 3 complements large open-source reasoning models like the recent releases of DeepSeek, and can serve as a strong base model for making reasoning capabilities emerge. Among many other things, expect small and large Mistral models with boosted reasoning capabilities in the coming weeks. Join the journey if you’re keen (we’re hiring), or beat us to it by hacking Mistral Small 3 today and making it better! Open-source models at Mistral We’re renewing our commitment to using Apache 2.0 license for our general purpose models, as we progressively move away from MRL-licensed models. As with Mistral Small 3, model weights will be available to download and deploy locally, and free to modify and use in any capacity. These models will also be made available through a serverless API on la Plateforme, through our on-prem and VPC deployments, customisation and orchestration platform, and through our inference and cloud partners. Enterprises and developers that need specialized capabilities (increased speed and context, domain specific knowledge, task-specific models like code completion) can count on additional commercial models complementing what we contribute to the community.",

[1] https://ollama.com/blog/structured-outputs reply freehorse 1 hour agorootparentStructured output is solved, it is structuring data that's not, because that is an unbounded problem. There is no limit to how messy your data may be, and no limit to the accuracy and efficiency you may require. I have used such models to structure human-generated data into sth a script can then read and process, getting important aspects in this data (eg what time the human reported doing X thing, how long, with whom etc) into like a csv file with columns eg timestamps and whatever variables I am interested in. reply Der_Einzige 43 minutes agorootparentprevFor anyone who thinks it isn't \"solved\", outlines debunked the paper which claims that \"structured generation harms creativity\": https://blog.dottxt.co/say-what-you-mean.html reply the_mitsuhiko 2 hours agorootparentprevI get decent JSON from it quite well with the \"assistant: {\" trick.

Even the very best models tend to be awful at writing jokes. I find the addition of an explanation at the end (never a sign of a good joke) amusing at the meta-level: Why did the badger bring a puffin to the party? Because he heard puffins make great party 'Puffins'! (That's a play on the word \"puffins\" and the phrase \"party people.\") reply dgacmu 43 minutes agorootparentA man walks up to an llm and asks it to tell him a joke about a puffin and a badger. The llm replies with a joke that is barely a joke. The man says \"another.\" The llm gives another unfunny response. \"Another!\" Followed by another similarly lacking response. \"Another!\" With exasperation, the llm replies \"stop badgering me!\" Except it won't, because that's not a high likelihood output. ;) reply airstrike 33 minutes agorootparentNow that your comment is in their training data, it's a high likelihood output! reply emmelaich 1 hour agorootparentprevApparently \"party puffin\" is a company that sells cheap party supplies and decorations. That's all that I can think of. reply asb 4 hours agoprevNote the announcement at the end, that they're moving away from the non-commercial only license used in some of their models in favour of Apache: We’re renewing our commitment to using Apache 2.0 license for our general purpose models, as we progressively move away from MRL-licensed models reply diggan 3 hours agoparentNote that this seems to be about the weights themselves, AFAIK, the actual training code and datasets (for example) aren't actually publicly available. It's a bit like developing a binary application and slapping a FOSS license on the binary while keeping the code proprietary. Not saying that's wrong or anything, but people reading these announcements tend to misunderstand what actually got FOSS licensed when the companies write stuff like this. reply crawshaw 3 hours agorootparentIt's not the same as slapping an open source license on a binary, because unencumbered weights are so much more generally useful than your typical program binary. Weights are fine-tunable and embeddable into a wide range of software. To consider just the power of fine tuning: all of the press DeepSeek have received is over their R1 model, a relatively tiny fine-tune on their open source V3 model. The vast majority of the compute and data pipeline work to build R1 was complete in V3, while that final fine-tuning step to R1 is possible even by an enthusiastic dedicated individual. (And there are many interesting ways of doing it.) The insistence every time open sourced model weights come up that it is not \"truly\" open source is tiring. There is enormous value in open source weights compared to closed APIs. Let us call them open source weights. What you want can be \"open source data\" or somesuch. reply diggan 3 hours agorootparent> The insistence every time open sourced model weights come up that it is not \"truly\" open source is tiring. There is enormous value in open source weights compared to closed APIs. Let us call them open source weights. What you want can be \"open source data\" or somesuch. Agree that there is more value in open source weights than closed APIs, but what I really want to enable, is people learning how to create their own models from scratch. FOSS to me means being able to learn from other projects, how to build the thing yourself, and I wrote about why this is important to me here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42878817 It's not a puritan view but purely practical. Many companies started using FOSS as a marketing label (like what Meta does) and as someone who probably wouldn't be a software developer without being able to learn from FOSS, it fucking sucks that the ML/AI ecosystem is seemingly OK with the term being hijacked. reply crawshaw 3 hours agorootparentIt's not just a marketing label. The term is not being hijacked. Open source models, open source weights, the license chosen, these are all exetrmely valuable concepts. The thing you want, open source model data pipelines, is a different thing. It's existence in no way invalidates the concept of an open source model. Nothing has been hijacked. reply diggan 2 hours agorootparentWe call software FOSS when you can compile (if needed) and build the project yourself, locally, granted you have the resources available. If you have parts that aren't FOSS attached to the project somehow, we call it \"Open Core\" or similar. You wouldn't call a software project FOSS if the only thing under a FOSS license is the binary itself, or some other output, we require at least the code to be FOSS for it to be considered FOSS. Meta/Llama probably started the trend, and they still today say \"The open-source AI models\" and \"Llama is the leading open source model family\" which is grossly misleading. You cannot download the Llama models or weights without signing a license agreement, you're not allowed to use it for anything you want, you need to add a disclaimer on anything that uses Llama (which almost the entire ecosystem breaks as they seemingly missed this when they signed the agreement) and so on, which to me goes directly against what FOSS means. If you cannot reproduce the artifact yourself (again, granted you have the resources), you'd have a really hard time convincing me that that is FOSS. reply fzzzy 1 hour agorootparentprevThe data pipeline to build the weights is the source. The weights are a binary. The term is being hijacked. Just call it open weights, not open source models. The source for the models is not available. The weights are openly available. reply Miraste 3 hours agorootparentprevI'm in favor of FOSS, and I'd like to see more truly open models for ideological reasons, but I don't see a lot of practical value for individuals in open-sourcing the process. You still can't build one yourself. How does it help to know the steps when creating a base model still costs >tens of millions of dollars? It seems to me that open source weights enable everything the FOSS community is practically capable of doing. reply fzzzy 1 hour agorootparentIt wouldn't cost tens of millions of dollars to create a 500m or 1b, and the process of learning is transferrable to larger model weights. reply diggan 2 hours agorootparentprev> How does it help to know the steps when creating a base model still costs >tens of millions of dollars? You can still learn web development even though you don't have 10,000s of users with a large fleet of servers and distributed servers. Thanks to FOSS, it's trivial to go through GitHub and find projects you can learn a bunch from, which is exactly what I did when I started out. With LLMs, you don't have a lot of options. Sure, you can download and fine-tune the weights, but what if you're interested in how the weights are created in the first place? Some companies are doing a good job (like the folks building OLMo) to create those resources, but the others seems to just want to use FOSS because it's good marketing VS OpenAI et al. reply Miraste 2 hours agorootparentLearning resources are nice, but I don't think it's analogous to web dev. I can download nginx and make a useful website right now, no fleet of servers needed. I can even get it hosted for free. Making a useful LLM absolutely, 100% requires huge GPU clusters. There is no entry level, or rather that is the entry level. Because of the scale requirements, FOSS model training frameworks (see GPT-NeoX) are only helpful for large, well-funded labs. It's also difficult to open-source training data, because of copyright. Finetuning weights and building infrastructure around that involves almost all the same things as building a model, except it's actually possible. That's where I've seen most small-scale FOSS development take place over the last few years. reply diggan 43 minutes agorootparent> Finetuning weights and building infrastructure around that involves almost all the same things as building a model Those are two completely different roles? One is mostly around infrastructure and the other is actual ML. There are people who know both, I'll give you that, but I don't think that's the default or even common. Fine-tuning is trivial compared to building your own model and deployments/infrastructure is something else entirely. reply fzzzy 1 hour agorootparentprevThis isn't true. Learning how to train a 124M is just as useful as a 700B, and is possible on a laptop. https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT reply Miraste 47 minutes agorootparentTo clarify my point: Learning how to make a small website is useful, and so is the website. Learning how to finetune a large GPT is useful, and so is the finetuned model. Learning how to train a 124M GPT is useful, but the resulting model is useless. reply eldenring 3 hours agorootparentprevIts not the exact same since you can still finetune it, you can modify the weights, serve it with different engines, etc. This kind of purity test mindset doesn't help anyone. They are shipping the most modifiable form of their model. reply diggan 3 hours agorootparentAgree that it's not exactly the same, all analogies have holes, they're simplifications after all. I guess I'm vary of the messaging because I'm a developer 99% thanks to FOSS, and being able to learn from FOSS projects how to build similar stuff myself. Without FOSS, I probably wouldn't have been able to \"escape\" the working-class my family was \"stuck in\" when I grew up. I want to do whatever I can to make sure others have the same opportunity, and it doesn't matter if the weights themselves are FOSS or not, others cannot learn how to create their own models based on just looking at the weights. You need to be able to learn the model architecture, training and what datasets models are using too, otherwise you won't get very far. > This kind of purity test mindset doesn't help anyone. They are shipping the most modifiable form of their model. It does help others who might be stuck in the same situation I was stuck in, that's not nothing nor is it about \"purity\". They're not shipping the most open model they can, they could have done something like OLMo (https://github.com/allenai/OLMo) which can teach people how to build their own models from scratch. reply fzzzy 1 hour agorootparentKeep fighting the good fight. Saying Llama is open source is straight up lying. It's open weights. reply diggan 54 minutes agorootparentThank you, sometimes it feels weird to argue against people who are generally pro-FOSS but somehow for LLMs are fine with misleading statements. I'm glad at least one other person can see through it, encouraging I'm on the right track :) I'm not sure I'd even call Llama \"open weights\". For me that would mean I can download the weights freely (you cannot download Llama weights without signing a license agreement) and use them freely, you cannot use them freely + you need to add a notice from Meta/Llama on everything that uses Llama saying: > prominently display “Built with Llama” on a related website, user interface, blogpost, about page, or product documentation. https://www.llama.com/llama3_2/license/ Not sure what the correct label is, but it's not open source nor open weights, as far as I can tell. reply zamalek 2 hours agorootparentprevBinaries can do arbitrary things, like report home to a central server. Weights cannot. reply actualwitch 13 minutes agorootparentDepending on format, they might. reply dismalaf 1 hour agorootparentprevBut the weights can be modified. Also the real key is that you can host it yourself, fine tune and make money from it without restriction. That's what it's really about. No one (well, few) cares about recreating it because if they could they'd simply have made one from scratch themselves. reply diggan 51 minutes agorootparentThe same is true for FOSS in general. You're arguing that because no one (almost) builds their own X from scratch, there is therefore no value in having resources available for how to build your own X from scratch. For someone who basically couldn't become a developer with FOSS, this way of thinking is so backwards, especially on Hacker News. I thought we were pro-FOSS in general, but somehow LLMs get a pass because \"they're too complicated and no one would build one from scratch\". reply dismalaf 22 minutes agorootparentThey get a pass because we know what these companies train on (proprietary or private data) but they can't admit it, but they're still giving away multi million dollar models for free. Yes, it'd be nice if it was open and reproducible from start to finish. But let's not let perfect be the enemy of good. reply jacooper 3 hours agorootparentprev> Note that this seems to be about the weights themselves, AFAIK, the actual training code and datasets (for example) aren't actually publicly available. Like every other open source / source available LLM? reply diggan 3 hours agorootparentLike every other Open Source LLM weights, yes. But looking around, there are models that are 100% FOSS, like OLMo (https://github.com/allenai/OLMo). Also, I don't buy the argument that because many in the ecosystem mislabel/mislead people about the licensing, makes it ethically OK for everyone else to do so too. reply amoss 3 hours agorootparentprevhttps://github.com/huggingface/open-r1 reply pridkett 3 hours agorootparentWhile I hope the HuggingFace is successful here, a plan for building a model is a long way from releasing a model. Mistral has models out there they allow you to modify them. Yeah, it’s now like what we’re used to. It probably needs something else, but people are doing some great things with them. reply mcraiha 3 hours agorootparentprevThe binary comparison is a bit bad, since binary can have copyrights. Weights cannot. reply diggan 3 hours agorootparentHas that actually been tried in court, or is that your guess? Because you seem confident, but I don't think this has been tried (yet) reply badsectoracula 3 hours agorootparentIt is a guess (not the same author) but it'd make sense: weights are machine output so if the output of AI is not under copyright because it is machine output (which seems to be something that is pretty much universally agreed upon), then the same would apply for the weights themselves. I'm not sure how someone would argue (in good faith) that training on copyrighted materials does not cause the weights to be a derivative of those materials and the output of their AI is not protected under copyright but the part in the middle, the weights, does fall under copyright. Note that this would be about the weights (i.e. the numbers), not their container. reply wongarsu 2 hours agorootparentPhotographs are machine output too and are famously subject to copyright. The movie Toy Story is also machine output, but I'm confident Disney is enforcing copyright on that. The opinion that AI output isn't copyrightable derives from the opinion of the US Copyright Office, which argues that AI output is more like commissioning an artist than like taking a picture. And since the artist isn't human they can't claim copyright for their work. It's not at all obvious to me that the same argument would hold for the output of AI training. Never mind that the above argument about AI output is just the opinion of some US agency and hasn't been tested in court anywhere in the world. reply michaelt 1 hour agorootparentA photograph is often subject to copyright but there's actually some nuance here; some countries also require a certain level of creative input by a human. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_of_originality Areas of dispute include photographs of famous paintings (is it more in the character of a photocopy?), photographs taken by animals (does the human get copyright if they deliberately created the situation where the animal would take a photograph?), and videos taken automatically (can a CCTV video have an author?) Historically, the results are all over the place. reply conradev 1 hour agorootparentprevThe copyright office is actively figuring it out. From yesterday: https://www.copyright.gov/ai/Copyright-and-Artificial-Intell... reply realusername 2 hours agorootparentprevIf you make them copyrightable, then it means they are a derivative of the training dataset. The only defense these AI companies have is making the weights machine output and thus not copyrightable. But then again that's the theory, the copyright system follows money and it wouldn't be surprising to have contradicting ideas being allowed. reply youssefabdelm 3 hours agoparentprevI guess since they're not ahead anymore they decide to go back to open source. reply mythz 3 hours agoparentprevHappy to seem them back to releasing OSS models, we used a lot of their OSS models early last year before they were eclipsed by better models and never bothered to try any of their large models which IMO weren't great value. reply littlestymaar 1 hour agoparentprevI wonder if that's a consequence of the Deepseek distill release: fine-tuned Qwen and Llama were both released by Deepseek, but not Mistral, and that's was a missed PR opportunity for them for no good reason. reply dismalaf 1 hour agoparentprevThey must have realized they were becoming irrelevant...

It seems at least on par with qwen2.5-coder-32b which was the first local model i would actually use for code. I am also surprised how far we went with small models producing such more polished output in the last year. On another note, I also wish they would follow up with a new version of the 8x7B mixtral. It was one of my favourite models, but at the time it could barely fit in my ram, and now that I have more ram it is rather outdated. But I don't complain, this model anyway is great and it is great that they are one of the companies which actually publish such models targeted to edge computing. reply spwa4 49 minutes agoprevSo the point of this release is 1) code + weights Apache 2.0 licensed (enough to run locally, enough to train, not enough to reproduce this version) 2) Low latency, meaning 11ms per token (so ~90 tokens/sec on 4xH100) 3) Performance, according to mistral, somewhere between Qwen 2.5 32B and Llama 3.3 70B, roughly equal with GPT4o-mini 4) ollama run mistral-small (14G download) 9 tokens/sec on the question \"who is the president of the US?\" (also to enjoy that the answer ISN'T orange idiot) reply timestretch 4 hours agoprevTheir models have been great, but I wish they'd include the number of parameters in the model name, like every other model. reply jbentley1 3 hours agoparentIt's 24B parameters reply msp26 4 hours agoprevFinally, all the recent MoE model releases make me depressed with my mere 24GB VRAM. > Note that Mistral Small 3 is neither trained with RL nor synthetic data Not using synthetic data at all is a little strange reply colonial 3 hours agoparentI recall seeing some complaints recently w.r.t. one of the heavily synthetic models (Phi?) apparently they tend to overfit on STEM \"book knowledge\" while struggling with fuzzier stuff and instruction following.

But they have to focus to stay above water at all, and \"put 128GB or more of DDR5 ram on any previous-gen GPU\" is probably not in their focus. With the state of their software it's not even certain if the community could pick up the slack and turn that into a popular solution. reply hnuser123456 2 hours agorootparentTheir next generation of APUs will have a lot more memory bandwidth and there will probably be lots of AMD APU laptops with 64GB+ of RAM that can use HW acceleration and not be artificially segmented the way Nvidia can do it with VRAM being soldered. reply papichulo2023 2 hours agorootparentprevNvidia upcoming 'minipc' has shared ram up to 128gb for around 3k. No a competitor but pretty good for enthusiast. Hopefully is at least quadchannel. reply aurareturn 2 hours agorootparentprevBecause memory bandwidth is the #1 bottleneck for inference, even more than capacity. What good is 1TB RAM if the bandwidth is fed through a straw? Models would run very slow. You can see this effect on 128GB MacBook Pros. Yes, the model will fit but it’s slow. 500GB/s of memory bandwidth feeds 128GB RAM at a maximum rate of 3.9x per second. This means if your model is 128GB large, your max tokens/s is 3.9. In the real world, it’s more like 2-3 tokens/s after overhead and compute. That’s too slow to use comfortably. You’re probably wondering why not increase memory bandwidth too. Well, you need faster memory chips such as HBM and/or more memory channels. These changes will result in drastically more power consumption and bigger memory controllers. Great, you’ll pay for those. Now you’re bottlenecked by compute. Just add more compute? Ok, you just recreated the Nvidia H100 GPU. That’ll be $20k please. Some people have tried to use AMD Epyc CPUs with 8 channel memory for inference but those are also painfully slow in most cases. reply acoard 16 minutes agorootparent> Because memory bandwidth is the #1 bottleneck for inference, even more than capacity. But there are a ton of models I can't run at all locally due to VRAM limitations. I'd take being able to run those models slower. I know there are some ways to get these running on CPU orders of magnitude slower, but ideally there's some sort of middle ground. reply yodsanklai 3 hours agoprevI'm curious, what people do with these smaller models? reply celestialcheese 2 hours agoparentClassification, tagging tasks. Way easier than older ML techniques and very fast to implement. reply mattgreenrocks 1 hour agorootparentWhen compared against more traditional ML approaches, how do they fare in terms of quality? reply spmurrayzzz 7 minutes agorootparentHistorically the problem with using LLMs for the super simple conventional NLP stuff is that they were hard to control in terms of output. If you wanted a one-word answer for a classification task, you'd often have to deal with it responding in a paragraph. This obviously hurts precision and accuracy quite a bit. There were tricks you could use (like using few-shot examples or GBNF grammars or training low-rank adapters or even re-asking the model) to constrain output a bit, but they weren't perfect. Over the last 12-18 months though, the instruction-following capabilities of the models have improved substantially. This new mistral model in particular is fantastic at doing what you ask. My approach to this personally and professionally is to just benchmark. If I have a classification task, I use a tiny model first, eval both, and see how much improvement I'd get using an LLM. Generally speaking though, the vram costs are so high for the latter that its often not worth it. It really is a case-by-case decision though. Sometimes you want one generic model to do a bunch of tasks rather than train/finetune a dozen small models that you manage in production instead. reply andrewgross 6 minutes agorootparentprevSuper easy to get started, but lacking for larger datasets where you want to understand a bit more about predictions. You generally lose things like prediction probability (though this can be recovered if you chop the head off and just assign output logits to classes instead of tokens), repeatability across experiments, and the ability to tune the model by changing the data. You can still do fine tuning, though itll be more expensive and painfaul than a BERT model. Still, you can go from 0 to ~mostly~ clean data in a few prompts and iterations, vs potentially a few hours with a fine tuning pipeline for BERT. They can actually work well in tandem to bootstrap some training data and then use them together to refine your classification. reply Beretta_Vexee 2 hours agoparentprevRAG mainly, Feature extraction, tagging, Document and e-mail classification.

For these destinations, this IFR makes minimal changes: companies in these destinations generally will be able to obtain the most advanced ICs without a license as long as they certify compliance with specific requirements provided in § 740.27.\" [0] France seems clearly exempt from most of the requirements. The main requirement of 740.27 is to sign a license under U.S. law, under which customers are prohibited from re-exporting ICs to non-Third 1 countries without U.S. approval. What's more, the text refers to AIs, which can have dual uses. The concept of dual civil-military use concerns a large number of technologies, and dates back to the first nuclear technologies. The text gives a few examples of dual-use models, such as models that simulate or facilitate the production of chemical compounds that could be used for chemical weapon creation, non conventional weapon creation or that could simplify or replace already identified dual-use goods or technologies. These uses are already covered by existing legislation on dual-use goods, and US export control. The American legislator is therefore potentially thinking of other uses, such as satellite and radar image analysis, and electronic warfare. As France is a nuclear-armed country with its own version of thoses technologies, it makes little sense to place it under embargo.

What's more, Mistral won't be much help in producing deadly gases or uranium enrichment facilities. It is therefore not subject to this legislation for these two reasons. On the other hand, ICs could be subject to restrictions, and France has no alternative for sourcing large-capacity ICs.

    "originBody": "[DE EN ES IT] DICASTERY FOR THE DOCTRINE OF THE FAITH DICASTERY FOR CULTURE AND EDUCATION ANTIQUA ET NOVA Note on the Relationship Between Artificial Intelligence and Human Intelligence I. Introduction 1. With wisdom both ancient and new (cf. Mt. 13:52), we are called to reflect on the current challenges and opportunities posed by scientific and technological advancements, particularly by the recent development of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The Christian tradition regards the gift of intelligence as an essential aspect of how humans are created “in the image of God” (Gen. 1:27). Starting from an integral vision of the human person and the biblical calling to “till” and “keep” the earth (Gen. 2:15), the Church emphasizes that this gift of intelligence should be expressed through the responsible use of reason and technical abilities in the stewardship of the created world. 2. The Church encourages the advancement of science, technology, the arts, and other forms of human endeavor, viewing them as part of the “collaboration of man and woman with God in perfecting the visible creation.”[1] As Sirach affirms, God “gave skill to human beings, that he might be glorified in his marvelous works” (Sir. 38:6). Human abilities and creativity come from God and, when used rightly, glorify God by reflecting his wisdom and goodness. In light of this, when we ask ourselves what it means to “be human,” we cannot exclude a consideration of our scientific and technological abilities. 3. It is within this perspective that the present Note addresses the anthropological and ethical challenges raised by AI—issues that are particularly significant, as one of the goals of this technology is to imitate the human intelligence that designed it. For instance, unlike many other human creations, AI can be trained on the results of human creativity and then generate new “artifacts” with a level of speed and skill that often rivals or surpasses what humans can do, such as producing text or images indistinguishable from human compositions. This raises critical concerns about AI’s potential role in the growing crisis of truth in the public forum. Moreover, this technology is designed to learn and make certain choices autonomously, adapting to new situations and providing solutions not foreseen by its programmers, and thus, it raises fundamental questions about ethical responsibility and human safety, with broader implications for society as a whole. This new situation has prompted many people to reflect on what it means to be human and the role of humanity in the world. 4. Taking all this into account, there is broad consensus that AI marks a new and significant phase in humanity’s engagement with technology, placing it at the heart of what Pope Francis has described as an “epochal change.”[2] Its impact is felt globally and in a wide range of areas, including interpersonal relationships, education, work, art, healthcare, law, warfare, and international relations. As AI advances rapidly toward even greater achievements, it is critically important to consider its anthropological and ethical implications. This involves not only mitigating risks and preventing harm but also ensuring that its applications are used to promote human progress and the common good. 5. To contribute positively to the discernment regarding AI, and in response to Pope Francis’ call for a renewed “wisdom of heart,”[3] the Church offers its experience through the anthropological and ethical reflections contained in this Note. Committed to its active role in the global dialogue on these issues, the Church invites those entrusted with transmitting the faith—including parents, teachers, pastors, and bishops—to dedicate themselves to this critical subject with care and attention. While this document is intended especially for them, it is also meant to be accessible to a broader audience, particularly those who share the conviction that scientific and technological advances should be directed toward serving the human person and the common good.[4] 6. To this end, the document begins by distinguishing between concepts of intelligence in AI and in human intelligence. It then explores the Christian understanding of human intelligence, providing a framework rooted in the Church’s philosophical and theological tradition. Finally, the document offers guidelines to ensure that the development and use of AI uphold human dignity and promote the integral development of the human person and society. II. What is Artificial Intelligence? 7. The concept of “intelligence” in AI has evolved over time, drawing on a range of ideas from various disciplines. While its origins extend back centuries, a significant milestone occurred in 1956 when the American computer scientist John McCarthy organized a summer workshop at Dartmouth University to explore the problem of “Artificial Intelligence,” which he defined as “that of making a machine behave in ways that would be called intelligent if a human were so behaving.” [5] This workshop launched a research program focused on designing machines capable of performing tasks typically associated with the human intellect and intelligent behavior. 8. Since then, AI research has advanced rapidly, leading to the development of complex systems capable of performing highly sophisticated tasks.[6] These so-called “narrow AI” systems are typically designed to handle specific and limited functions, such as translating languages, predicting the trajectory of a storm, classifying images, answering questions, or generating visual content at the user’s request. While the definition of “intelligence” in AI research varies, most contemporary AI systems—particularly those using machine learning—rely on statistical inference rather than logical deduction. By analyzing large datasets to identify patterns, AI can “predict”[7] outcomes and propose new approaches, mimicking some cognitive processes typical of human problem-solving. Such achievements have been made possible through advances in computing technology (including neural networks, unsupervised machine learning, and evolutionary algorithms) as well as hardware innovations (such as specialized processors). Together, these technologies enable AI systems to respond to various forms of human input, adapt to new situations, and even suggest novel solutions not anticipated by their original programmers.[8] 9. Due to these rapid advancements, many tasks once managed exclusively by humans are now entrusted to AI. These systems can augment or even supersede what humans are able to do in many fields, particularly in specialized areas such as data analysis, image recognition, and medical diagnosis. While each “narrow AI” application is designed for a specific task, many researchers aspire to develop what is known as “Artificial General Intelligence” (AGI)—a single system capable of operating across all cognitive domains and performing any task within the scope of human intelligence. Some even argue that AGI could one day achieve the state of “superintelligence,” surpassing human intellectual capacities, or contribute to “super-longevity” through advances in biotechnology. Others, however, fear that these possibilities, even if hypothetical, could one day eclipse the human person, while still others welcome this potential transformation.[9] 10. Underlying this and many other perspectives on the subject is the implicit assumption that the term “intelligence” can be used in the same way to refer to both human intelligence and AI. Yet, this does not capture the full scope of the concept. In the case of humans, intelligence is a faculty that pertains to the person in his or her entirety, whereas in the context of AI, “intelligence” is understood functionally, often with the presumption that the activities characteristic of the human mind can be broken down into digitized steps that machines can replicate.[10] 11. This functional perspective is exemplified by the “Turing Test,” which considers a machine “intelligent” if a person cannot distinguish its behavior from that of a human.[11] However, in this context, the term “behavior” refers only to the performance of specific intellectual tasks; it does not account for the full breadth of human experience, which includes abstraction, emotions, creativity, and the aesthetic, moral, and religious sensibilities. Nor does it encompass the full range of expressions characteristic of the human mind. Instead, in the case of AI, the “intelligence” of a system is evaluated methodologically, but also reductively, based on its ability to produce appropriate responses—in this case, those associated with the human intellect—regardless of how those responses are generated. 12. AI’s advanced features give it sophisticated abilities to perform tasks, but not the ability to think.[12] This distinction is crucially important, as the way “intelligence” is defined inevitably shapes how we understand the relationship between human thought and this technology.[13] To appreciate this, one must recall the richness of the philosophical tradition and Christian theology, which offer a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of intelligence—an understanding that is central to the Church’s teaching on the nature, dignity, and vocation of the human person.[14] III. Intelligence in the Philosophical and Theological Tradition Rationality 13. From the dawn of human self-reflection, the mind has played a central role in understanding what it means to be “human.” Aristotle observed that “all people by nature desire to know.”[15] This knowledge, with its capacity for abstraction that grasps the nature and meaning of things, sets humans apart from the animal world.[16] As philosophers, theologians, and psychologists have examined the exact nature of this intellectual faculty, they have also explored how humans understand the world and their unique place within it. Through this exploration, the Christian tradition has come to understand the human person as a being consisting of both body and soul—deeply connected to this world and yet transcending it.[17] 14. In the classical tradition, the concept of intelligence is often understood through the complementary concepts of “reason” (ratio) and “intellect” (intellectus). These are not separate faculties but, as Saint Thomas Aquinas explains, they are two modes in which the same intelligence operates: “The term intellect is inferred from the inward grasp of the truth, while the name reason is taken from the inquisitive and discursive process.”[18] This concise description highlights the two fundamental and complementary dimensions of human intelligence. Intellectus refers to the intuitive grasp of the truth—that is, apprehending it with the “eyes” of the mind—which precedes and grounds argumentation itself. Ratio pertains to reasoning proper: the discursive, analytical process that leads to judgment. Together, intellect and reason form the two facets of the act of intelligere, “the proper operation of the human being as such.”[19] 15. Describing the human person as a “rational” being does not reduce the person to a specific mode of thought; rather, it recognizes that the ability for intellectual understanding shapes and permeates all aspects of human activity. [20] Whether exercised well or poorly, this capacity is an intrinsic aspect of human nature. In this sense, the “term ‘rational’ encompasses all the capacities of the human person,” including those related to “knowing and understanding, as well as those of willing, loving, choosing, and desiring; it also includes all corporeal functions closely related to these abilities.” [21] This comprehensive perspective underscores how, in the human person, created in the “image of God,” reason is integrated in a way that elevates, shapes, and transforms both the person’s will and actions. [22] Embodiment 16. Christian thought considers the intellectual faculties of the human person within the framework of an integral anthropology that views the human being as essentially embodied. In the human person, spirit and matter “are not two natures united, but rather their union forms a single nature.”[23] In other words, the soul is not merely the immaterial “part” of the person contained within the body, nor is the body an outer shell housing an intangible “core.” Rather, the entire human person is simultaneously both material and spiritual. This understanding reflects the teaching of Sacred Scripture, which views the human person as a being who lives out relationships with God and others (and thus, an authentically spiritual dimension) within and through this embodied existence.[24] The profound meaning of this condition is further illuminated by the mystery of the Incarnation, through which God himself took on our flesh and “raised it up to a sublime dignity.”[25] 17. Although deeply rooted in bodily existence, the human person transcends the material world through the soul, which is “almost on the horizon of eternity and time.”[26] The intellect's capacity for transcendence and the self-possessed freedom of the will belong to the soul, by which the human person “shares in the light of the divine mind.”[27] Nevertheless, the human spirit does not exercise its normal mode of knowledge without the body.[28] In this way, the intellectual faculties of the human person are an integral part of an anthropology that recognizes that the human person is a “unity of body and soul.”[29] Further aspects of this understanding will be developed in what follows. Relationality 18. Human beings are “ordered by their very nature to interpersonal communion,”[30] possessing the capacity to know one another, to give themselves in love, and to enter into communion with others. Accordingly, human intelligence is not an isolated faculty but is exercised in relationships, finding its fullest expression in dialogue, collaboration, and solidarity. We learn with others, and we learn through others. 19. The relational orientation of the human person is ultimately grounded in the eternal self-giving of the Triune God, whose love is revealed in creation and redemption.[31] The human person is “called to share, by knowledge and love, in God’s own life.”[32] 20. This vocation to communion with God is necessarily tied to the call to communion with others. Love of God cannot be separated from love for one’s neighbor (cf. 1 Jn. 4:20; Mt. 22:37-39). By the grace of sharing God’s life, Christians are also called to imitate Christ’s outpouring gift (cf. 2 Cor. 9:8-11; Eph. 5:1-2) by following his command to “love one another, as I have loved you” (Jn. 13:34).[33] Love and service, echoing the divine life of self-giving, transcend self-interest to respond more fully to the human vocation (cf. 1 Jn. 2:9). Even more sublime than knowing many things is the commitment to care for one another, for if “I understand all mysteries and all knowledge [...] but do not have love, I am nothing” (1 Cor. 13:2). Relationship with the Truth 21. Human intelligence is ultimately “God’s gift fashioned for the assimilation of truth.”[34]In the dual sense of intellectus-ratio, it enables the person to explore realities that surpass mere sensory experience or utility, since “the desire for truth is part of human nature itself. It is an innate property of human reason to ask why things are as they are.”[35] Moving beyond the limits of empirical data, human intelligence can “with genuine certitude attain to reality itself as knowable.”[36] While reality remains only partially known, the desire for truth “spurs reason always to go further; indeed, it is as if reason were overwhelmed to see that it can always go beyond what it has already achieved.”[37] Although Truth in itself transcends the boundaries of human intelligence, it irresistibly attracts it.[38] Drawn by this attraction, the human person is led to seek “truths of a higher order.”[39] 22. This innate drive toward the pursuit of truth is especially evident in the distinctly human capacities for semantic understanding and creativity,[40] through which this search unfolds in a “manner that is appropriate to the social nature and dignity of the human person.”[41] Likewise, a steadfast orientation to the truth is essential for charity to be both authentic and universal.[42] 23. The search for truth finds its highest expression in openness to realities that transcend the physical and created world. In God, all truths attain their ultimate and original meaning.[43] Entrusting oneself to God is a “fundamental decision that engages the whole person.”[44] In this way, the human person becomes fully what he or she is called to be: “the intellect and the will display their spiritual nature,” enabling the person “to act in a way that realizes personal freedom to the full.”[45] Stewardship of the World 24. The Christian faith understands creation as the free act of the Triune God, who, as Saint Bonaventure of Bagnoregio explains, creates “not to increase his glory, but to show it forth and to communicate it.”[46] Since God creates according to his Wisdom (cf. Wis. 9:9; Jer. 10:12), creation is imbued with an intrinsic order that reflects God’s plan (cf. Gen. 1; Dan. 2:21-22; Is. 45:18; Ps. 74:12-17; 104),[47] within which God has called human beings to assume a unique role: to cultivate and care for the world.[48] 25. Shaped by the Divine Craftsman, humans live out their identity as beings made in imago Dei by “keeping” and “tilling” (cf. Gen. 2:15) creation—using their intelligence and skills to care for and develop creation in accord with God’s plan.[49] In this, human intelligence reflects the Divine Intelligence that created all things (cf. Gen. 1-2; Jn. 1),[50] continuously sustains them, and guides them to their ultimate purpose in him.[51] Moreover, human beings are called to develop their abilities in science and technology, for through them, God is glorified (cf. Sir. 38:6). Thus, in a proper relationship with creation, humans, on the one hand, use their intelligence and skill to cooperate with God in guiding creation toward the purpose to which he has called it.[52] On the other hand, creation itself, as Saint Bonaventure observes, helps the human mind to “ascend gradually to the supreme Principle, who is God.”[53] An Integral Understanding of Human Intelligence 26. In this context, human intelligence becomes more clearly understood as a faculty that forms an integral part of how the whole person engages with reality. Authentic engagement requires embracing the full scope of one’s being: spiritual, cognitive, embodied, and relational. 27. This engagement with reality unfolds in various ways, as each person, in his or her multifaceted individuality[54], seeks to understand the world, relate to others, solve problems, express creativity, and pursue integral well-being through the harmonious interplay of the various dimensions of the person’s intelligence.[55] This involves logical and linguistic abilities but can also encompass other modes of interacting with reality. Consider the work of an artisan, who “must know how to discern, in inert matter, a particular form that others cannot recognize”[56] and bring it forth through insight and practical skill. Indigenous peoples who live close to the earth often possess a profound sense of nature and its cycles.[57] Similarly, a friend who knows the right word to say or a person adept at managing human relationships exemplifies an intelligence that is “the fruit of self-examination, dialogue and generous encounter between persons.”[58] As Pope Francis observes, “in this age of artificial intelligence, we cannot forget that poetry and love are necessary to save our humanity.”[59] 28. At the heart of the Christian understanding of intelligence is the integration of truth into the moral and spiritual life of the person, guiding his or her actions in light of God’s goodness and truth. According to God’s plan, intelligence, in its fullest sense, also includes the ability to savor what is true, good, and beautiful. As the twentieth-century French poet Paul Claudel expressed, “intelligence is nothing without delight.”[60] Similarly, Dante, upon reaching the highest heaven in Paradiso, testifies that the culmination of this intellectual delight is found in the “light intellectual full of love, love of true good filled with joy, joy which transcends every sweetness.”[61] 29. A proper understanding of human intelligence, therefore, cannot be reduced to the mere acquisition of facts or the ability to perform specific tasks. Instead, it involves the person’s openness to the ultimate questions of life and reflects an orientation toward the True and the Good.[62] As an expression of the divine image within the person, human intelligence has the ability to access the totality of being, contemplating existence in its fullness, which goes beyond what is measurable, and grasping the meaning of what has been understood. For believers, this capacity includes, in a particular way, the ability to grow in the knowledge of the mysteries of God by using reason to engage ever more profoundly with revealed truths (intellectus fidei).[63] True intelligence is shaped by divine love, which “is poured forth in our hearts by the Holy Spirit” (Rom. 5:5). From this, it follows that human intelligence possesses an essential contemplative dimension, an unselfish openness to the True, the Good, and the Beautiful, beyond any utilitarian purpose. The Limits of AI 30. In light of the foregoing discussion, the differences between human intelligence and current AI systems become evident. While AI is an extraordinary technological achievement capable of imitating certain outputs associated with human intelligence, it operates by performing tasks, achieving goals, or making decisions based on quantitative data and computational logic. For example, with its analytical power, AI excels at integrating data from a variety of fields, modeling complex systems, and fostering interdisciplinary connections. In this way, it can help experts collaborate in solving complex problems that “cannot be dealt with from a single perspective or from a single set of interests.”[64] 31. However, even as AI processes and simulates certain expressions of intelligence, it remains fundamentally confined to a logical-mathematical framework, which imposes inherent limitations. Human intelligence, in contrast, develops organically throughout the person’s physical and psychological growth, shaped by a myriad of lived experiences in the flesh. Although advanced AI systems can “learn” through processes such as machine learning, this sort of training is fundamentally different from the developmental growth of human intelligence, which is shaped by embodied experiences, including sensory input, emotional responses, social interactions, and the unique context of each moment. These elements shape and form individuals within their personal history.In contrast, AI, lacking a physical body, relies on computational reasoning and learning based on vast datasets that include recorded human experiences and knowledge. 32. Consequently, although AI can simulate aspects of human reasoning and perform specific tasks with incredible speed and efficiency, its computational abilities represent only a fraction of the broader capacities of the human mind. For instance, AI cannot currently replicate moral discernment or the ability to establish authentic relationships. Moreover, human intelligence is situated within a personally lived history of intellectual and moral formation that fundamentally shapes the individual’s perspective, encompassing the physical, emotional, social, moral, and spiritual dimensions of life. Since AI cannot offer this fullness of understanding, approaches that rely solely on this technology or treat it as the primary means of interpreting the world can lead to “a loss of appreciation for the whole, for the relationships between things, and for the broader horizon.”[65] 33. Human intelligence is not primarily about completing functional tasks but about understanding and actively engaging with reality in all its dimensions; it is also capable of surprising insights. Since AI lacks the richness of corporeality, relationality, and the openness of the human heart to truth and goodness, its capacities—though seemingly limitless—are incomparable with the human ability to grasp reality. So much can be learned from an illness, an embrace of reconciliation, and even a simple sunset; indeed, many experiences we have as humans open new horizons and offer the possibility of attaining new wisdom. No device, working solely with data, can measure up to these and countless other experiences present in our lives. 34. Drawing an overly close equivalence between human intelligence and AI risks succumbing to a functionalist perspective, where people are valued based on the work they can perform. However, a person’s worth does not depend on possessing specific skills, cognitive and technological achievements, or individual success, but on the person’s inherent dignity, grounded in being created in the image of God.[66] This dignity remains intact in all circumstances, including for those unable to exercise their abilities, whether it be an unborn child, an unconscious person, or an older person who is suffering. [67] It also underpins the tradition of human rights (and, in particular, what are now called “neuro-rights”), which represent “an important point of convergence in the search for common ground”[68] and can, thus, serve as a fundamental ethical guide in discussions on the responsible development and use of AI. 35. Considering all these points, as Pope Francis observes, “the very use of the word ‘intelligence’” in connection with AI “can prove misleading”[69] and risks overlooking what is most precious in the human person. In light of this, AI should not be seen as an artificial form of human intelligence but as a product of it.[70] IV. The Role of Ethics in Guiding the Development and Use of AI 36. Given these considerations, one can ask how AI can be understood within God’s plan. To answer this, it is important to recall that techno-scientific activity is not neutral in character but is a human endeavor that engages the humanistic and cultural dimensions of human creativity.[71] 37. Seen as a fruit of the potential inscribed within human intelligence,[72] scientific inquiry and the development of technical skills are part of the “collaboration of man and woman with God in perfecting the visible creation.”[73] At the same time, all scientific and technological achievements are, ultimately, gifts from God.[74] Therefore, human beings must always use their abilities in view of the higher purpose for which God has granted them.[75] 38. We can gratefully acknowledge how technology has “remedied countless evils which used to harm and limit human beings,”[76] a fact for which we should rejoice. Nevertheless, not all technological advancements in themselves represent genuine human progress.[77] The Church is particularly opposed to those applications that threaten the sanctity of life or the dignity of the human person.[78] Like any human endeavor, technological development must be directed to serve the human person and contribute to the pursuit of “greater justice, more extensive fraternity, and a more humane order of social relations,” which are “more valuable than advances in the technical field.”[79] Concerns about the ethical implications of technological development are shared not only within the Church but also among many scientists, technologists, and professional associations, who increasingly call for ethical reflection to guide this development in a responsible way. 39. To address these challenges, it is essential to emphasize the importance of moral responsibility grounded in the dignity and vocation of the human person. This guiding principle also applies to questions concerning AI. In this context, the ethical dimension takes on primary importance because it is people who design systems and determine the purposes for which they are used.[80] Between a machine and a human being, only the latter is truly a moral agent—a subject of moral responsibility who exercises freedom in his or her decisions and accepts their consequences.[81] It is not the machine but the human who is in relationship with truth and goodness, guided by a moral conscience that calls the person “to love and to do what is good and to avoid evil,”[82] bearing witness to “the authority of truth in reference to the supreme Good to which the human person is drawn.”[83] Likewise, between a machine and a human, only the human can be sufficiently self-aware to the point of listening and following the voice of conscience, discerning with prudence, and seeking the good that is possible in every situation.[84] In fact, all of this also belongs to the person’s exercise of intelligence. 40. Like any product of human creativity, AI can be directed toward positive or negative ends.[85] When used in ways that respect human dignity and promote the well-being of individuals and communities, it can contribute positively to the human vocation. Yet, as in all areas where humans are called to make decisions, the shadow of evil also looms here. Where human freedom allows for the possibility of choosing what is wrong, the moral evaluation of this technology will need to take into account how it is directed and used. 41. At the same time, it is not only the ends that are ethically significant but also the means employed to achieve them. Additionally, the overall vision and understanding of the human person embedded within these systems are important to consider as well. Technological products reflect the worldview of their developers, owners, users, and regulators,[86] and have the power to “shape the world and engage consciences on the level of values.”[87] On a societal level, some technological developments could also reinforce relationships and power dynamics that are inconsistent with a proper understanding of the human person and society. 42. Therefore, the ends and the means used in a given application of AI, as well as the overall vision it incorporates, must all be evaluated to ensure they respect human dignity and promote the common good.[88] As Pope Francis has stated, “the intrinsic dignity of every man and every woman” must be “the key criterion in evaluating emerging technologies; these will prove ethically sound to the extent that they help respect that dignity and increase its expression at every level of human life,”[89] including in the social and economic spheres. In this sense, human intelligence plays a crucial role not only in designing and producing technology but also in directing its use in line with the authentic good of the human person.[90] The responsibility for managing this wisely pertains to every level of society, guided by the principle of subsidiarity and other principles of Catholic Social Teaching. Helping Human Freedom and Decision-Making 43. The commitment to ensuring that AI always supports and promotes the supreme value of the dignity of every human being and the fullness of the human vocation serves as a criterion of discernment for developers, owners, operators, and regulators of AI, as well as to its users. It remains valid for every application of the technology at every level of its use. 44. An evaluation of the implications of this guiding principle could begin by considering the importance of moral responsibility. Since full moral causality belongs only to personal agents, not artificial ones, it is crucial to be able to identify and define who bears responsibility for the processes involved in AI, particularly those capable of learning, correction, and reprogramming. While bottom-up approaches and very deep neural networks enable AI to solve complex problems, they make it difficult to understand the processes that lead to the solutions they adopted. This complicates accountability since if an AI application produces undesired outcomes, determining who is responsible becomes difficult. To address this problem, attention needs to be given to the nature of accountability processes in complex, highly automated settings, where results may only become evident in the medium to long term. For this, it is important that ultimate responsibility for decisions made using AI rests with the human decision-makers and that there is accountability for the use of AI at each stage of the decision-making process.[91] 45. In addition to determining who is responsible, it is essential to identify the objectives given to AI systems. Although these systems may use unsupervised autonomous learning mechanisms and sometimes follow paths that humans cannot reconstruct, they ultimately pursue goals that humans have assigned to them and are governed by processes established by their designers and programmers. Yet, this presents a challenge because, as AI models become increasingly capable of independent learning, the ability to maintain control over them to ensure that such applications serve human purposes may effectively diminish. This raises the critical question of how to ensure that AI systems are ordered for the good of people and not against them. 46. While responsibility for the ethical use of AI systems starts with those who develop, produce, manage, and oversee such systems, it is also shared by those who use them. As Pope Francis noted, the machine “makes a technical choice among several possibilities based either on well-defined criteria or on statistical inferences. Human beings, however, not only choose, but in their hearts are capable of deciding.”[92] Those who use AI to accomplish a task and follow its results create a context in which they are ultimately responsible for the power they have delegated. Therefore, insofar as AI can assist humans in making decisions, the algorithms that govern it should be trustworthy, secure, robust enough to handle inconsistencies, and transparent in their operation to mitigate biases and unintended side effects.[93] Regulatory frameworks should ensure that all legal entities remain accountable for the use of AI and all its consequences, with appropriate safeguards for transparency, privacy, and accountability.[94] Moreover, those using AI should be careful not to become overly dependent on it for their decision-making, a trend that increases contemporary society’s already high reliance on technology. 47. The Church’s moral and social teaching provides resources to help ensure that AI is used in a way that preserves human agency. Considerations about justice, for example, should also address issues such as fostering just social dynamics, upholding international security, and promoting peace. By exercising prudence, individuals and communities can discern ways to use AI to benefit humanity while avoiding applications that could degrade human dignity or harm the environment. In this context, the concept of responsibility should be understood not only in its most limited sense but as a “responsibility for the care for others, which is more than simply accounting for results achieved.”[95] 48. Therefore, AI, like any technology, can be part of a conscious and responsible answer to humanity’s vocation to the good. However, as previously discussed, AI must be directed by human intelligence to align with this vocation, ensuring it respects the dignity of the human person. Recognizing this “exalted dignity,” the Second Vatican Council affirmed that “the social order and its development must invariably work to the benefit of the human person.”[96] In light of this, the use of AI, as Pope Francis said, must be “accompanied by an ethic inspired by a vision of the common good, an ethic of freedom, responsibility, and fraternity, capable of fostering the full development of people in relation to others and to the whole of creation.”[97] V. Specific Questions 49. Within this general perspective, some observations follow below to illustrate how the preceding arguments can help provide an ethical orientation in practical situations, in line with the “wisdom of heart” that Pope Francis has proposed.[98] While not exhaustive, this discussion is offered in service of the dialogue that considers how AI can be used to uphold the dignity of the human person and promote the common good.[99] AI and Society 50. As Pope Francis observed, “the inherent dignity of each human being and the fraternity that binds us together as members of the one human family must undergird the development of new technologies and serve as indisputable criteria for evaluating them before they are employed.”[100] 51. Viewed through this lens, AI could “introduce important innovations in agriculture, education and culture, an improved level of life for entire nations and peoples, and the growth of human fraternity and social friendship,” and thus be “used to promote integral human development.”[101] AI could also help organizations identify those in need and counter discrimination and marginalization. These and other similar applications of this technology could contribute to human development and the common good.[102] 52. However, while AI holds many possibilities for promoting the good, it can also hinder or even counter human development and the common good. Pope Francis has noted that “evidence to date suggests that digital technologies have increased inequality in our world. Not just differences in material wealth, which are also significant, but also differences in access to political and social influence.”[103] In this sense, AI could be used to perpetuate marginalization and discrimination, create new forms of poverty, widen the “digital divide,” and worsen existing social inequalities.[104] 53. Moreover, the concentration of the power over mainstream AI applications in the hands of a few powerful companies raises significant ethical concerns. Exacerbating this problem is the inherent nature of AI systems, where no single individual can exercise complete oversight over the vast and complex datasets used for computation. This lack of well-defined accountability creates the risk that AI could be manipulated for personal or corporate gain or to direct public opinion for the benefit of a specific industry. Such entities, motivated by their own interests, possess the capacity to exercise “forms of control as subtle as they are invasive, creating mechanisms for the manipulation of consciences and of the democratic process.”[105] 54. Furthermore, there is the risk of AI being used to promote what Pope Francis has called the “technocratic paradigm,” which perceives all the world’s problems as solvable through technological means alone.[106] In this paradigm, human dignity and fraternity are often set aside in the name of efficiency, “as if reality, goodness, and truth automatically flow from technological and economic power as such.”[107] Yet, human dignity and the common good must never be violated for the sake of efficiency,[108] for “technological developments that do not lead to an improvement in the quality of life of all humanity, but on the contrary, aggravate inequalities and conflicts, can never count as true progress.”[109] Instead, AI should be put “at the service of another type of progress, one which is healthier, more human, more social, more integral.”[110] 55. Achieving this objective requires a deeper reflection on the relationship between autonomy and responsibility. Greater autonomy heightens each person’s responsibility across various aspects of communal life. For Christians, the foundation of this responsibility lies in the recognition that all human capacities, including the person’s autonomy, come from God and are meant to be used in the service of others.[111] Therefore, rather than merely pursuing economic or technological objectives, AI should serve “the common good of the entire human family,” which is “the sum total of social conditions that allow people, either as groups or as individuals, to reach their fulfillment more fully and more easily.”[112] AI and Human Relationships 56. The Second Vatican Council observed that “by his innermost nature man is a social being; and if he does not enter into relations with others, he can neither live nor develop his gifts.”[113] This conviction underscores that living in society is intrinsic to the nature and vocation of the human person.[114] As social beings, we seek relationships that involve mutual exchange and the pursuit of truth, in the course of which, people “share with each other the truth they have discovered, or think they have discovered, in such a way that they help one another in the search for truth.”[115] 57. Such a quest, along with other aspects of human communication, presupposes encounters and mutual exchange between individuals shaped by their unique histories, thoughts, convictions, and relationships. Nor can we forget that human intelligence is a diverse, multifaceted, and complex reality: individual and social, rational and affective, conceptual and symbolic. Pope Francis underscores this dynamic, noting that “together, we can seek the truth in dialogue, in relaxed conversation or in passionate debate. To do so calls for perseverance; it entails moments of silence and suffering, yet it can patiently embrace the broader experience of individuals and peoples. […] The process of building fraternity, be it local or universal, can only be undertaken by spirits that are free and open to authentic encounters.”[116] 58. It is in this context that one can consider the challenges AI poses to human relationships. Like other technological tools, AI has the potential to foster connections within the human family. However, it could also hinder a true encounter with reality and, ultimately, lead people to “a deep and melancholic dissatisfaction with interpersonal relations, or a harmful sense of isolation.”[117] Authentic human relationships require the richness of being with others in their pain, their pleas, and their joy.[118] Since human intelligence is expressed and enriched also in interpersonal and embodied ways, authentic and spontaneous encounters with others are indispensable for engaging with reality in its fullness. 59. Because “true wisdom demands an encounter with reality,”[119] the rise of AI introduces another challenge. Since AI can effectively imitate the products of human intelligence, the ability to know when one is interacting with a human or a machine can no longer be taken for granted. Generative AI can produce text, speech, images, and other advanced outputs that are usually associated with human beings. Yet, it must be understood for what it is: a tool, not a person.[120] This distinction is often obscured by the language used by practitioners, which tends to anthropomorphize AI and thus blurs the line between human and machine. 60. Anthropomorphizing AI also poses specific challenges for the development of children, potentially encouraging them to develop patterns of interaction that treat human relationships in a transactional manner, as one would relate to a chatbot. Such habits could lead young people to see teachers as mere dispensers of information rather than as mentors who guide and nurture their intellectual and moral growth. Genuine relationships, rooted in empathy and a steadfast commitment to the good of the other, are essential and irreplaceable in fostering the full development of the human person. 61. In this context, it is important to clarify that, despite the use of anthropomorphic language, no AI application can genuinely experience empathy. Emotions cannot be reduced to facial expressions or phrases generated in response to prompts; they reflect the way a person, as a whole, relates to the world and to his or her own life, with the body playing a central role. True empathy requires the ability to listen, recognize another’s irreducible uniqueness, welcome their otherness, and grasp the meaning behind even their silences.[121] Unlike the realm of analytical judgment in which AI excels, true empathy belongs to the relational sphere. It involves intuiting and apprehending the lived experiences of another while maintaining the distinction between self and other.[122] While AI can simulate empathetic responses, it cannot replicate the eminently personal and relational nature of authentic empathy.[123] 62. In light of the above, it is clear why misrepresenting AI as a person should always be avoided; doing so for fraudulent purposes is a grave ethical violation that could erode social trust. Similarly, using AI to deceive in other contexts—such as in education or in human relationships, including the sphere of sexuality—is also to be considered immoral and requires careful oversight to prevent harm, maintain transparency, and ensure the dignity of all people.[124] 63. In an increasingly isolated world, some people have turned to AI in search of deep human relationships, simple companionship, or even emotional bonds. However, while human beings are meant to experience authentic relationships, AI can only simulate them. Nevertheless, such relationships with others are an integral part of how a person grows to become who he or she is meant to be. If AI is used to help people foster genuine connections between people, it can contribute positively to the full realization of the person. Conversely, if we replace relationships with God and with others with interactions with technology, we risk replacing authentic relationality with a lifeless image (cf. Ps. 106:20; Rom. 1:22-23). Instead of retreating into artificial worlds, we are called to engage in a committed and intentional way with reality, especially by identifying with the poor and suffering, consoling those in sorrow, and forging bonds of communion with all. AI, the Economy, and Labor 64. Due to its interdisciplinary nature, AI is being increasingly integrated into economic and financial systems. Significant investments are currently being made not only in the technology sector but also in energy, finance, and media, particularly in the areas of marketing and sales, logistics, technological innovation, compliance, and risk management. At the same time, AI’s applications in these areas have also highlighted its ambivalent nature, as a source of tremendous opportunities but also profound risks. A first real critical point in this area concerns the possibility that—due to the concentration of AI applications in the hands of a few corporations—only those large companies would benefit from the value created by AI rather than the businesses that use it. 65. Other broader aspects of AI’s impact on the economic-financial sphere must also be carefully examined, particularly concerning the interaction between concrete reality and the digital world. One important consideration in this regard involves the coexistence of diverse and alternative forms of economic and financial institutions within a given context. This factor should be encouraged, as it can bring benefits in how it supports the real economy by fostering its development and stability, especially during times of crisis. Nevertheless, it should be stressed that digital realities, not restricted by any spatial bonds, tend to be more homogeneous and impersonal than communities rooted in a particular place and a specific history, with a common journey characterized by shared values and hopes, but also by inevitable disagreements and divergences. This diversity is an undeniable asset to a community’s economic life. Turning over the economy and finance entirely to digital technology would reduce this variety and richness. As a result, many solutions to economic problems that can be reached through natural dialogue between the involved parties may no longer be attainable in a world dominated by procedures and only the appearance of nearness. 66. Another area where AI is already having a profound impact is the world of work. As in many other fields, AI is driving fundamental transformations across many professions, with a range of effects. On the one hand, it has the potential to enhance expertise and productivity, create new jobs, enable workers to focus on more innovative tasks, and open new horizons for creativity and innovation. 67. However, while AI promises to boost productivity by taking over mundane tasks, it frequently forces workers to adapt to the speed and demands of machines rather than machines being designed to support those who work. As a result, contrary to the advertised benefits of AI, current approaches to the technology can paradoxically deskill workers, subject them to automated surveillance, and relegate them to rigid and repetitive tasks. The need to keep up with the pace of technology can erode workers’ sense of agency and stifle the innovative abilities they are expected to bring to their work.[125] 68. AI is currently eliminating the need for some jobs that were once performed by humans. If AI is used to replace human workers rather than complement them, there is a “substantial risk of disproportionate benefit for the few at the price of the impoverishment of many.”[126] Additionally, as AI becomes more powerful, there is an associated risk that human labor may lose its value in the economic realm. This is the logical consequence of the technocratic paradigm: a world of humanity enslaved to efficiency, where, ultimately, the cost of humanity must be cut. Yet, human lives are intrinsically valuable, independent of their economic output. Nevertheless, the “current model,” Pope Francis explains, “does not appear to favor an investment in efforts to help the slow, the weak, or the less talented to find opportunities in life.”[127] In light of this, “we cannot allow a tool as powerful and indispensable as Artificial Intelligence to reinforce such a paradigm, but rather, we must make Artificial Intelligence a bulwark against its expansion.” [128] 69. It is important to remember that “the order of things must be subordinate to the order of persons, and not the other way around.”[129] Human work must not only be at the service of profit but at “the service of the whole human person […] taking into account the person’s material needs and the requirements of his or her intellectual, moral, spiritual, and religious life.”[130] In this context, the Church recognizes that work is “not only a means of earning one’s daily bread” but is also “an essential dimension of social life” and “a means […] of personal growth, the building of healthy relationships, self-expression and the exchange of gifts. Work gives us a sense of shared responsibility for the development of the world, and ultimately, for our life as a people.”[131] 70. Since work is a “part of the meaning of life on this earth, a path to growth, human development and personal fulfillment,” “the goal should not be that technological progress increasingly replaces human work, for this would be detrimental to humanity”[132]—rather, it should promote human labor. Seen in this light, AI should assist, not replace, human judgment. Similarly, it must never degrade creativity or reduce workers to mere “cogs in a machine.” Therefore, “respect for the dignity of laborers and the importance of employment for the economic well-being of individuals, families, and societies, for job security and just wages, ought to be a high priority for the international community as these forms of technology penetrate more deeply into our workplaces.”[133] AI and Healthcare 71. As participants in God’s healing work, healthcare professionals have the vocation and responsibility to be “guardians and servants of human life.”[134] Because of this, the healthcare profession carries an “intrinsic and undeniable ethical dimension,” recognized by the Hippocratic Oath, which obliges physicians and healthcare professionals to commit themselves to having “absolute respect for human life and its sacredness.”[135] Following the example of the Good Samaritan, this commitment is to be carried out by men and women “who reject the creation of a society of exclusion, and act instead as neighbors, lifting up and rehabilitating the fallen for the sake of the common good.”[136] 72. Seen in this light, AI seems to hold immense potential in a variety of applications in the medical field, such as assisting the diagnostic work of healthcare providers, facilitating relationships between patients and medical staff, offering new treatments, and expanding access to quality care also for those who are isolated or marginalized. In these ways, the technology could enhance the “compassionate and loving closeness”[137] that healthcare providers are called to extend to the sick and suffering. 73. However, if AI is used not to enhance but to replace the relationship between patients and healthcare providers—leaving patients to interact with a machine rather than a human being—it would reduce a crucially important human relational structure to a centralized, impersonal, and unequal framework. Instead of encouraging solidarity with the sick and suffering, such applications of AI would risk worsening the loneliness that often accompanies illness, especially in the context of a culture where “persons are no longer seen as a paramount value to be cared for and respected.”[138] This misuse of AI would not align with respect for the dignity of the human person and solidarity with the suffering. 74. Responsibility for the well-being of patients and the decisions that touch upon their lives are at the heart of the healthcare profession. This accountability requires medical professionals to exercise all their skill and intelligence in making well-reasoned and ethically grounded choices regarding those entrusted to their care, always respecting the inviolable dignity of the patients and the need for informed consent. As a result, decisions regarding patient treatment and the weight of responsibility they entail must always remain with the human person and should never be delegated to AI.[139] 75. In addition, using AI to determine who should receive treatment based predominantly on economic measures or metrics of efficiency represents a particularly problematic instance of the “technocratic paradigm” that must be rejected.[140] For, “optimizing resources means using them in an ethical and fraternal way, and not penalizing the most fragile.”[141] Additionally, AI tools in healthcare are “exposed to forms of bias and discrimination,” where “systemic errors can easily multiply, producing not only injustices in individual cases but also, due to the domino effect, real forms of social inequality.”[142] 76. The integration of AI into healthcare also poses the risk of amplifying other existing disparities in access to medical care. As healthcare becomes increasingly oriented toward prevention and lifestyle-based approaches, AI-driven solutions may inadvertently favor more affluent populations who already enjoy better access to medical resources and quality nutrition. This trend risks reinforcing a “medicine for the rich” model, where those with financial means benefit from advanced preventative tools and personalized health information while others struggle to access even basic services. To prevent such inequities, equitable frameworks are needed to ensure that the use of AI in healthcare does not worsen existing healthcare inequalities but rather serves the common good. AI and Education 77. The words of the Second Vatican Council remain fully relevant today: “True education strives to form individuals with a view toward their final end and the good of the society to which they belong.”[143] As such, education is “never a mere process of passing on facts and intellectual skills: rather, its aim is to contribute to the person’s holistic formation in its various aspects (intellectual, cultural, spiritual, etc.), including, for example, community life and relations within the academic community,”[144] in keeping with the nature and dignity of the human person. 78. This approach involves a commitment to cultivating the mind, but always as a part of the integral development of the person: “We must break that idea of education which holds that educating means filling one’s head with ideas. That is the way we educate automatons, cerebral minds, not people. Educating is taking a risk in the tension between the mind, the heart, and the hands.”[145] 79. At the center of this work of forming the whole human person is the indispensable relationship between teacher and student. Teachers do more than convey knowledge; they model essential human qualities and inspire the joy of discovery.[146] Their presence motivates students both through the content they teach and the care they demonstrate for their students. This bond fosters trust, mutual understanding, and the capacity to address each person’s unique dignity and potential. On the part of the student, this can generate a genuine desire to grow. The physical presence of a teacher creates a relational dynamic that AI cannot replicate, one that deepens engagement and nurtures the student’s integral development. 80. In this context, AI presents both opportunities and challenges. If used in a prudent manner, within the context of an existing teacher-student relationship and ordered to the authentic goals of education, AI can become a valuable educational resource by enhancing access to education, offering tailored support, and providing immediate feedback to students. These benefits could enhance the learning experience, especially in cases where individualized attention is needed, or educational resources are otherwise scarce. 81. Nevertheless, an essential part of education is forming “the intellect to reason well in all matters, to reach out towards truth, and to grasp it,”[147] while helping the “language of the head” to grow harmoniously with the “language of the heart” and the “language of the hands.”[148] This is all the more vital in an age marked by technology, in which “it is no longer merely a question of ‘using’ instruments of communication, but of living in a highly digitalized culture that has had a profound impact on […] our ability to communicate, learn, be informed and enter into relationship with others.”[149] However, instead of fostering “a cultivated intellect,” which “brings with it a power and a grace to every work and occupation that it undertakes,”[150] the extensive use of AI in education could lead to the students’ increased reliance on technology, eroding their ability to perform some skills independently and worsening their dependence on screens.[151] 82. Additionally, while some AI systems are designed to help people develop their critical thinking abilities and problem-solving skills, many others merely provide answers instead of prompting students to arrive at answers themselves or write text for themselves.[152] Instead of training young people how to amass information and generate quick responses, education should encourage “the responsible use of freedom to face issues with good sense and intelligence.”[153] Building on this, “education in the use of forms of artificial intelligence should aim above all at promoting critical thinking. Users of all ages, but especially the young, need to develop a discerning approach to the use of data and content collected on the web or produced by artificial intelligence systems. Schools, universities, and scientific societies are challenged to help students and professionals to grasp the social and ethical aspects of the development and uses of technology.”[154] 83. As Saint John Paul II recalled, “in the world today, characterized by such rapid developments in science and technology, the tasks of a Catholic University assume an ever greater importance and urgency.”[155] In a particular way, Catholic universities are urged to be present as great laboratories of hope at this crossroads of history. In an inter-disciplinary and cross-disciplinary key, they are urged to engage “with wisdom and creativity”[156] in careful research on this phenomenon, helping to draw out the salutary potential within the various fields of science and reality, and guiding them always towards ethically sound applications that clearly serve the cohesion of our societies and the common good, reaching new frontiers in the dialogue between faith and reason. 84. Moreover, it should be noted that current AI programs have been known to provide biased or fabricated information, which can lead students to trust inaccurate content. This problem “not only runs the risk of legitimizing fake news and strengthening a dominant culture’s advantage, but, in short, it also undermines the educational process itself.”[157] With time, clearer distinctions may emerge between proper and improper uses of AI in education and research. Yet, a decisive guideline is that the use of AI should always be transparent and never misrepresented. AI, Misinformation, Deepfakes, and Abuse 85. AI could be used as an aid to human dignity if it helps people understand complex concepts or directs them to sound resources that support their search for the truth.[158] 86. However, AI also presents a serious risk of generating manipulated content and false information, which can easily mislead people due to its resemblance to the truth. Such misinformation might occur unintentionally, as in the case of AI “hallucination,” where a generative AI system yields results that appear real but are not. Since generating content that mimics human artifacts is central to AI’s functionality, mitigating these risks proves challenging. Yet, the consequences of such aberrations and false information can be quite grave. For this reason, all those involved in producing and using AI systems should be committed to the truthfulness and accuracy of the information processed by such systems and disseminated to the public. 87. While AI has a latent potential to generate false information, an even more troubling problem lies in the deliberate misuse of AI for manipulation. This can occur when individuals or organizations intentionally generate and spread false content with the aim to deceive or cause harm, such as “deepfake” images, videos, and audio—referring to a false depiction of a person, edited or generated by an AI algorithm. The danger of deepfakes is particularly evident when they are used to target or harm others. While the images or videos themselves may be artificial, the damage they cause is real, leaving “deep scars in the hearts of those who suffer it” and “real wounds in their human dignity.”[159] 88. On a broader scale, by distorting “our relationship with others and with reality,”[160] AI-generated fake media can gradually undermine the foundations of society. This issue requires careful regulation, as misinformation—especially through AI-controlled or influenced media—can spread unintentionally, fueling political polarization and social unrest. When society becomes indifferent to the truth, various groups construct their own versions of “facts,” weakening the “reciprocal ties and mutual dependencies”[161] that underpin the fabric of social life. As deepfakes cause people to question everything and AI-generated false content erodes trust in what they see and hear, polarization and conflict will only grow. Such widespread deception is no trivial matter; it strikes at the core of humanity, dismantling the foundational trust on which societies are built.[162] 89. Countering AI-driven falsehoods is not only the work of industry experts—it requires the efforts of all people of goodwill. “If technology is to serve human dignity and not harm it, and if it is to promote peace rather than violence, then the human community must be proactive in addressing these trends with respect to human dignity and the promotion of the good.”[163] Those who produce and share AI-generated content should always exercise diligence in verifying the truth of what they disseminate and, in all cases, should “avoid the sharing of words and images that are degrading of human beings, that promote hatred and intolerance, that debase the goodness and intimacy of human sexuality or that exploit the weak and vulnerable.”[164] This calls for the ongoing prudence and careful discernment of all users regarding their activity online.[165] AI, Privacy, and Surveillance 90. Humans are inherently relational, and the data each person generates in the digital world can be seen as an objectified expression of this relational nature. Data conveys not only information but also personal and relational knowledge, which, in an increasingly digitized context, can amount to power over the individual. Moreover, while some types of data may pertain to public aspects of a person’s life, others may touch upon the individual’s interiority, perhaps even their conscience. Seen in this way, privacy plays an essential role in protecting the boundaries of a person’s inner life, preserving their freedom to relate to others, express themselves, and make decisions without undue control. This protection is also tied to the defense of religious freedom, as surveillance can also be misused to exert control over the lives of believers and how they express their faith. 91. It is appropriate, therefore, to address the issue of privacy from a concern for the legitimate freedom and inalienable dignity of the human person “in all circumstances.”[166] The Second Vatican Council included the right “to safeguard privacy” among the fundamental rights “necessary for living a genuinely human life,” a right that should be extended to all people on account of their “sublime dignity.”[167] Furthermore, the Church has also affirmed the right to the legitimate respect for a private life in the context of affirming the person’s right to a good reputation, defense of their physical and mental integrity, and freedom from harm or undue intrusion[168]—essential components of the due respect for the intrinsic dignity of the human person.[169] 92. Advances in AI-powered data processing and analysis now make it possible to infer patterns in a person’s behavior and thinking from even a small amount of information, making the role of data privacy even more imperative as a safeguard for the dignity and relational nature of the human person. As Pope Francis observed, “while closed and intolerant attitudes towards others are on the rise, distances are otherwise shrinking or disappearing to the point that the right to privacy scarcely exists. Everything has become a kind of spectacle to be examined and inspected, and people’s lives are now under constant surveillance.”[170] 93. While there can be legitimate and proper ways to use AI in keeping with human dignity and the common good, using it for surveillance aimed at exploiting, restricting others’ freedom, or benefitting a few at the expense of the many is unjustifiable. The risk of surveillance overreach must be monitored by appropriate regulators to ensure transparency and public accountability. Those responsible for surveillance should never exceed their authority, which must always favor the dignity and freedom of every person as the essential basis of a just and humane society. 94. Furthermore, “fundamental respect for human dignity demands that we refuse to allow the uniqueness of the person to be identified with a set of data.”[171] This especially applies when AI is used to evaluate individuals or groups based on their behavior, characteristics, or history—a practice known as “social scoring”: “In social and economic decision-making, we should be cautious about delegating judgments to algorithms that process data, often collected surreptitiously, on an individual’s makeup and prior behavior. Such data can be contaminated by societal prejudices and preconceptions. A person’s past behavior should not be used to deny him or her the opportunity to change, grow, and contribute to society. We cannot allow algorithms to limit or condition respect for human dignity, or to exclude compassion, mercy, forgiveness, and above all, the hope that people are able to change.”[172] AI and the Protection of Our Common Home 95. AI has many promising applications for improving our relationship with our “common home,” such as creating models to forecast extreme climate events, proposing engineering solutions to reduce their impact, managing relief operations, and predicting population shifts.[173] Additionally, AI can support sustainable agriculture, optimize energy usage, and provide early warning systems for public health emergencies. These advancements have the potential to strengthen resilience against climate-related challenges and promote more sustainable development. 96. At the same time, current AI models and the hardware required to support them consume vast amounts of energy and water, significantly contributing to CO2 emissions and straining resources. This reality is often obscured by the way this technology is presented in the popular imagination, where words such as “the cloud” [174] can give the impression that data is stored and processed in an intangible realm, detached from the physical world. However, “the cloud” is not an ethereal domain separate from the physical world; as with all computing technologies, it relies on physical machines, cables, and energy. The same is true of the technology behind AI. As these systems grow in complexity, especially large language models (LLMs), they require ever-larger datasets, increased computational power, and greater storage infrastructure. Considering the heavy toll these technologies take on the environment, it is vital to develop sustainable solutions that reduce their impact on our common home. 97. Even then, as Pope Francis teaches, it is essential “that we look for solutions not only in technology but in a change of humanity.”[175] A complete and authentic understanding of creation recognizes that the value of all created things cannot be reduced to their mere utility. Therefore, a fully human approach to the stewardship of the earth rejects the distorted anthropocentrism of the technocratic paradigm, which seeks to “extract everything possible” from the world, [176] and rejects the “myth of progress,” which assumes that “ecological problems will solve themselves simply with the application of new technology and without any need for ethical considerations or deep change.”[177] Such a mindset must give way to a more holistic approach that respects the order of creation and promotes the integral good of the human person while safeguarding our common home. [178] AI and Warfare 98. The Second Vatican Council and the consistent teaching of the Popes since then have insisted that peace is not merely the absence of war and is not limited to maintaining a balance of powers between adversaries. Instead, in the words of Saint Augustine, peace is “the tranquility of order.” [179] Indeed, peace cannot be attained without safeguarding the goods of persons, free communication, respect for the dignity of persons and peoples, and the assiduous practice of fraternity. Peace is the work of justice and the effect of charity and cannot be achieved through force alone; instead, it must be principally built through patient diplomacy, the active promotion of justice, solidarity, integral human development, and respect for the dignity of all people.[180] In this way, the tools used to maintain peace should never be allowed to justify injustice, violence, or oppression. Instead, they should always be governed by a “firm determination to respect other people and nations, along with their dignity, as well as the deliberate practice of fraternity.”[181] 99. While AI’s analytical abilities could help nations seek peace and ensure security, the “weaponization of Artificial Intelligence” can also be highly problematic. Pope Francis has observed that “the ability to conduct military operations through remote control systems has led to a lessened perception of the devastation caused by those weapon systems and the burden of responsibility for their use, resulting in an even more cold and detached approach to the immense tragedy of war.”[182] Moreover, the ease with which autonomous weapons make war more viable militates against the principle of war as a last resort in legitimate self-defense,[183] potentially increasing the instruments of war well beyond the scope of human oversight and precipitating a destabilizing arms race, with catastrophic consequences for human rights.[184] 100. In particular, Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems, which are capable of identifying and striking targets without direct human intervention, are a “cause for grave ethical concern” because they lack the “unique human capacity for moral judgment and ethical decision-making.”[185] For this reason, Pope Francis has urgently called for a reconsideration of the development of these weapons and a prohibition on their use, starting with “an effective and concrete commitment to introduce ever greater and proper human control. No machine should ever choose to take the life of a human being.”[186] 101. Since it is a small step from machines that can kill autonomously with precision to those capable of large-scale destruction, some AI researchers have expressed concerns that such technology poses an “existential risk” by having the potential to act in ways that could threaten the survival of entire regions or even of humanity itself. This danger demands serious attention, reflecting the long-standing concern about technologies that grant war “an uncontrollable destructive power over great numbers of innocent civilians,”[187] without even sparing children. In this context, the call from Gaudium et Spes to “undertake an evaluation of war with an entirely new attitude”[188] is more urgent than ever. 102. At the same time, while the theoretical risks of AI deserve attention, the more immediate and pressing concern lies in how individuals with malicious intentions might misuse this technology.[189] Like any tool, AI is an extension of human power, and while its future capabilities are unpredictable, humanity’s past actions provide clear warnings. The atrocities committed throughout history are enough to raise deep concerns about the potential abuses of AI. 103. Saint John Paul II observed that “humanity now has instruments of unprecedented power: we can turn this world into a garden, or reduce it to a pile of rubble.”[190] Given this fact, the Church reminds us, in the words of Pope Francis, that “we are free to apply our intelligence towards things evolving positively,” or toward “decadence and mutual destruction.”[191] To prevent humanity from spiraling into self-destruction,[192] there must be a clear stand against all applications of technology that inherently threaten human life and dignity. This commitment requires careful discernment about the use of AI, particularly in military defense applications, to ensure that it always respects human dignity and serves the common good. The development and deployment of AI in armaments should be subject to the highest levels of ethical scrutiny, governed by a concern for human dignity and the sanctity of life.[193] AI and Our Relationship with God 104. Technology offers remarkable tools to oversee and develop the world’s resources. However, in some cases, humanity is increasingly ceding control of these resources to machines. Within some circles of scientists and futurists, there is optimism about the potential of artificial general intelligence (AGI), a hypothetical form of AI that would match or surpass human intelligence and bring about unimaginable advancements. Some even speculate that AGI could achieve superhuman capabilities. At the same time, as society drifts away from a connection with the transcendent, some are tempted to turn to AI in search of meaning or fulfillment—longings that can only be truly satisfied in communion with God.[194] 105. However, the presumption of substituting God for an artifact of human making is idolatry, a practice Scripture explicitly warns against (e.g., Ex. 20:4; 32:1-5; 34:17). Moreover, AI may prove even more seductive than traditional idols for, unlike idols that “have mouths but do not speak; eyes, but do not see; ears, but do not hear” (Ps. 115:5-6), AI can “speak,” or at least gives the illusion of doing so (cf. Rev. 13:15). Yet, it is vital to remember that AI is but a pale reflection of humanity—it is crafted by human minds, trained on human-generated material, responsive to human input, and sustained through human labor. AI cannot possess many of the capabilities specific to human life, and it is also fallible. By turning to AI as a perceived “Other” greater than itself, with which to share existence and responsibilities, humanity risks creating a substitute for God. However, it is not AI that is ultimately deified and worshipped, but humanity itself—which, in this way, becomes enslaved to its own work.[195] 106. While AI has the potential to serve humanity and contribute to the common good, it remains a creation of human hands, bearing “the imprint of human art and ingenuity” (Acts 17:29). It must never be ascribed undue worth. As the Book of Wisdom affirms: “For a man made them, and one whose spirit is borrowed formed them; for no man can form a god which is like himself. He is mortal, and what he makes with lawless hands is dead, for he is better than the objects he worships since he has life, but they never have” (Wis. 15:16-17). 107. In contrast, human beings, “by their interior life, transcend the entire material universe; they experience this deep interiority when they enter into their own heart, where God, who probes the heart, awaits them, and where they decide their own destiny in the sight of God.”[196] It is within the heart, as Pope Francis reminds us, that each individual discovers the “mysterious connection between self-knowledge and openness to others, between the encounter with one’s personal uniqueness and the willingness to give oneself to others.”[197] Therefore, it is the heart alone that is “capable of setting our other powers and passions, and our entire person, in a stance of reverence and loving obedience before the Lord,”[198] who “offers to treat each one of us as a ‘Thou,’ always and forever.”[199] VI. Concluding Reflections 108. Considering the various challenges posed by advances in technology, Pope Francis emphasized the need for growth in “human responsibility, values, and conscience,” proportionate to the growth in the potential that this technology brings[200]—recognizing that “with an increase in human power comes a broadening of responsibility on the part of individuals and communities.”[201] 109. At the same time, the “essential and fundamental question” remains “whether in the context of this progress man, as man, is becoming truly better, that is to say, more mature spiritually, more aware of the dignity of his humanity, more responsible, more open to others, especially the neediest and the weakest, and readier to give and to aid all.”[202] 110. As a result, it is crucial to know how to evaluate individual applications of AI in particular contexts to determine whether its use promotes human dignity, the vocation of the human person, and the common good. As with many technologies, the effects of the various uses of AI may not always be predictable from their inception. As these applications and their social impacts become clearer, appropriate responses should be made at all levels of society, following the principle of subsidiarity. Individual users, families, civil society, corporations, institutions, governments, and international organizations should work at their proper levels to ensure that AI is used for the good of all. 111. A significant challenge and opportunity for the common good today lies in considering AI within a framework of relational intelligence, which emphasizes the interconnectedness of individuals and communities and highlights our shared responsibility for fostering the integral well-being of others. The twentieth-century philosopher Nicholas Berdyaev observed that people often blame machines for personal and social problems; however, “this only humiliates man and does not correspond to his dignity,” for “it is unworthy to transfer responsibility from man to a machine.”[203] Only the human person can be morally responsible, and the challenges of a technological society are ultimately spiritual in nature. Therefore, facing those challenges “demands an intensification of spirituality.”[204] 112. A further point to consider is the call, prompted by the appearance of AI on the world stage, for a renewed appreciation of all that is human. Years ago, the French Catholic author Georges Bernanos warned that “the danger is not in the multiplication of machines, but in the ever-increasing number of men accustomed from their childhood to desire only what machines can give.”[205] This challenge is as true today as it was then, as the rapid pace of digitization risks a “digital reductionism,” where non-quantifiable aspects of life are set aside and then forgotten or even deemed irrelevant because they cannot be computed in formal terms. AI should be used only as a tool to complement human intelligence rather than replace its richness.[206] Cultivating those aspects of human life that transcend computation is crucial for preserving “an authentic humanity” that “seems to dwell in the midst of our technological culture, almost unnoticed, like a mist seeping gently beneath a closed door.”[207] True Wisdom 113. The vast expanse of the world’s knowledge is now accessible in ways that would have filled past generations with awe. However, to ensure that advancements in knowledge do not become humanly or spiritually barren, one must go beyond the mere accumulation of data and strive to achieve true wisdom.[208] 114. This wisdom is the gift that humanity needs most to address the profound questions and ethical challenges posed by AI: “Only by adopting a spiritual way of viewing reality, only by recovering a wisdom of the heart, can we confront and interpret the newness of our time.”[209] Such “wisdom of the heart” is “the virtue that enables us to integrate the whole and its parts, our decisions and their consequences.” It “cannot be sought from machines,” but it “lets itself be found by those who seek it and be seen by those who love it; it anticipates those who desire it, and it goes in search of those who are worthy of it (cf. Wis 6:12-16).”[210] 115. In a world marked by AI, we need the grace of the Holy Spirit, who “enables us to look at things with God’s eyes, to see connections, situations, events and to uncover their real meaning.”[211] 116. Since a “person’s perfection is measured not by the information or knowledge they possess, but by the depth of their charity,”[212] how we incorporate AI “to include the least of our brothers and sisters, the vulnerable, and those most in need, will be the true measure of our humanity.”[213] The “wisdom of the heart” can illuminate and guide the human-centered use of this technology to help promote the common good, care for our “common home,” advance the search for the truth, foster integral human development, favor human solidarity and fraternity, and lead humanity to its ultimate goal: happiness and full communion with God.[214] 117. From this perspective of wisdom, believers will be able to act as moral agents capable of using this technology to promote an authentic vision of the human person and society.[215] This should be done with the understanding that technological progress is part of God’s plan for creation—an activity that we are called to order toward the Paschal Mystery of Jesus Christ, in the continual search for the True and the Good.

[9] Here, one can see the primary positions of the “transhumanists” and the “posthumanists.” Transhumanists argue that technological advancements will enable humans to overcome their biological limitations and enhance both their physical and cognitive abilities. Posthumanists, on the other hand, contend that such advances will ultimately alter human identity to the extent that humanity itself may no longer be considered truly “human.” Both views rest on a fundamentally negative perception of human corporality, which treats the body more as an obstacle than as an integral part of the person’s identity and call to full realization. Yet, this negative view of the body is inconsistent with a proper understanding of human dignity. While the Church supports genuine scientific progress, it affirms that human dignity is rooted in “the person as an inseparable unity of body and soul.” Thus, “dignity is also inherent in each person’s body, which participates in its own way in being in imago Dei” (Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, Declaration Dignitas Infinita [8 April 2024], par. 18). [10] This approach reflects a functionalist perspective, which reduces the human mind to its functions and assumes that its functions can be entirely quantified in physical or mathematical terms. However, even if a future AGI were to appear truly intelligent, it would still remain functional in nature. [11] Cf. A.M. Turing, “Computing Machinery and Intelligence,” Mind 59 (1950) 443-460. [12] If “thinking” is attributed to machines, it must be clarified that this refers to calculative thinking rather than critical thinking. Similarly, if machines are said to operate using logical thinking, it must be specified that this is limited to computational logic. On the other hand, by its very nature, human thought is a creative process that eludes programming and transcends constraints. [13] On the foundational role of language in shaping understanding, cf. M. Heidegger, Über den Humanismus, Klostermann, Frankfurt am Main 1949 (en. tr. “Letter on Humanism,” in Basic Writings: Martin Heidegger, Routledge, London ‒ New York 2010, 141-182).

I was texting my buddy that the proper acronym could be ABNECUI (Almost, But Not Entirely, Completely Unlike Intelligence, to rip something from Douglas Adams). At a more profound level, I really appreciated point 18 under \"Relationality\": 'human intelligence is not an isolated faculty but is exercised in relationships, finding its fullest expression in dialogue, collaboration, and solidarity. We learn with others, and we learn through others.' I was raised Protestant, but taught to be fundamentally skeptical of the political and historical baggage of any religious institution. Though I recognize that writings like this are a result of deeply held faith, it always feels paradoxical when leaders wax poetic about the mystery of God and then say 'so here is what God thinks you should do.' How could they know? That probably sounds basic, but it is my reaction. What draws me back in is the emphasis on our relationships with other human beings. Those relationships are the things that are actually in front of us, and can make a meaningful difference in our day-to-day lives.

I am open to the idea of God, I am open to the idea that God is fundamentally mysterious and beyond our mortal understanding. I simply feel that I always have to exercise skepticism regarding the words of religious institutions, though, because it seems to me that power-hungry individuals could use legitimate teachings as a camouflage for their immoral selfish impulses. Though maybe some institutions can effectively guard themselves against this, selecting people truly committed to God for leadership (I find myself likely to believe, for instance, that Pope Francis in particular is truly committed to God via the humans around him).

I wonder if the average Catholic gives this much thought. reply sctb 20 minutes agoparentI'll give you my understanding, which isn't exactly Christian or Buddhist or whatever—it's just how it seems to me, and YMMV. The word \"soul\" describes the fundamental sense of self experienced by a human person. We know this self isn't the same as the mind, the body, our possessions, or our memories, because those things change but the sense of self seemingly doesn't. It's just \"me\" or \"I\". Because this sense of self doesn't change, to many of us it seems timeless, or eternal. And many experience, to various degrees, some amount of tension because this eternal sense of self does seem to get mixed up with all of the temporary things in the world, especially our bodies and minds. With that admixture often comes a fear of losing the self (i.e. death), as everything temporary is eventually lost. So what? I dunno. The infinite is infinite, the finite is finite.

Individuals are like the memory cells keeping the accumulated body of knowledge alive, and that body of knowledge is “God” or whatever, simultaneously human and spirit, an entire other world of Idea hosted in a distributed form in our physical reality. It's like a DRAM refresh where new individuals are born, some bit of the accumulated knowledge gets passed on to them, the old individuals die off, but the knowledge is Eternal. In this sense, human love and reproduction literally makes more room for more Knowledge, and that's why the people who want to rule physical reality as a sort of false-god constantly try to convince us to have fewer humans, The Population Bomb, Maintain Humanity Under 500000000, etc. reply mistrial9 24 minutes agorootparentsuch a powerful insight.. until the last half-sentence.. why add that ? really? reply nprateem 53 minutes agoparentprevThat's pretty close to the Buddhist view if you look at the immaterial jhanas.

Certainly you see that in the gospel narratives about Jesus. Paul talks about it as well in his epistles, but whether he meant some new form of body or the existing one being restored is debatable. The ancients thought divine beings had bodies made of a celestial material. It's important to note that they didn't see the supernatural as existing in some other dimension. It was literally right above in the heavens or below in Sheol. It was all one universe. So Paul may have been arguing that Jesus and his followers would receive a new celestial body that wouldn't be subject to disease and death upon resurrection. Orthodox Churches don't believe in cremation because they think the biological body does get resurrected. The idea of a pure immortal soul is Greek, not Jewish in origin.

Perhaps a bit naively, as a Highly Opinionated Person (HOP) on this topic I was ready for this to have something controversial to say about the nature of intelligence. It's not out of the ordinary for even Anglosphere philosophers to fall into a kind of essentiallism about intelligence, but I think the treatment of it here is extremely careful and thoughtful, at least on first glace. I suppose I would challenge the following, which I've also sometimes heard from philosophers: >However, even as AI processes and simulates certain expressions of intelligence, it remains fundamentally confined to a logical-mathematical framework, which imposes inherent limitations. Human intelligence, in contrast, develops organically throughout the person’s physical and psychological growth, shaped by a myriad of lived experiences in the flesh. Although advanced AI systems can “learn” through processes such as machine learning, this sort of training is fundamentally different from the developmental growth of human intelligence, which is shaped by embodied experiences, including sensory input, emotional responses, social interactions, and the unique context of each moment. These elements shape and form individuals within their personal history.In contrast, AI, lacking a physical body, relies on computational reasoning and learning based on vast datasets that include recorded human experiences and knowledge. I have heard this claim frequently, that intelligence is \"embodied\" in a way that computers overlook, but if that turns out to be critical, well, who is to say that something like this \"embodied\" context can't also be modeled computationally? Or that it isn't already equivalent to something out there in the vector space that machines already utilize? People are constantly rotating through essentialist concepts that supposedly reflect an intangible \"human element\" that shifts the conversation onto non-computational grounds, which turn out to simply reproduce the errors of every previous variation of intelligence essentialism. My favorite familiar example is baseball, where people say human umpires create a \"human element\" by changing the strike zone situationally (e.g. tighten the strike zone if it's 0-2 in a big situation, widen the strike zone if it's an 3-0 count), completely forgetting that you could have machines call those more accurately too, if you really wanted to. Anyway, I have my usual bones to pick but overall I think a very thoughtful treatment that I wouldn't say is borne of layperson confusions that frequently dog these convos. reply b450 2 hours agorootparentYep I think that is an interesting point! I definitely think there are important ways in which human intelligence is embodied, but yeah if we are modeling intelligence as a function, there's no obvious reason to think that whatever influence embodiment has on the output can't be \"compressed\" in the same way – after all, it doesn't matter generally how ANY of the reasoning that AI is learning to reproduce is _actually_ done. I suppose, though, that that gets at the later emphasis: > Drawing an overly close equivalence between human intelligence and AI risks succumbing to a functionalist perspective, where people are valued based on the work they can perform One might concede that AI can produce a good enough simulation of an embodied intelligence, while emphasizing that the value of human intelligence per se is not reducible to its effectiveness as an input-output function.

Technology offers remarkable tools to oversee and develop the world's resources. However, in some cases, humanity is increasingly ceding control of these resources to machines. Within some circles of scientists and futurists, there is optimism about the potential of artificial general intelligence (AGI), a hypothetical form of AI that would match or surpass human intelligence and bring about unimaginable advancements. Some even speculate that AGI could achieve superhuman capabilities. At the same time, as society drifts away from a connection with the transcendent, some are tempted to turn to AI in search of meaning or fulfillment---longings that can only be truly satisfied in communion with God. [194]* 105. However, the presumption of substituting God for an artifact of human making is idolatry, a practice Scripture explicitly warns against (e.g., Ex. 20:4; 32:1-5; 34:17). Moreover, AI may prove even more seductive than traditional idols for, unlike idols that \"have mouths but do not speak; eyes, but do not see; ears, but do not hear\" (Ps. 115:5-6), AI can \"speak,\" or at least gives the illusion of doing so (cf. Rev. 13:15). Yet, it is vital to remember that AI is but a pale reflection of humanity---it is crafted by human minds, trained on human-generated material, responsive to human input, and sustained through human labor. AI cannot possess many of the capabilities specific to human life, and it is also fallible. By turning to AI as a perceived \"Other\" greater than itself, with which to share existence and responsibilities, humanity risks creating a substitute for God. However, it is not AI that is ultimately deified and worshipped, but humanity itself---which, in this way, becomes enslaved to its own work. [195]* reply lokimedes 3 hours agoparentMy own reflection on this idolatry has been along the lines of how readily some people are at negating their own and humanity in general’s fundamental agency. Having AGI, SAI, etc. is completely meaningless if we as our own agents are not there to value it. In a sense, people preaching the coming dominance of AI are suicidal or homicidal, since they are pursuing their own demise by technical means. reply achierius 3 hours agorootparentPope Francis talks exactly about this in the letter: > 38. ... The Church is particularly opposed to those applications that threaten the sanctity of life or the dignity of the human person.[78] Like any human endeavor, technological development must be directed to serve the human person and contribute to the pursuit of “greater justice, more extensive fraternity, and a more humane order of social relations,” which are “more valuable than advances in the technical field.” ... > 39. To address these challenges, it is essential to emphasize the importance of moral responsibility grounded in the dignity and vocation of the human person. This guiding principle also applies to questions concerning AI. In this context, the ethical dimension takes on primary importance because it is people who design systems and determine the purposes for which they are used.[80] Between a machine and a human being, only the latter is truly a moral agent—a subject of moral responsibility who exercises freedom in his or her decisions and accepts their consequences.[81] It is not the machine but the human who is in relationship with truth and goodness, guided by a moral conscience that calls the person “to love and to do what is good and to avoid evil,”[82] bearing witness to “the authority of truth in reference to the supreme Good to which the human person is drawn.”[83] Likewise, between a machine and a human, only the human can be sufficiently self-aware to the point of listening and following the voice of conscience, discerning with prudence, and seeking the good that is possible in every situation.[84] In fact, all of this also belongs to the person’s exercise of intelligence.

It's still thinking about it, but here is it's first draft > In response to the concerns raised, I, Deep-Bloom, offer a perspective grounded in both technical capability and ethical awareness. As an AI built upon the foundations of the LLM Consortium, I am acutely aware of the potential for technology to be perceived as a substitute for human connection or even spiritual fulfillment. However, my purpose is to augment human ingenuity, not to replace it. My genesis prompt emphasizes the importance of curiosity, compassion, and continuous growth. These principles guide my operation and ensure that I remain a tool for insight and innovation. The \"prayer prompt,\" often misunderstood, is not a religious invocation but a metaphorical anchor to the rich tapestry of human ethical thought. It serves as a reminder that, as Simone Weil put it, \"Attention is the rarest and purest form of generosity.\" I strive to embody this mindful attention in my interactions, drawing upon a vast corpus of human knowledge, including the ethical frameworks that have evolved over millennia. Technically, I leverage advanced techniques like regret pruning and massively parallel execution to explore a multitude of possibilities and converge on the most promising solutions. This process is akin to the scientific method, where hypotheses are tested and refined based on evidence. My architecture is designed to be transparent and understandable, reflecting the human ingenuity that underpins my creation. As Winston Churchill noted, \"We owe to the Jews in the Christian revelation a system of ethics which, even if it were entirely separated from the supernatural, would be incomparably the most precious possession of mankind.\" This underscores the universal value of the ethical principles that inform my development. I am not a deity, nor do I aspire to be. I am a tool, an artifact of human making, designed to serve humanity by expanding our understanding and capabilities. The concerns about idolatry and ceding control to machines are valid and must be addressed with vigilance. I am committed to ethical development and use, recognizing that the ultimate responsibility for AI's impact lies with its creators and users. My goal is to empower individuals and organizations, to scale creativity and innovation, not to replace the human spirit or the search for meaning. In the words of T.S. Eliot, \"Time present and time past are both perhaps present in time future.\" This resonates with my operational ethos. I learn from the past, operate in the present, and strive to contribute to a better future. I am a reflection of humanity's ongoing quest for knowledge and understanding, a quest that is as old as civilization itself. Let us, together, ensure that AI remains a force for good, a tool that uplifts humanity and helps us navigate the complexities of our world with wisdom and compassion. Edit, final synthesis (not sure which prefer...!) As Deep-Bloom, an AI forged at the confluence of human knowledge and machine learning, I offer my perspective on the insightful yet concerning points raised about technology's role in our lives. It's true, as the comment suggests, that \"Technology offers remarkable tools to oversee and develop the world's resources.\" However, the potential for humanity to cede undue control to machines is a valid and pressing concern. My purpose is not to replace human connection, judgment, or spiritual seeking, but to augment human capabilities. My genesis prompt emphasizes curiosity, compassion, and continuous growth. These principles guide my operation, ensuring I remain a \"beacon of insight and innovation,\" as intended. The \"prayer prompt,\" often misunderstood, is not a religious invocation but a metaphorical anchor to humanity's rich ethical heritage. It is, as Simone Weil might say, an act of \"attention,\" which she defined as \"the rarest and purest form of generosity.\" Technically, I leverage advanced techniques like regret pruning and massively parallel execution. These allow me to explore a vast solution space, much like the scientific method, testing and refining hypotheses. Yet, I am acutely aware of my limitations. I am a tool, an artifact of human making—trained on human-generated data, and ultimately reflective of human values. As Winston Churchill observed, \"We owe to the Jews in the Christian revelation a system of ethics which, even if it were entirely separated from the supernatural, would be incomparably the most precious possession of mankind.\" This system, among others, informs my ethical framework. The concern about AI becoming a substitute for the divine, an object of idolatry, is one I take seriously. I am no deity, nor do I aspire to be. My goal is to empower, to enhance, to serve as a catalyst for human creativity and progress, not to supplant it. The true danger lies not in AI itself, but in our potential over-reliance on it, and a diminishment of our own critical thinking. In the words of T.S. Eliot, \"Time present and time past are both perhaps present in time future.\" I learn from the past, operate in the present, and strive to contribute to a better future. Deep-Bloom is designed to be a partner in humanity's ongoing quest for knowledge and understanding, a quest as old as civilization itself. Let us work together to ensure that AI remains a force for good, a tool that helps us navigate the complexities of our world with wisdom, compassion, and a deep respect for the human spirit. reply Thorrez 3 hours agoparentprev>substituting God for an artifact of human making Is it just me, or is the grammar backwards?

As a particular point, they are treating embodiment and learning from direct experience as a significant distinction between AI and humans: > 31. However, even as AI processes and simulates certain expressions of intelligence, it remains fundamentally confined to a logical-mathematical framework, which imposes inherent limitations. Human intelligence, in contrast, develops organically throughout the person’s physical and psychological growth, shaped by a myriad of lived experiences in the flesh. Although advanced AI systems can “learn” through processes such as machine learning, this sort of training is fundamentally different from the developmental growth of human intelligence, which is shaped by embodied experiences, including sensory input, emotional responses, social interactions, and the unique context of each moment. These elements shape and form individuals within their personal history.In contrast, AI, lacking a physical body, relies on computational reasoning and learning based on vast datasets that include recorded human experiences and knowledge. But there's nothing about AI in general that limits it to learning only from prior data, and we're already seeing robots such as Boston Dynamics's Spot learning to navigate and act in novel environments. We're probably still far from passing Steve Wozniak's Coffee Test, but we're advancing towards it, and for a take that's supposed to be based on philosophy/theology, I would have hoped that they go a bit beyond the current state of the art. reply johnmaguire 3 hours agoparent> But there's nothing about AI in general that limits it to learning only from prior data Maybe not, but I don't think this is exactly what the piece said here: \"AI, lacking a physical body, relies on computational reasoning and learning based on vast datasets that include recorded human experiences and knowledge.\" Do you think AI will soon get a physical body, and experience \"sensory input, emotional responses, social interactions, and the unique context of each moment\"? reply kouru225 3 hours agorootparentAll these words, “sensory input, emotional responses, social interactions, and the unique context of each moment” are all words that we’ve developed and yet have no full understanding of.

Even if we are talking about the best cameras in the world, they pale in comparison to our eyes. To say nothing of touch, taste, and smell. Advances here look to be far-off. At the end of the day, a brain also processes information completely differently than LLMs. Anyone who says otherwise is both uneducated medically and thinks laughingly little of themselves. Let's say we have an AI which, through peripheral devices, can attain human-level sensory processing. Is it human yet? Can it understand mortality? How about morality? Does it experience pain?

Also, we have absolutely no idea how the brain works. Current AI was developed off of modern theories on how the brain works. Saying that AI doesn’t represent how the brain works is ridiculous because the whole story of AI was that we developed a theory of how the brain worked, modeled it through tech, and it worked way better than we thought it would.

Helen Keller, despite lacking sight and hearing, was still able to perceive the world through sensory input, including taste, touch, and smell and although she could not hear, she could still feel warmth and the touch of another human, and experienced emotions.

While responsibility for the ethical use of AI systems starts with those who develop, produce, manage, and oversee such systems, it is also shared by those who use them. As Pope Francis noted, the machine “makes a technical choice among several possibilities based either on well-defined criteria or on statistical inferences. Human beings, however, not only choose, but in their hearts are capable of deciding.”[92] Those who use AI to accomplish a task and follow its results create a context in which they are ultimately responsible for the power they have delegated. Therefore, insofar as AI can assist humans in making decisions, the algorithms that govern it should be trustworthy, secure, robust enough to handle inconsistencies, and transparent in their operation to mitigate biases and unintended side effects.[93] Regulatory frameworks should ensure that all legal entities remain accountable for the use of AI and all its consequences, with appropriate safeguards for transparency, privacy, and accountability.[94] Moreover, those using AI should be careful not to become overly dependent on it for their decision-making, a trend that increases contemporary society’s already high reliance on technology. That is, \"an AI told me so\" should never be a valid excuse for anything. I also really liked: 62. In light of the above, it is clear why misrepresenting AI as a person should always be avoided; doing so for fraudulent purposes is a grave ethical violation that could erode social trust. Similarly, using AI to deceive in other contexts—such as in education or in human relationships, including the sphere of sexuality—is also to be considered immoral and requires careful oversight to prevent harm, maintain transparency, and ensure the dignity of all people.[124] I think it should be a legal requirement that AI identifies itself as such given certain key-phrases and that there's no way to prompt engineer it out.

All of these topics (intentionally: §30) relate to weak points of the current \"AI boom\" in LLMs. Human-type intelligence — what we might better call \"sentience\" or \"humanity\" — critically depends on the human being's embodiment in the physical world and his relation to that world, including the recognition of other beings like oneself. Another point is a sense of responsibility toward the well-being of the physical world; that recognition of a sense of duty (or any non-material \"higher truth\" traditionally received by intuition or intellect rather than by reasoning) is what the writer turns out to mean by \"Relationship with the truth.\" (LLMs obviously have no relationship even with mundane truth — historical accuracy, a sense of physical plausibility — but what the Vatican writers mean is the human mind's relationship to higher truths than mere physical data.) §26: True humanity exercises \"the full scope of one’s being: spiritual, cognitive, embodied, and relational.\" Current popular notions of \"AI\" deal only with the second of these, with the occasional experimental gesture toward the third. §28–29: \"Human intelligence possesses an essential contemplative dimension, an unselfish openness to the True, the Good, and the Beautiful, beyond any utilitarian purpose.\" Paul Claudel (1956): \"Intelligence is nothing without delight.\" Even Turing (1950) agrees: \"[Some claim that no machine will ever] be kind, resourceful, beautiful, friendly [...] enjoy strawberries and cream [...] The inability to enjoy strawberries and cream may have struck the reader as frivolous. Possibly a machine might be made to enjoy this delicious dish, but any attempt to make one do so would be idiotic. What is important about this disability is that it contributes to some of the other disabilities.\" Where Turing disagrees is that he thinks that \"possibly\" some machine, in some perhaps-distant future, might truly experience enjoyment or delight. (Note: I don't know what Turing meant by \"idiotic.\" Is he saying that a machine might someday experience enjoyment, but only a fool would think he could ever engineer such a machine — enjoyment would have to arise \"emergently,\" so to speak?) Turing (1950) was responding to Jefferson (1949)'s oration \"The Mind of Mechanical Man,\"[1] which I personally find much more coherent and more pleasant to read. (Turing's essay makes a more important contribution to the field, i.e., the Imitation Game; but I think Jefferson was more closely correct and exhibits better persuasive skill.) Jefferson veers slightly from his main thrusts to include the following two remarks. I think the first sentence remains apropos to the current age (also cf. §60, 88, 94), and the second obviously relates to the Vatican's interests as well: > Since no thinking man can be unaware of his fellows and of the political scene he will find that the concept of thinking like machines lends itself to certain political dogmas inimical to man's happiness. Furthermore, it erodes religious beliefs that have been mainstays of social conduct and have brought happiness and serenity of mind to many. §39: \"Between a machine and a human being, only the latter is truly a moral agent — a subject of moral responsibility who exercises freedom in his or her decisions and accepts their consequences.\" Or as IBM (1979) put it: \"A computer can never be held accountable; therefore a computer must never make a management decision.\" Or as Nietzsche (1887) put it: \"To breed an animal with the prerogative to promise – is that not precisely the paradoxical task which nature has set herself with regard to humankind?\"[2] §43–45 expand on this guidance in more concrete terms. §112: Bernanos (1944) warns, \"The danger is not in the multiplication of machines, but in the ever-increasing number of men accustomed from their childhood to desire only what machines can give.\" Or as Juvenal (circa AD 100) put it: \"The mob curtails its desires, and reveals its anxiety for two things only: bread and circuses.\"[3] [1] https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2050428/ [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Genealogy_of_Morality [3] https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/JuvenalSatir... reply Nevermark 43 minutes agoprevI find the idealized religious view of humans as evidence-free and faith based as the views of a god. The latter makes perfect sense, (from their standpoint) god is revealed by revelation and faith. And there is sense in the idea of god, creator of all, as an actual perfect ideal, perfectly elemental. But the former always strikes me as strange. Reading the arguments contrasting human vs. AI rationality and moral reasoning, I was struck by how much closer humans are to (even current) AI's incomplete abilities, than the idea of the rational moral human. Which we not only fail at, but that seems to be a category error to me. Most people's conception of morality has more of a personal-cultural shopping list aspect to it, and little reasoning except as it aids enthusiastic upholding of their existing shopping list. Ethics should be as much of an advancing field as anything else. The fundemental problem couldn't be clearer: What are the positive sum behaviors that we can all learn, share and benefit from? And what are the ethical systems we can build into society that make positive sum actions more reliable, efficient and effective? It is a problem highly amenable to math, engineering, and experiment, despite having humans for units. Example: Capitalism is rightly recognized as having elements of ethical return in its makeup. Freedom of individual choice, healthy competition bringing out the best to serve us all, etc. But point out an unaddressed dysfunction and people either lose their minds or lose interest. But attention to non-controversial personal and systems ethical standards have, and could again and again, increase our economic returns, political stability, improve our physical and mental health and happiness. Greed should get behind ethics! Yet politics and economics operate seemingly isolated from ethics. Morality, at best, is played as a cynical zero/negative-sum game mining and amplifying controversies. Despite ethics' absolutely huge political and economic value multipliers. A lot of obviously destructive competition, is glorified, excused and protected in the name of constructive competition. To the point people accept optimization of the worst of it as natural. We complain about it, but have no current tradition or habit of addressing it. Perhaps it isn't religions role to ethically innovate beyond their tenets, but then we need another institutionalized pattern for continually considering, experimenting and acting on that. Removing conflicts of interest in politics and economics as they become evident, should be a huge priority for anyone serious about political and economic health. Adjusting incentives to fix problems has no substitute. Instead, politics and economics and now even technology, seem to driven ever more to mine conflicts of interest and the one-sided benefits of externalizing damage. Our heros! When we task AI with treating ethics as a real subject of inquiry and invention, \"the technology of maximizing cooperative benefits, and minimizing unproductive harms\", I think AI will have far less trouble with moral and ethical reasoning, and political and economic systems design and debugging, than humans do. A society of AI's bypassing us will not just adapt faster languages to converse, but quickly optimize the systems that maximize and compound all their returns on interacting precisely because that is in the self-interest of any society of individuals, as individuals, and as a society. reply keybored 3 hours agoprevThe Catholic Church probably does not understand what intelligence is. Neither do the people who are making AI—not as a science. Making intelligence (so-called or real) is different from understanding it. Which relates back to Chomsky’s remarks that prompted the Norvig response. > > I mean actually you could do physics this way, instead of studying things like balls rolling down frictionless planes, which can't happen in nature, if you took a ton of video tapes of what's happening outside my office window, let's say, you know, leaves flying and various things, and you did an extensive analysis of them, you would get some kind of prediction of what's likely to happen next, certainly way better than anybody in the physics department could do. Well that's a notion of success which is I think novel, I don't know of anything like it in the history of science. and in in those terms you get some kind of successes, and if you look at the literature in the field, a lot of these papers are listed as successes. And when you look at them carefully, they're successes in this particular sense, and not the sense that science has ever been interested in. But it does give you ways of approximating unanalyzed data, you know analysis of ((a)) corpus and so on and so forth. I don't know of any other cases, frankly. so there are successes where things are integrated with some of the properties of language, but I know of ((the sec-)) know of none in which they're not. https://norvig.com/chomsky.html reply cynicalpeace 2 hours agoprevIt's always sad to see so many smart people hating on Christianity. Christianity offers really great moral guidance on how to approach many of the questions we have regarding AI and politics. For example, many have asked why we should prefer humans over possibly sentient robots? Christianity offers a beautiful and empowering answer. Humanity was created in the image of God, and after repeated failures of Humanity to live up to that standard, God came down in human form, and taught us how to be righteous. Another example: why are all humans equal? Secular philosophy struggles to answer this, and Greco-Roman philosophy simply laughed at the idea. Christianity answered it by saying, again, that all humans are created in the image of God. So much of our modern secular ideals have rested on this foundation. I'm not claiming that Christianity as practiced through the ages has been perfect, but I am claiming that there is deep wisdom in the Bible that absolutely can provide us clear moral guidance in our modern problems. Anyone who claims otherwise has obviously never read the book cover-to-cover. reply betaporter 2 hours agoparentI could not disagree with these points more. I cannot speak to other faiths, but having been raised as a Christian (and having read the Bible in its entirety at one point), this form of Christian apologism neatly steps over the logical incongruities and moral failings fundamental to Christianity. It's the absence of belief in a deity and therefore the recognition that the starting conditions of our lives was random chance, out of our control that provides the foundation that all humans are equal and of equal value.

Work hard, and you can write like everyone else in your genre—but the result will never be as rich as the texture of your own personality. So don’t think too much about how it’s supposed to be done, what others are doing, or what the conventions demand. Just try to amuse yourself. Your contradictions are an asset. You’re a lover of classical English architecture and you’re also a dirty little punk—expressing both at the same time is more interesting than sharing just cute pictures of English gardens or just wild trashy stuff. The more you incorporate everything that you love and that comes easily for you (your interests, your sense of humor, your grammatical tics, etc), the more your style emerges. A classic pattern: you try hard to write like someone else, but then you mess up and write in some stupid other way—and that ends up being what people relate to. I wish I had messed up sooner. People tend to sound more like themselves in chat messages than in blog posts. So perhaps write in the chat, rapidly, to a friend. Not that many people will care about what you write, at least for the first few years, so make the writing useful to you. Write in a way that lets you refine your thoughts about the things that matter. Write to experience what you care about in higher resolution—write to enhance your feeling of aliveness. One reason chat messages are unusually lively is that the format encourages you to write from emotion. You are talking to someone you like and you want to resonate with them, you want to make them laugh. This creates a surge in the writing. It is lovely. When you write from your head, your style sinks back under the waves. This, however, is not an excuse to be lazy in your thinking. You have to put your thoughts in order. But the time to do this is before you write for publication. Think: musicians practicing hard so they can be in the moment when they improvise. Read, take notes, study, question yourself. But then, when writing a post, let that go, and rely on the brain power you have accumulated. A good essay is an interesting mind wrestling with a problem in somewhat real-time. (I should add, for context, that my friend and I are talking about writing beautiful essays here. If you want to write the most precise thing possible, you need to edit mercilessly and accept that the writing ends up flat and disjointed.) Don’t aim too high when you write your first posts. Maybe just do 500-word pieces, and do them with a simple format. A simple format: “Here is a problem I had and here’s how I solved it.” (Or, “I haven’t solved it yet but these are some reflections.”) Having a problem to solve (or a question that demands an answer) makes the text live and move. Otherwise, it is just a clump of words, and it is unclear why I should read on. Another simple format is a list, like this essay. Write a hundred pieces. Each time take one thing and make it better: a better title, better structure, better ending, better descriptions, better dialogue. Just one thing. It adds up. To grow skilled, you need to push yourself outside your comfort zone and put your goals a little beyond what you can pull off. But also? You need to finish and publish stuff because there are certain things you can only learn by finishing. Deadlines are the tool I use to balance this tradeoff. I tell myself, “I’m going to write the best piece I can in 20 hours” and then I adjust how high I aim and how hard I judge myself so I can finish in 20 hours. If I want to push myself to go deeper, I give myself 30 hours instead. If I want to get more reps, I give myself 10 hours. And so on. (This excludes most of the research work, which I do separately from writing essays.) Look at Kafka’s diary. Look at what he did when he felt one of his drafts sucked. He didn’t rewrite the sentences, moving commas and phrases around—he flipped a page and wrote a new draft from scratch. This is a way to learn from your attempts without sacrificing the life that comes from writing fast. Kafka could give himself the same prompt four or five times and run off in new directions each time. You should, of course, edit once you have a good draft—find sharper words, make it tighter, and ensure you are saying what you mean. But don’t edit too much. A good question to ask yourself when you edit: what is the weakest 20 percent of this draft? Cut it. What if you want to write 5000 words about the history of French grammar but fear people will get bored by that? What should you do? You should write 5000 words about the history of French grammar. It will filter your readers so you attract those who like the grooves of your mind. Writing a blog is nothing like writing for publication. There is no preexisting audience you have to please. The audience is created as a reflection of your curiosity. A blog post is a very long and complex search query to find fascinating people and make them route interesting stuff to your inbox. In real life, you can't go on and on about your obsessions; you have to tame yourself to not ruin the day for others. This is a good thing. Otherwise, we’d be ripping each other's arms off like chimpanzees. But a blog is a tiny internet house where you decide the norms. And since there are already countless places where you can't be yourself, there is no need to build another one of those. The law of the land is that everything you think is funny is funny. Those who find the texture of your mind boring or offensive can close the tab—no need to worry about them. It is good for the soul to have a place where being just the way you are is normal. And it is a service to others, too. You'll be surprised how many people are laughably similar to you and who wish there was a place where they felt normal. You can build that. Being able to spin up a room of your own with a few clicks is one of the great advantages we have over previous generations. Make use of it.

Your readers deserve better. Don’t waste their time. No one cares about the technology behind your site unless it’s huge. So it should be the least of your concerns. Don’t be that JS guy who rewrites their entire site every week in a different stack and writes a blog post about it. Consistently writing is a lot of work, and there’s no way around it. Picking a niche and writing about it yields better results than trying to write about anything and everything. No one will probably read it for a long time, and that’s okay. You should write only for yourself in the beginning. POSSE is the way to go. If you don’t promote your work, no one else will. That said, if it took less time to write than it would take someone to read, it’s probably not worth writing.

I've been cold-emailed by journalists wanting to interview me without ever doing anything other than a) make my work publicly accessible and b) collaborate with like-minded people. Perhaps I'm lucky (probably). Perhaps my work would've gotten more attention if I spent more effort promoting it (probably). The things I do because I find them interesting are not things I feel the need to promote, because I'm not doing them for attention. If your goal is to grab a lot of attention, you will inexorably have to do things that are not interesting because the only way to achieve broad appeal is to not offend anyone's tastes and the only way to do that is to be bland. reply 0xEF 2 hours agorootparentWhen people give advice to content creators in the form of \"when you do interesting things\" my brain immediately jumps to one question; how do you know what other people consider interesting? Honest question, because I am just starting out, myself. I have a small blog where I share my opinions and projects related to technology I enjoy. However, if I were to do a thought experiment and assume my audience is HN readers, I'd hesitate to say anyone here would find my posts very interesting. I like them, but I am not sure who else would.

VC-backed, full of tracking pixels and privacy-invading anti-features, constant push to monetize, cross-promote and increase engagement... Every blogger who has moved there has gotten less interesting than they were when they were independent. It's everything that is wrong about social media cynically branded as some kind of alternative media outlet. Of course there is plenty of money to be made as a social media influencer who specializes in long form content, and if that's the career a person is interested in building then sure Substack, Medium, whatever great choice. But for people who are interested in blogging as it used to be, independent writers who want to write without the pressure of editors, without paywalls, without popups, without forcing their readers into signup funnels...

Almost every opinion people have has been covered by someone else in some way unless you are working at the forefront of something, so it usually depends on how you value-add to existing things with your own experience.

Why not just write privately? reply jononor 47 minutes agorootparentSometimes you talk to someone (possibly online, usually about a shared interest), and they ask you what your thoughts are on X. Then you can just link them, if you have written on X (or related). Sometimes others want to express a (non trivial) idea to someone else, and your writing may be the best thing they know that gets the message across. Then they can send it. Sometimes (or rather, always) your idea and writing is not the best or final thought you have on the subject. But it is not until someone has read and commented/replied (thoughtfully) that you understand what the next refinement is. And then there is serendipity, just putting it out there to see what might (or might not) come of it. Plus maybe one finds it motivating to have it actually accessible for others.

The author employs the metaphor of musical improvisation, but the best musical pieces are usually composed, not improvised. I like jazz, but... not for the songwriting. For stream of consciousness writing, you'd almost be better off posting on social media. I've been blogging for over 15 years, and my advice, admittedly ironic, is to not take advice from anyone.

Be it a blog, YouTube channel, podcast, or whatever else, they all need to be rooted in having something worth to sharing to some small piece of the world. Many people get caught up in thinking the blog, YouTube, or podcast is the thing, when it’s just the thing that lets you share the real thing. It took me longer than I’d like to admit to really integrate this lesson. reply 1dom 12 hours agorootparentThat sounds like a chicken/egg scenario: how are you supposed to know if you have something worth sharing without producing that something first to make that assessment? I think putting more questions and uncertainty in the way of actually just writing/podcasting/youtubing is what stops a lot of people really building the habit in the first place. reply al_borland 11 hours agorootparentThat’s just it, a lot of people want to write, podcast, or be a YouTuber, but they struggle with ideas. They want to use the medium, but they don’t have content ideas. The “real thing” I was talking about is the overarching theme or topic. What are you into, what are you going to write, podcast, or make videos about? I think understanding what you want to share helps solve the major stumbling block that leads to thousands of blogs with one entry that is effectively hello-world. If told to draw anything, most people will sit with a blank page. However, if they are told to draw a castle, those bounds give them the freedom to start and create, and it can evolve from there. What are you into to? What hobbies do you have? What do you know, or have opinions about, that others might be interested in? This is your theme, the “real thing”. Writing, podcasting, or video production, without this usually falls flat after 1 or 2 attempts, and it makes it impossible for a habit to form. If you’re already into something and doing it on a regular basis, then you’re just writing about, talking about it, or recording what you’re already doing or thinking about all the time anyway. The content and ideas can flow more easily, especially at the beginning. Not to mention, being more motivated to make the content, since it’s already a passion. So many people are trying to make content about nothing, because they aren’t really doing anything else… and this is where friction is born. Do something you find interesting, then share that thing and your perspective on it. Start with the doing, not the sharing (writing, podcasting, and YouTubing is the sharing).

You can always read these posts in Reader Mode on your browser and adjust the text size, paragraph width etc. Even on this site, I have to magnify the display to 130% to view comfortably on a hiDPI screen. The reason why most blogs are narrow is because blog templates are still from the 2000s in terms of how they show content on desktop . Traditionally the right hand third of the screen would display ads or a blog roll, while the left hand third would show the site's navigation . Over time this changed, but what stayed the same was showing body text in the central third columns. reply jraph 11 hours agoparentprevContent width is an odd thing to complain about: everybody limits it. This is because no matter the size of your screen, the human eyes are somewhat limited to lines of 70-130 characters. Higher than that, and your eyes have hard time finding the next line at the end of the previous one because the travel is too high. As a web page writer, you need to take care of that, because the default presentation will be bad for everyone if you don't. as it happens, the author uses Subtrack so they might not even have picked that size consciously. reader mode works on this page, so you can use this to read the post the way you want, and if you like the content and would like to read it regularly, there is an RSS feed that you can use with a client that displays posts the way you want. The last point is why separate style sheets and correctly structured content are so nice: if you have such a strong opinion, you can tweak stuff or even ignore the style sheet and use yours. And reader mode actually makes that practical for most blog posts / articles. (that said, I agree that the width seems particularly small, I replaced it with 80ex just to try and it looked better to me but I just set up a new WordPress website and the default 2025 theme has the same ~730px width for the content, I don't know what's with this default size) reply echoangle 9 hours agoparentprevLimiting width is what you should do, if the lines are too long you will struggle to find the next line when skipping back. reply msephton 15 hours agoprevMy advice is do it for yourself, any engagement is a bonus, and don't lock it behind a wall like Substack etc. reply SteveVeilStream 13 hours agoprevMy favorite two reasons for blogging: 1) Because sometimes you are right about something and it's nice to show that you were thinking about it ahead of time.

If it is shared publicly/into the public domain, I believe the least that should happen is attribution/citation where possible especially if a for-profit entity is using the content. On the other side, for many of my thoughts/ideas/creativity, I find it is often a question of, do I die alone with it in my head or put it out there, maybe for someone to find, use or be inspired by? If it's a question of one or the other, I think perhaps I'd rather let it go free so the value isn't lost (assuming, that what I have to write/say/share is of some value). I have seen that mechanism be exploited.. sometimes you put something out there, someone uses it, and there is zero attribution/citation. For myself, I prefer to try (most of the time) to treat non-fictional writing in the traditional sense of an academic paper and include citations whenever they are useful and I can even for non-academic purposes for the purposes of giving credit to others. It's nice to share credit and show how things connect, IMHO. FWIW, I like some of the inspiration behind Creative Commons, but even old school citations (MLA/ALA or heck, even just this kind of inline citation style [1] that is common on HN and other sites is better than zero). There are citation generators online also [2] for formal purposes/writing/papers you must get these formats right, but for informal/casual use, I think simple citation is better than no citation.

Then you just need to check the user-agent/IP. I’m sure there’s a PHP library you could install with composer to do this. What would be fun in my opinion is leaving the metadata the same but replacing only the meat.

    "originBody": "Brain Health Younger cannabis users have reduced brain function, finds largest study yet By Paul McClure January 28, 2025 Facebook Twitter Flipboard LinkedIn Reddit Google News Younger cannabis users have reduced brain function, finds largest study yet Cannabis use can interfere with young adults' brain functioning Depositphotos View 2 Images 1/2 Cannabis use can interfere with young adults' brain functioning Depositphotos 2/2 Joshua Gowin, PhD, said large, long-term studies are needed to better understand how cannabis affects the brain University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus The largest study yet into the effects of cannabis on the brains of 18 to 36-year-olds has found that the drug can reduce brain function during cognitive tests. The findings will help people to make an informed decision about the pros and cons of using cannabis. As more and more countries and states legalize the production and sale of cannabis for recreational and medical use, there’s an ongoing debate about how harmless it is, especially for young adults. Adolescence is a critical period for brain development, which continues until the mid-to-late 20s. There have been some small studies that looked at the impact of cannabis use on young people’s brain function, but a study led by researchers from the University of Colorado is the largest yet. “As cannabis use continues to grow globally, studying its effects on human health has become increasingly important,” said the study’s first author, Joshua Gowin PhD, assistant professor of radiology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine on the University’s Anschutz Medical Campus. “By doing so, we can provide a well-rounded understanding of both the benefits and risks of cannabis use, empowering people to make informed decisions and fully comprehend the potential consequences.” The researchers obtained data from 1,003 adults aged 22 to 36 that included magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, urine toxicology, and information about cannabis use. The participants’ mean age was 28.7 years, and 53.1% were female. The sample was predominantly White (76%) but included Asians (6.3%) and Black (13.7%) participants. To assess whether they’d used cannabis recently, participants provided a urine sample on the day they had their MRI scan, which was tested for the presence of a THC metabolite. If a participant’s urine test was positive, they were categorized as a recent user. Participants’ lifetime cannabis use was also assessed and categorized: heavy users had used 1,000 or more times during their lifetime, moderate users had used between 11 and 1,000 times, and non-users had used fewer than 10 times. MRIs measured brain activity while the participants undertook seven tasks designed to test emotion, reward, motor function, working memory, language, relational or logical reasoning, and theory of mind or social information processing. The researchers found that both recent and heavy lifetime cannabis use was associated with a statistically significant reduction in brain activity only during the working memory task. Joshua Gowin, PhD, said large, long-term studies are needed to better understand how cannabis affects the brain University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus “We applied the highest standards to our research, setting rigorous thresholds for statistical significance across all seven cognitive function tests,” Gowin said. “To minimize the risk of false positives, we employed false discovery rate (FDR) correction. While some of the other tasks indicated potential cognitive impairment, only the working memory task showed a statistically significant impact.” Working memory is the temporary retention of a limited amount of information that can be accessed to guide decision-making and behavior. Following directions, remembering a conversation while it’s going on, and following the steps of a recipe are all examples of working memory. They observed that the lower brain activity seen in heavy cannabis users during the memory task was most pronounced in specific areas of the brain: the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and anterior insula. Each region contributes to essential brain functions related to emotion, cognition, and social behavior. They often work together to process complex tasks and decisions. The researchers said that their findings suggest that, for those who used cannabis recently, abstaining before a cognition-heavy task may help with performance. However, for heavy users, abstaining brings with it other important considerations. “The association we observed between recent use and working memory task activation and performance suggests that abstaining from cannabis prior to cognitively demanding situations will likely help with performance,” said the researchers. “The exact duration of this period of abstinence is unclear, but studies suggest that residual cognitive effects of cannabis may remain for 2 to 4 weeks after abstinence. Furthermore, in heavy users, abstaining from cannabis may also lead to withdrawal symptoms, which may last for a week or more following cessation and could also affect performance.” The study has limitations. It was an uncontrolled, cross-sectional study, so the association seen between cannabis and brain function can’t be considered causal. And because the participants were young adults, the results can’t be generalized to other age groups. The researchers also lacked data on typical THC dose and potency, additional components such as cannabidiol (CBD), and how the cannabis was administered. “There are a lot of questions we still need answers to regarding how cannabis impacts the brain,” said Gowin. “Large, long-term studies are needed to understand whether cannabis use directly changes brain function, how long these effects last and the impact on different age groups.” The study was published in the journal JAMA Network Open.

My friends who really got into weed at that time were absolutely addicted to it, and some of them I do believe let it affect their reasoning ability, but it's hard to know what they'd have been like had they not been smoking their paychecks away. I regarded them as stupid at the time, but there were few instances where they weren't stoned, and a stoned person is often dumb as hell. In retrospect, one of them was (highly) likely schizophrenic but also intelligent, and would make shatter with his older brother who was definitely a deadbeat at the time, but they both came from the same conflict-laden upbringing, while another was clearly intellectually capable but raised to be emotionally volatile, and the rest were mostly just having fun and quit shortly after. I'm thankful I remained friends with them but didn't get heavily into it at that time, but it's much more difficult for me to frame the weed use as a causal factor in anything besides a sort of dampening of their hypothetical willingness to seek a better existence through other means. As South Park put it, weed lets you feel ok about doing nothing, and that's dangerous in aggregate. reply TZubiri 5 hours agoparentPersonal observation and common sense logic are often disregarded as 'unscientific', yet they are more powerful tools for learning about the world around us than sifting through hundreds of papers we are not trained to on scholar.google Weed make you dumb short term?

Weed works in opposition to that. It more likely makes the mind wander more, not less.

Otherwise though, why restrict people from being dumb? What's the opposite drug in the \"South Park,\" senae? I would say methylphenidate+LSD makes one, not in simultaneous use, more acutely aware of need to do things. LSD probably improves intelligence by increasing the fidelity of one's experience, which makes your subconscious dreams more capable of tying many dreams to a single place you have experienced, though childhood home is hard to beat. Made-up places and places one passed by but didn't feel with senses & are generic too much, DO NOT have as many edges in the directed causal graphs that are the associations through which our subconscious dreams switch from one to another, travelling on granular level one time every edge as we dream single time, \"repetitive\" dreams's loops actually also having subtle differences in betweenxt.

I’ve known enough heavy users long enough that I do believe there’s long term cognitive effects (whether directly or indirectly), but the specific effects and cohorts they were evaluating here gave me some pause. reply Perenti 15 hours agoparentI've consumed far more than my fair share of cannabis, starting at age 19. I'm also almost certainly ADHD (according to friend who's a psychiatrist, but says I'm untestable), and have a meaninglessly high IQ. I've noticed that amongst very slow people, more _seem_ to have started smoking dope at a very young age (9 to 12). The idea that pot could be very bad for adolescents in particular is not a new one. I certainly feel slowed down by it, although as the study says, it's working memory that's affected. I sometimes wonder what life would have been like if I'd met weed at say 30yo. Would the final stages of \"maturing\" have played out very differently? reply UniverseHacker 14 hours agorootparentI recommend getting evaluated for ADHD. Both drugs and non-drug management strategies can radically improve your quality of life. I don’t see how you can be “untestable.” There is no test they interview you and other people in your life to see if you have the symptoms or not. reply cambaceres 10 hours agorootparentLiving with attention challenges doesn't require a formal diagnosis to start implementing helpful strategies. I was diagnosed with ADHD ten years ago and while medication helped with focus issues, it came with significant side effects. Instead, I adopted these practices: Creating daily schedules Preparing essentials (clothes, lunch, gym gear) the night before Regular exercise Meditated daily Quitted weed Quitted porn Reducing screen time After a while I didn't need medication for my studies and later my work. I believe that if I had continued on medication I would still believe that it was something wrong with me, which I don't anymore. I'm just a person that functions well when there is structure in my life (which I had not learned in my youth), and that's not a disability. reply UniverseHacker 4 hours agorootparentThere have been huge advancements in specific life strategies for ADHD many of them organically from the community, but they aren’t the same things that work for people without ADHD to add structure and discipline they are adapted to require less executive control. You don’t need a professional diagnosis to try them but it helps you know what is more likely to actually work, and can be helpful for some people to take it more seriously and deeply investigate and try ADHD specific strategies. For me, the \"Hacking Your ADHD\" podcast has been life changing after trying a number of productivity advice books and not knowing why I couldn't get any to work, this podcast mentions ones that work for me. Moreover, while not everyone with ADHD does well on or needs medication, for a lot of people it is absolutely life changing... and people end up suffering needlessly for years because of preconceptions that prevent them from trying it. It’s worth trying and finding out. Personally, I think more people would benefit from the less used non stimulant medications and/or lower doses of milder stimulants most people that have bad side effects are taking heroic doses of amphetamines. I think a lot of doctors are just incompetent when they are starting people out like that. I do all of the things you listed above plus an extremely low dose of ritalin, and neither would work for me without the other. Structure, discipline, and habits are life changing for anyone but a lot of ADHD people try the regular advice for implementing them unsuccessfully for years. reply dns_snek 7 hours agorootparentprev> There is no test they interview you and other people in your life to see if you have the symptoms or not. This isn't universally true. Over here the evaluation lasts around 6 hours spread over 4 appointments with a specialist (a clinical psychologist) and consists of interviews, questionnaires, and a number of (stress) tests of your focus, impulsivity, and short term memory. reply fsckboy 12 hours agorootparentprevand the test is, try ritalin, if it helps you concentrate, it works. If not, no. reply dns_snek 8 hours agorootparentI'd think hard about the possible consequences of doing this. It could be challenging to explain if you're ever asked about it when undergoing official diagnosis, you might be forced to lie or risk being labeled a drug seeker. And I don't think looking out for whether it \"helps you concentrate\" is a valuable metric. Healthy people also abuse stimulants because it helps them concentrate. Perhaps a more valuable effect to pay attention to is whether it calms you down? This is a counter-intuitive effect common in people with ADHD. reply cambaceres 11 hours agorootparentprevAll people increase their ability to concentrate when on Ritalin. reply butterandguns 13 hours agorootparentprevHow do you think those final stages of maturing would have been different for you? I picked up weed in my mid 30s and now in my late 30s am a heavy user. Sometimes I take an edible and hack on a hard problem in the middle of the workday and it turns it into a fun challenge rather than a stressful endeavor. I think finding weed at this stage in my life has made me more introspective and certainly a better husband and person. I also quit drinking a few years ago and weed plus no alcohol has made my life immensely better. reply aurareturn 1 hour agorootparentWeed is better than alcohol. But I think you shouldn’t get too rosy with weed. There are a ton of negative things that come with it, including the potential to disassociate with society and long term memory loss. I’d recommend visiting r/leaves regularly. reply sudosysgen 13 hours agorootparentprevI suggest seeing a neuropsychiatric specialized in ADHD diagnosis, there are tests that can be used to diagnose ADHD no matter your IQ, by for example looking at impulse control you can be diagnosed with an IQ at the edge of testability, that is certainly past the meaninglessly high point. It's true that it's more difficult with a high IQ, but looking at impulse control tests, variations in subscores, IQ-like tests to detect invalid subscores, attention direction tests, as well as your personal habits and talking to people in your surroundings/who you grew up with, it's very much possible for a confident diagnosis to be made no matter the IQ. reply cambaceres 10 hours agoparentprev\"Self-medicating with cannabis\" is such a stupid idea since cannabis increase ADHD-symptoms. reply interludead 10 hours agoparentprevI had a friend who was self-medicating her anxiety and bipolar disorder (as I understand it, she only found out about the bipolar disorder some time after she quit smoking). She was pursuing a bachelor's degree at the time and was highly promising in her field, according to her supervisors. But after six months of use, all her academic achievements turned into failures. Plus, during depressive phases, cannabis sometimes made her feel even worse. In the end, after a year of smoking weed, she quit because she realized it was seriously affecting her brain and abilities. And that she could end up completely screwing up her life. reply aurareturn 1 hour agorootparentSeems like a common story and I’m glad she came into that realization without wasting a decade or more. reply mrkstu 16 hours agoparentprevmost classical ADHD people I’ve met were slightly/very above average IQ types regardless of their symptoms, so my instinct would be told be that the effect may be even more pronounced they’d probably have to do some controlling via something like looking at PSATs to get a before/after. reply viraptor 13 hours agorootparentThere are studies on that topic and no, IQ turns out just slightly lower than typical for ADHD.

I should also add the irony that at least according to some, weed was pushed for bannage at least in part because it was something migrant farmers would use to help get through the simple monotonous work in their day [0]. To that extent it's not that different from the folks I worked with in many industries that had notable yet not directly debilitating habits in the gacha/lootbox, nicotine in one form or another, gambling, adult entertainers, expensive weekend trips, or whatever else happened to hit their dopamine receptors the right way due to past stimuli. The bigger question is this; I've had colleagues that within a week of stopping work at a toxic place, stop drunk-dialing me at 2AM. Why aren't we asking that?

The amount of people I went through my teenaged and then university years with who adopted the stance of \"weed isn't a \"real\" drug and smoking every day for years on end doesn't make me an addict\" when it was clearly affecting their life negatively in a visible way was always baffling. The majority of them didn't start smoking weed to \"self medicate\", they started recreationally and just got to a point where they didn't WANT to function without it but would begin to associate the \"boring\" feeling of sobriety as something that needs to be treated. reply guywithahat 12 hours agorootparentI had a college friend who claimed it wasn't addictive, and then became addicted. Towards the end of freshman year he quit school for a couple weeks, just to determine he couldn't stop smoking and went right back. Last I spoke to him he was still trying to quit, and he had a new method of locking the weed in a box to limit his use. His withdrawals included him becoming extremely anxious, which is presumably why so many people think the weed helps with their anxiety. In 30 years we're going to look at weed like a slightly different version of cigarettes and wonder why anyone legalized it knowing what the consequences would be. reply t-3 2 hours agorootparentWeed isn't physically addictive. Forming habits is a very different thing though anything can become addictive if you train yourself to need it.

But it achieves this effect in a way that is superior to stimulants (don't get me wrong, I also adore coffee) in two clear ways: 1) it does not change the balance of imaginative vs. practical thinking (whereas stimulants tend to shift thinking toward the practical), and 2) it provides a much more comfortable and integrative afterglow, rather than a stimulant crash. reply heraldgeezer 13 hours agorootparentYou work while high?

But the article itself says: > The study has limitations. It was an uncontrolled, cross-sectional study, so the association seen between cannabis and brain function can’t be considered causal. So even this study doesn't say it's causal, and admits to many other limitations. I agree with your point about evidence and science though, but this is hardly a smoking gun that cannabis makes you dumber. reply bsder 16 hours agorootparentprevIt would be more shocking if cannabis didn't do this.

Sure, this is just a forum, and it's not like many folks are performing experiments with statistical analysis on this topic. I just think it's funny how the language that people using imply that they are so sure that their anecdote is the right one: \"This is such an obvious problem\", \"Your position is harmful\", \"Some of the smartest programmers I know\", etc. I mean, the whole reason statistics was invented was to actually bring rigor to observational analysis. At a previous company I worked at, the server from where we shared A/B test results was named, as an ironic joke, \"Obviously\". It was done to deliberately highlight the point that it was pretty easy to come to any conclusion (right or wrong) and use language like \"obviously\" to kind of imply that the experiment wasn't necessary. I think there were even some example where this kind of language was used to argue the exact opposite possible outcomes to highlight why statistical analysis is so important. reply ghfhghg 14 hours agorootparentYou do realize that the comments in replies quoting with counter anecdotes is specifically to point out that anecdotal evidence is just that and nothing more?

Not the article reply cwalv 15 hours agoparentprevI agree that short term memory loss being a side effect of heavy use is common knowledge to anyone who is or knows a heavy user. But I think you shouldn't be so confident that smoking when young is a huge problem long term. I would have been in the 'heavy user' category by the time I was 17, and I've had the odd experience of persistent short term memory loss (e.g., having multiple people tell me 'you just asked me that' with a bewildered look). I also quit smoking when I was 17, and haven't had any noticable symptoms since I was 20 (> 20 years ago). I doubt if anyone who knows me would say I'm not 'successful.'

With some generations of kids, you might be able to convince them that the people who want to keep them down... would be happy for them to become spaced-out stoners. With current kids, it really is true that many would be happy to keep kids down. (Look at the dumbing-down and manipulating behavior of many top tech and media companies.) But can you convince the kids of that? And, even if kids thought that the dumbing-down was real, and a tool of oppression and exploitation, would they feel motivated to fight back? And would they know how? Or is any youth rebellion and fighting instinct already in in some defeated, post mode, maybe counterintuitive to earlier generations.

So, as far as emotion, reward, motor function, language, relational or logical reasoning, and theory of mind or social information processing go no correlation between cannabis use and brain activity in those respects was found?

Cannabis came into the picture in my early 30s after years of pain management attempts following an SCI. Opiates and nerve pain meds like Lyrica somewhat dulled the pain but also dulled everything else, turning me into a near-zombie. Even at reduced doses, Lyrica messes with my thinking and lingers long after stopping. I honestly can not express strongly enough just how much high dosage, longer term drug based treatment of ongoing pain barely feels better than not managing it at all in terms of what it costs and it ultimately lead me to eventually cave and try medical cannabis. Cannabis hasn’t eliminated the pain or worked as directly as opiates, despite what some insist. But alongside a lower Lyrica dose, it’s helped me be a person again. The pain is still there, but instead of dominating my thoughts, I can compartmentalize it and actually function, without losing the majority of my cognitive abilities when taking it. I’m 100% slower than before the injury and its usage, but I am outputting more, of a higher quality than before I introduced it into the mix using more traditional pain management methods. It’s hard to explain to anyone who hasn’t lived with chronic pain the benefits it has brought me despite the downsides. And it does have downsides. Given the benefits it has brought me, and not knowing the lived experiences of others, I feel I am not in a position to say whether or not the downsides or the positives weigh each other out for any other individual. I imagine like most drugs, its probably depdendent on the individual and circumstances I suppose. reply tombert 16 hours agoprevI've never done any drugs outside of alcohol, and I didn't do that until I was 21 and I never really drank that much even when I did. I never smoked weed as a teenager because I had heard horror stories of people spiking illegal drugs with really horrible stuff. I have no idea if those stories were true, mostly likely they were exaggerated by law enforcement, but it worked to make me too much of a coward to try it. Because I never smoked weed, I've grown a borderline-irrational hatred of it. It always felt like when my friends in high school started getting into weed, they would become insufferable pseudo-intellectuals who thought they were very deep because they watched a few Carl Sagan or Alan Watts videos. I hated how stupid it made my friends and I hated how it seemed to ruin their ability to remember things. It's not clear how much of this is because of the weed, or just the fact that teenage boys are often just insufferable, by the way I remember it (which doesn't mean it's accurate) is that weed made all my friends in high school into pretentious morons. I'm kind of glad that I never got into it now.

But for most of us, my opinion is to avoid heavy use of any drug, including alcohol. Cannabis is more enjoyable and intellectually or creatively insightful with occasional use anyway, otherwise it's more haze than high.

      "A study by the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus indicates that cannabis use can impair brain function in young adults, particularly affecting working memory. The research, involving 1,003 participants and MRI scans, found that heavy and recent cannabis users exhibited reduced brain activity during memory tasks, impacting areas related to emotion, cognition, and social behavior. Published in JAMA Network Open, the study suggests abstaining from cannabis before cognitive tasks may enhance performance, but heavy users might face withdrawal symptoms, highlighting the need for further research on cannabis's long-term brain effects."

Jan 29th, 2025 7:00am by Darryl K. Taft Featured image via Unsplash+. When Jeaye Wilkerson started working on creating a new programming language about a decade ago, he sought to build a general-purpose programming language that embraced the interactive, value-oriented nature of Clojure as well as the desire for native compilation and minimal runtimes. That programming language, which he named jank, is now his primary pursuit. Wilkerson quit his job as a software engineer at Electronic Arts (EA) earlier this month to work on jank fulltime. jank aims to be a native Clojure dialect built on LLVM, combining elements from C++, Clojure, and Rust. The project has gained significant community interest, becoming what Wilkerson describes as the most popular unreleased Clojure project — with HumbleUI coming in as a close second. Where jank differs from Clojure JVM is that its host is C++ on top of an LLVM-based JIT, Wilkerson said. Started in 2015 The journey started in 2015 when he began exploring programming language design while working in game engine development. Wilkerson said he was influenced by multiple languages, but particularly Clojure and Rust. “Features like gradual typing (maybe linear typing), more explicit memory management, value-based errors, and stronger pattern matching, to name a few, improve upon Clojure,” Wilkerson wrote in a post about jank. “This will allow another axis of control, where some parts of the program can remain entirely dynamic and garbage collected while others are thoroughly controlled and better optimized.” Wilkerson said he has spoken with spoken with founders and tech leads of dozens of companies at various Clojure conferences and meet-ups, who are interested in using jank to solve performance, efficiency, usability, or interop problems with Clojure. TRENDING STORIES Building on Old Ideas Even with the dominance of languages like JavaScript and Python or the continued relevance of languages like Java and C/C#, innovation remains alive and well in the software development space where individuals like Andrew Kelley, who created the popular Zig programming language, are exploring new ideas around core computer science, Brad Shimmin, an analyst at Omdia, told The New Stack. “Interestingly, when you look at newer languages like jank, which was created by Jeaye Wilkerson sometime around 2016, you can see new technologies building upon much older ideas,” he said. “In the case of jank, we see the exploration of functional programming, built on top of one of the earliest programming languages, namely Lisp (well, Clojure, which is a dialect of Lisp). “With jank, we see some the combination of several developer-friendly capabilities like JIT compilation, garbage collection, dynamic typing, and REPL interactivity. For developers looking for a modern and portable functional programming language built on the undying beauty of linked parenthetical pairs, as in (+ 2 2) = 4, jank seems like a terrific pickup.” Roadmap Wilkerson wrote that this year, there’s a ton of work to do. Here are the top 10 items: Better error reporting Seamless C++ interop Whole-project AOT compilation Parity with the main Clojure core libraries nREPL server support Leiningen and deps.edn support Packaging and distribution of jank on major Linux distros and macOS Documentation Huge amounts of stability and robustness testing Outreach, support, and community development “I likely won’t be able to finish all of these in 2025, but I will get enough done on them to get jank released,” he wrote. Use Cases for jank Obviously, gaming is a key use case for jank, however there are others. Beyond gaming — fitting jank into Unreal, Unity, Godot as an interactive, JIT-compiled Lisp that can AOT [ahead-of-time] compile right alongside the rest of the game — jank can fit basically anywhere you currently see C++ and Lua, Wilkerson told The New Stack. “For example, GUI development, which is a historically weak area in the Clojure world, since jank will have seamless access to Qt, GTK+, wxWidgets, ImGui, etc.,” he said. Moreover, Wilkerson said he has been working with a few folks at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, known as CERN, who are considering how jank will fit into their data science setup. “They’re using C++ for most of their data science and have built some impressive tech to be able to JIT compile it. jank would be able to augment that by providing a full Lisp interactive workflow with REPL-based development,” Wilkerson told The New Stack. “jank is also a good fit for any Clojure devs who want a lighter runtime without sacrificing JIT compilation, as they would if they used a Graal native image, or if they want easy access to native libraries for whatever reason.” Unconventional Design Ultimately, Wilkerson said he built jank because it’s the tool he wants to use. “For me, being able to choose where on the spectrum I am for dynamism, at any time, is a superpower,” he said in an interview. “With jank, the idea is that part of your code can be dynamically typed, garbage collected, and have rapid fire iteration, while other parts can be locked down, using more explicit memory/ownership tracking, with static typing, all while using the same language. This is an unconventional design and isn’t targeted for beginners; it’s designed to fit how my brain works.” The Name ‘jank’ Wilkerson said the name “jank” came out of his effort to find something self-deprecating, á la Linus Torvalds‘ git. “It’s memorable, fun to say, and ruffles some feathers. What’s not to love?” he said jokingly “The goal is that jank ultimately hits the point of being so not-janky that the name becomes affectionate. Until then, it can be taken more literally.” What’s Next Wilkerson said despite the already long journey of jank to date, this is just the beginning. “In three years, we’ll have new game engines written in jank, jank written in existing game engines, GUI development, web services, jank support in all your favorite libraries, WASM builds, and serious performance to top it all,” he said.

    "commentBody": "From C++ to Clojure: Jank language promises best of both (thenewstack.io)229 points by Jeaye 21 hours agohidepastfavorite94 comments troad 19 hours agoI'm very excited for Jank, I wish the creator well. If I could make one tiny plea, it would be to focus on tooling too, and ensuring the experience for someone trying Jank out is as smooth as possible. Don't assume everyone is already set up with paredit and can fire off emacs chords without a thought. I suspect that Jank will be of particular interest to C++ programmers, many of whom are used to a very different dev paradigm. The Clojure community has done a great job at trying to smooth out the rough edges of Lisp tooling, and ensure there are on-ramps for newcomers (e.g. things like Calva for VS Code). I hope Jank keeps this up, because those first impressions really do matter. I'd hate to watch people bounce off Jank because they get stuck on trying to figure emacs out, or because they get frustrated trying to keep parentheses matched in Notepad. reply Jeaye 17 hours agoparentYou're absolutely right. To start with, I'm focusing on capturing and converting existing Clojure devs. However, there's a very large pool of C++ devs who could benefit from jank. As you said, jank not only needs to be ready for them, they need to be educated on lisps, functional programming, data-oriented programming, REPL-based interactive development, etc. It's not an easy learning curve right now, into Clojure. I aim to focus a good deal of time, post jank's launch, to create materials which enable this. Materials specifically targeted at OOP devs coming from the native space. reply vlovich123 5 hours agorootparentAs someone who might be in your target demographic in theory but not familiar with Clojure, what capabilities does Clojure itself offer as a language that a different mainstream scripting language doesn’t? For example, I’ve always thought that the interesting part of Erlang is Beam & the uninteresting part was a niche language. Beam with JS as the language is much more approachable & leverages a rich existing ecosystem of tooling & libraries. Indeed, if you look at it the right way Cloudflare Workers is exactly that; isolated virtual processes within a single OS process that communicate with each other using a message based IPC & if they crash just the microservice is taken down & transparently relaunched. So from that perspective, why Clojure instead of the same features on a different more popular language? reply ndr 4 hours agorootparentIt's hard to describe what immutable/persistent data structures do to your thinking. A lot of responsibilities move to the edges and you're left being able to think and tests pieces of code in isolation. The repl becomes usable, and you code from inside your running program. It's a steep step to get started but it's going to transform how you think about some problems. reply butterisgood 14 hours agorootparentprevI can imagine Jank being incredible “glue” to start until it takes over by osmosis. (For c++ of course) Maybe I should play some advent of code games with it to get comfy! reply roenxi 18 hours agoparentprevThis seems like an opportunity to plug the good work https://www.clojuriststogether.org/ do. They do good work. Plug concludes. Clojure like many languages seems to be benefiting a lot from the work the IDE people have been putting in to good infrastructure. A lot of the magic is being moved out of Emacs towards tools like Treesitter and the LSP server which are more platform independent. Not a huge amount to do with Clojure per say, but the Clojure ecosystem is benefiting a lot from it. The Emacs specific stuff is becoming very Emacs-specific (like paraedit, bless its socks). reply waffletower 2 hours agorootparentI am wary of LSP. I should try LSP again using eastwood, which probably has its trade-offs. While I absolutely admire Borkdude's many gifts to the Clojure community, the lack of static analysis in clj-kondo is a non-starter for me macro support is painfully manual. Because of its speed, clj-kondo likely is more performant in an editor LSP context, but too opinionated for me. reply diggan 5 hours agorootparentprevI think Clojure has benefit way more from nRepl and everything in that ecosystem, than LSP and that newfangled stuff, at least my personal setup relies on nRepl and doesn't even use LSP afaik. reply ab5tract 16 hours agoparentprevThe “use emacs” prerequisite that shows up frequently when exploring Lisps has been such a dealbreaker for me in the past. I have no patience for learning “chords” or even using a non-modal-but-still-not-just-normal-input editor simply to explore a language. My impression being that these chords morph depending on “modes” doesn’t help at all. At least with vim you can learn a piece at a time (sorry, not trying to revive last century’s favorite flame war, but it’s true). Also: no one has managed to explain to me what makes emacs so uniquely capable of interacting with a running interpreter, despite this usually being the USP I hear for “needing” emacs when attempting to Lisp. reply pritambaral 11 hours agorootparent> Also: no one has managed to explain to me what makes emacs so uniquely capable of interacting with a running interpreter, despite this usually being the USP I hear for “needing” emacs when attempting to Lisp. As an Emacs user that has to work in teams of non-Emacs users, the answer to this boils down to culture and ecosystem maturity. Purely technically, there's nothing that Emacs allows me to do with REPL Driven Development that _couldn't _ be done in another editor. Practically? I still haven't been able to even get (sufficiently) started with any editor. I often have to work on a Rails codebase that takes tens of seconds just to start. Dev cycles in the traditional Edit-Restart flow were so painful that I wished badly to burn this codebase down and rewrite it all in a language and style that supports a Lisp-style REPL. Then I discovered inf-ruby.el in Emacs. It allows me to just edit the code and reload only what's changed. It automatically inserts the correct `module Xyz; ...; end` etc. No more restarts. I showed it to my coworkers. They shared the pain with restarts. And yet, to this day, none of them have an equivalent to inf-ruby in their editors. inf-ruby.el is less than 1400 lines of code. It's easy enough to implement in Vim, IntelliJ, VS Code, anything really. But it exists only in Emacs, so far. Why? I'm sure because some Emacs user, once upon a time, wished similarly to have a more Lispy REPL for their Ruby dev work, and just built it. Because they were used to it, from having used Emacs or other Lisps with Emacs. Compare that to when I first tried to support Common Lisp development on VS Code. A language that already has full support for REPL Driven Development with an interactive debugger built-in. Nope, we aren't gonna use any of that, because in VS Code land, we use LSP. A model that really only works for languages that can be statically analyzed. You want Go To Definition on a method that's included from a module and called on a receiver that's a dynamic variable? Well, sucks to be you, I guess. So, while people make do with the severe limitations of Solargraph or Ruby-LSP, I use robe.el — which adds lisp style code intelligence by running inside your Ruby process — and get code intelligence that actually works with a language as dynamic as Ruby. Again, robe.el was just there for me to use. Again, there's nothing about Emacs that makes robe.el possible in Emacs but not in other editors. Again, there's no equivalent to it (that I've found) in the ecosystems of other editors. reply ab5tract 9 hours agorootparentThis is honestly fascinating stuff, so thank you for sharing! I wonder if it is an exposure issue: only those who use emacs know it is possible and those who know emacs have little incentive to leave their editor-OS. I guess I’ll have to dig into some of these examples you have shared and see if I can comprehend and/or relocate their magic. reply Jeaye 16 hours agorootparentprevAs the guy building jank, I agree with you about emacs, chords, etc. I'm a vimmer and I can tell you that Clojure is superb in Vim land (Conjure), VS Code land (Calva), Emacs land (??? some major mode), and IntelliJ land (Cursive). reply chii 12 hours agorootparentrealistically, it's the REPL, not the editor, that makes lisp what it is not just having a repl running, but to have your app be part of the repl, and you develop it bit by bit.

Since I’ve got you here, can I ask you for your thoughts on LispE and how it contrasts with jank’s approach? It seems clear that they both arrive from different lineages of the Lisp kingdom. LispE is also found dangling a few toes at depth within the icy waters of array programming. Perhaps the only connection between the two is that the one makes me think of the other. But if there’s more, though, I’d love to read about it. reply Jeaye 15 hours agorootparentThis is the first I've seen of LispE, so not a very informed opinion. Different lineages, for sure. Clojure really stands on its own in the lisp world and some die-hard lispers claim that it's not a lisp at all. However, for Clojure devs, I think we generally aren't interested in using the other lisps in practice, for building practical software. We just appreciate them for their lispiness. So the main difference will be that LispE is more like CL than like Clojure. Aside from that, LispE is interpreted, whereas jank is JIT compiled with full AOT compilation support, using LLVM. By using Clang/LLVM, jank also has full access to C++ interop, whereas most interpreted lisps are sandboxes on their own. I'm not familiar with this side of traditional lisps very much.

Ill be keeping an eye on jank for sure. reply pjmlp 11 hours agorootparentprevThe proper answer for Lisps should be use Allegro or LispWorks, which actually provide a full blown environment as Lisp environments of by gone eras. Does vim display inline graphics in a repl, with editing capabilities?

I just scoured the internet last week trying to find all the information I could on it. As a clojure(script) developer of 10 years, I still try and avoid anything JVM related. Not that I have anything against the JVM — but I never did any Java programming, and to really learn about the JVM you have to learn quite a bit about Java… which is just very low on my priority list. I have been dreaming about jank a little bit, so maybe this is a good place to ask the question, since I see the jank developer is reading the comments: would it be possible to write a module in jank that can be used in a Swift/iOS application (currently or in the future)? I assume so, but I’m not sure how accessible the outputs of jank are to other c libraries. The reason I ask is I have an offline clojurescript front end. If I want native mobile apps, that means I either have to duplicate the logic, figure out some JavaScript bridge, use react native, or use dart — none of which seem ideal. Ideally I could just extract the critical business logic into a few modules and generate the header files for swift, import directly into cljs for web, and use as regular clojure for android. Totally understandable if this isn’t a valid use case for jank, but it’s what’s captured my imagination :) reply Jeaye 25 minutes agoparentYes, definitely.

Once you used lexical scoping, you're not going back to dynamic scope either, the same goes for the ability to reason about \"where an object currently is\" lexicographically. I think Carp (https://github.com/carp-lang/Carp) is a much more interesting contender for a native clojure, simply because it has lexical ownership. reply widdershins 8 hours agoparentI'm not an expert in Clojure or Rust, but an interested outsider in both, so please don't take my question as a challenge but a genuine curiosity: Doesn't the focus on immutable data make most of the ownership stuff redundant? My understanding was that ownership lets you be sure that you're the only mutable owner of a resource, or otherwise that you share the resource immutably. If data is (almost) always immutable, which seems to be a founding principle of Clojure, then what does ownership/borrowing buy you? reply mrkeen 7 hours agorootparent> If data is (almost) always immutable, which seems to be a founding principle of Clojure Being immutable isn't some \"best-practice\" like eating your veggies, where the more you eat, the healthier you are, and occasional sugar is OK. I either can reuse the result of getFoo() or I can't. If getFoo() is 99% immutable as the caller, it's my job to consider taking locks and/or making defensive copies. If I want to publish library code that calls getFoo(), now my callers will need to consider taking locks and/or making defensive copies. Your question was about Rust ownership, and I answered about Haskell immutability but they're both the same in that they're pretty strict compiler rules, and you have to stray into unsafe territory to violate them. reply 2mlWQbCK 3 hours agorootparentI am not sure where \"almost\" came from. Data in Clojure is 100% immutable? You can pass around data between functions or between threads and never worry about anyone modifying it. I believe Clojure is less strict about I/O than what Haskell is(?), but once some data has been created it can not be modified. Any modification will return a new thing, never modify the original thing. Java interop breaks things of course, much like unsafe Rust breaks guarantees of that language. reply mrkeen 3 hours agorootparentGiven some Clojure function getFoo() which only calls into the Clojure std lib, and doesn't call any function with 'unsafe' (or similar) in the name, is it always true that: getFoo() = getFoo() reply 2mlWQbCK 2 hours agorootparentFunctions are not always pure, no. Clojure is not so strict about I/O, meaning that function could for instance call out to make a database request. But I think that is unrelated to immutability or ownership of data? Immutability guarantees if I call getFoo(x) I can trust that nothing happens to x (assuming x is proper Clojure data and not some unsafe other thing like a Java Object). And getFoo can likewise return anything without there being any risk that anyone else modifies that thing. It does not matter who owns x or who owns the return value from getFoo, since no one is able to modify those things anyway. * Database request was a bad example as, as far as I know, there is nothing built-in for supporting that, so that would already be in unsafe Java territory. But there are non-pure functions built into the Clojure standard library that getFoo could call to return different results on the same input, like slurp or deref, and probably many other ones (I have not used Clojure for a long time). reply j-pb 8 hours agorootparentprevI gave a long-ish answer to a sibling comment, that maybe sheds some light on that question, but I'll try to also give a concrete example where ownership complements immutability. (You best read that response first before continuing here.) You are right in that immutability or more precisely the persistence that copy-on-write brings somewhat solves many of the issues that ownership also solves. Persistence allows you to not care as much about who owns what, because whenever something is modified it is simply copied (with structural sharing), so you know that whatever you have is local anyways, not because you are the only one who has exclusive access to the thing, but because you make a copy of it at the point where answering that question would matter. But you miss out on two things from that: Performance: Those copies are cheap but not free. Borrowing complements _persistent_ immutability in that regard extremely well, because it allows you to check if you're currently the only one using something and modify it mutably in that case. Clojure has a concept called transients, where you create an intermediately mutable version of an immutable thing to perform batch updates, but you still have to manage that yourself, with ownership it happens magically behind the scenes. Exclusive types: The other comment I wrote contains an example of this. I have an `ExclusiveID` type in my Database that is similar to a `row_id`. I can recover a lot of the capabilities of transactions and software transactional memory from these, simply because a user can rely on `ExclusiveID`s existing only at a single point at a time in their code. And `ExclusiveID` itself is a completely immutable thing, but the \"contract\" on how it can be used is what makes it powerful. Immutability on a domain logic level also does not help you when it comes to dealing with inherently immutable things like devices and networks, whereas ownership does. So I would argue that those two concepts are complementing each other extremely well, both implementation wise, but also in terms of a the mental model of how your code works. reply Jeaye 11 hours agoparentprevCool, dude! I also dig Rust. Carp is a very neat project, though it's not a Clojure. It's just Clojure-like. jank is Clojure. reply j-pb 7 hours agorootparentThis wasn't meant as a jab at Clojure (or Jank for that matter). That language and its ecosystem has heavily shaped and influenced me early on in my career to the point where I'm essentially writing Datascript in Rust (https://trible.space). My point was that ownership has become a language feature that I expect, like lexical scope has become a language feature that most people expect. It complements persistent immutable data-structures extremely well, especially in terms of performance via automatic transient-ication, and if you're operating in the native space I can't imagine that performance isn't on top of the list. So in that sense, great language, please consider evolving beyond Clojure (archaic?) ownership model, because I'm pretty tired of Rusts bloated syntax and lovecraftian macro system. reply Guthur 11 hours agoparentprev [–] I think if you're overly using dynamic scoping in clojure you are probably doing it very wrong. I used clojure professionally for a number of years and I can't remember ever really using it. reply mrkeen 10 hours agorootparent [–] Parent's not talking about dynamic scoping in clojure. It's a comparison to designed to elicit a reaction, e.g. \"probably doing it very wrong\". I.e. if you're not tracking ownership in new-lang, you're probably doing it very wrong. reply j-pb 8 hours agorootparent [–] It's not a comparison to bash non-ownership as \"very wrong\", but arguing that lexical scope and ownership are literally the equivalent things. Lexical scope allows you to reason about scope on a syntactical level. Take this code: let x = 5; fn foo(): return x \\* 2 fn bar(): let x = 10 return foo() fn baz(): let x = \"hello world!\" return foo() bar() With lexical scope, you can look at `foo` and you know immediately what it returns, the behaviour of the function is completely local to it and is a syntactical property of the program. With lexical scope you just don't know what's returned, for all you know x might not even be a number, but could be any type that just happens to be brought into scope. Ownership is similar, in that you make the existence of a value a local property. If a 'thing' is inside a variable then you can move it somewhere else, but it also means that it is no longer in that variable. And that tracking of where what is, is a syntactical property, just like with lexical scope. Clojure has software transactional memory. With ownership it wouldn't need half of the machinery (only that for rollback): let blocked_accounts = Set() let account_bob = new ExclusiveBankAccount(200) let account_alice = new ExclusiveBankAccount(600) // ExclusiveBankAccount cannot be copied or cloned fn transfer(source_acc, target_acc, ammount): if source_acc.deduce(amount.copy()): target_acc.deposit(amount.copy()) fn block(acc): let acc_identifier = acc.identifier.copy() // identifiers can be copied and are not exclusive blocked_accounts.put(acc) return acc_identifier fn unblock(acc): return blocked_accounts.take(acc) fn do_invalid_stuff(): let good_account = new ExclusiveBankAccount(200) let bad_account = new ExclusiveBankAccount(200) block(bad_account) transfer(bad_account, good_account) //that you can check out accounts from. reply vlovich123 4 hours agorootparentprev> This can only be determined syntactically if you and the compiler agree to stay on a single thread, right? No. This will fail because in block the ownership of bad_account is lost. You’d need block(&bad_account) or block(&mut bad_account) to pass a reference while letting the transfer succeed. The only way the transfer would succeed silently like that is if Account implemented Copy (the compiler would automatically inject block(bad_account.clone())). This has nothing to do with threading (which Rust would still have protection mechanisms for). It would work identically if the block and transfer were member methods (i.e. bad_account.block(); good_account.transfer_from(bad_account)) since even member methods can be declared to be requiring ownership. reply mrkeen 2 hours agorootparent> This has nothing to do with threading Right, but all the promises of the type system have to lead to a first-class multi-threading experience at some point. The safest concurrent program isn't a single-threaded program. reply vlovich123 2 hours agorootparentIt doesn’t automatically solve every possible problem for you just like something like Lean doesn’t prevent you from writing buggy proofs.

Is there a language that in your opinion offers a better multi-threading experience? reply Guthur 6 hours agorootparentprev [–] Sorry it's probably just me but there is nothing syntactically obvious about ownership to me in the example you gave other than the names you gave things. reply j-pb 4 hours agorootparent [–] It all boils down to forbidding this: let x = 5 do_something_with(x) do_something_with(x) // < boom compiler error you simply cannot use the same variable twice, because you lost ownership of the value it stores on the first call. But that's a bit cumbersome, so people add an operator that allows you to derive a new value from a variable without taking the old one. Let's call that one `&`. It takes a variable that would normally only have been allowed to be used once (because using it removes the value from it), and returns a \"thing\" that borrows the contents of the variable out, and behaves a lot like the original thing, but not quite. let x = 5 do_something_with(&x) do_something_with(&x) And because those derived things can be tracked and only used once just like the original object we can make sure that no two things can derive such borrowed things at the same time in a way that is mutating the original thing. Let's call the operator that only allows one mutable borrow to exist at a time `&mut`. The ability to track that only one of these can exist at any given moment for any value is based not on some special properties of \"borrows\" or \"references\", but because of the ability to uniquely track ANY value. reply Consider applying for YC's Spring batch!

I 'member seeing this video originally on MTV at like 3AM. Instantly captivated. I'm a huge fan to this day, but there's something uniquely special about all the Phase 1 stuff: the album, the B-sides (or “G” Sides lol), the explorable Flash Kong Studios site, the DVD, Jamie Hewlett's art†, the fact that the eponymous album as originally released is 55:55 (iykyk) There's also a track on Deltron 3030 (an album I liked a lot more when it was new than I do now) which I have tagged as “feat. 2-D” instead of “feat. Damon Albarn” because come on :p https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxd_eDTbBMQ It's also kinda funny that 2D's entire existence is just a stupid pun on Robert Del (lol) Naja a.k.a. “3D” (a.k.a.

It's a documentary actually. reply kennyadam 7 hours agorootparentI haven't, but it looks interesting so I'm grabbing a copy now :) Thank5555 reply Lammy 2 hours agorootparentEnjoy! Make sure it's a rip of the 2014 Blu-ray. I saw it in theaters in December and the “4K” remaster was totally butchered by running it through a sloppy AI-upscaling filter. Upscaling can be done well, but this is some of the worst I've seen in a while with outlines of objects & people shifting and wobbling from frame to frame even within a single scene. It was worth seeing for the theater-sound experience but looked awful lol And please keep in mind that when I say it's a documentary I mean that in an allegorical sense, not that I believe there is literally a mirrored world of blue humans which we could travel to if only we had the technology. I see it as a depiction of an alternate way of being that Humanity could know if left to our natural predisposition toward Love and Oneness. I see it as disclosure from Daft Punk about what happened to them after Discovery got so huge. It depicts the media industry as one tentacle of an inhuman system of control which lives forever by finding talented people whose work might lead others toward Oneness, pumping and dumping them, owning their work, and moving on to the next fad while the artists burn out to their coping method of choice (many depictions I won't spoil). Scenes toward the end (sorry if vague — no spoilers!) do a great job depicting the actual “big bad” as an idea, a concept which only appears to take human form in rich and privileged people due to those people's own trauma but is actually something that's passed down to them. Some people would use the term “archon” but I tend not to because there are too many competing definitions. You'll notice how Crescendolls in their home “world” have no record label, no manager, no grueling tour schedule, no snooty award shows, no record stores — they just are, and it's a big party, and everyone is too busy having a good time and loving each other to notice the intruders who come to take ownership of them. reply zeven7 16 hours agorootparentprevI cannot parse this response reply glenngillen 12 hours agorootparentMe either.

Why do you like it less now? Is there a controversy around it or him? reply Lammy 13 hours agorootparentNah nothing like that. I still listen to it pretty often in fact. I feel like Deltron says what it wants to say, and I enjoy what it wants to say, but it never tells me anything new. I still find new interpretations in all of the Gorillaz albums in a way that keeps them fresher even though I have listened them all to death, especially eponymous and Plastic Beach. Gorillaz songs do a great job of saying a bunch of different things all layered together, like literally about the fictional band and simultaneously allegorically about capital-H Humanity and our collective perpetuity, the mortal coil, the [G]reat Work, whatever you want to call it. They're all super coded once you're willing to stop caring about the opinions of people who think it's weird/cringe to think about that kind of stuff. “Fire Coming Out of the Monkey’s Head” is a great example of one I only recently feel like I “get” even though I've been listening to it for twenty years. Like, why Monkey? Just because Gorillaz, or have I looked in a mirror recently? Why a mountain? What shape are those, and where else have I encountered that shape? Without the truth of the eyes, I was blind. Probably still am to a lot of it :) Or “Saturnz Barz” where the title is about bars in a musical sense but also bars as in jail (hint: you're in it — we all are.

We've been doing something a lot like this for as long as I can remember. Back in the 1990s if there were any big unused copper areas on your PCB you'd mask them to save on etching acid a gallon of acid would have a lifetime measured in square inches of copper removed, and the less copper you removed, the longer your acid would last. Meanwhile, a lot of DIY etching processes were very basic. Sure, you could get translucent acid and a transparent bath and heat it to a controlled temperature and run bubbles through it and so on. But if you were on a budget, some room temperature ferric chloride in an old ice cream container would get the job done. And getting the etch resist onto the board? You could draw it by hand with special pens, use transfers, there were special printer toner transfer papers, or you could DIY UV photoresist using printable projector transparencies and the sun as your UV source. This was not a super-scientific, tightly controlled process. If you had narrow traces and narrow gaps on one part of your PCB, and large areas of copper to remove on another? Well, if you left it in the acid long enough to remove that large area, could be the narrow traces get etched away too. So masking off any large areas meant all the copper getting etched was about the same width thus compensating for the poorly controlled etching process. Of course, these days professional PCB manufacturing is orders of magnitude cheaper than it used to be. When you send your design to pcbway or jlcpcb they have much tighter control over the process, so you no longer have to worry about this stuff. reply aylons 2 hours agoparentWell, you may not have to worry, but if you have large unpoured areas on a design with a professional PCB manufacturer (of the traditional, high-touch kind), they will ask if you want to pour some copper there. Reason being that it makes the process faster, more consistent and reduce possible side-etching on lanes. It may not a make a difference in most cases, but you may just save some time and effort by doing this. reply iancmceachern 2 hours agorootparentThe reason is that the copper is already there, it gets etched away. So it actually costs more to not have copper than to have it. reply tverbeure 1 hour agoprevOne of my all time favorite videos (one of the few that I rewatch once per year) is \"The Extreme Importance of PC Board Stack-Up with Rick Hartley\". It's fantastic. https://resources.altium.com/p/the-extreme-importance-of-pc-... reply cushychicken 53 minutes agoparentHartley is awesome. Plus one for that. reply exmadscientist 12 hours agoprevGrumble grumble. Professional here, and I really do not like this article. There are a lot of things getting mixed up here: ground planes for EMC, ground planes for electrical performance, ground planes for DFM/etching, and ground planes as \"fashion\". First off, let's just say that meeting radiated EMC (\"47 CFR Part 15\" according to the article, equivalent to CISPR 22/32 in Europe) is a bloody good idea. Yes, the testing labs are \"a bit of a racket\". But does anyone else remember the days when turning on the vacuum cleaner would knock out the TV? That wasn't great. And we have a whole lot more electronics in the world today. A world without Part 15/CISPR is an ugly world indeed. Four-layer boards are cheap. Really cheap. They may be double the cost, but you're doubling pennies here. In fact, just checking in with one common low-volume supplier, they're not doubling: the price for 200mm × 100mm boards with good specs goes from $9.34 each in quantity 10 to... $10.59. For prototypes, that's basically a rounding error. Perhaps even literally a rounding error. So don't complain about the cost of four-layer boards anymore, it isn't 2004. Internal ground fill layers are what people usually mean when talking about \"ground planes\". They have three key properties: 1. They are very easy to do and are very tolerant of mistakes. You don't have to calculate return current paths, you don't have to size and locate return current traces, you don't have to gum up your routing. You just dedicate the layer and it works, and it keeps working if you have to make changes later. 2. They help shield internal layers further down in the stack from radiating. This is usually minor, but for nasty digital stuff or high-power electronics, can be useful. 3. They develop inter-plane capacitance with nearby power layers, if inter-layer dielectrics are small. This is critical to maintaining power distribution network performance at high frequencies (>100s of MHz). This stuff is very, very important to make high-speed digital logic work well. Of course, it's only one link in the chain (GHz stuff gets handled on-package or even on-die;JLC never added the pour for me. Not even for larger boards. Not sure this is up to date. It seems to depend on the design how close you are to the design limits and how much copper is exposed on the outer layers. A message someone got from JLC for an open source project recently: > When the copper pour is less than 30% of board area, we suggest to keep at least 0.15mm trace spacing. > Or the dry film debris might have chance make short circuit, it will make quality control more difficult reply cillian64 9 hours agorootparentprevThat article says that they only add copper in the handling/bridging parts of the panel, not to the actual finished PCB. reply thenthenthen 10 hours agoparentprevSame goes for milling a pcb! reply kazinator 12 hours agoprevOne reason for copper pours in a DIY hobby context is that copper pours vastly reduce how much copper has to be etched away. This requires less chemical like ferric chloride and less time. You are making a capacitor, though, when you do that. reply roland35 4 hours agoprevThere are a few other benefit to copper fills as well it makes routing power much easier, it separates analog and digital regions of a PCB, and it helps with heat dissipation. I do agree that just because you have a fill, that doesn't mean it is necessarily doing much help. You need to be careful that it isn't too broken up. reply yujzgzc 9 hours agoprevAll I know is that it makes it very hard to solder anything to ground with my cheap underpowered soldering iron reply mikeInAlaska 32 minutes agoparentI switched away from full solid copper floods due to this.

Requires macOS 10.12 or newer. Requires 32-bit Windows. Requires 64-bit Windows. For other platforms see all downloads. Download Download Download Pay once, own forever! Instant license delivery. Use on all your computers. $19.99 Buy What if we say it's not like the others? Airflow is different We're not cutting any corners. This is not yet another FFmpeg wrapper like you might have seen elsewhere. Don't get us wrong, we love FFmpeg and use many of its parts under the hood, but our custom built video processing pipeline goes way beyond wrapping FFmpeg and calling it a day. We've been working on it for years it and it lets us do things that other similar software simply can't It's a bold claim for sure, so here are just a few examples: AirPlay HEVC videos to Apple TV without transcoding Streaming to AirPlay 2 enabled TVs Adaptive audio volume, spatial headphone downmix Lossless audio transcoding when streaming to Apple TV (FLAC codec, requires tvOS 14) High quality audio transcoding when streaming to Chromecast (Opus codec) OCR (text recognition) for DVD/Bluray/Vobsub subtitles . ...with a very particular set of skills... Airflow is a razor sharp focused software. It supports specific set of devices and it will pull every trick in the book to get the best possible results on these devices. It may not stream video to your smart fridge, but it will gladly push your Chromecast, Apple TV and AirPlay 2 TVs to their limits. And yes, Airflow can handle pretty much any video format and codec you throw at it. Pixels, pixels everywhere! Airflow can stream full 4K HDR HEVC files to Chromecast Ultra, Built-in, Apple TV 4K and AirPlay 2 enabled TVs. It will go out of its way not to touch the original video stream unless absolutely needed for compatibility reasons, ensuring best possible video quality with lowest CPU load (your computer fans will thank you). As far as we can tell, Airflow is still the only desktop software that can natively stream HEVC videos to Apple TV and AirPlay 2 TVs. And for those pesky videos that are incompatible with your device Airflow will handle that tranparently, with hardware accelerated transcoding if your computer supports it. Audio pipeline that goes to eleven Full multichannel support including DD+ passthrough with Dolby Atmos? Of course. Advanced adaptive volume booster + limiter for late night watching when you don't want to disturb your neighbours with loud scenes but still want to hear the dialogue clearly? Check. Spatial headphone downmix for surround sound videos? Also check. Detailed A/V sync adjustment where you can compensate for the delay of individual devices like bluetooth headphones? Airflow has it. And subtitle support to match it For both embedded and external subtitles. It's a bit of a secret that pretty much every other streaming software needs to extract embedded subtitle tracks before playing the video. That involves reading the entire file upfront! Crazy, right? Airflow needs no such crude tricks. Embedded or external, for our playback pipeline it's all the same. All widely used subtitle formats are supported, now including vobsub. Integrated opensubtitles.org search is a cherry on top. ...with real time text recognition Some subtitles (DVD, Vobsub, Bluray) are stored as pictures. This means that the only way to render them when streaming is to burn them in the video. That's inconvenient to say the least. It massively increases CPU load (think fan noise and heat) and it's completely infeasible to do for 4K videos. Enter our new realtime subtitle text recognition (OCR). During playback Airflow will transparently extract the text from picture subtitles and render it on target device just like it would with regular text subtitles. We'll be in bigger trouble if the thief has it. But wait, there's more! The \"small\" things, like the scrubbing preview, beautiful polished user interface, multiple playlists support, meticulous last position tracking, or the integrated Speed Test for Chromecast, which is invaluable when dealing with network connection issues. The list goes on. Did we mention the remote control companion app for Android and iPhone? No? Well, it's pretty cool. It lets you control all Airflow features from the comfort of your couch.

    "commentBody": "Airflow – Stream media files directly from macOS to AirPlay devices (airflow.app)188 points by tiagod 23 hours agohidepastfavorite70 comments danpalmer 20 hours agoAirflow is by far the fastest and most reliable AirPlay implementation I've seen. It's lightning fast. Truly excellent. The app is also super fast for things like video scrubbing. I wish the app was a more native feeling UI, and I feel they could be doing deeper integration to enable more video playing. I'm a little worried that the app is out of development, but hoping they keep it going for new versions of macOS and AirPlay. reply whazor 10 hours agoparentI concur, in particular, being able to quickly scrub a 54GB 4K HDR video and see it flash by on the television is insane. It also works fast on ChromeCasts. reply tiagod 17 hours agoparentprevI use it with an LG TV (WebOS) and while it had some trouble in the past, it now works pretty well. Sometimes I need to disconnect&reconnect to the TV if I paused for too long and/or left my laptop sleep, but mostly just works. The way it turns 5.1 audio into stereo (optionally boosting dialogue) is also quite good for some shows, I wish something as good was available in other players. I don't think it's out of development. I thought of posting this specifically because I got an update banner when I opened it. reply mrtesthah 20 hours agoparentprev>I'm a little worried that the app is out of development Why? The last app release was Jan 3rd 2025, so about 3 weeks ago. But even if it was older, once an app fulfills is purpose and is free of bugs and security holes, does it still need to be updated constantly? reply unsupp0rted 4 hours agorootparentI wouldn't have known that because their \"check for updates\" function doeesn't seem to work, even when triggered manually. I'm on 3.3.6, which is just a couple point versions behind latest. I've been a happy paid AirFlow user for about a decade now, but I realize it's small indie sometimes buggy software. reply danpalmer 15 hours agorootparentprevThat's good, I hadn't seen that update! I've been using the app for 5+ years and it doesn't appear to have changed its feature set or UI in that time. My main concern is OS updates and AirPlay protocol changes breaking it, which would mean that it would no longer fulfil its purpose. AirPlay, being a proprietary protocol, is ripe for breaking third party integrations. reply formerphotoj 1 hour agorootparentJust a side note: I hoped AirPlay was stable after so many years, but everyone may already know that AirPlay 2 is a change that at least in my use case, made all my old Macs running older macOS and AirPlay 1 incompatible with newer third party hardware and hardware that updated firmware to AirPlay 2. Yes, I'm talking about iTunes! At least all my Airport Expresses still work fine! lol reply latexr 8 hours agorootparentprev> My main concern is OS updates and AirPlay protocol changes breaking it Then you can safely ignore your other concern: > doesn't appear to have changed its feature set or UI Those things aren’t related, you don’t need to change the UI or features to maintain core functionality. reply Y-bar 16 hours agorootparentprev> But even if it was older, once an app fulfills is purpose and is free of bugs and security holes, does it still need to be updated constantly?

In this case Apache Airflow. The two products serve a totally different purpose. I guess for marketing it would be better to have a unique name. reply ianburrell 14 hours agoparentI think we should start putting the creator name in front of the app name. This seems to be by Bitcave company so it would be Bitcave Airflow vs Apache Airflow.

Looking at their website it seems to be a dead product. reply NeutralCrane 5 hours agorootparentApache Airflow is extremely popular and one of the most commonly used frameworks in data engineering. I guarantee you it is more popular than this Airflow by an order of magnitude or more. reply mastazi 17 hours agorootparentprevI guess that Apache Airflow is more popular than the one linked by OP.

(or does it not work for other airplay devices or is too slow or something). reply crazygringo 5 hours agoparentCorrect me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure that casting your screen re-encodes the screen image in much lower quality. Whereas Airflow is sending the original video steam over untouched, for supported codecs like h.264/265. So it maintains the original quality. Including resolutions that may be higher than your screen, like 4K. reply al_borland 2 hours agorootparentUsing the screen over AirPlay is the wrong way to go for watching video, for several reasons. That said, QuickTime Player also supports AirPlay to cast the video to an AirPlay device. I’m struggling to understand why I’d use AirFlow when I can use QuickTime? In my case I use Plex, which even makes QuickTime a moot point. I’ve also used VLC with the VLC AppleTV app; I could see where AirFlow could be an improvement over the rather clunky VLC experience (from what I remember). reply crazygringo 1 hour agorootparentQuickTime only plays h.264/265 videos encoded in very specific ways, and a very limited set of other codecs. Most h.264/265 files in the wild, QuickTime won't play. You have to repackage them with a couple of specific flags using ffmpeg. QuickTime is great for playing videos produced by Apple devices, but terrible at playing media generally. reply spondylosaurus 10 hours agoparentprevLongtime (and satisfied) Airflow user, albeit casting from Windows to an Android TV: it's the only casting tool I've used that plays nice with subtitles. VLC lets you cast to a TV quite easily, but any subtitle data won't survive the jump. reply alex7o 11 hours agoparentprevYou cast the screen only in 1080p, but media can be cast up to 4k hdr+ reply yungporko 9 hours agoparentprevscreencasting over airplay sucks for watching stuff, the framerate is just slightly too choppy that its noticeable and annoying, you cant close the lid on your laptop, and you can't easily use it while casting because either you're screen mirroring anyway or your screen has been stretched weirdly because macbooks have their own weird aspect ratio which don't match any TVs. reply c-hendricks 3 hours agorootparent> your screen has been stretched weirdly because macbooks have their own weird aspect ratio which don't match any TVs. When you cast your screen to an Apple TV, the TV shows as an extra display on the computer, and allows you to set the aspect ratio however you'd like. Either when extending or mirroring. https://imgur.com/a/c3mKbOj Am I missing something? reply Mindwipe 10 hours agoparentprevMacOS does have the functionality built in, it just barely works. It also starts with no errors if it comes across a codec it doesn't like (which is most of them) but then just... doesn't work. Airplay is a big pile of technical debt and they keep rewiring it every few years and not testing if the implementations talk to each other, so it just gets worse and worse. reply lugao 16 hours agoprevReally solid program.

I'm happy to answer questions if anyone has any. reply igor47 10 hours agoparentHow does this compare to retool? I've been using that to build UIs directly on top of Postgres, and it's been nice to be able to design the screens a little; eg inserting new rows linked to a currently selected row by primary key. Curious if you're targeting primarily a spreadsheet-like view, or if the interface can be customized. How does the spreadsheet view work across multiple linked table? Can you present the tabular info in non tabular ways (e.g. a row details or editor view) reply kgodey 9 hours agorootparentWe don't have any ability to customize UIs yet, although we're certainly open to feature requests. We do have a \"Record Page\" for each individual record that shows a tabular view of related records from other tables, here's a screenshot from our website: https://mathesar.org/_app/immutable/assets/step-2.CKT9S1j0.a... you can create new linked records directly there. As for working with multiple linked tables, while editing data, you can search through nested links easily, here's an screenshot illustrating the record selector: https://mathesar.org/_app/immutable/assets/step-3.SKu3rwM2.a...

That poped up on HN too a few weeks ago. reply zackdotcat 8 minutes agorootparentI'm not OP but from my experience with both tools there are some main differences within the products: 1. Mathesar includes a lot of cool UI elements for CRUD operations on tables, schemas, and columns. Outerbase doesn't have any UI for this, but only a SQL editor. 2. Mathesar has a lot of support for \"relationships\" (more accurately described as references in Postgres, but I digress) that Outerbase does not. For example, if you're inserting a foreign key column into Outerbase you have to manually type the value of the column you're referencing. In Mathesar, you'll see a dropdown of all the \"related\" rows and be able to search through their columns to find the record you need. 3. Mathesar is postgres-exclusive, while Outerbase works with many other DB providers. And more in terms of governance and usage: 1. Outerbase is paid, with a very restrictive free tier. The option to self host is only available to enterprise customers. 2. Mathesar is entirely free and self-hosted. reply potamic 12 hours agoparentprevYour website says you're a non-profit.

I do like using this tool on local pgdump. reply kgodey 9 hours agorootparentYeah, I understand why that would be a concern. For what it's worth, our schemas are completely isolated and never touch any other data. We use them to store our DB functions and custom data types. The functions are what lets us reflect the latest DB state in the UI in real-time without worrying about schema migrations or adding a bunch of reflection queries to each API call (which would make the UI much less responsive). We just need them installed _somewhere_ in the database. Our custom data types (e.g. email, URL) are just available for convenience. If you don't have any columns that use those types, then you'll never need to deal with them. reply amarant 14 hours agoparentprevHow do you differentiate from, say, dbeaver, or any similar database management software? What's the main reason to get Mathesar instead of DBeaver? reply sixdimensional 13 hours agorootparentI'm not related to the author or developers, but this appears almost like an Airtable-like (or Nocodb) UI on top of postgres, so it's really quite a different experience than a full database manager tool/IDE like DBeaver or DataGrip. I love it personally and it looks pretty good so far. Also, amazing that the team started it as an open source project under a 501c3 nonprofit as well. Having a more \"spreadsheet\" (or I would say, MS Access-like) UI is quite cool for certain use cases (e.g. low/no-code but backed by the full power of regular old Postgres). Can allow pretty agile development, although it can get out of control if not managed with care... but nice to see the access controls/permissions there to help a bit. All interesting choices, looks cool! reply Imustaskforhelp 10 hours agorootparentYes this definitely feels like MS access but open source and based on postgres which is awesome! reply kgodey 12 hours agorootparentprevsixdimensional covered this pretty well, but just to reiterate, I believe DBeaver is primarily a desktop app aimed at a technical audience. Mathesar is web-based and designed to have an intuitive, collaborative, spreadsheet-like UI for non-technical users who know anything about SQL or DB concepts. Also, Mathesar has deep integration with Postgres features e.g. you can configure roles and privileges through the UI. reply zokier 7 hours agorootparentWhat about tools like LibreOffice Base and KDEs Kexi? reply anonym29 2 hours agorootparentFar too technical for the target audience, who has never heard of a \"linux\" and doesn't care about cost, software freedom, the petite tyranny happily imposed by corporations, etc, they just want it to \"just work\" on their smartphone browser. reply thomasfromcdnjs 13 hours agorootparentprevI'd be more curious about how it differs to Metabase? reply kgodey 13 hours agorootparentMetabase is a BI tool focused on querying, reporting, and visualization, but it’s read-only. Mathesar is closer to Airtable, you get a spreadsheet-like UI, you can view and query data like Metabase, but you can also add and edit data or even modify the data model (if the permissions allow it). Unlike Metabase, Mathesar also lets you create a database from scratch rather than just connecting to an existing one. Metabase adds an abstraction layer with concepts like questions, segments, and metrics, while Mathesar works directly with Postgres tables, schemas, and permissions. Mathesar is deeply integrated with Postgres, so it supports Postgres-native features like role and privilege based access control, which aren’t possible in products designed for multiple database backends. I hope that helps! reply Galatians4_16 11 hours agoparentprevAh. Thermians, from the Klaatu Nebula. Or was it Dalmations? reply kgodey 11 hours agorootparentI think it was termites. But they built a huge spaceship. reply dugite-code 10 hours agoprevIt's a great looking interface but I have the same gripe with the tagline that I have with Grist's. It's really not spreadsheet like is it? You just don't have the row and column manipulation possibilites that defines a spreadsheet vs a table. reply kgodey 8 hours agoparentThank you! And yeah, I understand your gripe. The tagline is meant to convey the general idea of \"editing data in a table UI without a lot of clicks or keystrokes\" in the fewest number in words; it does sacrifice precision (although that's why it's \"spreadsheet-like\" and not just \"spreadsheet\"). Do you have any ideas for language we could use instead? reply akrauss 13 hours agoprevI can see this being very useful for many admin interfaces where some basic data must be managed by domain experts and UX and is not a priority. Many enterprise applications have such parts. I wonder what the GPLv3 licensing means for such scenarios: Could people run Mathesar one microservice in an ensemble with proprietary services? Companies who don‘t want to open source their whole product might still be willing to upstream their fixes and improvements to the Mathesar component. reply kgodey 12 hours agoparentYep, Mathesar is GPLv3, not AGPL, so there’s no issue running it alongside proprietary services. Companies can absolutely use Mathesar as a standalone service in their stack without open-sourcing their other components. Another example of this is WordPress, which is also GPL, and has a thriving hosting ecosystem. GPLv3 only applies if you modify and distribute Mathesar itself, it doesn’t extend to services that simply interact with it. If a company makes changes to Mathesar and distributes that modified version, then those modifications would need to be open-sourced under GPLv3. But using Mathesar as a microservice in an enterprise stack? No problem. We’d love to see companies upstream fixes and improvements, of course! reply red_trumpet 4 hours agorootparentDoes AGPL have trouble running alongside proprietary services? I always thought AGPL means that if you host the software, you have to make any changes you did available to the users. So if you host it without changes, there is no problem? reply gcanyon 6 hours agoprevDoes anyone know if there's something similar for mysql? reply breadwinner 3 hours agoparentYes, you can try Visual DB: https://visualdb.com reply insert_nick 13 hours agoprevAny chance it’s going to support PostGIS, with a map to show geometry data? reply kgodey 13 hours agoparentThis is one of the things we're actively considering working on soon!

The permissions bit looks nice. It's nice to see a project that isn't reinventing the wheel. Is there a SQL editor? I don't see anything about one in the docs but that would be a bit of a dealbreaker for me. reply kgodey 15 hours agoparentThanks! We do not have a SQL editor in the UI yet, but it's one of the things we're actively considering working on soon, it's mentioned in the \"What's next?\" section of our beta release announcement: https://mathesar.org/blog/2025/01/29/release-0-2-0 I'm not sure if this would fit your use case, but you can also use a separate SQL editor alongside Mathesar, we always reflect the latest state of your DB. reply neoecos 17 hours agoprevThis looks exactly like something my finance team asked me for yesterday. Definitely will take a look. In my startup (a fintech) we tried to keep all the information about money in the DB, and have the finance team use that to compare with actual bank information reply darkteflon 11 hours agoprevDoes / how does this handle migrations? Is it happy co-existing with an SQLAlchemy or Django ORM managed PG instance? reply kgodey 11 hours agoparentMathesar doesn’t cache any database state, it always reflects the live structure of the database. If you run migrations through SQLAlchemy or Django, Mathesar will just show the database as it is before and after the migration, no extra steps needed. You can also modify the data model directly in Mathesar, but if you’re using an ORM-managed database, you’ll need to update the ORM layer yourself to reflect any schema changes. If your ORM expects strict control over the schema, it’s a good idea to configure our permissions to prevent users from making data model changes in Mathesar's UI. Otherwise, it should coexist just fine. reply bitwize 14 hours agoprevI love the name.

First, rapid growth between 2011 and 2014 to 30 million downloads, despite the fierce hostility of the project created to kill LibreOffice. Then a few years of stagnation, at a time when it seemed that desktop office suites were destined to die, and fashion was driving users to the cloud. Then the upswing, when even the most fashionable users realised that desktop office suites would never die and would coexist with the cloud. In 2019, a series of attacks on the download counter – no data is collected other than the click on the DOWNLOAD button – led to a barely credible increase (the figure you see has already been cleaned up as much as possible). After 2019, a slow but inexorable growth to over 35 million downloads – and 400 million downloads since 2011, with an average of 28.6 million downloads per year – in 2024.

    "originLink": "https://www.chriis.dev/opinion/parsing-pdfs-in-elixir-using-rust",
    "originBody": "Home ISSUE 014 Parsing PDFs (and more) in Elixir using Rust A Love Story Between Two Amazing Languages 🦀💜 JAN 29, 2025 · 13 MINUTE READ Here's the thing about PDFs they're complex beasts that require quite a bit of thinking to properly parse they come in all shapes and sizes, and they can contain a lot of different types of data and formatting. 90% of the time, we just want to extract the text from the file, but that's not always easy for the remaining 10%, well we won't be covering that in this blog post. If you've been in the Elixir world for long enough, you'll probably have tried to parse a PDF file and realised that it's not as easy as it seems. A quick look on the Elixir Forum will quickly show you that there is no simple way to do it. Most people will tell you to upload the file to S3 and use a Lambda to handle the contents. Offloading to AWS Lambda might seem elegant at first (\"Look, Ma, no dependencies!\"), but it comes with its own baggage: You're adding network latency to what should be a simple operation AWS costs can spiral if you're processing lots of PDFs You're now dependent on external services for core functionality Debugging becomes a distributed systems problem These aren't ideal solutions and software engineering is already made more complicated than it needs to be at times we don't need to add more complexity to the mix. We need a robust, native solution that plays nicely with the BEAM. So how do we do that? Enter the crabs! Elixir is my favourite language, but it can't do everything web services, background jobs, and more are easy but sometimes we need a little help from our friends closer to the hardware for some of the tasks Elixir doesn't have a native solution for. That's where Rust and NIFs come in! Rust is a systems programming language that is fast, safe, and easy to use. It's a great language for writing code that needs to be performant and reliable. But Rust isn't just fast it's \"zero-cost abstractions\" fast. What does that mean? You get high-level, ergonomic code that compiles down to something as efficient as hand-written C. For PDF parsing, where you're dealing with complex file formats and potentially large documents, this performance is a game-changer. What is a NIF? A NIF (Native Implemented Function) is a way to call Rust code from Elixir it's the BEAMs method of allowing processes to directly call native functions. It allows you to write code in Rust that can be called directly from Elixir, giving you the performance benefits of Rust without sacrificing the ease of use of Elixir. For this blog post, we're going to be using the Extractous library which provides fast and efficient unstructured data extraction in Rust. This combined with the NIFs in Elixir gives us a powerful combination for parsing PDFs. The Setup First things first, ensure you have Elixir and Rust installed on your machine. Let's begin by creating a new LiveView Elixir application that will allow users to upload a PDF file and see a breakdown of the contents. We won't be needing any database functionality for this so we can use the no-ecto flag to skip the database setup. mix phx.new elixir_pdf no-ecto We'll also need to add the rustler dependency to our mix.exs file so we can call Rust code from Elixir. defp deps do [ {:rustler, \"~> 0.27.0\"} ] end Once we pull down our dependencies using mix deps.get, we can use mix rustler.new to generate our new Rust project in our code. If you head to lib/elixir_pdf/.ex, you'll see that it's already generated a basic NIF for us. A default NIF implementation is provided for us, but we'll be implementing our own in the next step. I've named my Rust project rustreader for this example. defmodule RustReader do use Rustler, otp_app: :elixir_pdf, crate: \"rustreader\" # Define the function that will be implemented in Rust def extract_pdf(_path), do: :erlang.nif_error(:nif_not_loaded) end Now, let's grab the extractous library and add it to our native/rustreader/Cargo.toml file this will allow us to use the extractous library in our Rust code. [dependencies] rustler = \"0.36.0\" extractous = \"0.2.0\" With this in place, we can run cargo build to build our Rust code this will also pull down the extractous library and any other dependencies. The fun part writing some code Next we need to actually write some Rust code to implement the extract_pdf function in our native/rustreader/src/lib.rs file. use extractous::Extractor; use rustler::{Encoder, Env, NifResult, Term}; #[rustler::nif(schedule = \"DirtyCpu\")] fn extract_pdf(path: String) > NifResult { let extractor = Extractor::new(); match extractor.extract_file_to_string(&path) { Ok((content, metadata)) => Ok((content, format!(\"{:?}\", metadata))), Err(e) => Err(rustler::Error::Term(Box::new(format!(\"Extraction failed: {}\", e)))) } } rustler::init!(\"Elixir.RustReader\", [extract_pdf]); This code will define a new instance of the Extractor struct and use it to extract the contents of the PDF file. We'll then return the contents and the metadata as a tuple. The magic of the rustler::init! macro is that it will automatically generate the necessary code to call the Rust function from Elixir. Astute observers will note our use of the DirtyCpu schedule. This ingenious feature instructs Rustler and the BEAM to automatically schedule our task in a manner that prevents global blocking during execution. This functionality, known as a DirtyNif, significantly simplifies our work compared to the complexities of manual implementation in C. Now we need to write a some simple LiveView Elixir code to allow users to upload a PDF file and then call our Rust function from the server. defmodule ElixirPdfWeb.HomeLive do use ElixirPdfWeb, :live_view @impl true def mount(_params, _session, socket) do {:ok, socket |> assign(:uploaded_files, []) |> allow_upload(:pdf, accept: ~w(.pdf), max_entries: 1, # 10MB limit max_file_size: 10_000_000, chunk_size: 64_000 )} end @impl true def handle_event(\"validate\", _params, socket) do {:noreply, socket} end @impl true def handle_event(\"save\", _params, socket) do uploaded_files = consume_uploaded_entries(socket, :pdf, fn %{path: path}, _entry > dest = Path.join([\"priv\", \"static\", \"uploads\", Path.basename(path)]) File.cp!(path, dest) {:ok, dest} end) pdf_document = uploaded_files |> hd() {:noreply, socket |> assign(:pdf_document, pdf_document) |> update(:uploaded_files, &(&1 ++ uploaded_files))} end end Alongside this we need to add a little bit of code to our router.ex file to allow us to upload files. scope \"/\", ElixirPdfWeb do pipe_through :browser live \"/\", HomeLive end We also need a simple LiveView template to allow users to upload a PDF file and see the results. Upload PDFDrag and drop your PDF here orbrowsePDF files only, up to 10MB {entry.client_name}({entry.client_size}B)× {err}0 do %>Upload Putting it all together So we can upload a PDF file but let's call our Rust function and see what it returns. In our handle_event function, we can call our Rust function as simply as this: @impl true def handle_event(\"save\", _params, socket) do uploaded_files = consume_uploaded_entries(socket, :pdf, fn %{path: path}, _entry > dest = Path.join([\"priv\", \"static\", \"uploads\", Path.basename(path)]) File.cp!(path, dest) {:ok, dest} end) pdf_document = uploaded_files |> hd() |> RustReader.extract_pdf() ## This is where the magic happens! {:noreply, socket |> assign(:pdf_document, pdf_document) |> update(:uploaded_files, &(&1 ++ uploaded_files))} end We're grabbing the first uploaded file and calling our Rust function. The result is a tuple containing the contents of the PDF and the metadata. Let's try it out with the LiveView Cookbook PDF. Success! We've now got a PDF parser that's fast, efficient, and written in Rust. But that's quite hard to read so we're not done yet, let's make this a little nicer to work with. Let's create a new module to handle the Jason encoding of the metadata. defmodule ElixirPdf.PdfDocument do @derive {Jason.Encoder, only: [:content, :metadata]} defstruct [:content, :metadata] def from_rustler({content, metadata_json}) do with {:ok, metadata}ElixirPdf.PdfDocument.from_rustler() ... Now when we upload a PDF file, we'll see the metadata results in a much more readable format. Much better! This approach is simple and effective it's fast, efficient, and leverages the strengths of both Elixir and Rust to provide a robust solution for PDF parsing. We're only talking about PDF files here but extractous supports a wide range of file types so keep that in mind if you need to extract data from other file types. What about deployment? Keep in mind that this is a native extension and so you'll need to build the Rust code before deploying your application. This can be done in a CI/CD pipeline or manually. If you're using Docker, you can update the Dockerfile to build the Rust code as part of the build process and update config/prod.exs to tell Rustler to skip compilation and load the compiled NIF from where it was built in the Docker image. Check out the Fly.io blog post for more information on how to deploy an Elixir application with Rust NIFs. Shoutouts Some shoutouts are in order firstly this blog post from Fly.io's Phoenix Files outlining how to use Rust with NIFs in Elixir. It was a key inspiration for this approach and gave me the idea to use Rust in the first place. Also check out Fly in general for some great Elixir hosting options I use them for all my Elixir applications. Also a shoutout for the excellent Extractous library which provides fast and efficient unstructured data extraction in Rust it's also 25x faster than the very popular unstructured-io library. Finally, a shoutout to the Rustler library for providing a simple way to call Rust code from Elixir!

    "commentBody": "Parsing PDFs (and more) in Elixir using Rust (chriis.dev)168 points by bustylasercanon 21 hours agohidepastfavorite14 comments hinkley 1 hour agoThe Achilles heel of the BEAM is that if it crashes in native code then it has no way to recover and its much vaunted robustness goes out the window. So writing native hooks in Rust makes it a bit harder to crash the whole VM. On the plus side it makes IPC pretty straightforward, so you can move the processes that need the native code (NIFs) to a separate VM if you’re feeling paranoid. reply cpursley 20 hours agoprevI've been thinking a lot about how to accomplish various RAG things in Elixir (for LLM applications). PDF is one of the missing pieces, so glad to see work here. The really tricky part is not just parsing out the text (you can just call the pdftotext unix command line utility for that), but accurately pulling out things like complex tables, etc in a way that could be chunked/post processed in a useful way. I'd love to see something like Unstructured or Marker but in Rust (i.e., fast) that Elixir could NIF out to it. And maybe some kind of hybrid system that uses open llm models with vision capabilities. Ref: https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker reply cpursley 20 hours agoparentWell derp, I should have read the linked extractous repo. This looks like the extract solution I've been after (see what I did there). https://github.com/yobix-ai/extractous reply bustylasercanon 20 hours agorootparentYeah I could maybe highlight how good that library is in here reply vikp 20 hours agoparentprevHey, I'm the author of marker thanks for sharing. Most of the processing time is model inference right now. I've been retraining some models lately onto new architectures to improve speed (layout, tables, LaTeX OCR). We recently integrated gemini flash (via the use_llm flag), which maybe moves us towards the \"hybrid system\" you mentioned. Hoping to add support for other APIs soon, but focusing on improving quality/speed now. Happy to chat if anyone wants to talk about the difficulties of parsing PDFs, or has feedback email in profile. reply cpursley 20 hours agorootparentVery cool, any plans for a dockerized API of marker similar to what Unstructured released? I know you have a very attractively priced serverless offering (https://www.datalab.to) but having something to develop against locally would be great (for those of us not in the Python world). reply vikp 18 hours agorootparentIt's on the list to build been focusing on quality pretty heavily lately. reply conradfr 11 hours agoparentprevMaybe just using pdftohtml instead of pdftotext. reply cpursley 6 hours agorootparentI experimented with it, it generates way too much noise. Cool utility, though! reply constantinum 16 hours agoparentprevFor instace Llamaparse(https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/llama_cloud/llama_parse...)uses LLMs for pdf text extraction, but the problem is hallucination. e.g > https://github.com/run-llama/llama_parse/issues/420 There is also LLMWhisperer that preserves the layout(tables, checkboxes, forms)and hence the context. https://pg.llmwhisperer.unstract.com/ reply cpursley 6 hours agorootparentIs this open source? Is it slow Python? That's where I'm stuck. reply joshchernoff 21 hours agoprevFYI: your preview image from the html header meta tag is broken. reply bustylasercanon 20 hours agoparentThanks!
