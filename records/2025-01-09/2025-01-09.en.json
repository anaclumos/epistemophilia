    "originBody": "JD Kaim CS @ UWPrev @ GitHub 1d Edited Report this post Welp, looks I might be getting expelled from the University of Washington. As many of you know, last quarter I built an initial version of HuskySwap for a class project. It was a simple app designed to help students find partners to trade spots in critical classes after they filled up. I’m sure other people have pursued this kind of thing before, but there’s no go-to solution at UW and I wanted to contribute something cool for everyone. At first it was a fun project to catch up to the latest versions of .NET and Angular with some practice implementing features around database abstraction, real-time chat, and the full stack challenges associated with things like role-based permissions. I was probably going to build it anyway, so it was great that I could actually get course credit for CSE 403. I was really proud of the MVP and excited that the people I demoed it for actually wanted to use it. So I set aside some time in my winter quarter schedule to start hardening it so I could launch ahead of spring quarter registration. Then I came across the swagger docs for integrating with the registration system. The site says: “The Student Web Service gives your application access to information in the Student database such as course data, registration data, section data, person data, and term data (general academic data).” I got excited because it sounded like they were supportive of scenarios like mine. After all, UW aspires to be top ranked in both CS and business. Of course they would F/foster :P an entrepreneurial spirit! I reached out to request an access token. I wasn’t too ambitious up front; all I wanted was read-only access to automate the course catalog import instead of having to manually enter every class. But if things went well it would be awesome to automate the process further or even find other gaps I could fill to improve the community experience. Several hours later I received an unambiguous response: a “Notice of Violation of Registration Tampering Abuse Policy”. I was instructed to take down my demo site (and its handful of fake demo classes) or else they would begin the process that would culminate with my expulsion. I had originally reached out hoping to make the school experience better for everyone and they immediately went nuclear. I’m not too worried about the threat since taking down the demo site is no big deal. But I’m a little heartbroken to see how the school views me. I thought they’d be excited about what I was pursuing—or at least that I was pursuing anything—but they’d rather have me simply leave. I’m scheduled to graduate in a few months and am eager to move on to projects that don’t need to be cleared with the UW Registrar. If you know of anyone looking for a full-time software engineer with a knack for getting the attention of senior leadership, please send them my way! I can start full-time in June.

    "commentBody": "I had to take down my course-swapping site or be expelled (linkedin.com)1112 points by jdkaim 21 hours agohidepastfavorite515 comments jdkaim 20 hours agoUpdate: I immediately took down my class project site after receiving yesterday’s ultimatum. I still don’t think the simple demo site violated the letter or spirit of the registration rules, but I took it down because I always want to operate in good faith. They followed up today to thank me for doing it, but also indicated that they were putting a hold on my account anyway. As a result, I am not going to be able to register for my final quarter and have been de facto expelled at the end of this quarter. Unless, that is, I agree to work on a comparable solution for the university focused on solving the underlying problem I was building HuskySwap for. They would presumably own the IP and were clear that I wouldn’t be compensated. But it was implied that they would then remove the hold, allowing me to graduate. I really love UW and have had a wonderful time here. But this is so demoralizing. Update #2: I appreciate you guys for all of your advice. This platform was never intended to be monetized, and I am not planning to get a lawyer involved as I have faith that UW leadership will make it right in the end. I'm not planning to pursue this project at this point. If they came up to me at first with the offer to work with them it might be different, but the way they handled it makes me just want to walk away. reply GrantMoyer 19 hours agoparent> I am not planning to get a lawyer involved as I have faith that UW leadership will make it right in the end. All evidence so far indicates they will not make it right, but instead they may make it even worse. Your faith is wildly misplaced. Seriously, talk to a lawyer. Keep in mind, just because you seek advice from a lawyer doesn't mean you need to take legal action against the school. Talking to a lawyer is not an escalation; the school doesn't even need to know you consulted one. A lawyer will advise whether you should take legal action and any more amicable alternatives available before they do anything on your behalf. reply eykanal 18 hours agorootparentJust piling on here because upvotes are not visible. The one thing you can guarantee is that your good faith is not reciprocated by the university. Get a lawyer. To make it easier: it sounds like you're still registered. University of Washington offers Student Legal Services ( https://depts.washington.edu/slsuw/ ). Set up a referral with one of them and talk to them. Even if they're employees of the university and don't want to work with you to sue the university itself they may be able to give you good advice about how to proceed. reply tokinonagare 16 hours agorootparentUpvoting too. > Unless, that is, I agree to work on a comparable solution for the university focused on solving the underlying problem I was building HuskySwap for. They would presumably own the IP and were clear that I wouldn’t be compensated. But it was implied that they would then remove the hold, allowing me to graduate. Wow. Literally blackmailing a student to do illegal work (at least would be categorized like that in my country). A student that already paid money for class and potentially a degree the univ is trying to block, mind blowing. OP, 1000% lawyer up. reply ra 16 hours agorootparentRelying on good faith won't help you at all. Someone at the uni has taken this personally, and has attacked you. At this point, if you don't defend yourself - that person has won. Please seek legal advice. reply phibz 15 hours agorootparentTheir response on face value doesn't make sense. But if I had to guess, you inadvertently made someone in the registrar's office look bad. They probably had to answer to \"why didn't you think of this?\" If that is the case then it makes a lot more sense and is retaliatory behavior. You can't undo their insecurity and loss of face. Therefore you should not expect a reasonable response. Act accordingly. Educate yourself on your options. This is why people are recommending a consultation with a lawyer. Reach out to your friends and contacts in the University. Leverage existing ones to make new ones. Others may be in a stronger position to put pressure on the registrar's office. Use the news and media to further ratchet up pressure. Stay positive. Fon't stoop to their level, it won't help you. And if you have to walk away it won't hurt you too much in the long term. After about 5 years in industry nearly all companies stop caring about credentials. Just get your foot in the door somewhere and shine, that's what I did and it worked out for me 26 years later. Hang in there. reply dekhn 1 minute agorootparentYeah, let me give some perspective here. There's somebody in the registrar's office whose job is to be responsible for the production process of registration. They are minimally staffed and given just enough resources to run that process. Likely at some point their leadership told them they had to make an API so that they could integrate with other systems. Due to poor funding and lack of skills, just doing that is a full time/major job. Then some student comes along and says \"hey look if I scrape this API, I can make an app that helps users! That's what APIs are for, right!?\" The student is likely quite smart and probably built something that is useful. But students aren't full time software engineers. They lack knowledge and context about how to build production systems that handle the load during the registration crush and also don't cause undue load on the backend API servers. So when the dean comes to the head of IT for Registration, and says \"wait, this student just did something that you were supposed to do, and it looked really easy\", you just made the IT person's life much harder but didn't actually necessarily solve the problem. Now the IT person has to defend what they have done, while looking bad... and is not getting any further resources to fix the issue. I think this is a variant of the \"why don't you just...\" and chesterton's fence. That is, if you're inexperienced, it's often easy to come up with a naive solution without understanding the context, that kind of works but that actually makes things overall worse. For example, what if your app crashed the registration backends during the middle of registration. Are you, the clever student, on call during registration (24/7) for your app, and in contact with the folks who run the registration backends? It's easy to criticize the IT folks at Colleges but they are not resourced to handle things like this. colanderman 15 hours agorootparentprevSeconding this. It's entirely likely the registrar is this petty and boneheaded. It's less likely that their boss is though, this is a really bad look for the university. Personally I would find a way to contact the president of the university (possibly through university PR, who also care about public image) and simply state, \"The registrar is asking me for quid pro quo, that I develop software for them in exchange to restore my ability to register for classes.\" and include a screenshot of that communication. Additionally, consider \"agreeing\" to their demands, if they will unblock you immediately. Register for classes, then reneg on your half of the \"deal\". Even if they then retaliate, that strengthens your position (a) that they are engaging in quid pro quo, and (b) that there's no valid reason that you should be barred from registering for courses, and also buys you some time. reply emacsen 14 hours agorootparentA +1 to everyone else who has said get a lawyer. I'll add another angle: financial. You have invested years of time and presumably thousands of dollars into your schooling. Their threat that they will not allow you to graduate unless you give them unpaid labor without a clear boundary condition is a threat. While I haven't seen the correspondence, from what you said it appears they're doing the moral equivalent of one of those sitcom situations where someone is compelled to do what the other person wants under a threat, and even when they've done it, the threatening person keeps the threat. A good lawyer (and not all lawyers are good) will help you understand your rights and your position. As others have said, this is not an escalation of aggression, and not only don't you have to tell them whether you've seen a lawyer, unless the lawyer is speaking on your behalf- you don't have to tell them anything, and you shouldn't tell them, or tell us (in case they read this, which they likely will). A lawyer in this case is more of a scholarly resource, telling you what your options are. reply thih9 10 hours agorootparentAgreed. To add to that: it is understandable to expect and hope for the other party to behave rationally. But there is a power imbalance that the other party is exploiting and for all we know intends to continue. reply exe34 10 hours agorootparentprev> reneg on your half of the \"deal\". deny, delay, defect. and don't sign anything!! reply andyjohnson0 8 hours agorootparentprev> But if I had to guess, you inadvertently made someone in the registrar's office look bad. They probably had to answer to \"why didn't you think of this? That was my initial thought too. The upside is that that \"someone\" likely has a boss who called them out - so there may well be levels of the hierarchy that won't lose face by backing out of the exclusion decision. The challenge is to get their attention. reply phibz 2 hours agorootparentThe problem is that their leadership may not care. Bureaucrats at higher education don't take the job because they're good at it. They take it because they're not and want a job with high job security. The poor pay and unrewarding tasks are acceptable to them as a means to coast. Couple that with a job that can be quite stressful at times, students can be very demanding, and you have a recipe for entrenched apathy. I base my assessment on my time working for a University for 8 years. The registrar's office are the wrong people to appeal to. The deans office can fix this, but they may only move if it makes the University look bad. That's where the news and media can help, but this guy likely needs help to make that happen effectively. reply move-on-by 18 hours agorootparentprevIt’s a funny thought, but looks like a nonstarter: > SLS cannot represent a student when the opposing party is another UW-Seattle, Tacoma, or Bothell student or UW entity. reply glaugh 16 hours agorootparentI know very little about lawyering, but I could imagine a UW-alum or Seattle-area lawyer advising pro bono bc of generosity or good publicity on a very newsworthy case Anyone on here friends with a UW-alum or Seattle-area lawyer who might be interested but doesn’t read HN? reply Symbiote 8 hours agorootparentDo American university students belong to unions? It's very common in the UK. The most visible part of the unions is running social activities, often bars and events, but they can also provide legal advice to their members. reply alistairSH 3 hours agorootparentNot undergraduates. The \"student union\" in this context is 100% a social entity. Graduate students sometimes are part of unions, but usually only if they're also employed by the university (somebody paying full tuition for an MBA probably isn't in a union, but a doctoral student teaching or doing research might be). Undergrads doing part-time work at the university to pay bills (dining hall, bookstore, etc) could be, in theory, but probably aren't. reply LPisGood 4 hours agorootparentprevGraduate students (who teach, do research, and some administrative tasks for the university) occasionally do. What American schools usually have is a “student government” which is approximately 90% roleplaying as elected officials, and the remaining 10% is deciding which banquets they should host themselves to spend the small budget the university gives them. reply zeckalpha 17 hours agorootparentprevThey can have a conversation without being representation and should connect OP to someone who can represent them. reply DannyBee 17 hours agorootparentNo they can't have a conversation when they know of a non waivable conflict. reply pbhjpbhj 16 hours agorootparentSurely they could refer the enquiry to the bar association or something in this jurisdiction.

If there's a way that almost any institution or person that you're transacting with in good faith—including schools, workplaces, lawyers, medical professionals, the leader of your country, sometimes family, whatever—can get away with fucking you over, they might. Not always, but expect it.

You may only interact with someone professionally, but you never know what kind of person you are really working with. Sometimes people may seem nice, but are pure evil. In this particular case, it is likely the people in charge are completely unaware of the people doing the blackmailing.

Sometimes people may seem nice, but are pure evil. It's not even always a case of being evil. Large institutions/companies are full of polices and processes designed to protect the system at all costs and some nice people will turn their brain off and strictly follow those policies either because they feel they have to, because it's the easiest thing to do, or because they know that as long as they stick to the policies (or what they think the policies are) they'll be safe. reply brailsafe 44 minutes agorootparentprevYep, they'll walk all over whoever they can, until they receive just enough bad publicity or pushback, and suddenly it's not an issue anymore. reply zzzeek 8 minutes agorootparentprevcosign, this story is outrageous, it is Lawyer Time, Now.

It was a massive time waste and I came out losing a years of my academic career where they lost nothing (money is absolutely not a factor for a large university, nor is stalling court proceedings to waste your life). I'm not even allowed to elaborate deeply on what it was about, the settlement for putting it behind me was a binding NDA. This isn't advice it's just a story about what happened to me, to give you an idea of how things *could* go for you: What I did to warrant initial sanctioning by my college was filing a witness statement describing a petty disorderly offense another student did. Apparently the college didn't like that I filed a statement with the police and it did not go through their internal system. The school placed a hold and I contacted my dean by email. I was told by the dean, in writing, that I was not being sanctioned but the hold would remain until I attended a hearing to describe the incident as prescribed in the handbook. When I went to this 'procedural hearing' with the other witness, they brought us in one at a time in front of representatives of the student body and the administration. At the end of my account they told me I would receive their decision and sanctions by mail. They issued formal academic sanctions and created a remediation plan not unlike what they are requesting of you. I retained a lawyer at this point and ended up filing a complaint in civil. There's nothing speedy here, judges stalled, the school stalled. Almost 2 years went by and we finally had the lawyers draft a settlement that made it possible to pursue college again. In the meanwhile they increased the sanctions on the remaining witness that didn't sue in order to retaliate. The student we filed the statement about, apparently the school couldn't touch since the police charged him. He got off paying a ticket and no other sanctions, last I heard he was in postgrad for mathematics and doing well for himself. reply red-iron-pine 35 minutes agorootparentUnlike most of hte other commentators I also have personal experience fighting a college administration -- and winning. By threatening lawyers, too. I got into an Honors Study Abroad thing through the school, but was worried about an incomplete grade screwing up my GPA or causing issues. Emailed the admin about it + study abroad office -- they said all good, it's kosher. Turns out it wasn't, and after dropping 41k to lock in housing and study abroad they told me I couldn't go because I couldn't transfer credits. Well here is a lesson in \"keep your emails\" cuz I dug that out and picked a fight with the administration. They eventually gave me all of my money back minus the $600 non-refundable deposit. I was ready to go to the mat for that, too, but they offered to get me a guaranteed slot for on campus housing and permanent first crack at class selection similar to athletes and disabled students. I was sick of commuting by that point and took the offer. I figured out it was a way to get more money out of me pretty quickly -- solve an issue and make money via housing -- but my RA in the on-campus apartments was super cool and basically let me and a roommate squat for multiple summers. Still friends with a lot of those folks I met living on campus too. Worked out okay, all things considered. Lawyers won't be a guaranteed win, but don't assume that just giving up is a better deal. reply Aurornis 5 hours agorootparentprevThanks for speaking up. The internet talks about getting a lawyer like it’s a magic (and free) button you press to resolve a situation. It’s not, and in some cases it can turn your problem into a more expensive and protracted different problem if you’re not careful. I’d be especially cautious around a University that has already proven itself to have bureaucratic people who will turn small issues into threats of expulsion.

He was directly and obviously infringing on student's First Amendment rights, not to mention bullying the class as a whole and attempting to threaten people. Ironically, his heart was in the right place, but his execution was way off. I was fortunate in that I went to college much later in life, after a career in the military, and as I'd had enough bullshit there, I made the conscious choice not to tolerate any out in the world. Long story short, he and I butt heads. Then he wanted to take up to the Department head. For someone with a Ph.D., she definitely didn't think it through, just proving you can have a Ph.D., even in a STEM field, and not be too fucking bright... but... when it got to the Dean of Students, and the campus's VA liaison all sat down for a meeting with me, and I started pointing out that F.I.R.E. would have a field day with this, and would we really want a veteran-led incident on campus with a lab director that's flat out admitted in recorded interviews (I was attending college in a one-party recording state, so I had recordings of every one of these meetings) that he doesn't care about students' First Amendment rights?? That put everything into perspective really damn quick. I have never forgot that meeting because there, in that moment, we all looked at each other and everyone understood exactly what I was saying. The Dean of Students stood up and said, \"Do you want to apologize to the department dean...?\" and I just raised one eyebrow and he immediately shot back, \"Right... we should probably all let this go.\" I nodded and said, \"I think that'd be the best option for everyone involved, after you guys sit down with Lab Director and straighten him out.\" I've done some things I'm not too particularly proud of in my life, but this was one time I really felt like I did the right thing. reply MadnessASAP 5 hours agorootparentFunnily enough, today I am I am (re)starting my post secondary education after a decade and counting in the military. Your comment reminds me of one of the misconceptions that friends have of me/military. I am not as it happens a particularly good shot/fighter/camper/adventurer. However the military has more then prepared me to wade through a bureaucratic swamp to tell a room full of people paid more then me that they're wrong and will fight to the proverbial death over it.

You need a lawyer. Not necessarily to go to court, but at least to write some letters. That should not cost more than a few hundred dollars. Don't wait. Document everything. Make copies. Store them somewhere safe. Read Washington State law on extortion in the first degree.[1] Follow the link to the definition of \"threat\", especially the section on \"official action\": \"To take wrongful action as an official against anyone or anything, or wrongfully withhold official action, or cause such action or withholding\". It's really bad for a state official to attempt extortion. It's a 10 years in prison felony offense. Edit: Having a lawyer write and send a letter on your behalf tends to resolve a large number of annoying situations. A lawyer on the other side will have to read it. This immediately gets you past the first-line people to people who have to consider consequences. [1] https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9A.56.120 reply dzdt 4 hours agorootparentprevA lawyer is NOT the right next step. As soon as you engage a lawyer the school will switch from treating this as a student policy matter (which will be resolved in a timeline of days) to a legal matter (which will only be resolved in a timeline of years). The timeline question is of no concern to the courts or the school but makes a huge difference to you. It does seem like you need someone on your side. A list of people to consider: your academic advisor, the professor in whose course you built the prototype application, your department chair, student ombudsman, dean of students. If the university is being as unreasonable as your posting makes it sound like, you will have no trouble getting one or more of these people on your side and they will be able to apply pressure to the registrars office on your behalf if needed to get your hold lifted. reply ANewFormation 1 hour agorootparentHaving been on both sides of the fence here, this is highly contrary to my experience. Large institutions are more than happy, in many cases, to bully anybody when it benefits them. But as soon as possible legal/media issues emerge they're going to suddenly be your best friend looking to make things right as quickly and cleanly as possible. The ombudsman is definitely not a bad idea, but in most cases the mere hint of legal involvement would get this resolved without any legal involvement - just going on for a consultation doesn't mean one has to go to the next step, and in all probability you won't have to. reply bazintastic 2 hours agorootparentprevThis is the right answer. A large institution like a university is not a monolith. The university will produce antibodies to external participants, like lawyers (or the media). You're most likely to get better outcomes if you can ensure the conflict plays out within the university and its rules, structures, and participants. Your work now is to convince other members of the university to advocate on your behalf. (It should not be difficult. If this is as you describe, reasonable faculty members will be your allies.) The same goes for publicizing this further. The student newspaper is probably okay, but keep talking to other media in the room as a bargaining chip. Bad press may well force some administrator's hand. To be sure, a chat with a lawyer may be helpful to get a sense of the universe of possible outcomes pursuing extramural action, but don't let anbyody send any lawyerly letters yet. reply peeters 14 hours agorootparentprevAlso, merely them knowing you have a lawyer instantly reframes the problem in their eyes.

Yes, and even if it doesn't go to court, the university will know that it will cost them time and money. It's entirely possible that university president or higher administration is unaware of the situation, and if they were, will intervene. The best way to do that is to have it brought to their attention via a legal letter, which then means they need to bring in their lawyers. A good lawyer for the university won't want to fight because fighting is not in the best interest of the university. A good lawyer will say \"We threatened the student with this? No good can come of that... let him register, let him graduate and make this all go away.\" That doesn't mean the client (the university) will take it, but overall fighting isn't in their interest either. reply sitkack 17 hours agorootparentprevGet a lawyer.

If they feel threatened they might start looking even deeper into into contracts you signed as a way to protect themselves or as legal leverage to silence you with further threats. I've witnessed a couple cases where things went from hiring a lawyer, to sending a letter, to a stalemate where legal bills started getting so expensive that the only winners were the lawyers. When you're dealing with a big bureaucracy you can't count on them giving up at the first sight of a letter from a lawyer. The legal route also takes time and locks any further conversations into the speed of both sides' lawyers. Time matters in this case because this student needs to get registered for classes, so anything that could stall that process needs to be weighed carefully.

None of these scenarios are painted as a pyrrhic victory because you had to pay the people who made it possible. All those people are generally paid hourly too. Is it because a good lawyer will bill you $400/hr? Is it because those generally have a lot more upside financially than simply winning a court case? I think it's projecting anger from spec attorneys taking 40% of personal injury judgments, or class action attorneys making $50 million in fees when the people affected get checks for $8.72, but neither of those apply here particularly when you're paying an attorney $75 to send a demand letter template on their letterhead. reply KPGv2 13 hours agorootparentprev> Because even if you \"win\", you now have all of those lovely legal bills that the lawyer sends you Oh come on, that's like saying when you involve engineers to build a bridge, the only people who wins are the engineers because you have to pay them. reply fakedang 12 hours agorootparentEngineers don't get paid more when a project gets further delayed. reply dmurray 9 hours agorootparentYou've obviously never worked in consulting. reply pc86 4 hours agorootparentprevPlenty of engineers and firms bill hourly, so yes sometimes they do. reply dehrmann 1 hour agorootparentprevEver get a $5 settlement check from a class action? reply j45 16 hours agorootparentprevWhen lawyers are paid hourly to talk to each other on behalf of their clients, sometimes the bill can get sky high if not managed. reply DennisP 17 hours agorootparentprevThat might be the way to bet but casually mentioning a lawyer once worked for me on a used car warranty claim.

Anyways, the counselor will have options for you, and won't be constrained by whoever is running the registration site (and aren't going to be their allies either).

An officious word for lawyer is counsel, because that’s what they’re for: they offer legal counsel. You don’t technically “talk” to a lawyer , instead you ask them questions. They answer. That’s why client-attorney privilege exists at all: so you can feel free to seek counsel, ie ask questions, without fear of those questions ever being held against you. You’re right not to talk to a lawyer. Instead, you should ask them questions. Like “what’s the worst that can happen?” and “what are my options if it does?” and “ what documents / evidence would I need to defend myself?” and “what would you advise me not to do?”. As a silly rule of thumb: every message to a lawyer should have at least one question mark in it. That is the role of legal counsel in our society. Use that privilege. Seek counsel.

I don't think there's any reason to have faith that their leadership will make things right. It sounds like they've already moved the goalposts once, and there's no reason to trust that they wouldn't do it again later. They no longer deserve the presumption of good faith. As an alternative to what the options here seem to be saying, I can't help but wonder if some other university might be more willing to work with you without having to go through all of the blackmail. If this is something that's actually valuable to UW, it probably would be valuable to others as well, and without the threat of expulsion, you might be able to get better terms from them; maybe someone here with a connection to a more open-minded university could help get the door open to making a more fair deal? If finishing your degree is important to you, and you still don't have any desire to make a business out of this, maybe some form of scholarship in return for making a system for them for something like this? Alternately, if you do end up wanting to own the IP and monetize it in some way, you could try to rework the idea to be a service you sell to universities rather than offer for free to students. Even if you don't want to sell it, you could always offer it to universities for free with some terms that require attribution to you (and maybe also stipulate that no one is allowed to share the code with UW, since you deserve some compensation from them even if you don't want it from anyone else). reply jostmey 19 hours agoparentprevSounds like you are being blackmailed into working for them for free reply bluGill 4 hours agorootparentRight, if he does work for them, he is worth a full time salary for a new software engineer.

Ironically, the fact that you went public on what could be a delicate internal matter might've escalated things, more than consulting a lawyer would. At a university, if there's at least one specific administrator or full professor who you both trust, and think has clout to resolve the matter satisfactorily, then trusting the university to make things right might be reasonable. Or, if your university is a rare one that has unusually good conventions of honorable behavior, which you know are practiced by most (including administrators, faculty, staff, and students), and there are effective checks and balances for when that fails, then maybe you're also OK. But, in most universities, when an official is talking about possibly ruining your career/life, then either you fudged up really-really badly (so, consult a lawyer), or you're in danger of learning just how bad a largely unaccountable institution of largely unaccountable individuals can get (so, consult a lawyer). Also, if an official you're talking with ever asks if you've filed a lawsuit, and says they have to stop talking with you if you do, don't say that you want to work collegially with the university to resolve the situation internally.

As in not \"they\" or \"the university\", but who within the university? Can you tell where the directive is coming from? If this comes from, say, the Provost's Office then this probably can't be handled internally. (The position of Provost is the #2 position at a university, and the provost usually runs the show while the President or Chancellor goes schmoozing with donors.) But if it's coming from the Registrar's Office, then the Registrar doesn't have that much power internally, and you might be able to fight this decision within the university. What they did is not only brazenly immoral, it is also a tremendous legal liability for UW, and it should and might be a firing offense for whoever is responsible. And quite frankly no matter what happens I would seriously consider hiring an attorney (you might find one who will work on contingency). You might speak with any professors in the department you have a good relationship with; I would be very surprised if they were sympathetic to this decision. You might also talk with the university ombudsman, Dean of Students, etc. -- although I would be a little bit cautious and polite here. Just calmly describe the situation and ask what you should do in this situation. Hopefully (but this is very far from certain), they will calmly offer to intervene on your behalf, and then they will go ballistic behind closed doors and absolutely rake the Registrar over the coals. In any case, be poker faced, don't fully trust them, and avoid committing to a particular course of action if you don't have to. Finally, here's an amusing hack. Salaries at UW are public record. If you want to find out how important any individual person is in the hierarchy, look up how much money they make.

They are a subject you have to study and train at...and sometimes sit in a theatre and have a class time about (watching scout footage or deconstructing plays, etc). Sports are probably just as rigorous as anything else academically once you get to something approaching a division 1 level of play.

If I may offer a personal story that illustrates that that is _really_ a good idea: While I did my Bachelor's in CS, I was employed by a university (not the one I attended, but one that the project I worked on moved to after the Prof in charge switched universities) as a \"student worker\" type deal. My job was essentially a Jr. SWE. A friend of mine also worked on that project, but he was ahead a bit further in his studies, so he already had a BSc degree, while I hadn't. Universities being universities, this meant that his hourly pay was a tiny smidge more than mine (think 50 cents/hour or something like that). Neither of us was paid very well, we both came out to about 10-12 €/hour. After 6 months my contract was up for renewal. Along with the renewal, they included a modest pay raise to my friend's level. I naively thought that that meant they appreciated my work or something like that. All went well until the _next_ renewal was up. The HR person responsible for student workers noticed that my \"raise\" had been in error because they assumed I had gotten my degree as well. None of their paperwork that I signed originally mentioned that. As \"proof\" that I \"should have known\" that the raise was in error, they sent along a scanned copy of a copy of a copy of an internal \"wage schedule\" that I somehow should've been aware of. Their solution was to hand me a \"new\" backdated contract with lower hourly wages and told me to sign that to \"just quickly fix this error\" and told me to just pay back what I had \"erroneously\" received (signed contract stating the contrary nonwithstanding). I politely declined because that's not how I think employment works. As a response they said \"ah well, don't worry, we'll just take it out of your next pay check\", which they did (without me signing anything). At that point I called my mom and told her the full story. She immediately went \"Alright, how do you want to play this? Should we talk to them or do you want to pull out the big guns?\". I was sufficiently pissed off that I told her I want the big guns, she told me the info for my families' \"lawsuit insurance\" (The German term is \"Rechtsschutzversicherung\", basically cheap-ish insurance to help you pay for a lawyer in cases like this) and called them after we talked. I called up a lawyer in town that specialized in employment law, had an appointment with him to tell him the story, he went \"I can see roughly 4 or 5 reasons that they can't take that money from you, let me write a letter to them and we'll see how it goes\". The end result was that the university in my next paycheck included the amount they had initially reduced my previous check by, my higher-wage contract was renewed, and we never spoke of any of that again. I didn't get an apology or anything from the HR admin who had clearly messed up my contract and was probably trying to cover her ass, but that's fine with me.

I fortunately did take advantage of this, and so did my wife. Thought we took advantage of it so we could do cheap study abroad and not have to take any courses toward our degree plan (indeed, I actually earned a second degree in a completely unrelated field while doing my study abroad) But to be clear, this was because I took every advanced class offered at my high school and took other courses at the local community college instead of hanging out with my friends during lunch, etc. It was a constant gaming of the system to eventually get the results I wanted. reply lazyasciiart 7 hours agorootparentIn Washington, high school students can enrol in community college courses through their school, and count them for both high school and college credit. https://www.seattlecolleges.edu/running-start reply joe5150 15 hours agorootparentprevYou can double up on a lot in high school (AP, IB, dual enrollment) or CLEP out of a good number of GenEd classes, but not everybody has the access and support they need to pull that off.

It doesn't seem like there was any indication of monetization here. I'm definitely flabbergasted by their stance on asking you to build the same feature as an extortion mechanism. I've lived in WA for ~9 years, and held UW in high regard as I often interact with graduates at my day job. But, this leaves a sour taste in my mouth.

Evan Carroll Dec 24, 2024 121 Share this post Evan Carroll The erasure of Luigi Mangione Copy link Facebook Email Notes More 21 33 Share Stack Exchange is a large online crowd sourced content provider for questions and answers. The Stack Exchange network of sites includes everything from cooking, to politics, and Judaism and Islam. In 2021, it was sold to a private equity company Prosus for 1.8 billion USD. Its largest asset is Stack Overflow, a site tailored to programmers. The Stack Overflow site is a vital resource for software developers. Ideally, it makes it easy and free to ask questions and get professional assistance. On Stack Exchange, all of the contributions on the site are contributed under a license maintained by a third party called Creative Commons; Creative Commons provides a license which states that licensed content must be perpetually shareable for any purpose including modification and by anyone including for-profit ventures, so long as the work remains properly attributed. This incentivizes content creation because every contributor is working on a corpus of work which is free from royalties and modification restrictions: everyone is bettering and growing the commons by using the site. The only “payment” we get out for our work is recognition: the right granted under the Attribution Clause. The Stack Exchange network is further “gameified” with rankings and reputation (a quantifiable standing) to encourage active membership and community while keeping things fun. Work hard, have a larger contribution to the commons and be recognized as such. Thanks for reading! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. Subscribe Alas, this minimal obligation of attribution is too much for some companies which have sought to erode this right. Right now, on Stack Overflow, Luigi Magione’s account has been renamed. Despite having fruitfully contributed to the network he is stripped of his name and his account is now known as “user4616250”. As reported by one of the moderators, Zoe, on Stack Overflow. I can confirm SE, Inc. were the ones to clear his name. A reason was not specified anywhere obvious. Mods have been given explicit instructions not to touch that profile. While this particular incident may be limited to SO, the implications of this affect the entire network – Zoe - Save the data dump Though I’m not a lawyer, even with a guilty verdict I don’t believe Stack Exchange is freed from their contractual obligation of attribution under the Creative Commons license. However, in the spirit of the site I put the preliminary legal question about the Creative Commons license to the experts on law.stackexchange.com. Raising the Question In order to get more information about the justification and reasoning for the unattribution, I asked a question on the “meta” site that helps run the network called meta.stackexchange. I have not received an official answer from the company. Exceptional Treatment for Mangione As pointed out in a comment, this kind of treatment is specific to Mangione, This situation has a very direct precedent: \"Frosty\" (Ross Ulbricht) is still attributed under his chosen pseudonym and gets to keep the 500 not-very-organic upvotes on the question he asked in furtherance of the crime for which he was sentenced to life in prison and fined hundreds of millions of dollars. – Jeremy The Ross Ulbricht case is even more egregious because he was convicted and his old pseudonym remains with his attribution as Ulbricht desired. Potential Legal Mechanism Used One user hypothesizes Stack Exchange is invoking a second seldom-mentioned license that contributors grant, many probably unknowingly. In this explanation you grant two licenses to Stack Exchange, one under the CC BY-SA, and one under an unnamed explicit license provided by the terms of use. However, even the suggestion of this “dual-license” theory being used in this case invoked tremendous push-back from users, and it was eventually subsequently deleted and hidden, This license mentioned is provided by the Terms of Service which currently reads, you grant Stack Overflow the perpetual and irrevocable right and license to access, use, process, copy, distribute, export, display and to commercially exploit such Subscriber Content, even if such Subscriber Content has been contributed and subsequently removed by you as reasonably necessary to, for example (without limitation): Provide, maintain, and update the public Network Process lawful requests from law enforcement agencies and government agencies Prevent and address security incidents and data security features, support features, and to provide technical assistance as it may be required Aggregate data to provide product optimization This means that you cannot revoke permission for Stack Overflow to publish, distribute, store and use such content and to allow others to have derivative rights to publish, distribute, store and use such content. It would seem this would allow them to do whatever they want, and to relicense the content under any name under the CC BY-SA. Whether or not this is the legal mechanism used to remove traces of Luigi Mangione is unknown at this time, however there is a specific resource on the site detailing this dual-license scenario. Retribution for Asking the Question As of yet, Stack Exchange has not replied to the above post, but they did promptly and within hours gave me a year-long ban for merely raising the question. Of course, they did draft a letter which credited the action to other events that occurred weeks before where I merely upvoted contributions from Luigi and bountied a few of his questions. It’s important to grasp the severity of my suspension: suspending a professional resource for one year will create a hardship for me. And, I’m one of the largest producers of content on the network (by any measure I’m in the top 0.1% of members). All of that said, with the growth of AI and competition in their industry it’s never been easier to weather a ban from Stack Exchange, even if they are the big player. The policy on providing a bounty is in their user’s help documents. They eventually did cite a separate recent policy created in 2023, but not before a very blunt statement that you’d have to really struggle to not see as an admission on retribution, As to the question you asked today, Removing attribution because someone was charged but not convicted with a crime?, yes, that question brought a lot more attention to the overall situation, which includes your targeted voting/bounties. If you had not posted that question, it's unclear when your targeted voting/bountied would have been seen by Stack Overflow moderators. But, no, this suspension is not retribution for posting that question. Had you not posted that question and we became aware of the voting fraud situation, which we, eventually, would have, the response and suspension would have been the same. That reads to me like “yes, it was retribution.” My response to this was simple, Had I have not posted that question, you may have never been made aware of my transgressions though. You discovered this after an investigation which was prompted by my question. Let's remove ourselves for a second: if an employee steals a pen and he's fired from it only after reporting sexual harassment the company's defense can't be \"we would have eventually fired you for stealing the pen\", right? That's not a defense the employer can reasonably make at that point despite being otherwise actionable. I concluded with the following, That said, I don't feel I ever artificially did anything; but, I understand how it looks. I did find all the contributions from the profile page, and I did reward all the bounties to a specific user who I felt was trying to be productive (and oblivious to any celebrity he currently has). But this is hardly a \"pattern.\" When you say \"pattern\" you're referring to this single case (granted over days) with this single user, that culminated in the removal of bounties and upvotes which I just found out about when you told me. My side of the story is easy: I saw an alleged killer that I believe is wrongly framed who has a good head on his shoulders get swept up by the justice system. I went online and viewed his contributions and thought they were warranting of incentive. I wanted to incentivize him to become a productive member of society, and of our network. Let's correct that if it's against policy: keep the bounties removed and the upvotes removed, but a prior offense shouldn't sit as a Trump card for punishment now. I started a respectful conversation because I believe Luigi Mangione should NOT be treated as a criminal prior to a conviction. That's the request of his defense attorney (today), and I believe there is a trend for that to happen which is wrong. That's all I'm doing here in asking the question. Balance with other online accounts How does this sit with how other tech sites react? GitHub, a division of Microsoft, still has Luigi’s profile online. This indifference to a mere charge should be applauded. It’s unfortunate Stack Overflow couldn’t chart the same course. LinkedIn, also owned by Microsoft, seems to have Luigi’s LinkedIn still active — however, I’m not sure this has been verified. Reddit has deleted his account (presumed to be /u/Mister_Cactus) Facebook and Instagram accounts are long gone. They even deleted his company page. Twitter removed the account and reinstated it later, after Musk got involved Goodreads made his account private, and waffled, reverting their decision a few times. While all of these companies took different approaches the only one that chose to both erase him and keep the content, is Stack Exchange. Thanks for reading!

He knows the rules, the process, what's expected, and he knows how lowly moderators react when they the system alerts them to infractions. It's no surprise he's earned himself [another] suspension here. But as a moderator, what the company is doing here is ridiculous and a seemingly flagrant abuse of license. If you take contributions under CC-BY-SA, you damned-well keep the attribution unless the contributor wants to be disassociated from it.

Furthermore, there doesn't seem to be any mechanism to force a company to maintain publication of content it doesn't want to host... it can simply delete users and content whenever it chooses, but typically doesn't for reasons of goodwill and/or reputation. Youtube deletes millions of people's comments and videos daily because an AI algorithm disagreed with them by virtue of sentiment analysis and decided their combination of words was not allowed. At some point though, people around the world will demand a digital \"Bill of Rights\", even if the content, processing, and/or publication is happening on the systems of for-profit corporations... it's either that, or enough people must leave forums that have a history of one-sided, unfair, and/or unethical (while maybe legal) practices. reply EvanCarroll 3 hours agoparentprevI know my fame and legendary repute may lead one to believe otherwise, but I hate drama.

Putting additional punishment in the form of abuse (physical, mental and sexual) and then putting the onus of that additional punishment on a vulnerable population is a recipe for disaster.

The question for this could be rephrased as \"which takes less moderation?\" Option 1 is moderating the votes, voting reversals, and bounty reversals... or changing the user name so that it's less visible? The tools for doing the moderation of personal votes and reversals and whatnot are blunt and clumsy and time consuming. The tools for doing the \"change the account name\" is similarly blunt and clumsy, but much less time consuming. From a mod perspective, it isn't necessarily \"what is right or wrong\" but rather \"what do I have time to do? ... and if I don't have time to do this, what are the outcomes?\" There is a lot of \"the tools for doing (diamond) moderation haven't been built out well\" combined with \"the stance of Stack Exchange Inc (I specify it this way to distinguish between Stack Exchange the community) has been inconsistent on social issues in the past.\" Running a social network (but not wanting to admit its a social network, and sometimes denying that it is, but having engagement metrics like a social network) with a diminishing paid moderation team combined with taking stances that haven't been run past a lawyer before a proclamation or actions being taken... and then as often as not going back on (or not following through with) those actions or proclamations... And we've got problems. The actions themselves may not be of Stack Exchange Inc's direction actions this time, but the underlying confusion and lack of communication of clear policies (and lack of enforcement of the clear policies), or the tools to allow for less blunt actions... well... we've got problems. I don't see this getting better as Stack Exchange Inc has taken very little action to increase the paid moderation team or take responsibility for the content that is published on their sites. reply backoverflow 11 hours agoprevStack Overflow's rules for bounties [0] discourage promotional bounties but do not state that bounties cannot be given to the same user or on the basis of the user as opposed to a user's answers. Stack Overflow failed to enunciate their own rules (or - let's be honest - imagined new rules after the fact), blamed you for breaking non-existent rules, sent you an obviously mostly copy/paste suspension notice (the bit about secondary accounts seems bizarre and non sequitur), and gas-lit you with the imaginary claim that you cannot vote on a post you already voted on which for whatever reason hadn't been logged. FWIW also a high-rep SO user and had to create a burner account in case there's retribution. We shouldn't have to hide ourselves just to talk sanely. SO is right to try to protect the bounty system from unintended uses, but not to make rules up on the fly and enforce them heavy-handedly and retrospectively, suspending someone for breaking non-existent rules. Stack Overflow should make rules for bounties and make them crystal clear and unsuspend you. Can they admit they're wrong - will they do this? Of course not. [0] https://stackoverflow.com/help/bounty#:~:text=Users%20may%20.... reply fabian2k 9 hours agoparentFrom the SO help center (https://stackoverflow.com/help/privileges/vote-up): When should I not vote up? Posts should be voted on based on the content in the post rather than the person who wrote it. Voting for specific people, whether you know them or not, can negatively impact our ranking system. Here are some examples of common cases that should be avoided: - Repeatedly upvoting several of a user's posts to say \"thanks\" for one great answer. - Repeatedly upvoting posts created by people you know because you know them – often friends, family, or coworkers. - Targeting a specific user with votes for any other reason. In cases where voting patterns appear to be targeted, the votes are likely to be reversed, either by automatic systems or manually following an investigation by the staff, which will cause a loss of reputation earned from these votes. ----- The rules around abuse of the voting system are by necessity somewhat fuzzy, you can't enumerate all the possible cases clearly. And bounties are even more fuzzy as they can be similarily abused, but users still have a lot of freedom in deciding how to use them. Usually misuse of bounties would likely just result in the mods warning the user and undoing the bounties, exactly because this is an area where the rules are not necessarily clear to users and the boundaries are somewhat fuzzy. But Evan Carroll certainly knows how the system works and is a user with a very extensive history on SO. Suspensions and especially suspension lengths are heavily influenced by previous behaviour. A year-long suspension means this is at least the third suspension for that user according to the guidelines given to mods for suspension lengths. reply jml7c5 10 hours agoparentprev>(or - let's be honest - imagined new rules after the fact) StackOverflow has been sending that exact email (\"the motivation for doing so needs to be anchored in the merits of the post, not the person who wrote it\") for at least nine years.

Somebody publishes their thoughts contributing to how the world should be in their view on the internet. We all do that, me here. They are then accused and arrested for a horrible crime. Murder, for example. This garners their thoughts a great deal more attention than they would otherwise get as now they are (in)famous. No removal of publication until conviction. Is there now an incentive to advertise your views by committing crime to attract as much attention as possible? Easiest way is to make it as horrific as possible. I am thinking extremist racists will take those rules. More than one of them. More than once. So now we're somewhere pretty uncomfortable. I think it wrong to suppress Osama Bin Laden's screeds recently removed from the Guardian online, however much I loathe him and everything he stood for. So what about some neo-nazi mass murderer? Or the copycat? Or the following ten? Is that really so hypothetical that we can't see a body count with it? Is this alarm-ism? I hope so, I genuinely do and have no hidden motive here. I'm not buying that this situation has easy policy nor that whatever is done results in something we are going to be fully comfortable with. One outcome may be very much worse for many more people than another, so thinking it through fully is really needed. Something I am yet to make much more than this vague start.

Don't impose information control on me because others do stupid shit. reply Cumpiler69 9 hours agorootparent>I'm much more concerned about the ideology of the people who think information control is justifiable. Indeed. That's only to justify blatant censorship. Reading books doesn't cause people to kill other people. If someone kills someone after reading a book, that person already had huge issues and was on the edge to kill already, and instead of a addressing the issue by investing more in helping those with mental illnesses, we take the dumb cheap and easy way out of blaming books, video games, forums, incels, toxic masculinity, etc. Everyone is quick to blame incels but nobody asks why do men become incels in the first place and how to prevent that by addressing the causes and not the effects. The truth is our current society has a disproportionate lack of safety nets and help available to males and male issues, when compared to females, hence why there's 10x the rate of suicides and homelessness for males vs females, and is also one of the reasons why men have statistically been going more conservative and right wing in the last decade or so. Yet nobody talks about this or wants to do anything to address this and just resorts to shaming men who draw attention to this as incels and \"far right\" and calls it a day. When society takes away young men's communities (previously it was the church) and purpose in life, their prospect of building a family, good job (men used to be able to support a family by bolting bumpers to Fords in a factory) and owning a home, and demonize them for the sins of their fathers (patriarchy and male Privilege) while depriving them of any help, it's no surprise they become radicalized against the society that hates them and that void gets filled by manosphere bros who tell them it's the fault of the Rothschilds and that all women are hoes. reply paulryanrogers 5 hours agorootparent\"Won't someone think of young men!\" is a point that won't travel far because the world is owned and ruled by men, young and old. Of course, most men are poor and powerless in comparison. So they (we) rage against those we do have some power over. Changing healthcare and the culture is necessary. Because healthcare is only effective when men are willing to accept it, not cling to harmful ideas like \"only the weak take meds / do therapy / cry / talk about their feelings / avoid violence\". But it's also like trying to stop shit rolling down hill. Ultimately we need to stop the source of the problems and limit the damage of those that slip through the cracks. And the manosphere and machismo culture are part of the problem, not innocent symptoms. Said another way, the problem is multi-faceted and there is no silver bullet. reply _Algernon_ 4 hours agorootparent>the world is owned and ruled by men These kind of extreme statements just help to feed the divide. Sure in one sense it's a true statement, but it is a very small minority of men that actually have any of this power or wealth you speak of. Why should the rest, including the marginalized men who are worse of than many women (in terms of suicide, working dangerous jobs), not be defensive as a response to such claims? It is completely irrelevant to them that Mansa Musa was the richest person in the world and a man long before they were born. It is completely irrelevant to them that the president of the united states is a man. They don't stand to gain anything from that. Focusing on class is a much more fruitful endeavor because it unites the groups that are actually harmed instead of dividing them. Anything else plays into the hand of the elite, and if I was them I would be laughing at you for taking the bait of continuing this culture war. reply paulryanrogers 3 hours agorootparentFair point, and I tried to call that out elsewhere in my comment. Though IMO it's not entirely a class problem. Males as a gender do have certain tendencies that require (more? different?) nurturing to avoid antisocial outcomes.

If someone would hate you and discriminante you based on an immutable characteristic like gender, wouldn't you be upset and vocal about it and look to vote for someone who promises to be on your side? How can we punish a group of people today for the original sin? >Because healthcare is only effective when men are willing to accept it Most men aren't in the luxurious position to be able to refuse care that's not even offered to them in the first place. Hence the 10x more homelessness and suicide than women. If you're a woman in risk of unemployment, homelessness or suicide, you have dozens of decent options of help available for you both public and private. If you're a man in the same situation, you have much fewer and of lower quality options or even none at all, or worse, a lot of \"help\" available for men is just telling them how they're priviledged and they need to shut up and man up and stop bitching about it. You can't tell me with a straight face there is no gender discrimination and anti-male bias here. >And the manosphere and machismo culture are part of the problem, not innocent symptoms. No. The core problem is societal anti male bias and discrimination which you pointed out yourself in the first phrase.

Since when do women have more job opportunities than men? Certainly not true in most of the US and certainly not for the same pay. Society isn't anti-men. Society very clearly fears men, as both males and females should. Because men are -- as a group -- far more dangerous than females. There are many societal controls to counter act that danger. Until the rich no longer exploit the weak, and leave them powerless and without adequate healthcare, AND male culture becomes more pro-social and willing to accept help, things won't improve. reply Cumpiler69 4 hours agorootparent>Since when do women have more job opportunities than men? It's not about raw absolute numbers but DEI policies in companies and some gov jobs, have made plenty of good white collar jobs restricted to only women or giving priority to female candidates at the expense of competence, which is legally speaking just gender discriminations with a PR spin on top. You are not allowed by law to discriminate job candidates by immutable characteristics like gender. >Because men are -- as a group-- far more dangerous than females Treating men, and individuals generally, as a group based on statistics is just discrimination legally speaking. Imagine saying that society should fear black people because they are more dangerous because statistically speaking they're more likely commit more crimes than whites. That's the same kind of discrimination. Are you ok with this? >Until the rich no longer exploit the weak What does this have to do with the life of average men? 99,99% of men individually, are not rich and powerful enough to cause oppressions at societal level. Lots of global oppression is happening due to capitalist corporate greed which are a collective hive mind, at which many women are also at the helm on boards and help enable this oppression. It has nothing to do with gender. >AND male culture becomes more pro-social and willing to accept help Please share what help are men getting and refusing.

I can see how a manifesto saying \"the truth is, women are [bla bla bla], therefore [bla bla]\" can make sense in a superficial level (and gives twats like Jordan Peterson an air of intelligence), and can be persuasive to incels.

This is unavoidable. Laying people off is not violence. Again, absolutely agree.

In every just society, the debtor has a responsibility as well to not lend money to people who cannot afford it.

Not to mention government bailouts, which really changed the game with regard to balancing risk. reply midnightblue 11 hours agorootparentprevThis is an insane comment what you wrote. I live in a European country with public free healthcare. Sure, you pay a portion of your income towards healthcare, so it's not really free etc. etc. If you don't have income, the state pays it for you. There isn't any denial of healthcare. I never heard about anything like that. Sure, there are limits on availability of healthcare, particularly if it's some advanced or expensive procedure. For example, there is a place where they do radio surgery on the brain. There may only be one such place in the country (it's a small country). If you need that kind of procedure done, obviously there is a waiting list. And certainly some of those on a waiting list must have died. But there is no denial of healthcare per se with someone making a decision to deny healthcare. reply Kiro 8 hours agorootparentI live in a Nordic country and the state-owned insurance provider often denies healthcare, much like health insurance companies in the US. Denying healthcare doesn't necessarily mean \"leaving someone bleeding to death on the street\" but rather refusing to provide certain treatments or medications. This issue isn't unique to the US. Granted, the healthcare system in the US is, in my opinion, significantly worse but claiming that healthcare denial doesn't happen elsewhere is simply incorrect. reply xyzzyz 11 hours agorootparentprevI'm confused, you said that there isn't any denial of healthcare where you are, but then described very clearly and explicitly how some people are denied healthcare, and they sometimes die as a result. Maybe you understand the word \"deny\" differently? reply em-bee 8 hours agorootparentthe big point you are missing is the denial of paying for treatment after it has been applied. in germany (and probably most other european countries) you can be denied treatment if it is deemed unimportant and it is known that insurance does not cover it. you will never be put in a situation where treatment is applied but then the insurance doesn't pay leaving you with the bill unless you were made aware that the treatment is optional or you specifically chose a treatment that you could not be sure would be paid. payment for any treatment that is not optional can not be denied. if there is uncertainty you can also ask your insurer in advance, and they must give you a binding response whether the proposed treatment will be paid or not. most importantly the doctors must inform the patient in advance if the treatment is insured or not. if they don't tell them that something is not insured then they can't demand payment from the patient. you will never face a surprise bill. reply gorororog 10 hours agorootparentprevI think you understand the word \"deny\" differently. Accepted but didn't happen in time doesn't equal denial. reply davrosthedalek 9 hours agorootparentOf course it does. The patients wanted care early enough to save their live. They denied them that care. Hypothetical care after death is worthless. Whether they denied that care by not paying for it (which means people could have gotten that care if they would have had the means), or by limiting the amount of care in a period of time, doesn't really matters for the person who didn't get it. Why do you think the healthcare resources (number of beds, hospitals etc) are limited? Why isn't there a second hospital? By the way, would they have paid for an operation in a different country if space would be available there? No? So they denied that healthcare. reply gorororog 7 hours agorootparentExcept it just doesn't, denial of claim has a very specific meaning, there's no reason to go all philosophical.

That it never denies care? Is it also violence when it does so? IIUC, those are also private companies or at least to a degree. So probably similar to american healthcare, just more regulated. Let's take a look at a 100% pure public healthcare instead, for example La Seguridad Social in Spain. It denies some claims, care, and can cause some suffering and death. The institution is administered directly by some leadership individuals, and to some degree even by the elected government. Those individuals are not driven directly by the \"financial obligation to make the maximum profit\" out of healthcare. However they indirectly are, there are decisions to be made on spending, and budget is not magically infinite. These decisions are hard: you can't make everyone happy and healthy, whatever the result, some people suffer and die. See the trolley problem. So if a public healthcare system works badly, and causes too much pain and suffering, then some of these individuals can also be held responsible. It's just that in practice, in general any public system works more towards the benefit of society than for some shareholders. To be blunt: if the government individuals take decisions that degrade the public healthcare system, for their own benefit, whatever that is, then those individuals should maybe be shot in public too. This kind of violence, terrorism, works historically well, especially if it isn't targeted at random civilians. Democracy is not simply the rule of the majority. It's not a matter of awareness, the public knows how perverse the incentives of private health insurance are, and how a public system can do much better.

Again, my point is that denying healthcare is not automatically something wrong or evil. This is something that must necessarily happen, and so the details as to why some healthcare was denied are very important. You can’t just say that someone being denied care is basically murder, like some people here, or point to some percentage of denied claims and pretend that this is prima facie evidence of wrongdoing.

We as a society has many examples of holding such people responsible for ”legal” and ”non-violent” actions that clearly resulted in deaths of lots of people. Sorry about the rather extreme example and inviting Godwin. But consider for example Krupp (CEO) and Ribbentrop (Diplomat) who were both entirely ”non-violent” people, they personally did not draw a single drop of blod as far as I know. And the holocaust were perfectly legal according to the law at the time. Violence with the stroke of a pen, killing via a rubber stamp, violence through withholding safety. reply ruthmarx 4 hours agoparentprev> vigilante justice (especially against nonviolent offenders) is considered to be wrong. I guess hiding behind the veil of legality and murdering thousands if not hundreds of thousands if considered worse. Rightfully IMO. reply thefz 10 hours agoparentprevBringing justice to the person responsible to hundreds/thousands of deaths and immense suffering is right - was the murder of Mussolini unjust? Hitler's? If the justice system won't take care of it, there has to come a tipping point, IMO. reply lazide 6 hours agoparentprevIt’s so weird to me that people say vigilante violence is so universally abhorred, when we literally have Batman and the Punisher as major draws at the theatre. reply xyzzyz 12 hours agoparentprevBut what he did was objectively what we consider to be bad… in our society, vigilante justice (especially against nonviolent offenders) is wrong. What are you talking about? What \"vigilante justice\"? The innocent victim, Brian Thompson, was murdered by a lunatic. He was not an offender. It was no justice. reply __MatrixMan__ 12 hours agorootparentBy some accounts Thompson was a killer of thousands. reply xyzzyz 12 hours agorootparentUsing such a weasel phrase like \"by some accounts\" means that there's absolutely nothing standing behind this. If there was any concrete thing Brian Thompson did that was any kind of legal crime or moral error, you'd be able to name it. reply __MatrixMan__ 12 hours agorootparentMy intent was merely to point out that it is a commonly held belief, because it seemed like you were not aware. I didn't want to champion that belief. But since you've invited me to name the moral error, sure. Accepting a fiduciary responsibility to chase after profits in a context where that very clearly means finding ways to deny people access to healthcare is a moral error. If you can't ethically do a job you shouldn't take that job. At best you're lying to shareholders, at worst you're killing people. The only ethical path is to go find a different job. reply xyzzyz 11 hours agorootparentThere is absolutely no way to run an insurance scheme without denying some people coverage. No system anywhere in the world, public or private, accepts every single claim. You must deny some claims, there's no way around it. This means that according to you, there's no ethical way to run health insurance system. I disagree, I think we need insurance to exist, and given that someone needs to run insurance, I don't think that taking such a job is inherently a moral error. reply __MatrixMan__ 11 hours agorootparentIt's really just for-profit health insurance systems that I think can't be made ethical. If you have to deny some claims based on resource availability, that's an uncomfortable necessity, but we can do insurance-like things without asking people to balance human life against shareholder greed. It seems pretty obvious that opting into a position where you'll have to do that might make you unpopular with the humans. reply xyzzyz 11 hours agorootparentWhat is \"resource availability\"? In a non-profit healthcare systems, how exactly the amount of available resources is determined? Is there no person involved making a decision that causes the amount of available resources to change? Think about it. Consider, for example, politicians who set the healthcare tax rate. If they set it 1% higher, there will be more resources available. Does it mean that by not doing so, they deny care to some? I strongly encourage you to think very carefully about this. Once you do, you'll find that there are no simple answers: you'll always have limited resources, and you'll always have to deny care to some people, and in fact it will always include some people personally making the call to deny care to some people. Any system that actually exists, public or private, does this. reply __MatrixMan__ 10 hours agorootparent> In a non-profit healthcare systems, how exactly the amount of available resources is determined? You would generally count them. Like, if you have three people in need of a ventilator and you only have two ventilators, then one person is getting denied a ventilator today. > Any system that actually exists, public or private, does this. That's true, and I don't have a problem with it. Tradeoffs have to happen. What I have a problem with is incentive structures that attribute greater success for the people at the top when they create outcomes that involve more death for the people at the bottom. Plenty of systems which actually exist don't congratulate leadership for reducing quality of care. reply xyzzyz 10 hours agorootparentOK, but why is there only two ventilators? Who made this decision, and based on what? Try to think a couple of steps ahead. reply __MatrixMan__ 10 hours agorootparentPresumably somebody involved in deciding budgets, a politician perhaps, or somebody with a rather political role in the hospital. Whoever they are, in most cases they're balancing ventilators against test kits or against hiring more doctors or against letting people keep more of their paychecks, or all kinds of other things which might indeed be more important for the patients/citizens/etc... There's no fundamental reason why they have to be in a position where screwing the people who receive the care would ever be considered the ideal option. But that's how it is when you have a group of shareholders who have no stake in the quality of care. Thompson opted into a conflict of interest which need not exist in order to provide insurance. reply davrosthedalek 8 hours agorootparentMore likely they balance the need to increase healthcare taxes against their chance of being reelected. reply __MatrixMan__ 5 hours agorootparentSure, and that's not exactly comfortable (maybe \"reelected\" shouldn't be a thing, idk). But if the people reelecting you are also the patients then the particular conflict of interest I'm worried about is not present. reply davrosthedalek 2 hours agorootparentYes, that's why NHS is so well funded. Oh, wait, it isn't. Government-organized resource allocation is, more likely than not, bad to very bad. reply xvinci 11 hours agorootparentprevYou are right, BUT: Those denials have to follow contractual terms. I know a local (Europe) real world example where a friend of a friend (insurance company area manager) literally was told \"this is your sum of money on claims that you can accept in this quarter, it cannot go above that\". Which either you get lucky and make the quota, or you screw people over and hope they don't sue. And since we live in a world where the company wants \"a little more\" each year, well.. I don't see how this ends well. The same problem does not apply to our social services (including health insurance) as they dont have to make profits at all costs. reply davrosthedalek 8 hours agorootparentprevI think you need to specify this more. In most insurance fields, it would be possible to only deny false claims. Take insurance of your house. The rates could be calculated that they can pay out all real damages to the full amount. Because the maximum damage amount is limited. That's not true for health insurance, because the total possible damage (cost of treatments) is almost arbitrarily high, so that you cannot pay everything for everyone. I don't want to defend the US system here. But it's not a problem that any country really solved, and one could argue about advantages and disadvantages of the different systems all day long. reply oneeyedpigeon 8 hours agorootparentprevThe line is on why you are doing the denying. Are you doing so because providing the healthcare is literally impossible, or are you doing so in order to make more money? reply thowawatp302 12 hours agorootparentprevI’m standing behind this. I think that Brian Thompson was a mass murderer. His actions as CEO put profit before people and caused many people’s lives to be lost. reply xyzzyz 12 hours agorootparentWhat actions? What did he do? You're just repeating empty phrases to smear the murder victim. reply thowawatp302 11 hours agorootparent> UnitedHealthcare in particular denied coverage for post-acute care, or services and support needed after a hospitalization. In 2019, the insurance provider’s initial denial rate for post-acute care prior authorization requests was 8.7%; by 2022, it had increased to 22.7%. Buck stop with him; between 2021 and 2022 he did that. Being the CEO and all. reply xyzzyz 11 hours agorootparentAnd what's the crime here? What's the moral error? Can you elucidate? I hope you're not trying to argue that insurance should not be allowed to ever deny claims? reply anigbrowl 11 hours agorootparentI think you understand very clearly what point is being made, and are just pretending not to get it. reply xyzzyz 11 hours agorootparentMy understanding is that people are twisting themselves into pretzels to blame the murder victim for something, but they have extremely hard time finding anything explicit to point to, so they just throw allusions, hoping that the reader will complete the bogus argument in their head. Here, for example, the parent poster brings up some statistic that some very specific category of insurance claim denial went up in some period. The allusion is that this is nefarious, and is a result of some specific action by the murder victim. The reader is supposed to interpret it this way. Of course, there's absolutely zero evidence for any of these claims, and when you lay it down like that, it sounds pretty stupid without anything backing this up. reply anigbrowl 1 hour agorootparentIt's a general category (all claim denials) and it did not go up, it more than doubled; as you are probably aware, it's far, far above the industry average. Also you're misusing the word 'allusion' which means 'to refer to something. You probably meant 'implication'. reply xyzzyz 1 hour agorootparentNo, denial of “post-acute care, or services and support needed after a hospitalization” claims is a narrow category, it’s not all claim denials. reply DangitBobby 2 hours agorootparentprevJust goes to show you how incompatible your morals are from others, I suppose. reply thowawatp302 11 hours agorootparentprevWhy not, I pay them. Do you pay your phone company to not provide service? reply xyzzyz 11 hours agorootparentOf course, there are plenty of places and circumstances where my phone company does not provide me service. reply ruthmarx 5 hours agorootparentprevYou don't see a moral error with a health insurance company going out of their way to more than double the claims they deny, not because it's ethical or necessary but because they find ways to do so legally and the motive is profit? Perhaps you're not well equipped to evaluate moral errors in the first place. reply Philpax 12 hours agorootparentprevOk: https://fortune.com/2024/12/05/unitedhealthcare-ceo-brian-th... reply xyzzyz 12 hours agorootparentThe only potential crime that article lists is allegation that the murder victim failed to disclose some material fact to the company investors. Are you saying that Luigi Mangione killed Thomson on behalf of the stock holders, who lost money by holding UnitedHealthcare stock? Your comment is pretty clear example of the attitude around the case. People hate CEOs of companies that must make difficult decision, and so when they are murdered, they will twist themselves into pretzels to somehow justify that they had it coming. reply impossiblefork 9 hours agorootparentYes, but if there were a crime, then there'd be a legal remedy, so any vigilante action would be unjustified. That something harmful is legal or effectively legal is a necessary requirement for a vigilante action to morally acceptable. reply davrosthedalek 8 hours agorootparentWouldn't the",

But the fees aren’t actually changing – you’re just being upsold. Here’s how to keep the price of your subscription the same as it’s always been. Microsoft 365 is an all-in-one cloud service. It includes office software like Word and Excel, the storage service OneDrive and a few other miscellaneous bits and pieces. Until November 2024, Microsoft 365 Personal cost $129 a year, or $12 a month. Now, the price has risen to $179 annually, or $17 a month – an increase of about 40%. The 365 Family plan, which includes up to six user accounts, has also risen in cost by $50 a year. Customers have been told the price jump comes with integration of Microsoft’s generative AI chatbot, Copilot, into office apps. (Think AI-generated images for PowerPoint slides or Word docs condensed into shorter summaries.) But crucially, 365 plans don’t provide unlimited access to Copilot – that requires an extra $37/month subscription called Copilot Pro. Instead, the plans provide a bank of 60 credits per month, where each credit pays for one action that makes use of Copilot. Credits don’t carry over if you don’t use them – the first day of each month wipes the slate clean and resets to 60 again. On a Family plan, the credits can only be used by the primary account, not the others in the household. On face value, a price hike of around 30–40% for a half-hearted implementation of an AI tool seems like a bad deal – at least for some of the tens of thousands of 365 subscribers in Aotearoa. Opting out of the increase There’s one way to stay on your existing plan, but it’s extremely well hidden and requires calling Microsoft’s bluff. You have to pretend to cancel your plan! Log into your Microsoft account at account.microsoft.com. Find your 365 subscription and select “Manage”. Then select “Cancel subscription”. That’s when a new option will miraculously appear – Microsoft 365 Classic, which has no price increase or Copilot AI. In other words, it’s your old plan. Customers are presented with three subscription options – their current plan, the cheaper “Classic” plan and a “Basic” OneDrive-only plan. Customers aren’t told about this option anywhere else. It isn’t mentioned in the official post announcing Copilot integration, the email notifying customers of the price rise or on Microsoft’s marketing website. In all three situations, only the new AI-studded versions of 365 are listed. We strongly encourage all Microsoft 365 customers to consider whether they want to pay a premium for Copilot integration or would prefer to keep the service they know. As it stands, customers aren’t being given that choice. We’d like to thank Consumer NZ member Rob, who tipped us off about this change and how to get around it. You can also get the cheaper plan as a new customer To test whether 365 Classic was only available to existing customers at the time of the announcement, we signed up to one month’s worth of 365 Personal, then immediately went to cancel it. To our surprise, we were also able to access the classic plan at the old price – we just had to pay for one month at the new, higher price first. So, anyone who isn’t currently on a 365 plan but might want to access Office apps or OneDrive storage in the future also needs to know about this “secret” tier to be able to make an informed decision about the best option for them. What this says about Microsoft Frankly, we feel this is a flagrant breach of goodwill and trust for Microsoft’s customers. It’s unethical for a company to automatically upgrade all its customers to a more expensive product they didn’t ask for – especially when customers aren’t even informed they have the ability to opt out. It’s also potentially misleading and a breach of the Fair Trading Act. It reflects the powerful market position Microsoft enjoys in this space. As long as Word remains the default word processor that everyone uses, Microsoft has consumers over a barrel and can charge what it likes for office apps. We don’t think that’s fair and would encourage consumers to consider free alternatives, like LibreOffice and WPS Office. This issue also highlights how tech companies are having to smuggle recent innovations into consumers’ lives because many consumers aren’t willing to pay for new features upfront. Microsoft, in particular, has invested many billions of dollars toward its Copilot product and needs to recoup that cost somehow. Rather than sneaking an extra $5 a month, perhaps Microsoft should focus its efforts on making Copilot valuable enough that its customers will actually be willing to pay for it. The wider issue Hiding the ability to opt out of a change to a pricier plan is a textbook example of a “dark pattern”. A dark pattern is when a user interface is designed to trick users into making choices they wouldn’t otherwise make. Other instances include preselected tick boxes for extras like extended warranties when shopping online or services such as gyms that can be joined online but only cancelled in person. This particular practice is likely in breach of our country’s consumer law, but most dark patterns are legal. The Australian federal government is currently consulting on a ban of unfair trading practices, which will prohibit many dark patterns, including subscription traps, dynamic pricing and hidden fees. There’s no immediate plan for a similar piece of legislation in Aotearoa, but we’d like to see the same protections introduced here. Dark patterns have become a particularly pressing consumer issue in the wake of subscription models taking over many industries, including the “software-as-a-service” trend that Microsoft 365 is a part of. We don’t think a business should have to use deceptive designs to sell its products. Using dark patterns, like Microsoft is doing in this instance, suggests a company that doesn’t believe its products are good enough to stand on their own in the market.

    "commentBody": "You don't have to pay the Microsoft 365 price increase (consumer.org.nz)353 points by lancewiggs 18 hours agohidepastfavorite208 comments gwerbret 17 hours agoI feel that convincing people to pay monthly/yearly for something that has minimal monthly recurring expenditure/investment from the provider (unlike utilities, streaming services, etc.) is one of the biggest cons of the modern era. I have Office 2010 on an old computer. While it lacks some modern features of Microsoft 365 (for example, Office 2010 is much, much faster), it still works seamlessly with any files I create in 365. And I only had to pay, once, about the same amount that Microsoft is charging for a year's use of the same suite in the present day. So they throw in a few gigs of OneDrive to supposedly justify the cost? That vendor lock-in is obviously part of the con (see for instance the complete and very deliberate lack of portability of documents created in OneNote, if you don't have the Professional/Enterprise version). And there are innumerable better services out there, many of which are even free. reply aetherspawn 17 hours agoparentWe use so many SaaS I'm not sure it's worth resisting anymore. Microsoft 365. Can't exit because: it's our SSO provider, also it's cost competitive with all the other email providers and you can't self-hosted email because sender reputation is too important in business. Job tracking system. Can't exit because: it integrates with our cloud accounting software and getting that to link up with anything self-hosted is virtually impossible. Freshdesk. Can't exit because: we could get off the ticketing system, but the knowledge base is hosted here as well, and that's publicly accessible. Miro. Can't exit because: needs to be cloud hosted to share boards with customers, probably not worth hosting it considering costs involved and feature gaps with open source version. This probably costs us like $2-3,000/yr per employee, sure, but wages are like 50x that these days. On the business continuity side of things using a bunch of SaaS does make me nervous, but if you have to have to rely on APIs connecting everything and throwing SSO around the place, can you really escape being held hostage to it all? I think what it would take to escape SaaS is to go back to paper filing, and I think that would be more expensive than the money saved by the cross-integration of SaaS, for example manually copying bank lines from statements from several banks would take a good part of a day. Manually distributing copies of documents around the office would mean we get less work done. Manually backing-up everything probably costs more in external hard drives and time than it saves in SaaS fees. I write this while holding back tears (:/) that things have come to it. reply achrono 6 minutes agorootparent>but wages are like 50x that these days How is that even comparable? Said wage earners aren't even getting to choose which tool they use; let alone those two expenses being remotely comparable in qualitative terms. reply baobun 4 hours agorootparentprev> and you can't self-hosted email because sender reputation is too important in business. It is not uncommon to self-host everything except the outgoing sending. So you can mostly bring it all home without tackling sender reputation. > Freshdesk. Can't exit because: we could get off the ticketing system, but the knowledge base is hosted here as well, and that's publicly accessible. This can be done. The knowledge base sounds like some of the easier things to migrate tbh. Why the need to go to paper filing? Airgapped servers are a middle ground. But I guess your deeper issue is one of organizational culture norms, not of technical limitations or challenges... Which I hope can be encouraging. It's all doable if you (plural) actually want it. One path is to start with setting up contingency systems. Continously sync all mail to your own infra so you can access mailboxes even if o365 is unavailable. Mirror the knowledge base. Forward ticket mails to a duplicate archive (obviously potential caveats around PII and security here). reply jazzyjackson 20 minutes agorootparentI’m on Team Airgap but I would expect that bringing on dedicated devops staff to maintain internal systems would blow away any cost savings and leave you at higher risk for downtime if the one Linux Wizard you hired to set it all up leaves for greener pastures. At least the SaaSs have a higher bus factor. And then you have your security risks of duplicating your access control. So you mirror all your employees emails, now you have to make sure only administrators have read access and avoid ever exposing that system to the internet and prevent exfil. I’m thinking of how to do this for a friends company and the amount of stuff that a SaaS takes care of is staggering. Right now I’m stuck on learning to be my own root CA to distribute client certificates for mTLS so I can avoid relying on third party SSO/auth. reply ajb 16 hours agorootparentprevI remember the days before SaaS. Sure we paid only once and self hosted services with open source, but we also needed a full time sysadmin/IT person for a 12 person startup. I'm not sure it worked out cheaper. reply dijit 16 hours agorootparentOut of interest, who's managing your mail, accounts, purchasing and computer setup now? reply scarface_74 13 hours agorootparentYou pay $25 a seat to either Google (GSuite) or Microsoft. There is nothing to manage but signing into the account. As far as computer purchasing, my latest employer had my computer shipped directly from Apple. Once I got it, I installed the mandated MDM software. reply zie 13 hours agorootparentYou clearly have never dealt with their support system(s). You still need a geek or geek adjacent person. Their stuff breaks all the time in weird and wonderful ways and someone local has to figure that out and send trouble tickets in to the vendor(s). With Google, you pretty much can't get support, even if you are a paying customer, so you absolutely have to have your own human, if only to tell you: You can't use Google that way... With MS you can get support, but you pay extra for it, and it's hit and miss as to how useful it is. With Apple, you get support. It's generally pretty good, but can occasionally fail. reply scarface_74 13 hours agorootparentWhat do you think can “break” with logging in to your Google account and using GSuite? It’s basically the same thing as the consumer version. It’s the same with O365. reply zie 3 hours agorootparentGoogle closing your account for some random reason. Their API's being maliciously compliant. Their systems being down. Browser/client compatibility issues. Network/connectivity issues, etc. Users being stupid, using and holding it wrong, etc. Just because you haven't had any bad experiences with Google, MS, Apple, etc doesn't mean it's a rosy world where everything works all the time. reply scarface_74 3 hours agorootparentHave you seen any reports of Google randomly closing business accounts? What do you think the reliability of Google’s servers compared to an in house managed server? Have you ever known GSuite not be available with Chrome? As far as network/connectivity, how is that a Google problem if your office can’t connect to the internet? reply frizlab 12 hours agorootparentprevThere are many ways in which a cloud suite can fail. I was the guy zie is talking about for many years though it was not my main job. reply aembleton 8 hours agorootparentCan you name any of these ways in which a cloud suite can fail? reply pas 6 hours agorootparentpayment doesn't go through, for example. because the CEO/founder's card has a limit. we had this ~10 years ago where I was also the aforementioned IT guy for on-offboarding, doing whatever needs to be done for marketing, to set one more TXT record, to add one more email alias, to host one more PDF file, and so on. because this is typical when you are at the size that you have a lot of SaaS subscriptions and you need to manage them, but still way too small to have institutional muscle memory (with semi-dedicated long-hauler folks, proper enterprise accounts with good separation of concerns/controls). reply scarface_74 5 hours agorootparentThat’s not a technical problem or one unique to SaaS. Someone has to be responsible for onboarding and off boarding and making sure suppliers and vendors are paid. A lot of the HR stuff ironically can also be handled by a PEO for small businesses. https://www.rippling.com/aso While your employer as far as hiring, firing, internal management is your actual company. As far as health benefits and payroll taxes you are “co employed” by the PEO reply baobun 4 hours agorootparentprevMisconfiguration and skill issues (aka poor docs). IME not a big difference vs 99% of the failures of business IT systems in general... reply lostlogin 10 hours agorootparentprev> It’s the same with O365. If you have a company on O365 and don’t ever need IT support, you either have a very very small company or are living the dream surrounded by unicorns.

We set up one spreadsheet where I have read only access so I don’t accidentally delete anything. Turns out when I do make a change, excel creates a locally cached version and stops syncing changes.

CRM vendor says ”problem isn’t on our end”. Hopefully someone at your company understands DNS and MX records and SPF records and SMTP headers in log files so you can go back to your CRM vendor and keep barking up the chain until you get someone who understands how Mailgun works so you can explain to them how to fix their problem. When evaluating options, I’ve learned to ask myself the question, ”how do I fix this if it breaks?” If my answer is, ”it won’t ever break”, I’ve learned it’s always a red flag that says I don’t understand enough about that solution to support it, because everything can (and will) break. reply scarface_74 7 hours agorootparentThis is a mail gun issue then isn’t it?

Or flip it around. Your marketing is using Mailgun, and they just ran an expensive marketing campaign, but none of the emails are going out. Or the marketing person says Mailgun sucks so they just send mass marketing emails from their work email and now your domain is on a blacklist. An employee gets phished and their email sends out spam to all your vendors. Your main supplier blocks your domain until their IT can talk to your IT to confirm your IT has fixed the issue. ”we reset their password” isn’t going to cut it. Your cybersecurity insurance renewal requires 2FA and geoblocking login attempts. Your office manager thinks they maybe figured it out, but now no one in your organization can login.

I know developer tools from Microsoft in the 90's had subscriptions, but I never dealt with Enterprise licensing back then. But, given some of the blanket enterprise licenses I did have to deal with, I always thought at that level it was always a subscription model. I think the shift wasn't that the SaaS model is now new, but that the SaaS model was now also taking over consumer and small business accounts. reply StellarScience 10 hours agorootparentWe used to buy Microsoft MSDN subscriptions, which got us constant upgrades of Visual Studio and other development tools. Those licenses were perpetual - you'd get a disk with e.g. Visual Studio 2007 on it, and you were legally entitled to use that version forever. IIRC if we didn't think we'd need a new version anytime soon, to reduce costs sometimes we wouldn't purchase MSDN renewals. I think Microsoft's licensing 20 years ago shows the prevailing view then was that companies wanted the certainty of perpetual licenses. reply scarface_74 5 hours agorootparent20 years ago, most businesses and consumers didn’t have reliable and fast internet. MSDN came in dozens of CDs/DVDs in a binder. Back then, most people only had one computer and if you switched between Windows and Macs you had to buy a separate copy of Office. Now I can run Office on my Mac, iPad (and pair it with the same mouse and keyboard I use with my laptop), and iPhone. If I’m not near my computer but want to use Office on another computer, I can do it on the web.

The main alternative that we could budget for (since we're an F&B business in Vietnam and many options are too expensive) is the Google Workspace lowest tier.

We'd still have to be making sure people were not sharing huge files by email. reply scarface_74 6 hours agorootparentIt’s different because you also get the complete office suite from Google. Are you really saying the difference between $6/month for the lowest tier that you said is affordable and $12/month for a shared 2TB pool of storage would break the bank? reply jazzyjackson 8 minutes agorootparentIn think they said even $6 per month per user was a bum deal next to $65/year flat for unlimited. raxxor 3 hours agorootparentprevYou absolutely can host your own mail server.

True, but it's not completely new. Decades ago I tried to buy my first car, and the salesperson told me how much it would cost me per month. I asked for the total cost, the interest rate, and even the number of months, and he had no idea about any of those things. I left and bought elsewhere, but I'm fairly careful with money and am always looking for the lowest total cost. Salespeople seem to have learned that many people think in terms of monthly budgets rather than total costs. For them, this monthly billing is a \"service\". People don't have to think or do math. Of course it costs them money and makes the seller money, but it keeps their budgets even and predictable. Sadly many corporations have adopted bureaucratic policies around budgets, purchase justifications, and approvals. At those companies, even though purchasing permanent licenses would save the company money, signing up for monthly services requires less bureacracy and keeps costs predictable.

Desktop software does not impact COGS, and people near universally hate subscriptions for desktop software. File storage obviously has a COGS impact for the physical drives, and no one questions Dropbox/etc charging for their cloud storage (even if the price is an order of magnitude disconnected). Notably, customer support is not usually considered part of COGS, and doesn't scale in exactly the same way as the general variable costs associated with delivering a service. reply gruez 16 hours agorootparent>and doesn't scale in exactly the same way as the general variable costs associated with delivering a service. You underestimate the technical sophistication of the average user. Even with perfect docs, there's going to be 1% (or whatever) of customers that call into technical support asking questions. That's essentially COGS. reply danpalmer 15 hours agorootparentSure there's always going to be someone, but it's hard to attribute a specific figure for support cost to any given sale (you don't know about future support requirements, or for a subscription when do you account for support costs). This is why COGS usually doesn't include support. In the same way, marketing costs vary wildly per sale and are very hard to attribute, which is why marketing is usually not a part of the COGS. reply gruez 15 hours agorootparent>Sure there's always going to be someone, but it's hard to attribute a specific figure for support cost to any given sale (you don't know about future support requirements, or for a subscription when do you account for support costs). This is why COGS usually doesn't include support. By that logic, do cloud companies need to factor storage costs into COGS? Most people don't store exactly 1TB when they get the 1TB plan, and many don't use anywhere near that amount. Does that mean dropbox can pretend their offering has 100% margins? Sounds unlikely. The principle of accounting is that the numbers should reflect the actual business. Customer support costs don't have to be allocated to sales with 100% accuracy, but they can't pretend it doesn't impact unit economics either. reply danpalmer 14 hours agorootparentLook, I'm not an accountant, if there's one here to correct me on this I'm keen to hear it. I can understand that it may be useful to associate customer support costs to accounts in some ways. It obviously impacts unit economics. But none of that is what COGS is about (again, marketing is a major factor in unit economics and not traditionally considered in COGS). COGS is about me as a customer buying a widget, receiving a widget, and the seller having to have made me a widget. That's an incomplete view of a business, but incomplete views can still be very useful. Understanding customer support cost for example must be done over some time horizon, i.e. what's the 6 month post-purchase support cost, which means we don't know the cost for 6 months. COGS is known much faster. As for whether it should include storage, or any other particular piece of technology, for a SaaS business, I guess that probably depends on the business. The important bit for accounting is the direct cost of providing the service. If you're renting out GPUs by the hour then clearly a GPU hour is a direct cost. If you're just hosting a web app and not selling any particular slice of infrastructure then that's probably not a direct cost. Fixed size plan storage is probably somewhere in the middle, although cloud storage is clearly a direct cost. Still, my point is really that businesses should only use subscription pricing when there's ongoing COGS, because that's what people intuitively associate with ongoing value most of the time. reply scarface_74 16 hours agoparentprevDropbox’s 2TB plan is $120.

Haven't used Dropbox in many years. They all just sync files which is what I need them for. reply anytime5704 12 hours agorootparentI’m just one person. So take my opinion for what it is: just my opinion. I started using Dropbox in high school and it has always “just worked”. I use the native app on Windows, iOS, and OSX. It’s essentially a virtual drive on all my devices and it backs up all my phone’s pictures and videos automatically. I can probably count on one hand the number of times Dropbox has annoyed me in the last 15 years. Maybe it’s overpriced, but at least it’s reliable. That’s worth a lot to me. I experimented with Google drive as an alternative in college. It worked pretty well on android devices, but there was just enough friction on other OS’s that I abandoned it as a general file system. My g drive is basically just a graveyard of Google docs that I will never care to organize and random gmail attachments that ended up there for whatever reason. Onedrive is by far the last choice I would make. My only experiences with it are (1) when Microsoft tries to force it on me/upsell me when I’m using office on my personal desktop or (2) when an employer uses it as their approved file sharing system. In my experience, it is consistently the least reliable of the three solutions.

Is the value you get out of Microsoft 365 really that much greater than any of the open source alternatives? So much better that you let a corporation dictate the terms of your computing environment? It honestly makes me angry. And I say that as someone who works in the industry for a SaaS company.

But very little of this is appealing as an actual user. It's basically Office and an inconvenient to use 2TB of storage.

So I swallowed the pill, downloaded all our files (very slowly...) and backed them up properly instead, with a service that will send me a hard drive with my files upon request. reply silversmith 10 hours agorootparentI'm curious, what did you select, and how is the UX? With OneDrive, it looks like any other folder in your windows/mac computer, and the built in gallery of the Samsung phones my family uses will transparently sync to OneDrive. Other apps on Android can also \"directly\" access OneDrive files, but that sadly needs support from the app. And it all is available for access online via browser. My main goal is to prevent data loss if a device is ever stolen / fails beyond repair.

For $6-7/month you get 1TB of online storage, or for $8.25-10/month you get up to 6TB. Their competition (Apple, Google, Dropbox) pretty much all start at $10/mo for 2TB, possibly with paying for a year in advance.

It also makes me wonder what it would take for IT people to finally stop gritting their teeth about having to use, or having to let others use, Windows and start just dealing with the learning curve of switching to some Linux distro. I mean, Windows Recall is spyware. If it didn't come from Microsoft, Windows Defender would be sure to mark it as malicious... What's the name for a screenshot based keylogger I wonder... I used to just figure that Windows was just all some people could use. And if that was the best tool for them, then ok. But now? I can't say that anymore. It's out and out malware at this point.

Yet UGS (https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/...) and Playstation/Xbox development tools only work on Windows, and especially focus on Visual Studio (which also only works on Windows).

Even for certain CAD software I use that has Mac and Windows versions, the Windows version feels so much more performant and responsive. I’ll switch to Windows for anything serious. Also, YMMV, but in the past 5 or so years my Windows workstation has felt less buggy and more stable than my Macs.

My 60+ father also uses Linux for most of what he does. And, yes, software working on your OS is not a minor point. That's the whole reason I used to go with the \"best tool for the job\" approach. Windows Recall is what changed that for me. I can't see using an OS with spyware built in as a \"feature\". In my opinion, Apple is no more trustworthy than Microsoft, so... > It’s a big deal for people who do things other than use a browser, text editor, and terminal. So, the number of video editing, photo editing, CAD, gaming, and so on tools that work on Linux has grown a LOT. It's not just for basic stuff.

At the time of the writing, about 70,000 people were told to evacuate their homes as the fires erupted after a dry winter, and hurricane-force winds howling across Southern California spread the flames over thousands of acres. Some 400,000 residents are without power, and water pressure needed to fight the blazes is reportedly failing, with hydrants said to be running dry. Two people so far are reported dead, more than 1,000 structures have been destroyed, and California Governor Gavin Newsom has declared a state of emergency. The National Guard - along with thousands of firefighters (many of them prisoners working for $10 a day or less) - have been deployed to help tackle the conflagration. \"This is a highly dangerous windstorm that’s creating extreme fire risk – and we’re not out of the woods. We’re already seeing the destructive impacts with this fire in Pacific Palisades that grew rapidly in a matter of minutes,\" Newsom said. \"Our deepest thanks go to our expert firefighters and first responders who jumped quickly into fighting this dangerous fire.\" A crew has been deployed to protect NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which houses top science talent - not to mention the primary control stations for the agency's Mars and outer space hardware. The site is on emergency lockdown and several staff report losing their homes to wildfire. \"JPL is closed except for emergency personnel,\" tweeted the site's director Laurie Leshin. \"No fire damage so far (some wind damage) but it is very close to the lab. Hundreds of JPLers have been evacuated from their homes & many have lost homes. Special thx to our emergency crews. Pls keep us in your thoughts & stay safe.\" Shame about those wildfires.

Control of the Mars rovers and spacecraft will be shifted to the Goldstone Deep Space Network just north of Barstow, California. But generations of scientific data and hardware could be lost. With the fires still largely unconfined, and no sign of letup from the winds spreading the blazes, the loss of JPL is looking increasingly likely. ® Whitepaper: Top 5 Tips For Navigating Your SASE Journey Share More about Climate Change Emergency Services Network NASA More like these × More about Climate Change Emergency Services Network NASA Narrower topics Artemis Hubble Space Telescope ISS James Webb Space Telescope Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Perseverance Voyager Broader topics Earth Federal government of the United States Home Office Science Space Telecommunications More about Share 46 COMMENTS More about Climate Change Emergency Services Network NASA More like these × More about Climate Change Emergency Services Network NASA Narrower topics Artemis Hubble Space Telescope ISS James Webb Space Telescope Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Perseverance Voyager Broader topics Earth Federal government of the United States Home Office Science Space Telecommunications TIP US OFF Send us news",

They frequently give grants to the local organizations running the evacuation shelters. reply blululu 14 hours agorootparentI would second this and say donate today.

Genuinely curious why she is in the spotlight compared to the local officials in Santa Monica?

Did she fly to Ghana when the fires erupted? Is she not allowed to take vacations? Was she expected to magically reappear in California when things got out of hand? Has her responsiveness been extremely latent. reply harmmonica 1 hour agorootparentI think the outrage is part political, but it's also justified. The warnings were in place that the fire risk was extreme. The language experts were using to describe the upcoming weather conditions was \"unprecedented,\" given both the winds and importantly the lack of measurable rain. These warnings were issued many days in advance of fires starting, before Karen Bass went to Africa, and yet, even with these warnings in place, she decided to get on a plane and head to Africa. I can 100% guarantee she was briefed on that, that she had deliberations with her staff about it, and that she decided to hop on the plane anyway. I do think it was a major strategic mistake on her part and I think people are rightly outraged about it. Of course the political part has poured gasoline on that legitimate outrage and that part is appalling since the crisis is still very much ongoing. Of course that outrage assumes you believe that a mayor should be on the scene even if they're not, in this case, holding onto a hose and actively suppressing fire. I personally think that's a fair ask of her constituents. It would be an entirely different story if this was an unpredictable situation, but, again, every expert commenting pointed out how unique the upcoming weather was and that there was the very real potential for massive fires. reply throwbacktictac 12 hours agorootparentprevOk, I understand some of the criticism now. 1.)

Are you lucky enough to be in a place where insurers in California are still operating? Hopefully you can at least get financial situation taken off your mind reply throwup238 13 hours agorootparent> Are you lucky enough to be in a place where insurers in California are still operating? California has had a state fire insurer (FAIR) of last resort for over fifty years and fire insurance is practically mandatory for mortgages so there aren’t many places that are excluded. It’s entirely funded by premiums and has never been bailed out by state or federal funds. It’s not like the National Insurance Flood Program that’s burned billions of dollars in federal funding to subsidize people living in flood plains and Florida. reply bushbaba 10 hours agorootparentMortgage firms demand Home insurance policies which it covers some fires, but not all fires. E.g. if there’s an earthquake and it causes a natural gas fire, you’re not covered by home insurance. Same goes for if there’s a flood and it causes a fire, not covered. I suspect long term fire insurance due to wildfire will not be covered by home insurance policies. As it’s not a “random” event, and instead a risk of certain areas. reply trogdor 3 hours agorootparent> I suspect long term fire insurance due to wildfire will not be covered by home insurance policies. As it’s not a “random” event, and instead a risk of certain areas. Insurance companies cover known risks all the time. The greater the risk, the higher the premiums. As long as insurance companies are permitted to accurately and fully price the risk into premiums, anything is insurable — at least in concept. reply tiahura 4 hours agorootparentprevYour statement is not entirely accurate. Under the insuring agreement of a typical homeowner’s insurance policy, fire—including wildfire—is a covered peril, unless specifically excluded elsewhere in the policy. Standard policies are designed to provide coverage for direct physical loss or damage caused by fire, regardless of whether the fire is “random” or arises in wildfire-prone areas. While some exclusions may apply to fires caused by excluded perils (e.g., floods or earthquakes) or to contributory factors like neglect, wildfires are generally not excluded in standard homeowner’s insurance policies. reply aaronbrethorst 11 hours agorootparentprevFTFY: subsidize people living in red states reply infecto 5 hours agorootparent> FTFY: subsidize people living in red states Please leave politics out of this discussion, it's immature. reply Yeul 4 hours agorootparentLol tell that to Trump. reply geysersam 14 hours agorootparentprevAre there areas of California where insurers are not operating anymore because of wildfires? That's crazy reply jandrewrogers 14 hours agorootparentYes, there are parts of California that are uninsurable against wildfires. Technically they could be insurable but State regulators will not allow insurance companies to raise premiums sufficient to cover the actuarial risk. The necessary premiums are prohibitively expensive for homeowners, but anything less risks bankrupting the insurance companies and increases their reinsurance costs which also must be passed on to homeowners. This is mostly on the California government, since the high insurance premiums are a side effect of disastrous wildfire mitigation policy in California. More proactive and competent wildfire mitigation would reduce the risk and therefore make insurance premiums more reasonable. reply mschuster91 10 hours agorootparent> More proactive and competent wildfire mitigation would reduce the risk and therefore make insurance premiums more reasonable. Or... not building mansions next to forestry? In Germany we have pretty strict requirements on distances, so it's rare for damages to occur. Also, most of our power grid infrastructure is buried below ground, so videos like the ones circulating on Twitter from arcing lines setting bushes and trees alight can't really happen here either. Prevention is orders of magnitude cheaper in the long run. reply friend_Fernando 10 hours agorootparentThe largest power company in CA is in the process of burying its cables. The risk level is not just affected by proximity to forests. For offshore (Santa Ana) wind events, the riskiest areas are the SW bottom of hills and near canyons. That's where the current LA fires are. IMO, a better prevention measure would be to not build houses out of sticks. That's already the case for much of the housing in Europe. Alas, here in the US the colonial and cabin aesthetics still win out, even when fire-resistant options aren't more expensive. Coffey Park in Santa Rosa was destroyed in 2017, and most properties were rebuilt to lower fire-resistance standards.[1] The second little pig just doesn't wanna hear it. https://wildfiretoday.com/2019/11/19/after-the-tubbs-fire-ho... reply jandrewrogers 59 minutes agorootparent> IMO, a better prevention measure would be to not build houses out of sticks. That's already the case for much of the housing in Europe. Alas, here in the US the colonial and cabin aesthetics still win out, even when fire-resistant options aren't more expensive. It is not an aesthetic preference, the US used to construct housing like in Europe through the 19th century. That style of construction was repeatedly catastrophically destroyed by severe earthquakes, killing many people needlessly, and is now illegal in many regions. The US became strict about seismic safety after the famous 1906 San Francisco earthquake[0]. A few decades earlier, the 1872 Lone Pine earthquake[1] literally flattened entire towns of European-style construction; some of these are now ghost towns that were simply abandoned and never rebuilt. When you see surviving old masonry buildings, they usually have been retroactively refitted with steel frames to make the masonry mostly decorative. The regions of the US prone to wildfire are also prone to severe earthquakes, so your options are wood or steel frame construction, neither of which is particularly wildfire resistant but at least it won't collapse during a severe earthquake. Many parts of the US also have to engineer for much higher wind loadings than in Europe. You can build masonry buildings that meet the seismic standard but that requires a lot of steel and is expensive. Where I live, all modern construction is required to survive a M8.5 earthquake; I've never seen a house in Europe engineered to that standard.

It's an extremely naive take on why it happens. The reason most homes in America are wood framed is really down to economics. Europe does not have as vast of a forest stock for lumber as the US/Canada does. Over time we have specialized in building wood framed homes and because of lumber, its cheaper. These homes would have been destroyed regardless of building material. The bigger issue is most of these homes have probably not properly gone through fire mitigation steps. https://www.insurance.ca.gov/01-consumers/200-wrr/Safer-from... reply mschuster91 9 hours agorootparentprev> IMO, a better prevention measure would be to not build houses out of sticks. That's already the case for much of the housing in Europe. The only thing that helps against is hurricanes and other storm events. Once the fire has blown up the windows and embers (or outright flames) enter the interior, it's game over generally. You might be able to re-use a concrete or brick structure after a large fire, but if the fire ran unchecked until it burned out everything, no chance - concrete will have lost rebar integrity and bricks will have soaked up toxic combustion products. reply friend_Fernando 9 hours agorootparentHere in CA, it's more about reducing the spreading speed than about the resistance level once the fire gets there. All the large structure fires in recent years spread at breakneck speeds during an offshore wind event. In these cases, all that firefighters can do early on is evacuate people. reply NewJazz 10 hours agorootparentprevFwiw these aren't really forest fires, they are brush fires. reply ashoeafoot 11 hours agorootparentprevWould it make sense to allow this? The models as you said make it a non viable buisness and where that gap exists scams move in, which the routinely have to be bailed out by the public. reply ramshanker 6 hours agoparentprevWhat was the major building material? Wood or Concrete? I hear wood houses are a lot more popular in US. Sorry for your loss. reply jandrewrogers 46 minutes agorootparentHouses almost all use wood framing. Rarely they use steel framing, which is more expensive and provides worse insulation. None use concrete or masonry because it is illegal to build a house that will collapse during a M7-8 earthquake. Like Japan, construction style in the western US is driven primarily by the requirement to be extremely seismic resistant, since that is a predictable and unavoidable risk. In Southern California, it is typical to have tile roofs and stucco exteriors, which helps protect against the embers that will rain on your house during a major wildfire. reply gcanyon 5 hours agorootparentprevMost houses in the US are made of wood. In Los Angeles they often have tile/concrete roofs, but I've read that in a situation like this the problem is the vents under the edge of the roof that lead into the attic: if anything burning gets through there, the house is toast. Source: used to live in a Los Angeles hilly suburb. If the fires get to where I used to live, that house will definitely burn despite having a cement tile roof. reply throwup238 4 hours agorootparentInsurers require ember resistant vulcan vents and the like now. It’s a relatively minor upgrade for most homeowners since its just a mesh over the vent. reply onemoresoop 4 hours agorootparentWould that have stopped this fire from spreading? reply diggan 4 hours agorootparentConsidering that winds both made the spread a lot further, faster and moving around fuel (trees/wood/material blowing around and ending up on streets and whatnot), it sounds unlikely any 1 solution would have prevented this. reply bamboozled 18 hours agoparentprevSorry friend, may your new place be even better. reply sapphicsnail 20 hours agoprevI was in Pacific Palisades when the fire started yesterday.

I was in a grocery store and I didn’t see anything burning. 2 minutes into the store, another person came in saying they saw smoke a few blocks away. I immediately left the store and went back to the car. Before I could leave the parking lot, everything around me was on fire, there was smoke so dense I couldn’t see anything beyond 10 feet and I genuinely thought I was going to die, if not in the fire, then in an accident.

Some of the strongest Santa Ana winds in a century reply bragr 20 hours agoparentprevI have a good view of the smoke column from Brentwood. I've also never seen a fire spread that fast. Same thing, in about an hour it went from a small fire to the smoke blocking out the sun. As a testament to the speed of the winds, I've never seen a smoke column visually move so quickly. Usually at that size and distance, they feel more like static objects. Edit: I'm preparing to evacuate tonight in case the order comes through. Checking the most recent maps, the fire has burned through almost all of the Palisades and is getting into Brentwood. The fire may also reach Santa Monica at this rate.

Reminds me of a video (part of series), titled \"Why American Cities Are Broke - The Growth Ponzi Scheme\". Previous HN submission and discussion: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32495647 TLDR: Suburban and certain commercial development is money-loser because tax-revenue is way under the long-term costs of the infrastructure to support it, and already denser areas (including the housing of poorer people) are subsidizing spread-out/richer zones. reply xyzzyz 3 hours agorootparentThis is just false, and a quick look at any municipal budget is enough to confirm it. Infrastructure costs are small fraction of spend of any municipality. It’s typically under 10%. Making infra spend twice aa efficient will only increase ability to spend by 5%, which is equivalent to two years of revenue growth. The growth Ponzi scheme people say that it’s all deferred maintenance and in long term it will collapse, but it simply has not happened anywhere, even in places where suburban development pattern has existed for three quarters of a century. reply colechristensen 14 hours agorootparentprevNot every city is drowning in those kinds of liabilities. reply friend_Fernando 8 hours agorootparentprevLocal governance in general is FUBAR. Here in CA, housing supply policies from the legislature have gotten a lot better in recent years, but construction still gets bogged down at the local level. Most budgeting should be moved to the state level, IMO. It's crazy for Western Springs, Atherton and Beverly Hills to waste money while Chicago and Oakland fall behind. If some magnates decide to move to Texas as a result, good riddance. The dependence on property taxes is particularly perverse, as it incentivizes the housing pyramid scheme. reply rayiner 5 hours agorootparentWhy would you want more decisions to be moved up to the state level, where officials will be elected by a low-information statewide electorate, instead of a local level, where there’s at least hope of an informed electorate that’ll hold the government accountable? That’s certainly been my experience living in a well-run county in Maryland. This guy is my county executive: https://www.aacounty.org/pittmanandfriends. I trust him to make sure our trash gets picked up on time and to keep the community safe. I certainly don’t trust the Maryland government to do that. reply friend_Fernando 4 hours agorootparentIt's not so much an informed electorate as a rent-seeking one.[1] The regulatory capture [2] of obscure local boards is much easier than that of state agencies. Voters who are part of a special interest group are much more aware of what and who they're voting for. The prime example are landlords and homeowners. They have managed to strangle the supply of housing to inflate prices, creating the crisis we're in now. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture reply rayiner 3 hours agorootparentThe home ownership rate in my county is 75%, so “landlords and homeowners” is the vast majority of the population, not a “special interest group.” And your point doesn’t contradict mine. The homeowners in my county are highly informed and conscientious voters, and their decisions are good for most of the people who already live in the county. I agree in certain circumstances, including land use, you want to make decisions at the state level. But for most government services, like education, policing, local roads, etc., I want Kim who runs our HOA to be voting on who makes those decisions and hassling those officials to keep them accountable. reply friend_Fernando 2 hours agorootparentIt's still a special interest group, even if it happens to be a large one. It's orchestrating decisions that effectively siphon money from non-members (e.g. renters and young families), and in proportion to the number of properties each member owns no less. In any case, we don't seem to disagree all that much. My original point was more legislative than executive in nature.

So.. cheers for the update and context, that does highlight a 'loss' of $7 million in training alocation from an over 800 million budget. Do 'we' hold the state of California responsible here for allocating less overall, or the LA Fire Chief for perhaps not making the best use of what was allocated to them. I'm an outsider and I'm avoiding throwing shade, just highlighting the complexity of budget issues.

The literal job description involves running the city based on money they have, including prioritizing what’s important. Fire departments and emergency services are the last departments that need budget cuts. Obviously some blame does also fall on the fire chief, but fire departments are usually well run and from the looks of it, there seems to have been an effort to absorb most of the cost cutting in vacant admin positions.

Should some of the Police budget be cut and redirected? One a portion of total available has been allocated it does rather fall to the Fire Chief to make the most of what has been granted. The challenge appears to be how to make what's available go the furtherest.

(This PDF is great, props to whoever made it for making it so easy and accessible for normal people to read.) If you look at the pie chart on Page 11, you will see that by far the largest slice of the pie is the police budget. It's 45% of LA County's entire budget, totalling almost $2 billion. The LAPD's budget for one fiscal year is larger than most country's GDPs, yet crime is still rampant in Los Angeles. So that's the first place I would start.

What do you think the budget would need to be to handle this? In a scenario that goes deep, such as how water pressure is low because of how much demand is coming from so many hydrants? 100M more? 200M? 500M? 1B?

Just eliminate laws. Meanwhile, people aren't necessarily concerned with the crime rate, per se. There are crimes we care about more than others, namely, violent personal crimes: muggings, felonious assault, rape, and murder. Close on its heels are property crimes: breaking and entering, vandalism, and robbery. Given the crimes the majority of the people actually care about, can we say that the LA crime rate has not gone down? Meanwhile, 20% of the hydrants ran dry in the Palisades. Increased LAFD funding isn't going to change anything about that. This isn't even getting into whether it's reasonable for a municipal government to be prepared to battle a wildfire enveloping an entire region.

It also allows for limited control over how many cars try to uses the same road. Traffic jams become bugs.

The problem is that you can't just count everything you take from the police budget as extra money because even though the police aren't able to competently do a lot of the work they are currently being utilized for somebody still needs to do that work and they also have to be paid. At least initially it would require an investment to get a better agency to start handling that stuff. That said, I'm sure there is plenty of opportunity to cut waste too and in addition to slashing the police budget a great way to recover some tax money being burned by the police would be to clean up the department so that taxpayers aren't on the hook for the millions spent in lawsuits generated by their repeated abuses, screw ups, workplace injustices, etc. Much of that actually would be free money. reply threatofrain 18 hours agorootparentprevFor $2B you could save a lot of lives even through the overpriced medical system.

The spread of the viewline fire was contained, the getty villa was saved, the hurst fire is being contained and they were on the sunset one pretty quickly. There was one in culver city and woodley that they quashed quickly as well. They got the divide fire from igniting angeles national forest and the lidia. The royal fire is about where the 2018 fire was and that was taken down as well today as was the sunswept, freddy, and emma fire. that's the past 24 hours. If you've been following this, they've done a fairly amazing job at knocking out maybe a dozen fires in the past day. Many of these had the potential to be giant infernos and you can actively see very clear evidence of them being contained and suppressed as the fire crews responded. The evacuation orders and rescue operations were also effective and remarkably little life has been lost. On the contrary, with crime, there's things like the 1992 Watts truce, which is credited with a rapid decline in LA street violence, which happened without law enforcement at all. So unlike with say fire-fighting, there's empirically more effective strategies for dealing with crime.

Not only have fire departments seen cutbacks, but so has the forestry needed for preventative measures. What really bugs me is what I find to be a disinterest and lack of belief in vastly expanding the fleet of water dropping aircraft. Letting fires burn to the extent that they have been isn't cheap, to put it lightly. Somehow, a state that is one of the largest economies in the world can't or won't expand its aerial response such that fires of the scale we are seeing become a thing of the past. With satellite technology, it should be possible to identify wildfires as they begin and immediately deploy hundreds if not 1000+ planes to dump water from the Pacific and reservoirs, while drones go ahead of them to confirm that an out-of-control fire is actually in progress.

You don't fight wildfires in 60-100mph winds. Firebombers can't fly in those winds (or at night, since it's close to terrain), and even if they did, that sort of wind will scatter your drop before it has a chance to do anything useful. > With satellite technology, it should be possible to identify wildfires as they begin and immediately deploy hundreds if not 1000+ planes to dump water from the Pacific and reservoirs, while drones go ahead of them to confirm that an out-of-control fire is actually in progress. Great, you've just put out the fire, and kicked the can for next time. Even if it did work that way, it doesn't fix the root problem, which is simply: Many western forests need to burn. Not in the sort of uncontrolled canopy fires we see with this sort of situation, but a lower, \"clean the brush out, candle off some weaker trees, and open up the seeds\" sort of fire. The problem is, for most of the past century, we haven't been allowing them to burn. Wildfire fighting in the US really ramped up and became a capable force with the post-WWII surplus - Jeeps, bombers that could be bought for nothing and converted to fire bombers, cheap spotting aircraft. So, for about 80 years, we've been fighting fires - or, explained differently, \"We've been letting fire load build up for 80 years.\" When those areas light, with most of a century worth of buildup, they go off like a bomb, and your option in high winds is to \"get out of the way.\" You cannot allow endless fuel growth in a forest without consequences - and we're out of runway on that. All the aerial firefighting in the world won't fix that problem, because it's not the problem that needs fixing. reply defrost 18 hours agorootparentWhere I live we routinely do prescribed (planned) burns and aim to mosaic the landscapefuel load regions to break up high load buildups.

CALFIRE has been advocating for prescribed burns for decades but it doesn’t have jurisdiction over all the lands owned by the federal government and the 35 California Air Districts mired in local politics are responsible for issuing the permits for those burns. Lots of NIMBYs who pressure the district boards to withhold those permits for air quality reasons. There’s hope that this series of events will cause them to reevaluate but prescribed burns wouldn’t have helped in the Palisades anyway. reply rurp 19 hours agorootparentprevIt's not a binary choice between expanding aircraft and doing nothing. I have seen some convincing arguments that firefighting aircraft are mostly for show against large fires. Essentially the amount of water/chemicals they can move is trivial compared to land approaches, and the cost is significant. That doesn't mean that nothing should be done, just that the money should be spent on more effective measures. Lord knows I'm not going to defend the competence of the CA state govt and I'm sure they could be protecting against wildfires better, but I don't know that railing about the number of aircraft involved will help anything. reply WillPostForFood 19 hours agorootparentEssentially the amount of water/chemicals they can move is trivial compared to land approaches I'm sure that's correct for many geographies, but most of this fire is burning on steep mountainsides and in canyons without road access, or an occasional dirt road and no water connection.

(How do you fly and aim the water in those winds?) Wildfires are obviously not new, if you're saying the fault is of the administration of the last 10 years, how do you explain that the earlier government for the fifty years prior ALSO failed to see and implement your \"just dump the water everywhere from planes\" approach to the fires in the 90s, say? We're, what, 13 years from terrible financials for the state and local governments that forced widespread major cuts and furloughs and reduction in hours? Everyone who's been hit by those can point to negative outcomes somewhere or other (crime is up! education achievement stats are down! wait times are up! etc) but there's no free lunch here to just have avoided any cutbacks in any area. reply cameldrv 19 hours agorootparentprevBuying more firefighting equipment is like building a dam higher and higher every year as the reservoir fills up, instead of letting it drain out gradually. The natural cycle in California is for there to be periodic fires, but due to the policy of suppression, they haven't happened for 70 years or more, so now when they do, they are these massive infernos. Better and better fire suppression tech over the years that enables a quicker response, like aircraft, satellite monitoring, remote video cameras, etc, has just served to make the problem worse in the long run. reply nradov 16 hours agorootparentThat's not quite what's going on with these particular fires. They weren't caused by excessive fire suppression. Most of the terrain involved is chaparral rather than forest. The previous two years had relatively high rainfall which caused a lot of fast brush growth. This season has had much less rainfall so everything dried out, creating tinderbox conditions. In those areas we have to rely more on clearing defensible space around structures. https://youtu.be/gunenpZ5JuE The forest management issues are valid but apply more to other parts of the state. reply perihelions 14 hours agorootparentprevNot an expert: I think one of the issues is that there's only a handful[0] of satellites with the appropriate infrared instruments, which means that any given point of Earth is only sampled at a multiple-hour cadence. [0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Information_for_Resource_... It's a generic problem for any sensing problem that's real-time + low-orbit. I speculate adding instruments to large LEO constellations, en masse, would solve that problem—though I have no clue if that's practical. (Perhaps if the same instrument were doing other kinds of real-time imaging, you could piggyback wildfire alerts on that datastream, and the get the functionality essentially for free?) edit: More info: - \"Geostationary satellite sensors view the same area of Earth’s surface at all times while polar-orbiting sensors, such as MODIS and VIIRS, typically view the same area of Earth’s surface twice daily. Consequently, geostationary satellite sensors can provide repeated observations on a sub-hourly basis, making it possible to detect fires which may not be detected at longer temporal intervals. Geostationary satellites provide data at 10-15 minute intervals, so they can detect more fire events and capture their growth and change. However, the spatial resolution of geostationary satellite data is coarser and therefore less sensitive to small fires.\" https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/data/tools/firms/faq reply jonstewart 15 hours agorootparentprevHundreds or thousands of planes??? “Federal agencies are responsible for managing 200 to 300 wildland fire aircraft.” - Nat’l Interagency Fire Center, https://www.nifc.gov/resources/aircraft “CAL FIRE’s fleet of more than 60 fixed and rotary wing aircraft make it the largest civil aerial firefighting fleet in the world.” — CAL FIRE, https://www.fire.ca.gov/what-we-do/fire-protection/aviation-... reply mulmen 18 hours agorootparentprevThe wind is too high for aerial firefighting.

These are extremely expensive platforms and while they're useful for fast response in some scenarios they're hardly a complete solution. For these particular fires the winds were often too strong for air tankers to fly. Effective fire prevention and suppression requires a variety of different solutions. It would be foolish to focus on a single issue. https://www.gov.ca.gov/2024/08/26/c-130-hercules-is-now-figh... reply fatbird 19 hours agorootparentprevCalifornia has a problem with overly aggressive fire suppression over the last 100 years creating a buildup of extra-flammable burnable areas. Literally, you need to let a certain amount of burning go on, continuously over time, so that the burnable areas aren't over-fueled tinderboxes that get very hot, very fast. Part of this is using controlled burns to mitigate the buildup, another thing that's been under-resourced in California. I had a discussion at a B and B with a guy who flew F-16s in the USAF, then U2s once they were going to promote him out of flying. He'd just left the service and had retrained to fly Grumman water bombers for Calfire. The problem as I've described it is apparently well-known in the wildfire fighting community in Californa. reply nradov 14 hours agorootparentThat's true in general but not really applicable to these fires. It's mostly chaparral that's burning, and most of the dry brush has built up over only a few years — not 100. We had two years of heavy rains that caused a lot of brush growth, and then this season it all dried out. Controlled burns in that terrain are impractical because there are too many structures nearby and a controlled burn can turn into an uncontrolled burn in minutes. A more realistic approach would be expanding defensible space and culling non-native flora. https://youtu.be/gunenpZ5JuE reply hyeonwho4 12 hours agorootparentInteresting.

But we're talking about a rich area in a rich city in a state that is very rich and I just read an article about some pretty famous people that I've heard off losing their houses that collectively probably have a net worth hundreds of millions (or individually in some cases) that lost their houses. They'll be fine, financially at least. You'd struggle to find a richer place in the world. Some things that crossed my mind: - Affected people probably spend way more on personal security, lawyers, dog grooming, plastic surgery, etc. than on fire safety in that area. I.e. all the extravagant nonsense that spoiled millionaires in LA and these areas in LA specifically are famous for spending their money on. I watched the new beverly hills cop movie on Netflix over the summer (not amazing) that makes fun of that specifically. - Given the string of wild fires specifically in LA in the last few years, how is it that they are not more prepared for this and what genius decided that now was a good moment to cut spending on the fire department? And who voted that clown into office? Oh wait that would be the same people that live there that donate money to all sorts of causes by the bucket load. That doesn't help the people there right now. And I'm sure there are some people caught up in this that are less well off, which totally sucks. But I'm sure charity events will be organized and I'm sure there will be quite a few millionaires attending and performing at these events. But my point is that they don't exactly have a lot of excuses for not organizing the most awesome, best funded and equipped fire department in the world. Also, on the prevention side there is probably a thing or two that could have been done to e.g. clear out areas of bone dry bushes, wood, etc. that are well known fire hazards.

Besides that I wouldn't be surprised if it supports all the required JS APIs and more, just possibly behind some permission prompts. It might work in Foxit as I believe it supports some scripting. Most of the other native PDF renderers are more static, as far as I know. In either case, I was most interested in the browser-native engines, as I always thought of them as more \"static\"/limited. As for documentation on specific features: to be honest, I just looked at the implementations of PDF.js and PDFium. Both only support a subset of the \"standard\" API, likely for security reasons. But PDF.js for example allows changing a field's background color (colored pixels!), and PDFium allows modifying their position/bounding box (I tried a high res color display by moving a row vertically as if it's a scanline, but things become quite laggy). reply KeplerBoy 1 hour agoparentprevI guess it should read intersection instead of union. reply ThomasRinsma 24 minutes agorootparentOops, yeah :) reply internetter 2 hours agoprevAtari Breakout for PDF: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/osnr/horrifying-pdf-experiments@... reply illegalmemory 3 hours agoprevNot only web but majorly all OS pdf renderers support JS.

The CEO and founder of Salesforce told the 20VC with Harry Stebbings podcast that the cloud giant was in the midst of doing its business plan for next year, and Agentforce – the company’s flagship artificial intelligence product – was the “only thing that really matters today”. “30% Productivity Boost” from AI In a long-ranging conversation with the venture capitalist, Marc outlined the reasons why his company decided to implement the hiring freeze. When asked if Salesforce would have more or fewer employees in five years’ time, he said he thinks the company will “probably be larger”. But he went on to say: “We’re not adding any more software engineers next year because we have increased the productivity this year with Agentforce and with other AI technology that we’re using for engineering teams by more than 30% – to the point where our engineering velocity is incredible. I can’t believe what we’re achieving in engineering.” “And then, we will have less support engineers next year because we have an agentic layer. We will have more salespeople next year because we really need to explain to people exactly the value that we can achieve with AI. So, we will probably add another 1,000 to 2,000 salespeople in the short term.” He also confirmed a focus shift in the company which many in the ecosystem have been commenting on for some time: “Everything needs to become about Agentforce at Salesforce – this is the only thing that really matters today.” Marc and Salesforce rarely miss an opportunity to talk up Agentforce, with the AI platform clearly becoming the company’s primary focus in recent months. We at Salesforce Ben tested it out ourselves in early December when the AI became available on the cloud giant’s help portal. Our reviewer reported mixed results, finding that experienced Salesforce professionals who provided clear and detailed instructions could find use in it, while more entry-level people might make poor choices and accumulate technical debt from following an agent’s instructions. READ MORE: Agentforce Is Now Available on Salesforce Help: But Is It Actually Helpful? Winter Is Coming… While December is a time of celebration for many, it may be slightly less so for people working at Salesforce – which has been known to let staff go at the start of the year. In January 2024, we reported how the ‘mothership’ was laying off 700 workers – roughly 1% of its 70,000-strong global workforce. This was no doubt heartbreaking news for many of those affected, but it was a drop in the bucket compared to the previous year’s lay-offs. In January 2023, Salesforce Ben reported how the cloud giant was letting go of 7,000 people – roughly 10% of the entire company. At the time, CEO Marc Benioff sent a letter to employees saying that they had “hired too many people” during the coronavirus pandemic. Tech giants like Salesforce saw huge demand for their services throughout the COVID-19 outbreak, with cloud services providing much-needed remote working options for businesses amid stay-at-home orders. As Marc himself wrote in his letter to employees: “As our revenue accelerated through the pandemic, we hired too many people leading into this economic downturn we’re now facing, and I take responsibility for that.” Final Thoughts It remains to be seen whether Salesforce’s campaign of staff cutting following the COVID pandemic has well and truly come to an end, though nervous Salesforce staff might take solace in Marc Benioff’s words that the company will “probably be larger” in five years. Still, with January approaching, no doubt some ‘mothership’ team members will be anxious that 2025 will see a repeat of the layoffs of the previous two years. And if the Agentforce productivity bump means no further software engineers, what else might it mean? The Author Henry Martin Henry is a Tech Reporter at Salesforce Ben.

I work for a SaaS that has added a lot of features during the years, but the product 2 years ago could probably easily be created by a single dev in a couple of months and could be sellable as a product to a subset of the market today. The reason why I don't create a simplified version of the SaaS and sell to customers is that the sales process itself is actually the hard part. You may get some sales from ads or phone calls, but you often need to sell it in person if you want to have enough customers to cover all the expenses.

That being said, if you want some recommendations I'd suggest Tyler Cowen [1] as a good clearinghouse for topical ideas and John Cochrane [2] as an interesting read.

This definitely reads more like a “everything is going AWESOME ignore anything else you hear about us” PR-ese. I read this as messaging to shareholders more than anyone else (and sure some word-spreading about the product). reply jrockway 14 hours agorootparentYeah, it's just an ad for Agentforce. They have been aggressively advertising on TV lately. One ad shows a restaurant seating customers in the rain because they aren't using AI. The other ad shows someone buying clothes that don't match because AI wasn't suggesting them. (They also serve the customer shrimp, which he doesn't like.) Looking at weather forecasts and rescheduling reservations has nothing to do with AI, and I doubt AI can do anything other than write the \"we're sorry\" message. (Additionally, most restaurants simply ask what food you want before preparing it, so they don't have to worry about feeding you something you don't want.) Meanwhile, choosing matching colors for multiple articles of clothing is at most a satisfiability problem, which again has nothing to do with AI. I also doubt the sales floor staff needs any help with that. There are a fixed number of SKUs and colors. If a customer says \"I like this shirt, can you suggest pants\", I feel like 98% of adults would be able to competently assist. They also don't get paid very much, so it's unclear what the Salesforce value add is there. IBM also does a bunch of AI advertising and the gist is that it is being used for air traffic control. Somehow, I doubt that. If AI could replace one pilot on 10% of flights, the airlines would make millions of dollars. They all still have 2, though. I'd love to see a case study from someone other than the AI vendor. The ideas in the TV commercials aren't even good. Would love to see \"well actually we're making a ton of money thanks to these products\". The reason we're not seeing it is because it isn't happening. reply ArnoVW 10 hours agorootparentLike you I am highly skeptical of bullish AI narratives, even if AI clearly represents value. However, your analysis has one flaw.

(Operations cost) Very different from the software dev who gets paid today for revenue that might come in in two years. (Capital cost) The average person has no idea of how capital sees the world. A worker feels resentful if they get paid less per hour of input, a capitalist feels resentful when they get paid less per dollar of investment. The Marxist viewpoint that they conflict directly is quite wrong: operations costs can be passed on to the consumer, but a capitalist is going to have to negotiate with their investors if they are having trouble with the bang/buck ratio of their investments.

Executives will happily jump at any excuse to lower wages, cut jobs, and pocket the money they saved while raising their prices.

Sure, but I don't care about these companies - I care about my career and the opportunities available to me in the next 1-5 years. If these opportunities are tainted by false claims about AI capabilities - that is a huge problem to me. It is irrelevant to me whether the company eventually suffers for it, because that doesn't reimburse my \"damages\" (if they exist). I agree with you though, and to be clear I absolutely do not believe this is anything but marketing hype - If anyone was actually doing what they claimed we'd be seeing evidence of it. I have yet, to this day, to see any evidence of such claims.

These kinds of tools cover 80% of what you want to do out-of-the-box. For the remaining 20% to build it correctly you need to either hire expensive consultants or hire in-house staff to build. Nobody budgets properly for this, and it isn't in the sales pitch, and so that last 20% is built as horrible spaghetti code by the cheapest possible devs / consultants. Even if you wanted to pay good salaries and hire people in-house how many great engineers want to be limited to programming in Apex on salesforce? reply gregw2 18 hours agorootparentprevI've only been involved with such Salesforce integrations at one company, but based on that, I can give you my take. I'd be interested to hear others'. One, the salesforce data changes all occur through APIs (ok) which various enterprise integration tools (Informatica, Mulesoft, etc) support (ok), but those tools typically dont support easy options for retrying a change to a specific row that causes an error. If you are updating 100 Accounts in a single Salesforce Bulk API call and \"5\" are busy/locked, you have to build a lot of custom error handling to notice and retry just those 5 rows. Its not part of most connectors or python libraries I've seen. Also, 3 of those errors might be fatal and 2 might be retriable but you have to learn which are which or blindly retry them all. In database terms, their API transactional semantics are not statement by statement ACID but row by row within an API request. Second, no API or SOQL operations can pull back or process or update more than 50,000 rows. Given those two things, unless the integration person is skilled about both error handling and testing, some of the object busy/contention failures only show up in production traffic with many jobs going on so a generic integration specialist doesn't know about these Salesforce-specific pitfalls and they are discovered after the integration goes live under strange production access patterns. EDIT: a third issue is that most Salesforce developers are UI-centric in their thinking and training and don't have database or data modeling or data integration experience to draw on so the troubleshooting for data issues on their end tends to suffer. reply rawgabbit 17 hours agorootparentI have been there and done that. In a complex SF org with a lot of triggers, any record update will get blocked. The only solution is to refactor all the apex triggers processes and flows to something more orderly. Technically it is doable. Politically it is almost impossible. SF is an ERP in most companies and touches every department. reply chasd00 17 hours agorootparentSalesforce definitely makes it easy to screw yourself with customization. It’s a very complex beast. reply chasd00 17 hours agorootparentprevThe regular REST api has request scoped transactions. Only the bulk api has the issues you describe. The bulk api is kind of a special thing annyway and has its quirks. The regular REST api works more like what you’d expect. reply gregw2 7 hours agorootparentGreat point. That said, the remaining problem is that regular API calls dont scale/perform well for integrations between systems involving lots of data syncing. A few records? Fine. Many? Not so much. I would love to be wrong on this. reply chasd00 5 hours agorootparentYeah pushing or pulling large, according to salesforce, numbers of records is definitely harder than it should be. On the “push” side you have row lock errors and no way to disable APEX based triggers unless you’ve designed that into the code itself. On the pull side, if you’re trying to extract a large number of records and your soql query times out you’re out of luck. SF is good about creating custom indexes for you through a support case but it takes time. Even then, on the order of millions of records it’s still difficult. My day job is implementing large SF projects. Multi-million record data migrations arent unusual. Even if the data is clean and mapped the migrations take weeks of planning. We go over every inch of the setup to make sure we have the best chance of getting a clean load on try #1. However, we schedule for 3 trial loads and verification before a “go live load” into actual production. Even after all that it’s still an all nighter with contingency plans and c-suite cell numbers on deck. reply maxfurman 17 hours agorootparentprevSalesforce has the ability for users to define their own bespoke data models. This modeling is nearly always done by sales people who may or may not be good at sales, but are almost never good at data modeling - not an insult, simply stating that data modeling isn't their job - and so the models are almost always a mess. The problems flow from there reply rawgabbit 17 hours agorootparentprevThe actual Salesforce core products are very good. Their documentation is well written.

I understand there's cynicism at multiple levels. The cynicism about AI's capabilities is well understood, we're at the peak of the hype cycle. People are selling AI across the board, but the reality will fall short of the sales pitch in innumerable ways across the board whether that be programmer productivity or anything else. Then there's the meta cynicism about the sales pitches of AIs, reinforced my CEOs speaking to wall street about how AI will enable staff reductions. The rank and file is understandbly very angry about this, coupled with the understanding by technical folks that AI is far from being able to replace the function of actual deep-thinking humans. This is when the temptation to minimize the value of executives and \"call their bluff\" comes in. But here is where you need a dose of reality. Executives aren't stupid as you think, they don't get paid what they do for no reason, and despite the bad and anti-humanitarian decisions they make in the name of shareholder, they actually can't be replaced by AI. Both executives and boards understand this and so it's not really a topic of discussion. You are free to disagree with this of course, but at some point its just toothless wishful thinking. reply mullingitover 16 hours agorootparent> Executives aren't stupid as you think, they don't get paid what they do for no reason I agree, but I think the reason they get paid what they do isn't because they're highly skilled (not to say they don't have skills, but those skills are mostly good ol' boys networking and the ability to do basic analysis), but rather because they're part of an insular class that protects its own. However, they're expensive and inefficient, and if we're going to practice honest capitalism then the first group to rip that bandaid off and automate away their (mostly) dead weight actually will be competitively superior to the backwards holdouts, and they will proceed to dominate the market. This is of course if we're practicing actual capitalism and not a dressed-up form of neo-feudalism. > but the reality will fall short of the sales pitch in innumerable ways across the board whether that be programmer productivity or anything else Remains to be seen.

AI could largely already fill the role and fulfill all responsibilities at expected level of any C suite or management only position better right now than it could a software or operational position. Their position is fundamentally easier to do for an AI compared to operational and labor roles. They are given data and output a decision or course of action.

I could imagine 30 percent among certain engineers for certain tasks, especially if you use a popular language with popular libraries and frameworks that are well-represented in the training dataset. I don’t know how typical of a codebase Salesforce has. They could also finetune a model on their own codebase or devote a small team of engineers to figuring out which prompts, models, etc. work best for their codebase and process. In theory, those advantages could boost it beyond what testing would typically show. But a consistent increase of “more than” 30 percent across the whole engineering workforce seems less plausible, especially lacking details on how they measured that and uptake numbers. Edited to add: Are they even confident that their engineers are using it consistently? At this scale, that’s not a given. I’d be interested to know whether Salesforce customers have noticed a change in the number or scope of features being announced. A change of this size seems like it should be noticeable from the outside. I’d like to hear from the engineers in particular. reply scherlock 17 hours agorootparentSalesforce core is Java. A smattering of other languages in the mix. I left Salesforce a year ago, their main developer productivity drains had nothing to do with the code base. It's their build process where it takes a minimum of a day to get code committed, even with their git on top of perforce hack which is seriously impressive, but still a process smell, that coupled with massive overhead from when dealing with inter team dependencies and various \"edicts\" getting passed down from on high that blow up any planning. In short, you could have agents that code at 2x but it would have only a small impact on deliverabkes since non-coding processes have a higher impact on velocity. reply Jach 12 hours agorootparentI left in 2020 before a bunch of the new dev processes were made and enforced, from what I've heard since the replacements aren't better and at least half sounded insane. Wouldn't surprise me if core teams have lost more than 30% productivity... not to mention all the low morale.

Those are companies at the forefront of AI investment and if they haven’t achieved that kind of increased engineering productivity, I am ready to bet money on the fact that any other company claiming so hasn’t either. Even if 30% productivity gains are true, they are probably not because of AI.

Large corps likely have some huge codebases of overengineered spagetti code, which are hardly comprehendable by LLMs. But if you want to build for example some new/smaller web/mobile apps talking to various API, LLM can boost your productivity significantly, because it will easily generate ready to use code snippets. reply mullingitover 18 hours agorootparent> Large corps likely have some huge codebases of overengineered spagetti code, which are hardly comprehendable by LLMs. I think it's the other way around, though.

However, with copilot you can just figuratively walk up to any repo and ask \"@workspace what's going on in this codebase\" and it'll tell you. From experience I can say this can deliver results.

Every AI tool I've thrown at it is great at making surgical edits to single files (or small groups of files) but completely chokes if you ask it a question that requires it to understand context across the repo. I'm always hoping that I'm just using the tools wrong, but so far that doesn't seem to be the case. reply taurath 18 hours agorootparentprevBut the second those smaller prototype apps become big enough to need to scale or be maintained, you’re back at the same problem. The whole thing it gets you then is “faster experimentation”, which was something that was /already fast/ if you use modern tools of the day. 1 week vs 2 weeks for a prototype app may build you more prototypes but it doesn’t help when you can’t scale them. It does smooth some of the processes though - AI is maybe helpful for cognitive augmentation for coders, but it’s not going to be building you apps worth a damn. reply spac 18 hours agorootparentwhile I agree with the sentiment that it's hard to evaluate the real gains, it's definitely not just about code generation. Debugging is a a big part of the value, IMO. reply darth_avocado 19 hours agorootparentprevBut, we are talking about Salesforce. reply briga 19 hours agoprevIf there are productivity gains of 30% per engineer, doesn't it stand to reason that hiring more engineers would make the org even more productive? This is like the opposite of 2021 where every tech company went on a wild hiring spree (remember how well that went?). Now in 2025 tech companies are just going to stop hiring anyone. I suspect by 2026 they will have a bunch of slop AI spaghetti code that no one can maintain. I'm starting to question whether this field is worth it anymore reply BigJono 17 hours agoparentSoon there's going to be a fuckload of money in pretending to clean up AI generated code while secretly deleting it and starting again. reply actuallyalys 18 hours agoparentprevI don’t find the claim of 30 percent improvement plausible, but it actually does track to me that you might pause hiring for a time if your employees were suddenly more productive in order to catch up in other parts of the business or figure out what markets to put your new productivity toward. reply WgaqPdNr7PGLGVW 18 hours agorootparent> in order to catch up in other parts of the business or figure out what markets to put your new productivity toward. Product can come up with and design features an order of magnitude faster than developers can implement them. In practice established products have deep backlogs full of bugs and features that never get actioned. reply actuallyalys 16 hours agorootparentIn my experience, while there are some things in the backlogs that a developer can basically pick up and run with, others require input from other roles to actually address or implement properly. And then once developed, you need to test, document, and localize a feature. (Realistically, you probably want to market it as well.) Depending on your design and support model, your customer service teams may need to help organizations implement the feature effectively or may need to be trained on how to answer customer questions about that feature. reply crabmusket 18 hours agoparentprevWhat are you referring to as \"this field\"? reply briga 18 hours agorootparentSoftware engineering, or at least the Silicon Valley style tech sector reply Barrin92 17 hours agoparentprev>doesn't it stand to reason that hiring more engineers would make the org even more productive? Yes, that does stand to reason, it's the funniest bit about it. When you make engineers more productive the value of an engineer goes up, not down. Otherwise we'd have no game developers left after people went from writing assembly to working in modern game engines. As others have pointed out it's obviously just a really cringy attempt at trying to sell their AI software, which apparently isn't smart enough to sell itself reply onlyrealcuzzo 19 hours agoprevLet's say coding is actually 50% of your job (for almost no engineers is it). If AI makes you 30% more efficient at coding (it might if you went from having literally 0 code completion or any form of AI to state of the art, not many people are doing that): * 1 engineer = 50% feature dev (1x), 50% other * 1 engineer with AI = 50% feature dev (1.15x), 50% other So engineers are theoretically getting 15% more done. If your company is growing faster than 15%, you're probably still going to need to hire eng. The real way SalesForce is going to increase productivity is by forcing more unpaid overtime, not by AI. reply dasil003 19 hours agoparentThis kind of math is nonsense, even as a back-of-the-napkin exercise. Engineers productivity is not linear, both over time and team size. In fact there may be productivity improvements just be freezing hiring as adding too many people becomes net negative if the architecture and domain complexity does not support. Also, writing code is not the bottleneck on value, it's making the correct changes that adds value. While AI can accelerate simple and repetitive code production, this could easily add more technical debt and be net-negative producing over time if engineers aren't thinking about the big picture. On the other hand AI could add a lot of value not directly related to coding as it can process and \"understand\" more breadth of information (including code) that can magnify engineers productivity if used thoughtfully, but that may have no direct relationship to coding per se. reply zeroonetwothree 19 hours agoparentprevFWIW various studies find that software engineers spend about 25% of their time coding on average. reply not2b 17 hours agoprev“As our revenue accelerated through the pandemic, we hired too many people leading into this economic downturn we’re now facing, and I take responsibility for that.” I wish CEOs would avoid such phrasing unless \"take responsibility for that\" involves some personal penalty, like a lower bonus or some other way to compensate for the fact that a bad decision cost the company money. reply ncr100 17 hours agoparent50% of their net worth..? reply JCM9 19 hours agoprev+400% engineering time and effort because of the bloated mess Salesforce has become, then -30% because of “AI productivity”.

So, we will probably add another 1,000 to 2,000 salespeople in the short term Sounds like a nightmare. Replacing engineers with sales people trying to sell the AI. The pressure to sell is going to be tremendous, they hype will be incredible. And at the same time they are at a huge risk of sailing into the winds of the AI valley of disillusionment. Studies have shown that so far customers already find AI sales pitches a significant turnoff. They better hope customers really want whatever their AI actually does or their competitors are going to skate right past them with real actual products and features. reply troyvit 3 hours agoprevJudging by what I have to deal with in Salesforce this shouldn't pose much of a problem.

I mean, when having the best software engineers doesn't make the difference anymore because every company can afford the AI doing their job, presumably at comparable efficiency? reply layman51 15 hours agoprevI have experience working with the Salesforce platform via the “Power of Us” program where nonprofits can get a discount and some free user licenses. It is interesting how much the platform has changed from the perspective of an “Admin”. I have frequently heard from others that compared to the past, it is much more difficult to for a staffer to implement it, especially if it’s not their primary role or they don’t have a technical background. Apparently there are failed implementations at for-profit customers too which sounds super odd considering how expensive it all is and the consulting partner ecosystem. reply TZubiri 14 hours agoparentWhat do you mean failed implementations? Like, they ask for a refund? reply layman51 14 hours agorootparentI think Salesforce’s customers typically sign an annual contract so not sure how the refunding thing works. Maybe they can ask Salesforce to do an “org swap” where they essentially start from scratch. (Some configuration options in the Salesforce platform are irreversible or difficult to undo. Example: Enabling “person accounts” in the data model.) What I meant by failed implementation is when the team that’s in charge of setting it up is struggling to get their staff or salespeople to use it as part of their job responsibilities. The reason why this is challenging is that the implementation team really needs to understand the teams that are being asked to use Salesforce as part of their job while at the same time knowing the intricacies of the platform. Plus, there’s often a lot of integration of systems and data migration that would likely need to happen in a very organized fashion. It is kind of similar to a story I have seen here on HN about Hertz (car rental company) having sued Accenture for a botched project that was supposed to help them improve the business’s website and to create mobile apps. reply TZubiri 13 hours agorootparent\"I think Salesforce’s customers typically sign an annual contract so not sure how the refunding thing works.\" \"It is kind of similar to a story I have seen here on HN about Hertz (car rental company) having sued Accenture for a botched project that was supposed to help them improve the business’s website and to create mobile apps.\" The main idea is that you sign a contract for some services in exchange for cash. And if the services are not provided, you don't need to pay the cash. Depending on who has the advantage, (whether the contract was paid upfront or not), one party or the other can bring it to court, and similarly the other party can counterclaim. In both cases the claim will be for \"Breach of Contract\". In my experience there is no expectation both parts of the contract have equal weigh and requirement for proof. It's not like you automatically win a case if you signed a contract, you need to show that you did the work, that client received what they asked, that you made no fraudulent representation to get them to sign. It's not as straightforward as, \"they signed for 50K, therefore they owe 50K\" Of course this can be solved extrajudicially, through internal processes, but in general these processes follow the same logic as the courts of law (common law in this case), so the underlying legal case law is what shapes these refund policies. IANAL reply nextworddev 17 hours agoprevThe real truth is that there's a lot of 1) excess (development) capacity, 2) and not enough market opportunities where software brings incremental revenue.

I am well versed in all three areas, but obviously I can’t remember all the syntax, and don’t have time to trial and error the changes, and ai reduces that loop.

I found that it is good at snippets, mid-complexity queries, etc., but not so much full applications. Still, I keep hearing people claim that devs are getting ~60% productivity increases.

Jan 8th, 2025 11:00am by Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols Feature image courtesy of the Halligan-McCabe-DeVries Funeral Home. The Linux world will be a poorer place without Steve Langasek. It came as no real surprise, for he had been fighting illness for several years, but Steve Langasek, a pillar of the open-source community and long-time Debian and Ubuntu Linux contributor, passed away on Jan. 1, 2025. It’s trite to say, “he’ll be missed,” but he really will be missed. His untimely death, he was only 45, has profoundly impacted the Linux and open source world. Langasek’s journey in free software began in 1996 when he started experimenting with Slackware. After a brief stint with Red Hat, which he described as “Red Hat purgatory,” he found his true calling with Debian in 2000. He became a staunch Debian supporter and contributor. In 2001, he officially became a Debian Developer, beginning an over two-decade-long dedication to Debian development. While with Debian, he managed the unenviable but crucial role of release manager for Debian Sarge and Etch. In September 2007, Langasek joined Canonical as the Ubuntu release manager, where he helped direct Ubuntu’s path forward, starting with Ubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy Gibbon). His expertise spanned various critical areas, including system administration, software development, and package maintenance. Steve’s contributions were particularly notable in projects such as Linux-PAM, Samba, and OpenLDAP. Beyond his technical contributions, Langasek was renowned for his leadership and mentorship within the community. His patience, technical acumen, and ability to explain complex concepts made him an invaluable resource for developers and users alike. His impact extended beyond individual projects. He was a member of the Debian Technical Committee, where his insights helped shape critical decisions for the distribution. A focus on technical merit and a commitment to collaboration marked his approach to problem-solving and conflict resolution. TRENDING STORIES Mark Shuttleworth, Ubuntu’s founder, described Steve in a blog post as epitomizing “everything that is great about the movement — depth of technical insight, generosity of spirit, rigor in design, care for those who put their trust in us, curiosity about the future and a willingness to do hard work in the face of uncertainty to bring that future into being.” Personally, I didn’t know him well, but he was always one of Linux’s most impressive programmers, managers, and leaders. Dustin Kirkland, long-time programmer and tech leader who’s now product manager at Chainguard, put it better than I could in response to Shuttleworth’s post, “Steve was always a wonderful thought partner, collaborator, sponsor, educator, leader, developer, colleague, tour guide, and friend. There’s no one else I’ve ever known to be as graceful in being precisely correct so much of the time. He always fought hard, yet fairly, for what he knew to be right. And the Debian/Ubuntu world consistently benefited from better results and technology and solutions because of it.” Exactly so. Even in his final years, while battling illness, Langasek’ remained active in the community, approaching his challenges with “stoicism, humor, and science.” His dedication to open-source principles and his ability to bridge commercial and community interests set a standard for future developers. Langasek’s contributions to Linux and open source software have indirectly touched millions of lives through his improvements to Ubuntu, Debian, and other projects. You may have never known his name, but if you’ve used Linux, you owe him a debt of gratitude. Steven J.

This really changed for me after getting a kid. The thought I hope to live long enough to see my kid do X crosses my mind on a regular basis.

It’s not a fun thing to do, but it can save your life reply ANewFormation 2 hours agorootparentThe statistics on early detection are very different than most think. Colonoscopies were one of the only tests with a statistically significant positive outcome, but even that has been challenged recently by multiple studies. [1] I don't know the exact cause colonoscopies are not performing as thought, but for breast cancer it's quite interesting - basically treatment was improving at the exact same time early screening was being heavily promoted. And so years of survival continued to increase in a strongly proportional way to early screenings. Naturally people assumed the correlation was causal, but it turns out screening mammograms are only marginally effective and that women are significantly more likely to receive unnecessary treatment (treating small tumors that would not have developed into large malignant tumors) than to receive beneficial treatment. [2] If screening provides someone with piece of mind, then more power to them, but you're unlikely to meaningfully extend your life.

I found polyps by paying thousands out of pocket when insurance told me 36 was too young and there wasn't enough blood in my stool. That's with a mother having them removed at 19, and older brother having them removed at 39. reply bluGill 3 hours agorootparentGiven your family history they should have been done young. However they are not completely risk free and so for most of us the standard guideline of 50 is good enough. There are less invasive tests that can be done instead as well. They are not as likely to find cancer (which is why you should have done the more invasive colonoscopy), and if they do find anything you have to do a colonoscopy anyway, so for those with less family history who have unexplained bleeding while young they are a good option. Ask your doctor about the pros and cons of them if this comes up. (I suspect once you reach 50 a colonoscopy every 10 years is the right answer) reply bragr 17 hours agoparentprevNeither any of the articles I looked up nor his obituaries name the illness so I assume he wanted that kept private. Probably not how I'd handle it, but to each their own. reply bluGill 3 hours agorootparentDepends. AIDS (this is treatable these days, but I'm using it as an example) would imply a history of something he would want to keep secret from his conservative church. Of course I have no idea what his religion is, nor what he died of. If it is cancer - while rare at his age it happens and isn't something I'd be embarrassed of but maybe he was. To some extent too, you don't get to chose this, those who write your obituary do. Perhaps his wife (I have no idea if he was marred) and him have a disagreement on what is embarrassing and so even though he would have shared this she wanted it secret. reply fred_is_fred 2 hours agorootparentThis is some awful speculation. You speculate that he had AIDS and was embarrassed by his church or that his wife was embarrassed.

    "originBody": "Factorio Blueprint Visualizer I love the game Factorio and I really like the look of factories after growing for many hours or blueprints after tweaking them for perfection. That's way I created a website to artfully visualize Factorio blueprints. With the website you can import Factorio blueprints as text and visualize them. You can tweak the drawing settings or create random ones. All buildings and tiles with their bounding boxes and belt, pipe, rail, inserter, wire and electricity connections can be visualized. Everything is drawn in vector graphics (SVG) to be able to view it in any resolution. With the latest update, Blueprints from Factorio before version 2.0 might not work correctly. You can import older blueprints to factorio and export them again to update them. Usage Open Factorio and create a blueprint. Export the blueprint as text (in the upper left corner, next to the \"Delete\" button). Go to the website. Click the \"Upload Blueprint\" button and paste the text into the text area. Now you can test new random drawing settings (using the buttons or the arrow keys) or edit the current drawing settings. Documentation of the drawing settings can be found here. Examples The last three blueprints are by Josh Ventura and can be found here. Update [2025-01-08] Factorio 2.0 and Factorio: Space Age are supported (Blueprints from earlier version might only work partially) Ported everything from Python to Javascript for simplicity and performance. Added ability to modify drawing settings. Added support for tiles. Lots of quality-of-life improvements. Ways to use this tool Text to Image I created a dataset with images generated using this tool to finetune SDXL (a text-to-image neural network). The model with examples can be found here: https://huggingface.co/piebro/factorio-blueprint-visualizations-sdxl-lora Pen Plotting I have a pen plotter, and one of my initial ideas was also to be able to plot my factories. You can create visualizations you can easily draw. I recommend using https://github.com/abey79/vpype for merging lines together before plotting. An example of a visualization for plotting is here: Another way to create plots from your factories is to use: https://github.com/drawscape-labs/factorio-cli.

That's why I created a website to artfully visualize Factorio blueprints a few years ago. With the new 2.0 update, a few things broke. I took the opportunity to rewrite everything from Python to JavaScript and support Factorio 2.0 and the Space Age DLC. It's now also possible to easily modify the style of the drawings. Let me know if you find any bugs or if you have ideas for features. reply jvanderbot 3 hours agoparentThis is amazing. I did a similar thing for the game Highfleet, until I ran into roadblocks with the dev team. My ultimate goal was to have a \"print poster\" button that would generate the image and ship it off to one of those poster drop-shippers for a small fee. In that game, you can annotate the maps, and the world map with battle annotations is really special with lots of memories of victories and defeats. Alas, no dice. I suggest you do this for blueprints! The first thing I'm going to do is take my favorite space platforms and outposts and make posters - the colored block imagery is really artful. And, if you want a real challenge, you could parse the end-game uploads (galaxy) if available, or save files themselves. Or, slightly less ambitious - a game mod that generates links to this site directly. Very nicely done! reply Pannoniae 59 minutes agorootparent\"until I ran into roadblocks with the dev team.\" What kind of roadblocks? reply jvanderbot 23 minutes agorootparentThere were a few things that were difficult to render properly that made the maps incorrect in ways that would really look bad to a veteran player. Like certain cities not having the right links via trade routes (which is a huge part of the game). I got radio silence from everyone when I tried to confirm the way to correctly determine links. So I moved on to an easier problem. reply piebro 3 hours agorootparentprevI actually printed a few designs and hung them up in frames in my home. Maybe I'll add the idea and some links to the readme. Can you recommend a printing service? I think it's not possible to access the actual file upload using the galaxy hall of fame (https://www.factorio.com/galaxy) or I just can't find them. Otherwise it would be pretty cool. Oh yeah, I like the mod idea. That should also be quite doable, thanks. reply spieswl 1 hour agoprevThanks for refreshing and sharing this again! The visualizations are so similar to integrated circuit layouts; they immediately reminded me of some of the coasters that GamersNexus sell which represent simplified computer subsystems. reply natebc 4 hours agoprevthank you for the artistic contribution to the factorio community!

I think one of the main reasons was, that it's really hard to visually grok the factories from the in game visuals. All the shades of brown and gray made it not really enjoyable either (I like pretty and colourful virtual environments, there is enough gray and brown in the real life). If the game would look more like those visualizations, I might have enjoyed it more. reply jcalx 1 hour agoparentThe Factorio development blog has occasional samples of concept art [0] which are more stylized and saturated than the final, \"realistic\" assets. I honestly prefer the concept art style, even though the more realistic sprites complement the brutalism and grittiness of the game.

It's a lot more bright and colorful, though I think it lacks some depth relative to Factorio, but I think that just makes it more approachable. reply connicpu 1 hour agoparentprevThis also affects gameplay, but your map will have a lot more green if you turn up the moisture setting on world gen :) and you can have fresh green trees all the time in the space age DLC once you unlock tree farming reply tmvphil 2 hours agoparentprevI agree that the visual style was not for me. I had a much better time with satisfactory, which is quite pretty. It also spares you the threat of factory destruction. reply mmastrac 2 hours agorootparentSatisfactory's scale is so massive for building that it was a shock coming from Factorio. I started a project over the holidays and I'm pretty sure it's going to end up at nearly 200x50. I am not sure it'll fit in a screenshot, hah. reply Aeolun 2 hours agorootparentWhen you’ve built 5KM of train tracks just to get around xD reply mmastrac 2 hours agorootparentGuilty as charged. reply proc0 32 minutes agorootparentprevLol, it's funny I played both and like factorio much more for precisely those reasons. It's post-apocalyptic and gritty, and has enemies. Satisfactory is great but I need a threat to stay focused. To each their own :) reply andix 2 hours agorootparentprevSatisfactory is on my list, once I replace my ~10 year old GPU. reply brailsafe 47 minutes agorootparentWhich one do you have? A friend recommended Satisfactory but all I have is a 5970 and an M4 Pro lmao reply andix 33 minutes agorootparent1050ti, which satisfies the minimum spec. But it would probably mean playing on lowest graphics settings at low resolution. reply brailsafe 25 minutes agorootparentMine is surprisingly still serviceable at 60fps 2560x1600 on older games, but I feel like it'd choke hard on this one too. The laptop performs much much better but obvs can't run it. reply Engineering-MD 1 hour agorootparentprevI like the threat of factory destruction. It adds to the flavour, and makes designing the factory not just about pure optimisation reply ddoolin 53 minutes agorootparentAgreed. I started playing Satisfactory a few years ago, before I ever picked up Factorio. And I played A LOT of Satisfactory. Into the thousands of hours. I'm currently at a couple hundred hours into Factorio and I can safely say I like it better. It is way more polished and way more in-depth. It has definitely had much more time to mature and respond to user feedback. Also the threat level keeps it more interesting. But I do find Satisfactory much more beautiful, and I think the idea of having belts go directly into/out of buildings, etc, without the need for inserters, a much better style than inserters. reply bombcar 45 minutes agorootparentFactorio has \"loaders\" but they're not enabled in the default game, but easy enough to add with a mod (some do as part of the mod, some enable just them, some even try to make them balanced). https://mods.factorio.com/mod/loaders-modernized or https://mods.factorio.com/mod/vanilla-loaders-hd or this one made by a Wube developer: https://mods.factorio.com/mod/aai-loaders reply BlueTemplar 1 hour agoparentprevWhen was that ? Factorio has increased its colourfuness several times to make it more appealing : https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-320 (There's also now a saturation slider in the graphics settings.) And maybe again with 2.0, including some more colorful new planets in the Space Age expansion. P.S.: The Industrial Revolution overhaul mod might also be to your liking ? https://mods.factorio.com/mod/IndustrialRevolution3 reply grufkork 4 hours agoprevNice! I might actually try drawing our factory with a shoddy pen plotter I built, could give some cool results. Well-built factories are really pretty, looks like small ecosystems growths when zoomed out. All the draw settings should make it easy to generate some good outlines reply piebro 4 hours agoparentThanks, pen plotting was my motivation for doing this as an SVG and not on a canvas. I never got around plotting an actual factory though, but I might do it this time. reply readyplayernull 3 hours agoprevAlmost full circle from discrete processing element board to diagram, the next step is: circuit design to board diagram to factoring. reply NelsonMinar 3 hours agoprevI like the emphasis on this being beautiful and the pen plotter experiments. There's plenty of productivity tools for Factorio, including several blueprint renderers. This one's special for having some aesthetics. reply bloopernova 2 hours agoprevoh wow this is very cool, I can't wait to use it! Does this work with mods? reply piebro 1 hour agoparentNot out of the box. The easiest way to add mod support is to fork the project and add the buildings from mods: https://github.com/piebro/factorio-blueprint-visualizer/blob...

RIP reply vessenes 59 minutes agoparentFor better or worse, Aquilo is designed to be a limiter against end-game tech. All the other planets you can drop in and get everything going from scratch; Aquilo is there to gate legendary items and railguns and fusion power, essentially, and it’s the first time that the quality of your shipping logistics really matters to the player, esp. through high danger areas. That said, I loved the redesign work needed on Aquilo, it took me quite a while to get the hang of cascading temperature brownouts, heat fluid dynamics, and adding piping to layouts. I found that fun. Eventually, Aquilo can work like any other base, with rare - legendary bots, it can be remotely laid out and expanded as needed; in reality, very very little needs to be built on Aquilo to support even relatively large economies. I’m on my second playthrough, I have legendary-only production lines up for everything but railguns and fusion power and I’m just thinking about adding my second pump jack for fluorine. Anyway, come back to it in a year - you might find it’s fun after all. :) reply bombcar 42 minutes agoparentprevI usually hit a burnout point in Factorio, and either I start throwing down blueprints obtained online (turn it into a resource discovery / train game) or I wander off. reply bigstrat2003 3 hours agoparentprevSame. I didn't like Fulgora, then I didn't like Gleba, but pushed through to get to Aquilo so I could see all the content. But then Aquilo wasn't fun either thanks to the massive amount of ice platform I needed to build and how slow it is to build. I just stopped playing. Overall I was pretty unhappy with Space Age, as it doesn't really feel like Factorio any more (except for Vulcanus which is excellent). reply zelias 2 hours agorootparentI actually found the new mechanics on Fulgora and Gleba very enjoyable. Fulgora especially, for whatever reason. I enjoyed spaghetti-ing my way through all the planets by primarily using the resources available on that planet (\"starter\" rocket full of belts and power poles notwithstanding). Aquilo is just so barren. The new mechanic it introduces locks down player choice, as opposed to the other planets that are rife with opportunities for exploration and creativity. reply unethical_ban 1 hour agorootparentprevI think that Nauvis+Vulcanus you can still build gnarly mega bases, if the full space age isn't your thing. I find fulgora and gleba a bit tedious, but I appreciate that each of them bring unique new restrictions/mechanics/challenges to the game. Vulcanus is actually the least inspired, from a mechanics perspective. Mining->lava. It's a good lead-in to those wilder planets. reply FrustratedMonky 3 hours agoprevNice.

All good things have an end. I really hope Wube could make it more interesting to play in multiplayer, in games of 50 or 100 players, unfortunately there are no incentives for it. I suggested to add some resources trading and currency, coupled with a land ownership system, to prevent trolls and scale the game so that any player can join, but it would probably require some balancing. This game is already 10 years old and still going strong. Unfortunately mods are not very good quality, or too difficult to enjoy. Space age is interesting because new planets are being added by fans, but I don't think they're going to be as well designed and really bring anything interesting. reply kryptn 57 minutes agoparent> Unfortunately mods are not very good quality, or too difficult to enjoy. Most of my playtime in Factorio is with overhaul mods, there's a lot of quality content there. I'm not sure how many of them have been brought to 2.0 or even will be. I'm curious where you think quality lacks. Space Exploration has been my favorite, but Ultracube, Krastorio2, and Nullius were all quite fun. I'll admit I haven't finished Ultracube and Nullius, but I have restarted my Ultracube run in 2.0. > Space age is interesting because new planets are being added by fans, but I don't think they're going to be as well designed and really bring anything interesting. Check out Maraxsis and/or Cerys, these were the kinds of planet mods I was hoping for in Space Age. Maraxsis is an ocean planet and you build underwater and in deep trenches, and the planet's building has a base 50% quality. Cerys is a moon of Fulgora that's really quite small and it's more of a puzzle than anything. reply jprete 2 hours agoparentprevI love Factorio, although I haven't gone far in the expansion.
