    "originBody": "Charith Amarasinghe Jan 17, 2025 So You Want to Build Your Own Data Center Since the beginning, Railway‚Äôs compute has been built on top of Google Cloud Platform. The platform supported Railway's initial journey, but it has caused a multitude of problems that have posed an existential risk to our business. More importantly, building on a hyperscaler prevents us from delivering the best possible platform to our customers. It directly affected the pricing we could offer (egress fees anyone?), limited the level of service we could deliver, and introduced engineering constraints that restricted the features we could build. And not only is it rare that we understand why things break upstream, but also despite multi-million dollar annual spend, we get about as much support from them as you would spending $100. So in response, we kicked off a Railway Metal project last year. Nine months later we were live with the first site in California, having designed, spec-ed, and installed everything from the fiber optic cables in the cage to the various contracts with ISPs. We‚Äôre lighting up three more data center regions as we speak. To deliver an ‚Äúinfra-less‚Äù cloud experience to our customers, we‚Äôve needed to get good fast at building out our own physical infrastructure. That‚Äôs the topic of our blogpost today. So you want to build a cloud From kicking off the Railway Metal project in January 2024, it took us five long months to get the first servers plugged in. It took us an additional three months before we felt comfortable letting our users onto the hardware (and an additional few months before we started writing about it here). The first step was finding some space. When you go ‚Äúon-prem‚Äù in cloud-speak, you need somewhere to put your shiny servers and reliable power to keep them running. Also you want enough cooling so they don‚Äôt melt down. In general you have three main choices: Greenfield buildout (buying or leasing a datacenter), Cage Colocation (getting a private space inside a provider's datacenter enclosed by mesh walls), or Rack colocation (leasing individual racks or partitions of racks in a colocation datacenter). We chose the second option: a cage to give us four walls, a secure door, and a blank slate for everything else. A cage before any racks have been fitted The space itself doesn‚Äôt cost much, but power (and by proxy, cooling) costs the most. Depending on the geography, the $/kW rate can vary hugely ‚Äî on the US west coast for example we may pay less than half as much as we pay in Singapore. Power is paid for as a fixed monthly commit, regardless of whether its consumed or not, to guarantee it will be available on-demand. But how much power do you need? With great power comes great responsibility Ideally if you‚Äôve embarked on your data center migration mission, you should have an idea of the rough amount of compute you want to deploy. We started with a target number of vCPUs, GBs of RAM, and TBs of NVMe to match our capacity on GCP. Using these figures, we converged on a server and CPU choice. There are many knobs to turn when doing this computation ‚Äî probably worth a blogpost in itself ‚Äî but the single biggest factor for us was power density e.g. how do we get the compute density we want inside of a specific power draw. The calculations aren‚Äôt as simple as summing watts though, especially with 3-phase feeds ‚Äî Cloudflare has a great blogpost covering this topic. Power is the most critical resource for data centers, and a power outage can have extremely long recovery times. So redundancy is critical, and it‚Äôs important to have two fully independent power feeds per rack. Both feeds will share load under normal operation, but the design must be resilient to a feed going down. To deliver this power to your servers, you‚Äôll also want a Power Distribution Unit, which you'll select based on the number of sockets and management features it provides. The basic ones are glorified extension cords, while the ones we deploy allow control and metering of individual sockets. Each PDU is accessible over the network and individual sockets can be remotely metered and controlled With that, power is now available in the cage. Let there be light No cloud machine is an island and that's where networks come into play. To achieve the lowest possible latency on Railway, we need to set you up with solid connections to the rest of the world. We look for DC facilities that are on-network with Tier 1 Internet Services Providers (ISPs), that are part of an Internet Exchange (IX), and that have available fiber to other data centers in close proximity. Each cage gets diverse and redundant network links Your applications deployed to Railway will want to connect to a diverse mix of endpoints over the network ‚Äî be it a home internet user in Sydney, Australia or a API hosted on an AWS server in the US. To get you the best possible latency and the lowest bandwidth cost, we contract with a mix of internet providers optimized for each use case. We select ISPs for the maturity of their networks in each geography we target. Partnering with the wrong ISP in a region can lead to extra network hops (and thus latency) to reach specific target markets ‚Äî or in the worst case ‚Äî convoluted network routes. So for each region, we pick at least two separate networks based on their regional footprints. Once connected, we receive full internet routing tables from each ISP and consolidate them on our network switches to resolve the best path for each IP prefix. If you have an end user in Australia trying to reach an app deployed to Singapore, we‚Äôll likely hand those packets off directly to Telstra who have one of the densest access networks in Australia. If that same app needs to send packets to a end-user or server in Japan, then we‚Äôd likely be handing them over to PCCW who peer directly with NTT in Japan and have a dense footprint in APAC. üëâ Peering information is public, head-over to bgp.tools to see how your favorite networks interconnect. For redundancy we‚Äôre building out multiple zones in each region, and interconnectivity between these sites is also critical for our expansion. There are several tools such as dark fiber or wavelength services that we look for to plan this expansion. The result is that your apps won‚Äôt notice if your database is in the same room or if it‚Äôs 4 blocks over in a neighboring building ‚Äî this is a feature not a bug ‚Äî as it builds resilience against the failure of an individual data center. ... Ok, now that you‚Äôve found a space you like, signed a deal with a data center, and signed deals with several ISPs, you're all-systems-go to install some servers, right? Well, not exactly. First you need a bunch of other things to give your server a nice snug home to warm up in. Aisles, racks and overhead infrastructure In a data center, racks are arranged in rows, and the space between racks, the aisle, is used for airflow. The Cold Aisle is where cold air is blown in from the DC facility, and servers in your rack suck this air up and exhaust it towards the rear onto the Hot Aisle. The DC facility will remove this hot air from the Hot Aisle. For optimum efficiency, you don‚Äôt want air between these aisles to mix. A cage schematic - all equipment must be mounted such that fans blow air from the cold aisle to the hot The racks themselves have some variability, even if you opt to use conventional 19\" wide equipment. You can select the height, width, and depth to suit your equipment and cabling needs. Most server equipment can slide on rails to allow for easy maintenance, so it‚Äôs important to ensure that cage dimensions allow for this. Cabling and cable management also requires some space, so there‚Äôs a tradeoff to be made with how crowded you want each rack to be vs. how many racks you can fit into a cage. In our experience, power and cooling is often the limiting factor rather than the actual space available. In newer sites we opt for wider 800mm racks to allow for better airflow by getting cables out of the way of the exhausts. A rack-mount server on rails can be pulled out and serviced in place, each weighs nearly 20kg‚Ä¶ In addition to racks, you'll need several bits of infrastructure to get power and data to your racks. This will likely involve installing some overhead infrastructure and trays that let you route fiber cables from the edge of your cage to each of your racks, and to route cables between racks. This is something the DC operator will throw in when quoting the cage. Depending on your design, you‚Äôll want to optimize for short cable paths by ensuring your overhead infrastructure, rack local cabling, and device orientations align. Because our racks have dense switch-to-server fiber cabling in each rack, we buy switches that have their ports oriented to the back of the rack (these are called reverse airflow switches because they exhaust air on the side with the network ports). This allows us to align the cable trays such that all cabling happens on one side of the rack and there‚Äôs no zig-zagging of cables between the front and back of the rack. A ladder rack and fibre cable tray allow routing cables to racks from above So you‚Äôve got the space, signed up ISPs, ordered the hardware, got the racks, and a pretty good picture on how to lay it all out. But it‚Äôs still a pretty expensive lego set sitting in the loading bay of a data center. To assemble it you now need to leverage the most versatile programming tool ever devised in the history of mankind ‚Ä¶ Microsoft Excel. The rack and stack Let‚Äôs first step back and publish a disclaimer: neat and organized cabling requires a lot of practice; we tried it ourselves first - with‚Ä¶ mixed‚Ä¶ results. Our DIY attempts at cabling to get the first server online vs. what our installation partner put together To install it properly, we bring in professionals, but the professionals need to know what to install. A comprehensive documentation pack is essential. A cabling matrix and rack elevation are common documents that communicate to contractors how to rack and wire-up servers. A cabling matrix describes the termination of each cable, specifying the device position and port for each side of the connection, along with the specification of the cable itself (type of fiber, length, etc). The rack elevation is a visual representation of the rack itself, showing the position and orientation of each device. The cabling matrix for our first install - 300+ cables all manually entered and cross-checked The documentation exercise can be intense, each of our install phases involved 60+ devices, 300+ discrete cables, and dozens of little details. This was all handcrafted into written specifications and spreadsheets we used as a basis for the installation and commissioning. From the materials being on site to getting everything installed takes us about 6-14 days. We have now built internal tooling to automate generating build specifications This all seems very far removed from software, DevOps, or what you‚Äôd typically think of as ‚Äúinfrastructure,‚Äù and that is very true ‚Äî building a datacenter cage is probably closer to building a house than to deploying a Terraform stack. To compound this, every datacenter facility, contractor and vendor will do things slightly differently, even within the same organization. The operational aspect requires you to stay on your toes and be extremely detail-oriented. Some what-the-duck moments we‚Äôve had thus far: Contractor: ‚ÄúWe need longer power cables‚Äù - the PDUs at that site were upside down because the power came in from the floor, so our socket numbering was reversed in the plan Phonecall from Amsterdam: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no demarcation point at the site?‚Äù - a specific facility installs external fibre links direct to a box in one of our racks rather than via a dedicated demarcation point overhead Railway Discord quote: ‚ÄúWhy are the phases wired so weirdly on this PDU?‚Äù - the facility was wired differently to our other sites and the power sockets were wired phase-to-neutral vs. phase-to-phase (WYE vs Delta circuits for you EE‚Äôs) Contractor: ‚ÄúYour data cables are too short‚Äù - the contractor didn‚Äôt realize the network gear was reverse-airflow and tried to mount things the wrong way around Us raising a support ticket: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no link coming up on this cable‚Äù - the fiber was wired in the wrong polarity; we learnt what ‚Äúrolling fibre cables‚Äù was that day‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs when they rip out the plugs from the LC connector and swap them around Railway Discord quote: ‚ÄúI brought a rubber mallet from HomeDepot today‚Äù - a batch of nearly 24 PDUs from one vendor were delivered with faulty sockets that didn‚Äôt properly engage with the power plugs, even with appropriate extreme mechanical force being applied But from this point - the hardware is in place the task begins to feel more familiar; we‚Äôre now needing to do some BGP, install some OS‚Äôes, setup monitoring and bring everything up. The completed cage ready for configuration Pedal on Metal The installed cage is but a blank canvas, the network devices need configuring, router config needs writing, RIR (regional internet registry) records need updating, and we must interact with the likes of Redfish APIs (HTTP APIs to dedicated controllers on server motherboards and PDUs) and PXE (a protocol to boot servers over the network) to get everything up and running. We've also not discussed how networking works. Our design uses FRR and whitebox network switches running SONiC to build a L3-only software-driven network that deeply integrates with our control plane. We‚Äôve regaled you with tales from the frontline ‚Ä¶ but any more and you‚Äôd be here all day. In a future post, we‚Äôll discuss how we go from a bunch of servers in a room to a functional Railway zone. In the space of the last few months we‚Äôve built two new software tools, Railyard and MetalCP, to enable a button click experience from designing a new cage, tracing and visualizing the cabling, to installing OSes on servers and getting them on the internet.

Someone decided they have to have a public cloud, so they did it, but they want to keep clients away with a 3 meter pole. My AWS account manager is someone I am 100% certain would roll in the mud with me if necessary. Would sleep in the floor with us if we asked in a crisis. Our Google cloud representatives make me sad because I can see that they are even less loved and supported by Google than us. It‚Äôs sad seeing someone trying to convince their company to sell and actually do a good job providing service. It‚Äôs like they are setup to fail. Microsoft guys are just bulletproof and excel in selling, providing a good service and squeezing all your money out of your pockets and you are mortally convinced it‚Äôs for your own good. Also have a very strange cloud‚Ä¶ thing. As for the railway company going metal, well, I have some 15 years of experience with it. I‚Äôll never, NEVER, EVER return to it. It‚Äôs just not worth it. But I guess you‚Äôll have to discover it by yourselves. This is the way. You soon discover what in freaking world is Google having so much trouble with.

(We pay for whatever the tier below Enterprise is called, I think it costs 10% of your spend) I‚Äôve been on 4 hour screenshare with AWS engineers working through some infrastructure issues in the past, and we only spend $100k/yr. Even at the $100k/yr spend level, AWS regularly reaches out with offers to try new services they‚Äôre launching for free. We‚Äôve said ‚Äúsure‚Äù a couple times, and AWS shows up with 4-6 people on their end of the call (half of them engineers). In the past 10 years, we‚Äôve had maybe 2-3 emergency issues per year, and every time I‚Äôm able to get a really smart person on a call within 5 minutes. This is the #1 thing I‚Äôd be concerned about losing if we did colo or bare metal with cheaper providers. reply motorest 5 hours agoparentprev> Microsoft (...) have a very strange cloud‚Ä¶ thing. Risking a going off on a tangent, this is something I rarely see discussed but is perhaps one of the main problems with Azure.

Boy we had some war stories: - Some EMC guys came to install a storage device for us to test... and tripped over each other and knocked out an entire Rack of servers like a comedy skit. (They uh... didn't win the contract.) - Some poor guy driving a truck had a heart attack and the crash took our DFW datecenter offline. (There were ballards to prevent this sort of scenario, but the cement hadn't been poured in them yet.) - At one point we temporarily laser-beamed bandwidth across the street to another building - There was one day we knocked out windows and purchased box fans because servers were literally catching on fire. Data center science has... well improved since the earlier days. We worked with Facebook on the OpenCompute Project that had some very forward looking infra concepts at the time. reply PaulRobinson 2 hours agoparentOnce worked in a \"DC\" in a converted cow shed in the English countryside. Hot takes that align with your experiences: - A key microwave link kept going down with intermittent packet errors way down in the data link layer. A short investigation discovered that a tree across the road had come into leaf, and a branch was blowing into the line of sight of the kit on our building. A step-ladder, a saw and 10 minutes later we restored connectivity - Our main (BGP-ified) router out of the DC - no, there wasn't a redundant device - kept rebooting. A quick check showed the temp in the DC was so high, cooling so poor, that the *inlet* fan had an air temp of over 60C. We pointed some fans at it as a temporary measure. - In a similar vein, a few weeks later the air con in another room just gave up and started spewing water over the Nortel DMS-100 (we were a dial-in ISP with our own switch). Wasn't too happy to be asked to help mop it up (thought the water could potentially be live), but what to do? After that experience I spent time on a small, remote island where main link to the internet was a 1MB/sec link vis GS satellite (ping times > 500ms), and where the locals dialled in over a microwave phone network rated to 9600 baud, but somehow 56k modems worked... One fix I realised I needed was a Solaris box was missing a critical .so, there were no local backups or install media and so I phoned my mate back in the UK and asked him to whack up a copy on an FTP server for me to get the box back online. And a few years after that I also got to commission a laser beam link over Manchester's Oxford Road (at the time, the busiest bus route in Europe), to link up an office to a University campus.

Google really screws you when you are looking for 100G speeds, it's almost insulting. For example redundant 100G dedicated interconnects are about $35K per month and that doesn't include VLAN attachments, colo x-connect fees, transit, etc. Not only that, they max out on 50G for VLAN attachments. To put this cost into perspective, you can buy two brand new 32 port 100G switches from Arista for the same amount of money. In North America, you can get 100G WAN circuits (managed Wavelength) for less than $5K/month. If it's a local metro you can also get dark fiber for less and run whatever speed you want. reply ChuckMcM 15 hours agoprevFrom the post: \"...but also despite multi-million dollar annual spend, we get about as much support from them as you would spending $100.\" -- Ouch! That is a pretty huge problem for Google. I really enjoyed this post, mostly because we had similar adventures when setting up the infrastructure for Blekko. For Blekko, a company that had a lot of \"east west\" network traffic (that is traffic that goes between racks vs to/from the Internet at large) having physically colocated services without competing with other servers for bandwidth was both essential and much more cost effective than paying for this special case at SoftLayer (IBM's captive cloud). There are some really cool companies that will build an enclosure for your cold isle, basically it ensures all the air coming out of the floor goes into the back of your servers and not anywhere else. It also keeps not cold air from being entrained from the sides into your servers. The calculations for HVAC 'CRAC' capacity in a data center are interesting too. In the first CoLo facility we had a 'ROFOR' (right of first refusal) on expanding into the floor area next to our cage, but when it came time to expand the facility had no more cooling capacity left so it was meaningless. Once you've done this exercise, looking at the 0xide solution will make a lot more sense to you. reply chatmasta 18 hours agoprevThis is how you build a dominant company. Good for you ignoring the whiny conventional wisdom that keeps people stuck in the hyperscalers. You‚Äôre an infrastructure company. You gotta own the metal that you sell or you‚Äôre just a middleman for the cloud, and always at risk of being undercut by a competitor on bare metal with $0 egress fees. Colocation and peering for $0 egress is why Cloudflare has a free tier, and why new entrants could never compete with them by reselling cloud services. In fact, for hyperscalers, bandwidth price gouging isn‚Äôt just a profit center; it‚Äôs a moat.

One thing that comes to mind is why would you write your own internal tooling for managing a rack when Netbox exists? Netbox is fantastic and I wish I had this back in the mid 2000s when I was managing 50+ racks. https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox reply ca508 19 hours agoparentwe evaluated a lot of commercial and oss offerings before we decided do go build it ourselves - we still have a deploy of netbox somewhere. But our custom tool (Railyard) works so well because it integrates deeply into the our full software, hardware and orchestration stack. The problem with the OSS stuff is that it's almost too generic - you shape the problem to fit its data model vs. solve the problem. We're likely going to fold our tool into Railway itself eventually - want to go on-prem; button click hardware design, commission, deploy and devex. Sorta like what Oxide is doing, but approaching the problem from the opposite side. reply nyrikki 16 hours agoparentprevLook at the issue list...that is why. https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues?q=is%3Aiss... Note how they want to be \"NetBox functions as the source of truth for your network infrastructure.\" Your individual situation dictates what is important, but had netbox targeted being a central repository vs insisting on not allow other systems to be truthful for certain items it could be a different story. We have learned that trying to centralize complexity and control doesn't work, heck we knew that almost immediately after the Clinger Cohen Act passed and even ITIL and TOGAF fully call this out now and I expect this to be targeted by consultants over the next few years. You need a central constant way to find state, to remove any questions or doubt regarding where to find the authoritative information, but generally if you aspire to scale and grow or adapt to new changes you really need to avoid having some centralized, god-box, and prescriptive system like this. reply jpc0 10 hours agoparentprevI like netbox, had it deployed for quite a while.

This lets one get closer to the metal (e.g. all your data is on your specific disk, rather than an abstracted block storage, such as EBS, not shared with other users, cheaper, etc) without having to worry about the staff that installs the hardware or where/how it fits in a rack.

We run our own bare metal in a rack, but also rent machines from Hivelocity where the use case suits. reply ch33zer 15 hours agoprevI used to work on machine repair automation at a big tech company. IMO repairs are one of the overlooked and harder things to deal with. When you run on AWS you don't really think about broken hardware it mostly just repairs itself. When you do it yourself you don't have that luxury. You need to have spare parts, technician to do repairs, a process for draining/undraining jobs off hosts, testing suites, hardware monitoring tools and 1001 more things to get this right. At smaller scales you can cut corners on some of these things but they will eventually bite you. And this is just machines! Networking gear has it's own fun set of problems, and when it fails it can take down your whole rack. How much do you trust your colos not to lose power during peak load?

What's written in the Cloudflare blogpost linked in the article holds true only of you can use a Delta config (as done in the US to obtain 208V) as opposed to the Wye config used in Europe. The latter does not give a substantial advantage: no sqrt(3) boost to power distribution efficiency and you end up adding Watts for three independent single phase circuits (cfr. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-phase_electric_power). reply sitkack 20 hours agoprevIt would be nice to have a lot more detail. The WTF sections are the best part. Sounds like your gear needs \"this side towards enemy\" sign and/or the right affordances so it only goes in one way. Did you standardize on layout at the rack level? What poke-yoke processes did you put into place to prevent mistakes? What does your metal->boot stack look like? Having worked for two different cloud providers and built my own internal clouds with PXE booted hosts, I too find this stuff fascinating. Also take utmost advantage of a new DC when you are booting it to try out all the failure scenarios you can think of and the ones you can't through randomized fault injection. reply ca508 20 hours agoparent> It would be nice to have a lot more detail I'm going to save this for when I'm asked to cut the three paras on power circuit types. Re: standardising layout at the rack level; we do now! we only figured this out after site #2. It makes everything so much easier to verify. And yeah, validation is hard - manually doing it thus far; want to play around with scraping LLDP data but our switch software stack has a bug :/. It's an evolving process, the more we work with different contractors, the more edge cases we unearth and account for. The biggest improvement is that we have built a internal DCIM that templates a rack design and exports a interactive \"cabling explorer\" for the site techs - including detailed annotated diagrams of equipment showing port names, etc... The screenshot of the elevation is a screenshot of part of that tool. > What does your metal->boot stack look like? We've hacked together something on top of https://github.com/danderson/netboot/tree/main/pixiecore that serves a debian netboot + preseed file. We have some custom temporal workers to connect to Redfish APIs on the BMCs to puppeteer the contraption. Then a custom host agent to provision QEMU VMs and advertise assigned IPs via BGP (using FRR) from the host. Re: new DCs for failure scenarios, yeah we've already blown breakers etc... testing stuff (that's how we figured out our phase balancing was off). Went in with a thermal camera on another. A site in AMS is coming up next week and the goal for that is to see how far we can push a fully loaded switch fabric. reply sitkack 19 hours agorootparentWonderful! The edge cases are the gold btw, collect the whole set and keep them in a human and machine readable format. I'd also go through and using a color coded set of cables, insert bad cables (one at a time at first) while the system is doing an aggressive all to all workload and see how quickly you can identify faults. It is the gray failures that will bring the system down, often multiple as a single failure will go undetected for months and then finally tip over an inflection point at a later time. Are you workloads ephemeral and/or do they live migrate? Or will physical hosts have long uptimes? It is nice to be able to rebaseline the hardware before and after host kernel upgrades so you can detect any anomalies. You would be surprised about how larger of a systemic performance degradation that major cloud providers have been able to see over months because \"all machines are the same\", high precision but low absolute accuracy. It is nice to run the same benchmarks on bare metal and then again under virtualization. I am sure you know, but you are running a multivariate longitudinal experiment, science the shit out of it. reply ca508 19 hours agorootparentLong running hosts at the moment, but we can drain most workloads off a specific host/rack if required and reschedule it pretty fast. We have the advantage of having a custom scheduler/orchestrator we've been working on for years, so we have a lot of control on that layer than with Kube or Nomad. Re: Live Migration We're working on adding Live Migration support to our orchestrator atm. We aim to have it running this quarter. That'll makes things super seamless. Re: kernels We've already seen some perf improvements somewhere between 6.0 and 6.5 (I forget the exact reason/version) - but it was some fix specific to the Sapphire Rapids cpus we had. But I wish we had more time to science on it, it's really fun playing with all the knobs and benchmarking stuff. Some of the telemetry on the new CPUs is also crazy - there's stuff like Intel PCM that can pull super fine-grained telemetry direct from the CPU/chipset https://github.com/intel/pcm. Only used it to confirm that we got NUMA affinity right so far - nothing crazy. reply sitkack 18 hours agorootparentLast thing. You will need a way to coordinate LM with users due them being sensitive to LM blackouts. Not many workloads are, but the ones that are are the kinds of things that customers will just leave over. If you are draining a host, make sure new VMs are on hosts that can be guaranteed to be maintenance free for the next x-days. This allows customers to restart their workloads on their schedule and have a guarantee that they won't be impacted. It also encourages good hygiene. Allow customers to trigger migration. Charge extra for a long running maintenance free host. It is good you are hooked into the PCM already. You will experience accidentally antagonistic workloads and the PCM will really help debug those issues. If I were building a DC, I put as many NICs into a host as possible and use SR-VIO to pass the nics into the guests. The switches should be sized to allow for full speed on all nics. I know it sounds crazy but if you design for a typical crud serving tree, you are a saving a buck but making your software problem 100x harder. Everything should have enough headroom so it never hits a knee of a contention curve. reply la64710 54 minutes agorootparentprevThat‚Äôs pretty cool. reply ksec 4 hours agoprevI am just fascinated by the need of Datacenter. The scale is beyond comprehension. 10 years ago, before the word HyperScaler was even invented or popularised, I would have thought DC market to be on the decline or levelled off now or around this time. One reason being HyperScaler, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Meta, Apple, Tencent, Alibaba, to smaller ones like Oracle and IBM. They would all have their own DC, taking on much of the compute for themselves and others. While left over space would be occupied by third parties. Another reason being the compute, memory and storage density continue to increase, which means for the same amount of floor space we are offering 5 - 20x of the previous CPU / RAM / Storage. Turns out we are building like mad and we are still not building enough. reply jpleger 16 hours agoprevMakes me remember some of the days I had in my career. There were a couple really interesting datacenter things I learned by having to deploy tens of thousands of servers in the 2003-2010 timeframe. Cable management and standardization was extremely important (like you couldn't get by with shitty practices). At one place where we were deploying hundreds of servers per week, we had a menu of what ops people could choose if the server was different than one of the major clusters. We essentially had 2 chassis options, big disk servers which were 2u or 1u pizza boxes. You then could select 9/36/146gb SCSI drives. Everything was dual processor with the same processors and we basically had the bottom of the rack with about 10x 2u boxes and then the rest was filled with 20 or more 1u boxes. If I remember correctly we had gotten such an awesome deal on the price for power, because we used facility racks in the cage or something, since I think they threw in the first 2x 30 amp (240v) circuits for free when you used their racks. IIRC we had a 10 year deal on that and there was no metering on them, so we just packed each rack as much as we could. We would put 2x 30s on one side and 2x 20s on another side. I have to think that the DC was barely breaking even because of how much heat we put out and power consumption. Maybe they were making up for it in connection / peering fees. I can't remember the details, will have to check with one of my friends that worked there around that time. reply winash83 15 hours agoprevWe went down this path over the last year, lots of our devs need local and dev/test environments and AWS was costing us a bomb, With about 7 Bare metals(Colocation) we are running about 200+ VMs and could double that number with some capacity to spare. For management, we built a simple wrapper over libvirt. I am setting up another rack in the US and will end up costing around $75Kper year for a similar capacity. Our prod is on AWS but we plan to move everything else and it's expected to save at least a quarter of a million dollars per year reply cbg0 11 hours agoparentSounds like a good chunk of money saved, but are you getting the same level of redundancy as you did on the cloud? reply winash83 7 hours agorootparentFor most dev/test workflows redundancy is not a huge concern, because we can just recreate the environments, in practice things are quite stable, most HW vendors like Hp Dell etc let you rent the servers instead of buying them, in case of serious HW issues they take care of the fixes, and usually there is someone at the Colocation site to take care of the day to day reply dban 22 hours agoprevThis is our first post about building out data centers.

Once a host is onboarded onto it, it's a few button clicks on an internal dashboard to provision a QEMU VM. We made a custom ansible inventory plugin so we can manage these VMs the same as we do machines on GCP. The host runs a custom daemon that programs FRR (an OSS routing stack), so that it advertises addresses assigned to a VM to the rest of the cluster via BGP. So zero config of network switches, etc... required after initial setup.

The mainboard was hung on the wall with some zip ties, the PSU was on the desk top, the hard drive was suspended as well. Eventually, the system was upgraded to newer hardware, put in an actual case, and then racked with an upgraded 100base-t connection. We were screaming in 1999. reply nyrikki 15 hours agoprev> This will likely involve installing some overhead infrastructure and trays that let you route fiber cables from the edge of your cage to each of your racks, and to route cables between racks Perhaps I am reading this wrong, as you appear to be fiber heavy and do have space on the ladder rack for copper, but if you are commingling the two, be careful. A possible future iteration, would consider a smaller panduit fiberunner setup + a wire rack. Co-mingling copper and fiber, especially through the large spill-overs works until it doesn't. Depending on how adaptive you need to be with technology changes, you may run into this in a few years. 4x6 encourages a lot of people putting extra cable up in those runners, and sharing a spout with cat-6, cx-#, PDU serial, etc... will almost always end badly for some chunk of fiber. After those outages it also encourages people to 'upgrade in place'. When you are walking to your cage look at older cages, notice the loops sticking out of the tops of the trays and some switches that look like porcupines because someone caused an outage and old cables are left in place.

Obv. missed updating that.

We have certain switches from Arista that have a 3-6 mo leadtime. Servers are build to order, so again 2+ months depending on stock. And obv. holidays mean a lot of stuff shuts down around December. Sometimes you can swap stuff around to get better lead-times, but then the operational complexity explodes because you have this slightly different component at this one site. I used to be a EEE, and I thought supply chain there was bad.

Even at scale when vendors really, really want (or want to keep) your business. At times it almost seems like someone sneezes somewhere and whoops, there goes your hardware delivery timelines. The advantage at cloud scale is a lot of constant signal around capacity delivery, demand etc. so you can build mathematical models to best work out when to start placing orders, and for what. reply solarkraft 7 hours agoprevCool post and cool to see Railway talked about more on here.

The simplicity of getting a cluster of machines up and running with all the metadata readily available via APIs is just liberating. And it just works: the network is easy to configure, the ASGs are flexible enough to customize, and the autoscaling offers strong primitives for advanced scaling. Amazingly, few companies who run their own DCs could build anything comparable to EC2, even at a smaller scale. When I worked in those companies, I sorely missed EC2.

At this scale, why did you opt for a spine-and-leaf design with 25G switches and a dedicated 32√ó100G spine? Did you explore just collapsing it and using 1-2 32√ó100G switches per rack, then employing 100G>4√ó25G AOC breakout cables and direct 100G links for inter-switch connections and storage servers?

When we started, we didn't have much of an idea about what the rack needs to look like. So we chose a combination of things we thought we could pull this off. We're mostly software and systems folks, and there's a dearth of information out there on what to do. Vendors tend to gravitate towards selling BGP+EVPN+VXLAN or whatever \"enterprise\" reference designs; so we kinda YOLO'ed the Gen 1. We decided to spend extra money if we could get to a working setup sooner. When the clock is in cloud spend, there's uh... lots of opportunity cost :D. A lot of the chipset and switch choices were bets and we had to pick and choose what we gambled on - and what we could get our hands on. The main bets this round were eBGP to the hosts with BGP unnumbered, SONiC switches - this lets us do a lot of networking with our existing IPv6/Wireguard/eBPF overlay and a debian based switch OS + FRR (so fewer things to learn). And ofc. figuring out how to operationalise the install process and get stuff running on the hardware as soon as possible. Now we've got a working design, we'll start iterating a bit more on the hardware choice and network design. I'd love for us to write about it when we get through it.

How is the diversity in datacenter providers? In my area, several datacenters were acquired and my instinct would be that: the \"move to cloud\" has lost smaller providers a lot of customers, and the industry consolidation has given suppliers more power in both controlling the offering and the pricing.

Regarding data centers that cost 9 figures and up: For the largest players, there‚Äôs not a ton of variation. A combination of evaporative cooling towers and chillers are used to reject heat. This is a consequence of evaporative open loop cooling being 2-3x more efficient than a closed-loop system. There will be multiple medium-voltage electrical services, usually from different utilities or substations, with backup generators and UPSes and paralleling switchgear to handle failover between normal, emergency, and critical power sources. There‚Äôs not a lot of variation since the two main needs of a data center are reliable electricity and the ability to remove heat from the space, and those are well-solved problems in mature engineering disciplines (ME and EE). The huge players are plopping these all across the country and repeatability/reliability is more important than tailoring the build to the local climate.

Many tenants arranged for their own ISPs, especially the ones large enough to use a cage. reply latchkey 16 hours agorootparentprevOne of the many reasons we went with Switch for our DC is because they have a service to handle all of that for you. Having stumbled on doing this ourselves before, it can be pretty tricky to negotiate everything. We had one provider give us a great price and then bait and switch at the last moment to tell us that there is some other massive installation charge that they didn't realize we had to pay.

For people who have taken empty lots and constructed new data centers (ie, the whole building) on them from scratch, the phrase \"building a datacenter\" involves a nonzero amount of concrete. OP seems to have built out a data hall - which is still a cool thing in its own right! - but for someone like me who's interested in \"baking an apple pie from scratch\", the mismatch between the title and the content was slightly disappointing. reply fishstock25 9 hours agorootparentprevWhen you invite a girl/guy over, do you say \"let's meet at my place\" or \"let's meet at the place I'm renting\"? The possessive pronoun does not necessarily express ownership, it can just as well express occupancy. reply kqr 5 hours agorootparentI wouldn't oppose telling a client \"we can meet at your data centre\". I would not tell my wife \"we need to discuss building our apartment complex\" when we are planning interior decorations in our flat. reply inopinatus 5 hours agorootparentIf I said to my wife, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs build a home together‚Äù, she would be halfway done with engaging a promising firm of radical young architects and negotiating for April delivery of pre-stressed concrete, Italian art glass, and Japanese tatami mats by close of business. reply fishstock25 3 hours agorootparentprevHaha fair enough reply motorest 5 hours agorootparentprev> Come to my office and tell me how it‚Äôs not actually my office (...) I think you're failing to understand the meaning and the point of \"building your own datacenter\". Yes, you can talk about your office all you'd like. Much like OP can talk about there server farm and their backend infrastructure. What you cannot talk about is your own office center. You do not own it. You rent office space. You only have a small fraction of the work required to operate an office, because you effectively offloaded the hard part to your landlord. reply inopinatus 5 hours agorootparentLet‚Äôs chat about inferring meaning from pragmatic context at your data. reply yard2010 10 hours agorootparentprevThe british are always the ones to blame :') reply arminiusreturns 10 hours agorootparentYes.

HN people are smart reply ThatGuyRaion 17 hours agoparentprevNot saying I don't agree with you but most tech businesses that have their own \"Data center\" usually have a private cage in a Colo. reply cortesoft 16 hours agorootparentThey usually don‚Äôt say they are building their own datacenter, though. It is different to say something like, ‚Äúour website runs in our datacenter‚Äù than saying you built a datacenter. You would still say, ‚Äúat our office buildings‚Äù, even if you are only renting a few offices in an office park. reply fweimer 8 hours agorootparentDon't the hyperscalers outsource datacenter construction and operation? Maybe it's not clear where to draw the line because the datacenters are owned or operated by disposable shell companies for various reasons. reply bagels 11 hours agorootparentprevWe built an office building would be the analogy. reply ncruces 9 hours agorootparentprevWhen you rent an apartment, you can still invite people to your apartment for drinks. But you don't claim to have built an apartment. reply chatmasta 18 hours agoparentprevIt seems a bit disingenuous but it‚Äôs common practice. Even the hyperscalers, who do have their own datacenters, include their colocation servers in the term ‚Äúdatacenter.‚Äù Good luck finding the actual, physical location of a server in GCP europe-west2-a (‚ÄúLondon‚Äù). Maybe it‚Äôs in a real Google datacenter in London! Or it could be in an Equinix datacenter in Slough, one room away from AWS eu-west-1. Cloudflare has also historically used ‚Äúdatacenter‚Äù to refer to their rack deployments. All that said, for the purpose of the blog post, ‚Äúbuilding your own datacenter‚Äù is misleading. reply boulos 16 hours agorootparentYou're correct, there are multiple flavors of Google Cloud Locations. The \"Google concrete\" ones are listed at google.com/datacenters and London isn't on that list, today. cloud.google.com/about/locations lists all the locations that GCE offers service, which is a super set of the large facilities that someone would call a \"Google Datacenter\". I liked to mostly refer to the distinction as Google concrete (we built the building) or not. Ultimately, even in locations that are shared colo spaces, or rented, it's still Google putting custom racks there, integrating into the network and services, etc. So from a customer perspective, you should pick the right location for you. If that happens to be in a facility where Google poured the concrete, great! If not, it's not the end of the world. P.S., I swear the certification PDFs used to include this information (e.g., https://cloud.google.com/security/compliance/iso-27018?hl=en) but now these are all behind \"Contact Sales\" and some new Certification Manager page in the console. Edit: Yes! https://cloud.google.com/docs/geography-and-regions still says: > These data centers might be owned by Google and listed on the Google Cloud locations page, or they might be leased from third-party data center providers. For the full list of data center locations for Google Cloud, see our ISO/IEC 27001 certificate. Regardless of whether the data center is owned or leased, Google Cloud selects data centers and designs its infrastructure to provide a uniform level of performance, security, and reliability. So someone can probably use web.archive.org to get the ISO-27001 certificate PDF from whenever the last time it was still up. reply quicksilver03 10 hours agorootparent> P.S., I swear the certification PDFs used to include this information (e.g., https://cloud.google.com/security/compliance/iso-27018?hl=en) but now these are all behind \"Contact Sales\" and some new Certification Manager page in the console. This is not good, I can't think of any actual reason to hide those certificates. For comparison, AWS makes their ISO-27001 certificate available at https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/iso-27001-faqs/ and also cites the certifying agent, most of which have a search page from where you can find all the certificates they've issued. reply throwaway2037 10 hours agorootparentprevI found this list: https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/locations/ I cannot believe that they never had a UK DC until recently. I guess they (originally) chose Ireland instead. reply matt-p 18 hours agorootparentprevThe hyperscalers are absolutely not colo-ing their general purpose compute at Equinix! A cage for routers and direct connect, maybe some limited Edge CDN/compute at most. Even where they do lease wholesale space, you'd be hard pushed to find examples of more than one in a single building. If you count them as Microsoft, Google, AWS then I'm not sure I can think of a single example off the top of my head. Only really possible if you start including players like IBM or Oracle in that list. reply chatmasta 18 hours agorootparentMaybe leasing wholesale space shouldn‚Äôt be considered colocation, but GCP absolutely does this and the Slough datacenter was a real example. I can‚Äôt dig up the source atm but IIRC some Equinix website was bragging about it (and it wasn‚Äôt just about direct connect to GCP). reply matt-p 18 hours agorootparentGoogle doesn't put GCP compute inside Equinx Slough. I could perhaps believe if they have a cage of routers and perhaps even CDN boxes/Edge, but no general cloud compute. Google and AWS will put routers inside Equinx Slough sure, but that's literally written on the tin, and the only way a carrier hotel could work. reply chatmasta 18 hours agorootparentThen why do they obfuscate the location of their servers? If they were all in Google datacenters, why not let me see where my VM is? reply achierius 17 hours agorootparentSecurity reasons, I presume? Otherwise it would be trivial for an adversary to map out their resources by sampling VM rentals over a moderate time-period. reply lostlogin 17 hours agorootparentI‚Äôm very naive on the subject here - what advantage would this give someone? reply chupasaurus 16 hours agorootparentThe knowledge of blast radii. reply jazzyjackson 16 hours agorootparentGives whole new meaning to ‚Äúreverse engineering‚Äù reply chupasaurus 15 hours agorootparentWell, the alternative name for it is \"backwards engineering\" for a reason. reply deelowe 18 hours agorootparentprevHyperscalers use colos all the time for edge presence. reply boulos 16 hours agorootparentprevSee my sibling comment :). reply fragmede 17 hours agorootparentprevThe best part about adamantly making such a claim is that anybody who knows better also knows better than to break NDA and pull a Warthunder to prove that the CSPs do use colo facilities, so you're not going to get anyone who knows better to disagree with you and say AWS S3 or GCP compute is colo-ed at a specific colo provider. reply buildbot 9 hours agorootparentYup, I assume AWS, Azure and GCP would NDA this info. That being said, this page amusingly mentions colocation in reference to media destruction: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/assurance/assur... reply matt-p 16 hours agorootparentprevThey consume wholesale space, but not retail Colo for general compute, that's all I'm saying. Equinx is retail, with only a couple of exceptions, although I know they're trying to grow the wholesale side. reply Over2Chars 16 hours agorootparentprevIndeed, I've seen \"data center\" maps, and was surprised they were just a tenant in some other guys data center. reply chatmasta 12 hours agorootparentWhich makes you a subletter, and the one with the highest fee of the whole chain‚Ä¶ reply motorest 5 hours agorootparent> Which makes you a subletter, and the one with the highest fee of the whole chain‚Ä¶ I don't know what point you tried to make. Any business in the whole world survives because they sell things for more money than what it takes to keep their business running. Is it surprising that they charge their customers more than their infrastructure costs? reply motorest 5 hours agorootparentprev> It seems a bit disingenuous but it‚Äôs common practice. Even the hyperscalers, who do have their own datacenters, include their colocation servers in the term ‚Äúdatacenter.‚Äù I think you're conflating things. Those hypothetical hyperscalers can advertise their availability zones and deployment regions, but they do not claim they built the data centers. They provide a service, but they do not make broad claims on how they built infrastructure. reply walrus01 19 hours agoparentprev> Why would you call colocation \"building your own data center\"? The cynic in me says this was written by sales/marketing people targeted specifically at a whole new generation of people who've never laid hands on the bare metal or racked a piece of equipment or done low voltage cabling, fiber cabling, and \"plug this into A and B power AC power\" cabling. By this, I mean people who've never done anything that isn't GCP, Azure, AWS, etc. Many terminologies related to bare metal infrastructure are misused by people who haven't been around in the industry long enough to have been required to DIY all their own infrastructure on their own bare metal. I really don't mean any insult to people reading this who've only ever touched the software side, but if a document is describing the general concept of hot aisles and cold aisles to an audience in such a way that it assumes they don't know what those are, it's at a very introductory/beginner level of understanding the OSI layer 1 infrastructure. reply justjake 18 hours agorootparentI think that's my fault BTW (Railway Founder here). I asked Charith to cut down a bit on the details to make sure it was approachable to a wider audience (And most people have only done Cloud) I wanted to start off with the 101 content to see if people found it approachable/interesting. He's got like reams and reams of 201, 301, 401 Next time I'll stay out of the writing room! reply _kb 6 hours agorootparentSitting on the front page of HN with a good read, and what is ultimately company promo and a careers link seems like a job well done. It made me read/click. Yes, building a physical DC is much wider scope than colo. This is one part of that, which is also still interesting. The world is built on many, many layers of abstraction which can all take lifetimes to explore. There are non-devs who enjoy learning about software, web-devs who dabble in compilers, systems programmers curious about silicon, EE's that are aspiring physicists, who in turn peek into the universe of pure path (cue yes, that xkcd you're thinking of). A 'full stack' overview of a standalone DC build still has to set a bound somewhere. This was an approachable intro and look forward to reading more from the layers you operate. reply haneefmubarak 17 hours agorootparentprevBro let him at the 401 and higher hahaha! reply justjake 17 hours agorootparent\"Booo who let this guy cook?\" Fair tbh We will indeed write more on this so this is great feedback for next time! reply llm_trw 16 hours agorootparentprevI mean the more people realize the the cloud is now a bad deal the better. When the original aws instance came out it would take you about two years or on demand to pay for the same hardware on prem. Now its between two weeks for ml heavy instances to six months for medium CPU instances. It just doesn't make sence to use the cloud for anything past prototyping unless you want Bazos to have a bigger yacth. reply TacticalCoder 19 hours agoparentprev [‚Äì] > You could call it \"colocation\" or \"renting space in a data center\". What are you building? You're racking. Can you say what you mean? TFA explain what they're doing, they literally write this: \"In general you have three main choices: Greenfield buildout (...), Cage Colocation (getting a private space inside a provider's datacenter enclosed by mesh walls), or Rack colocation... We chose the second option\" I don't know how much clearer they can be. reply jeremyjh 6 hours agorootparentThe title is \"So you want to build your own data center\" and the article is about something else. Its nice that they say that up front, but its valid to criticize the title. reply quickthrowman 3 hours agorootparentprev [‚Äì] Only one of those options is ‚Äòbuilding your own data center‚Äô, and I‚Äôll give you three guesses as to which one it is.

And a great example that truth is complicated, expensive and uncomfortable. It's much easier to postulate an evil nation-state entity with a bad plan (without evidence) than to dig through the thicket of this article. It's much cheaper as well, certainly in terms of time and knowhow. And it's also much more comfortable to claim you're the victim and have uncovered a conspiracy, rather than realize this was just the result of the patchwork typical of engineering. Kudos to the author. reply DSMan195276 21 hours agorootparentI would also add, it's not _unreasonable_ to be wary of something when a tool like a virus scan pops up a warning. The jargon used to explain what the executable is doing is gibberish to any 'normal' user, there's no way for them to know it's listing stuff you'd more or less expect it to be doing. Of course, there's a bit of a jump from that to making bold claims about what it's doing, but the initial concern was understandable. reply klik99 21 hours agorootparentprevYeah, the insane takes spread faster but it takes more time and resources to look into it than just come to conclusions early. The worst thing is this creates an environment where most people are either completely credulous and buy into everything or completely incredulous and think everything is unfounded. It's just exhausting to have a healthy level of skepticism these days, and maybe 1 out of 1000 times (number source: from thin air) something that sounds insane actually has some truth to it. reply pwagland 6 hours agorootparentSadly, this is just another example of \"A lie can travel halfway around the world before the truth puts on its shoes.\" That doesn't mean that every sensational thing is a lie, but verifying the truth definitely takes time! reply fishstock25 21 hours agorootparentprevYeah, for a substantial fraction of people, this case will stick to their minds as \"oh the chinese .. again\" It's both sad and scary. It was even submitted to HN. Flagged by now, but still. Many people won't have read this follow-up, especially since it doesn't come as a 1-sentence TL;DR.. reply dgfitz 19 hours agorootparentHmm, why is it sad and scary? reply fishstock25 10 hours agorootparentIt's sad because the HN crowd is technically maximally (?) literate and should be one of the last communities to even remotely buy the debunked story. It's scary because if even those in the know are not resistant to such BS, who else is going to shield the general public from populism-fueled pushes to anarchy or worse? Detoriation of trust in media is one of the building blocks of that, and if even the experts of subject areas are fooled and/or don't care enough, all hope may be lost. The silver lining though is that the HN submission got pushback in terms of comments and an eventual flagging. reply tacet 5 hours agorootparent>It's sad because the HN crowd is technically maximally (?) literate I laughed.

Corporations cannot be trusted. Proprietary software is bad enough but proprietary drivers is on a whole new level. You really have no idea what those things are doing unless you reverse engineer them. Here are example of corporations essentially pwning your computer with their \"justified and trustworthy\" software: https://www.vice.com/en/article/fs-labs-flight-simulator-pas... Shipped a browser stealer to users and exfiltrated on an unencrypted channel the usernames and passwords of users they deemed to be \"pirates\". https://old.reddit.com/r/Asmongold/comments/1cibw9r/valorant... https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/anti-cheat-bypass/634974-...

As far as I'm concerned anyone who trusts these corporations with kernel level access to their computers is out of their minds. I don't trust firmware but at least it's contained in some isolated device. reply fishstock25 2 hours agorootparentSorry but you are blurring the lines between an actual malicious attack and a badly designed driver. The first is what the original claim was, screaming \"Russians!\" and \"Chinese!\" at the same time with poor technical understa ding. The second is what actually happened. It's no worse than inserting a CD-ROM and installing a driver. As bad as that is, and to be criticised in its own right, it's qualitatively different from the first. Let's not muddy the waters by conflating the two and make the (IMO legitimate) criticism of one of them wade into a conspiracy theory about the other. reply Cthulhu_ 9 hours agorootparentprevTo add, there's a huge politically motivated anti-China movement going on right now, to the point where anything Chinese sounds scary or suspicious. This has been going on for years now, but only came to my awareness with the Huawei scare (as of today, no evidence was found that they did come loaded with backdoors and the like - but do correct me if I'm wrong, this is based on what I remember, not researched facts). I mean I don't trust the Chinese, but neither do I trust the Americans so it's choose your flavour of evil. Anyway that said, I'm sure it's politically and economically motivated, as for decades China has played catch-up in the global economy and they are rapidly overtaking, with financial interests worldwide. The US is trying to slow them down by trying to keep e.g. chip technology out of their hands, but other than that all they can do is to stop Chinese companies from earning money in the US. reply klik99 4 hours agorootparentHonestly there are so many claims about Huawei but I think the loudest ones were about the 5G network which were BS but there were some that were legit, and this is exactly my point - it‚Äôs exhausting to check this stuff, so the vast majority of people either believe it all or none. For example it seems like the Supermicro spy chip thing has truth to it (it feels the thing OP was rebutting was inspired by this story), though it‚Äôs unclear, it‚Äôs very much based on statements from 3 letter agencies, so I just have to guess, yes probably China got their manufacturers to install hardware spyware on some devices. These days, all countries are doing insane digital spying on other countries. I believe we‚Äôre in a modern Cold War. China is a unique threat not because there‚Äôs something uniquely evil about them but they own so much manufacturing and have an explicit tight relationship between companies and government. This is the main reason for moving manufacturing to US, nobody really cares about the workers, it‚Äôs a security threat. All that can be true, and still also be true that most of the shit you hear about China is BS and xenophobic. It leads to actual violence and racism. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important to push back against, for the regular people just living their life. I‚Äôm never going to defend any country, these are battles the very richest people are fighting it‚Äôs not my war, I push back so don‚Äôt people don‚Äôt act as foot soldiers in their war or become collateral damage for something they have no part of. reply prerok 11 hours agorootparentprevNot the OP, but I think I get the \"sad and scary\" part.

The BBC and Reuters can be posited as counterexamples to your assertion. They‚Äôre good journalists and well-funded (and not primarily by advertising either). reply prerok 11 hours agorootparentHmm... but do you think that they would produce such an article, funding the research into it? From what I can tell, they would report accurately once these findings were published but would not find a researcher to dig into the claims before publishing that someone (named) said that these chips are at fault. reply immibis 6 hours agorootparentprevWhich firm's journalist was it that just got arrested at a press conference for asking questions about Israel? reply mschuster91 10 hours agorootparentprevBBC is under constant threat of getting defunded, it's almost a meme at this point, and on top of that is generally under constant attack. Reuters doesn't do much local or regional stuff. reply pammf 7 hours agorootparentprevTruth lies somewhere in between. It's also a generalization to think everything related to the ‚Äúevil-nation‚Äù postulation is nothing beyond a conspiracy theory. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. Edit: quoted evil-nation since it‚Äôs a debatable term usually applied to any country not politically or culturally aligned with some intelligence activity presence. reply fishstock25 2 hours agorootparent> Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. Correct. Not more, not less. Question is what the default assumption is. With enough BS thrown around, the public seems to tend to tilt to \"something is fishy\" without any (non-debunked) evidence having ever been presented. Doesn't mean it never will be, but until then, a lot of debunked falsehoods shouldn't create more bias than just silence.

I suppose in this day and age the \"right\" thing to do is to upload a bunch of stuff to microsoft servers so that it downloads whatever is needed upon getting plugged in, but I've observed enough stuff needing manually installed drivers to know that this isn't as apparently easy as it may appear to be. (For example, I very often need to download vendor-specific ADB drivers) Anyways, I think it's clever for peripherals to help you bootstrap, and having the drivers baked into the device makes things a little easier instead of trying to find a canonical download source. reply Suppafly 20 hours agoparent>I actually really appreciate USB devices that masquerade as a storage device to provide their own drivers.

I have never encountered any problem whatsoever. Only in Windows I have encountered sometimes scaling problems. The only programs with which I had sometimes problems in Linux with high-DPI monitors have been commercial applications written in Java, some of which were very expensive. However those problems were not Linux-specific, but Java-specific, because those Java programs behaved equally bad on Windows. For some reason, there seems to exist a high percentage of Java programmers who are incompetent at writing GUIs and the programs written by them neither follow the platform DPI settings nor allow the user to select a suitable display font, making their programs unusable without a magnifying glass when using high-DPI monitors. Moreover, I have encountered several expensive Java applications that crash and die immediately when used with monitors configured for 10-bit color instead of 8-bit color, both on Linux and on Windows. So in more than a decade of using only high-DPI displays, I have never had problems with native Linux GUI applications, I have seldom encountered problems with native Windows applications and I have very frequently encountered problems with Java applications, regardless of the operating system on which they were run. reply ChocolateGod 5 hours agorootparent> For some reason, there seems to exist a high percentage of Java programmers who are incompetent at writing GUIs There's multiple GUI Java toolkits and they all equally suck in their own way.

Among those that I have encountered more frequently have been several kinds of Realtek, and of ASIX, and of Aquantia. Especially among the faster USB Ethernet adapters I doubt that there are many without custom drivers.

It would not have been strange to use a device like that to store 10s of bytes! The ISO thing is a little bit weird, but to be honest it's a creative way to try to evade corporate IT security policies restricting mass storage USB devices.

For example, I use a USB Ethernet dongle to connect my router to a cable modem provided by the ISP. The ground of the cable modem is at the potential of the shield of the coaxial cable, which comes from far away and the voltage difference between the coaxial cable and the ground of my apartment is big enough to give you a serious shock if you would touch an exposed metal part (normally there are no such exposed metal parts). So it is essential for the USB Ethernet dongle to provide insulation between the incoming Ethernet cable and the USB port that is connected to the router, which is grounded at the home ground. reply immibis 6 hours agorootparentDo you have to wear thick rubber gloves to plug in the cable? reply adrian_b 5 hours agorootparentWith well-made Ethernet cables, even when they are shielded, it is easy to not touch any conductor (the good shielded RJ-45 connectors have plastic sleeves covering the metal). On the other hand, I would have to be careful if I would want to disconnect and reconnect the coaxial TV cable that comes from the ISP, where the threaded coaxial connectors have a metal part.

With those you just need coaxial cables of appropriate lengths, also with SMA connectors, for making point-to-point connections. If you want a network where each device can talk with any other devices, you also need a splitter, also with SMA connectors. Many WiFi M.2 2230 cards have MMCX coaxial connectors on them, which allow the connection of internal antennas attached somewhere on the case of the laptop or mini-PC. For these, there are MMCX to SMA adapters, which you can use together with SMA cables. Some M.2 cards have even smaller U.FL coaxial connectors. For these there are U.FL to SMA adapters. For devices that do not have any standard antenna connectors, one may need to modify them, to solder some RF connectors, which is hard to do without greatly lowering the quality of the WiFi links, due to additional attenuation and reflections. reply zinekeller 5 hours agorootparentI would imagine that the stage lightning microcontroller is running a variant of ESP8266 or something similar where the \"antenna\" are actually thick traces on a circuit board (https://www.electronicwings.com/storage/PlatformSection/Topi...).

Ethernet controller being a dma master means it can continually plop packets where it wants without CPU intervention. Infamously Realtek RTL8139 10/100M chip was the first Realtek with DMA mastering support, but it was brain dead implementation https://people.freebsd.org/~wpaul/RealTek/3.0/if_rl.c: >\"The RealTek 8139 PCI NIC redefines the meaning of 'low end.' This is probably the worst PCI ethernet controller ever made, with the possible exception of the FEAST chip made by SMC. The 8139 supports bus-master DMA, but it has a terrible interface that nullifies any performance gains that bus-master DMA usually offers. For transmission, the chip offers a series of four TX descriptor registers. Each transmit frame must be in a contiguous buffer, aligned on a longword (32-bit) boundary. This means we almost always have to do mbuf copies in order to transmit a frame, except in the unlikely case where a) the packet fits into a single mbuf, and b) the packet is 32-bit aligned within the mbuf's data area. The presence of only four descriptor registers means that we can never have more than four packets queued for transmission at any one time. Reception is not much better. The driver has to allocate a single large buffer area (up to 64K in size) into which the chip will DMA received frames. Because we don't know where within this region received packets will begin or end, we have no choice but to copy data from the buffer area into mbufs in order to pass the packets up to the higher protocol levels. It's impossible given this rotten design to really achieve decent performance at 100Mbps, unless you happen to have a 400Mhz PII or some equally overmuscled CPU to drive it.\" Afaik 10 years later 1Gbit RTL8111B required alignment on 256 byte boundaries so not much better. reply black3r 5 hours agoparentprevthere is no PCI-e through USB though, other than Thunderbolt/USB4 or is there? so if you only have USB ports and care about performance the bigger distinction would be if the USB ethernet device implements CDC-NCM or just CDC-ECM, with the distinction being that CDC-ECM sends the frames to the driver one-by-one and the driver has to acknowledge and process them one-by-one which generates ton of CPU work, while the newer CDC-NCM protocol sends frames in batches..., on my laptop I can still get full gigabit speeds with a 1Gbit ECM dongle but when I do it uses 100% of one CPU core, while a 1Gbit NCM dongle has negligible CPU usage... reply kiririn 18 hours agoparentprevRealtek RTL8156 (USB 2.5G ethernet) is fast and rock solid, even for server use cases.

I've had good luck with the Realtek 2.5 GbE adapters, no CPU usage issues. And these days even with a 10 GbE Thunderbolt adapter the CPU use is negligible, so things have improved across the board I think. reply throeurir 21 hours agoprev [‚Äì] So many wtf here.

Maybe. I don't know of any modern systems that will execute anything on a newly inserted drive, nor boot from an external drive in the default configuration. So we are missing a couple of things. First, a vulnerability in the OS/system. Second, an implementation of that vulnerability in a device like this. Should this design be phased out? Perhaps. There is relatively little difference between not populating the flash memory part of the board and a proper network-only implementation. reply SpecialistK 16 hours agoparentprev1) China is a country, and in that country people use Windows and make /stuff/ that runs on Windows. A flash tool, which was only intended to be distributed to OEMs, only being found on obscure forums is in line with what I've experienced with similar NAND or BIOS flashers. 2) Any USB storage can contain malware. The driver that this one stores is digitally signed by Microsoft as mentioned in the article. 3) If there was a MBR boot block or EFI file, sure. But there isn't. See 2.

    "originBody": "I've been advocating for RSS support, and you should too 17 Jan, 2025 I've been using Feeder to keep up with the news for awhile now. For a long time, I just checked AllSides. But then I found out NPR in my state supports RSS, my local news org supports RSS, and YouTube even supports RSS! One outlet I really like is GovTrack.us, and they did not support RSS - so I emailed them about it, and they added support. Feeder's news website wasn't working with the Feeder app, so I emailed them and they fixed it. I learned my State Senator's website supports RSS, but my state's GOP website does not - so I emailed the GOP asking for RSS. We'll see. I emailed Ubisoft/Nadeo asking for RSS support on the Trackmania news website. They replied that they'll send the suggestion to dev team. We'll see. I spoke at my Library's Board meeting last night asking for RSS support on their website. Seemed well-received. We'll see. Substack supports RSS. Jurist.org supports RSS. Justia's supreme court summaries support RSS (I used to read those, but I don't any more). Blogger supports RSS. So yeah - If you are interested in an organization's updates, then get a feed reader app, and subscribe to their feed on their website. If they don't have a feed, just ask them to add one! You'll be surprised how nice it is to keep up with things you actually care about in a way that you're completely in control of, without bloat, without ads, without algorithms. Please advocate for more RSS support - especially with orgs you want to stay up-to-date with. This can be video game news websites, government organizations, political news websites, entertainment platforms, blogs, or whatever. #action #blog 86",

The form is https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC2wdo5v... where channel_id is the channel hash code which is buried in the source for the \"nicely named\" channel: https://www.youtube.com/@CuttingEdgeEngineering and can be found without source diving via (say) FeedBro (RSS browser extension) \"Find Feeds in Current Tab\" function. https://nodetics.com/feedbro/ reply EvanAnderson 8 hours agoparentI worry about YouTube RSS feeds getting popular and Google killing them. Every time I see them discussed publicly I have this \"Ssshh! Keep it on the down low!\" reaction. I browse YouTube anonymously, have an ad blocker setup that pretty much eliminates all ads, and track my \"subscriptions\" with RSS. It's highly usable. I use a fork of tt-rss and actually embed the YouTube videos in the reader pane so I never see any of YouTube's algorithmic recommendation schlock (beyond recommendations at the end of videos, which I ignore). Browsing YouTube, the site, is a jarring nightmare. I am considering having my podcatcher use a YouTube downloader to just pull down all the videos in the feeds I watch. I believe Google is throttling yt-dlp to realtime speeds, but I figure if my podcatcher is doing it behind the scenes that shouldn't matter. I maintain curated collections of podcasts I like (in case they ever disappear), and since I just added 40TB if storage to my home system I figure it's time to do that with YouTube too. reply jhot 1 hour agorootparentI run pinchflat [0] to automate yt-dlp and file management behind the scenes.

'Subscriptions' shows exactly what's on the tin, a timeline of videos from your subscribed channels. reply renegat0x0 4 hours agorootparentI use RSS for many sources, from YouTube also. I can open yt from there.

I'm not sure if that's intentional or just misguided design, but the only reason I knew to see it out on my PS4's YouTube app is because I'd seen it on desktop. reply oneeyedpigeon 9 hours agorootparentprevThe opposite problem is also bad: subscribe to a channel, then get frequent notifications of years-old videos. reply MortyWaves 7 hours agorootparentprevDon‚Äôt forget the ‚Äúclick the bell‚Äù too.

I'm surprised that YouTube still allow it, but I hope it stays. reply latexr 7 hours agorootparentUnfortunately those have a major flaw: they always show the top 15 items in a playlist. This is a problem because many channels have playlists where they put older episodes at the top and add new ones to the bottom.

Looking into the XML, it turns out it's called xml-stylesheet:And I would argue that this is an excellent way to introduce new readers to RSS: instead of the browser popping up a download prompt, you can make your RSS feeds themselves a dedicated page for advocating RSS, in case an interested reader is browsing through the links on your site.

I see hackernews front page posts, friends facebook posts, friends nitter (x) posts, friends substack posts, youtube subscriptions, all in one chronological feed. And a browser icon shows how many posts are waiting to be viewed. There are some paid services that scrape other sites to RSS for you too (like zapier). reply tyleo 6 hours agoprevI recently added RSS to my personal site (https://www.tyleo.com/) Even with a custom implementation it‚Äôs a simple thing to support. You can find the whole spec here: https://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification I‚Äôll mention that there is a competing Atom specification which is compatible with all notable RSS readers https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(web_standard). The POV I‚Äôve seen on HN favors Atom because it offers more functionality and is a clearer standard. I want to voice my support for RSS though based on its simplicity. To me the feed doesn‚Äôt need a bunch of bells and whistles. I get analysis paralysis I get deciding which Atom features to support. reply talideon 6 hours agoparentUse whatever elements you need from Atom. Atom is a functional superset of RSS 2.0, and if you're hit with analysis paralysis, using only the functionality that exists in RSS 2.0 in your Atom feed. Atom exists because RSS is ambiguous and prone to breakage. The \"bells and whistles\" exist only because there were a lot of common extensions at the time that made sense to fold into Atom itself. Even if you use none of that and just the bits that overlap with RSS 2.0, your feed will be less likely to break in random feed readers, and that's enough reason to use Atom over RSS. In this day and age, there's no good reason to use RSS over Atom beyond brand recognition. (Yes, I'm still salty from the feed wars of the 2000s, but I still stand by all that I've written above.) reply oneeyedpigeon 6 hours agoparentprev> You can find the whole spec here There's also this version, which I believe is the original: https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html It's far from perfect, but at least it's not infested with spammy advertising. reply oneeyedpigeon 10 hours agoprev> Please advocate for more RSS support - especially with orgs you want to stay up-to-date with.

It doesn't address discover ability, though. reply n144q 6 hours agorootparentprev> RSS is best when integrated with a stateful server-side reader. Who said that? It's meaningful if you read the feed across multiple devices, but lots of people read RSS on their computer only. And even so browsers could provide RSS status synchronization. In fact almost every browser is already syncing your browsing history, bookmarks and settings if you are signed in. > Whatever comes with the browser will not be as good as an extension... not true. reply kevincox 8 hours agorootparentprevFirefox had this and it was great. - It rendered the feed in a pretty way. - If provided a little widget to open the feed in your feed reader (in practice it substituted the feed url into a URL template with popular readers by default and the option to add your own). This basically made it a one-click subscribe option. reply latexr 7 hours agorootparentprev> I use RSS heavily and I don't want an RSS button Then don‚Äôt click it? > RSS is best when integrated with a stateful server-side reader.

Im sick of this paternalism for tech illiterate people. Its a choice. reply freetanga 6 hours agorootparentJust for reference: - 21% of adults in the US are illiterate in 2024. - 54% of adults have a literacy below a 6th-grade level (20% are below 5th-grade level). I would argue than everyone who is stuck a below 6th grade understanding of a language they use everyday can hardly be tech literate ( which in itself requires good reading and abstraction capabilities) Is it their fault because they choose to be like this? Their parents? Their goverment? Nature gave them the wrong genes? Society shun them for their skin color? A bearded white guy in a cloud chose to ruin their lives? Don‚Äôt know, don‚Äôt care, but demanding agency to all adults feels a bit narrow minded, selfish, and not too thankful for avoiding a few external barriers that other humans have to endure‚Ä¶ most of us here skipped those challenges, and ignoring how much headstart we got by sheer luck and no own merit is a bit inmature, IMHO.

But then nefarious tricks by tech companies aren't exactly punished. Eg google itself attempted to kill rss, by massively supporting it then dropping it. This is not an illegal or punishable offence (it is immoral imo), but illustrates the point that these companies attempt to sculpt the reality, to train people into compromise. It can't be a one way street only, where individuals have to fend for themselves, but corporations can try every trick to get their way. reply beretguy 6 hours agorootparentprevI don't know, it's almost kind of like saying that newborn babies are illiterate by choice. Not everybody cares about computers or how to use them, they just want to find that restaurant address or read this news article or whatever. They don't have time or interest to learn how to use computers. I don't know how to replace transmission in my car. It's not by choice - I just don't have time and money to learn how to do that. Things take time and money to learn. reply _Algernon_ 2 hours agorootparentI'm literally mentioning adults in my comment. Adults have agency. Babies don't. Weird choice of comparison. As for the car analogy: You're right, but you also accept the consequences of that choice which is mostly limited to having to pay for a mechanic every once in a while. The consequences of tech illiteracy is much worse (more comparible to actual illiteracy): - Lower employability. - Easier to get scammed / have data leaked or hacked. - Easier to get manipulated by platforms (social media are comparable to priests interpreting the bible to people before literacy was common). - On a societal scale, when enough people are affected, the above leads to instability, proliferation of dis- and misinformation on a societal scale. - Per av above, destabilising of democracy. I'm sure people argued the same about people not having to learn to read / write during the enlightenment. Im happy they did not win out.

Around 2010 when Chrome was entering the market Firefox had around 30% global market share. In Slovakia where I'm from Firefox was \"mainstream enough\" that we had it pre-installed on high school and library computers and were taught to use it instead of IE as early as 2005..., But also in lots of enterprise-style managed companies (including basically all government offices, banks, ...) you couldn't use anything other than IE as late as 2016 cause there was no way they were gonna allow you to change your homepage from the company intranet home, so there were also lots of people who were using Firefox at home but also using IE at work because they had no other choice... reply picafrost 10 hours agoprevThis is a great initiative. Large tech companies, through hijacking our web experience and pursuing maximum scale, have normalized not being able to talk to a human being on the other side of a website/app/business. In many situations you _can_ just send an email. Most often someone will read it and be very happy to help out if they can. Not always, but how much of a time and effort investment is an email really?

Turns out no one but me knew what it was for they just saw the link in the site footer clicked it their browser showed a bunch of xml and they thought it was broken. I checked the logs turns out it gets 1000s of requests a day so I think that convinced them to keep it. reply talideon 6 hours agoprevOne thing though: is you're adding \"RSS\" support, use Atom for the feed, not actual RSS. Everything supports Atom that supports RSS, it's no harder to implement, less ambiguous, less prone to breaking, and has a richer vocabulary that doesn't require you resort to pulling in additional vocabularies via namespaces. I cringe every time I see a feed that uses RSS and then pulls in Atom for some of elements. If you're going to do that, then just use Atom for the whole thing rather than building a frankenfeed. reply brisky 11 hours agoprevRecently I have posted about RSDS (really simple decentralized syndication) - a protocol that tries to solve RSS content global discovery problem.

Podcasts typically use RSS (even if the app goes to great length to hide it). I sometimes wonder why there is so much push for \"federation\" and so few for... well just simple interoperable solutions that just require a client to connect to whatever server it wants with a well-known protocol. reply entuno 9 hours agoparentWhere I have RSS feeds from news sites, I usually skim down the list of titles, read an article (in my feed) if it's interesting, and then move on. I never visit their website, I don't see their adverts, their tracking scripts can't run, and I don't see or interact with their comments. Which is great for me as the end user - but makes it much harder for them to monetise. reply galleywest200 7 hours agorootparentLe Monde will tell you that you only got 70% or so of the article in your feed and you need to go to the site to get the full article. Why don't more feeds do that? Actually, I am unsure if this is the feed itself or the fact that my RSS reader scrapes the sites too. Some sites even have different RSS links for subscribers only that give a full feed. reply oneeyedpigeon 9 hours agorootparentprev> makes it much harder for them to monetise. On the other hand, RSS definitely provides extra opportunities to monitise. Imagine your business provides a customisable \"offers\" feed so you can tell interested parties when a sale occurs, etc. Businesses should be falling over themselves to get that kind of engagement. reply entuno 8 hours agorootparentThat just sounds like a mailing list, but without the ability to easily identify and track the individuals you're sending to. reply oneeyedpigeon 8 hours agorootparentSo... a win-win? RSS also avoids all the problems associated with spam. reply openrisk 7 hours agorootparentprevNot everyone is out to monetise (e.g public sector).

The user can decide if they want to visit the site to read more, subscribe etc. reply saint_yossarian 9 hours agorootparentprevNobody's forcing them to put the full text into the feed, for me the main benefit is not having to check the site manually. reply entuno 8 hours agorootparentAs the consumer, that's a big benefit, and the main reason I use RSS. But for the company running the website, the fact that you're no longer browsing to their site, being served adverts and tracking code, and seeing what's on their homepage is not a benefit reply _heimdall 6 hours agoparentprevIt comes down to a push versus pull architecture. RSS is pull based, you aren't notified when a feed is updated. Most people today want push based with a feed, with all the bells and whistles of a social feed that is updated instantly. Federation comes in mainly because push based systems require a server managing who follows who, what is posted, and who to notify of updates. That's a lot of information for one central service to be responsible for, leading some to think its better to federate and trust a bunch of servers to host copies of some or all of that same data. reply palata 1 hour agorootparentRight, those are good points. Still I can't help but to wonder whether those notifications are needed or not. Except for instant messaging, I generally don't want notifications.

Whenever I receive an HTML-only email (that my email reader cannot open), I send a kind email to the company, asking if they could consider adding a plaintext version next to it. I clearly explain that they can keep the HTML version as a default, and that some people need plaintext for accessibility and security reasons. I often receive answers, that surprised me!

I don't even know if they did anything more than answering to the email. reply geor9e 1 minute agoparentI don't mean to sound critical - but what? Why can't your email reader convert html to plain text? There are so many open source tools that do this in one line. It's not like websites have a seperate .txt file for the blind, for every .html page. When you click \"Read aloud\" (or whatever the inbuilt screenreader calls it) it does the conversion automatically. But instead, you're shifting the burden onto hundreds of non-technical email writers, shaming them for not catering to your niche desire? And you've been doing it for years, with not a single success? Think about it for a moment ‚Äî even if you won, are people going to manually create 2 versions of every email, or are they going to create one and let software convert it?

If you print the HTML, it's often full of \" \", images and links unrelated to the actual content. It's hard to extract the meaningful part of that pile of stuff in a trustworthy way (and you wouldn't want to lose information). Also many of those emails are autogenerated. So the template has to be done once, and that's it. And it should be trivial for whoever composes the HTML email to copy-paste the important part into a text-only version. Maybe it would actually help them think about what the important part actually is. reply rednafi 9 hours agoparentprevInteresting. I didn‚Äôt even know you could do it.

Full-text searching uses Elasticsearch. reply bluebarbet 7 hours agoprevWhile I use RSS, I think we need to recognize that it's slowly going away. Even a single publisher that's missing a feed will be a deal-breaker for any new adopters. And RSS is an over-complex solution anyway, designed for a time before web standards when sites all had spaghetti table layouts. Today there's no need to create a whole shadow site in fussily-formatted XML for what can usually be found in the page source of the article list page as a bunch of ``s. The more sustainable solution, I believe, is client-based: RSS readers that also parse HTML. There is even an HTML attribute schema, `hfeed`, that makes this easy-peasy and is much easier to implement for publishers. I still don't understand why this solution has not taken off yet. It's clearly optimal. reply _heimdall 6 hours agoparentAt least for me, there is still benefit in being able to load only the list of articles. Attempting to fetch the full HTML and scrape it can be error prone and may not even work depending on how the site is using client-side rendering. Microformsts, which give us things like h-feed, are useful but the author is already thinking about the feed reader use case. Why wouldn't they also hook up an RSS feed? reply bluebarbet 6 hours agorootparentThe scraping issue is resolved by just putting the `h-feed` attributes on the relevant HTML elements. Far easier to implement and maintain than RSS. Maintaining a parallel XML endpoint is itself very error-prone, I know this from unpleasant experience. The only drawback to `h-feed` I can see is that the feed reader must fetch a larger initial payload. Seems like a small price to pay for much easier implementation and maintainability. reply _heimdall 4 hours agorootparentDo RSS readers and libraries do a good job of parsing out the feed without all the related microformats tags like h-entry, p-title, etc? I've found microformats to be just as much work to maintain (assuming more than just h-feed is needed these days). Its still easy to break silently, and if I care enough to make it I'll automate a test. Testing an RSS feed shouldn't be any harder than testing the rendered HTML to catch silent regressions. reply jasoneckert 5 hours agoprevAfter getting sick of maintaining the JavaScript in iWeb myself after Apple deprecated it, I ended up migrating my personal blog from iWeb to Hugo almost a decade ago.

After the migration was complete without an RSS feed, I received dozens of emails within the same week from people I never knew read my blog specifically requesting an RSS feed on the new site. So I added it. That quickly reminded me about how important and common RSS is, and I'll continue ensuring that RSS feeds exist on any blog I create as a result. reply kmfrk 5 hours agoprevI was happy to see Bluesky supporting RSS on all profiles, but less excited to see that there's nothing in the content and title fields: https://github.com/bluesky-social/social-app/issues/3384 https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:3nfshkzomgboapasu6amkhui/rs...

RSS is also a signal that some new content has arrived, why would one not send it to the world if its essentially free? Even if their business model requires that you visit their website (instead of reading everything on a client app) syndicating a teaser message makes sense. In any case, many actually useful sites that disable RSS are public orgs that do not rely on adtech or subscriptions. Its the sad result of digital illiteracy and outsourcing their web presence to some inane outfit thats up their neck in the SEO and social media shit. Incidentally a Web that makes full use of RSS is also one where more complex protocols like ActivityPub and ATProto can flourish. A client is a client is a client.

So there's one place for reading posts and for publishing your own posts, just like the timelines from big tech. Combine that with a list of shared links which functions as a blog roll and consists of the feeds that you follow, and you have yourself a Really Social Site. You can even download the OPML file that contains all the shared links and start following some feeds from it yourself. So discovery is also possible with RSS feeds and OPML lists, albeit it works slightly different than you're used to from big tech. After that I built a Newspaper module that automatically collects new posts from feeds that I selected. This is my main way to get news without some algorithm deciding for me.

I only click for new content. reply grumbel 7 hours agorootparentprevI am not talking about RSS, I am talking about plain old bookmarks. Browser never would give you notification when something you bookmarked changed. The RSS feature was always kind of useless, since it required that the website provided a RSS feed to begin with, which most don't. The implementation in Firefox was also horrible on top.

And if you respond with \"well, I don't care about the actual content, I just want to receive a notification when the page has changed at all\", think how long would it take for every marketer use that \"feature\" to simply make minimal changes in the site to trick their viewers into inflating their page view numbers... reply grumbel 7 hours agorootparentMozilla had half a billion dollars each year to work with, I am sure they could have figured something out if they cared.

If browsers started doing this scraping I can only imagine the arms race. I can only see this happening as a service. A company crawls the web‚Äîprobably a search company. Their LLM classifies changes. Their users can subscribe to individual sites or pages. Even then there are downsides to publishers including loss of some tracking information and users spending less time on their sites being subjected to advertisements. reply bluebarbet 4 hours agorootparentThis was part of the technical justification for RSS: concentrate all the redundant page hits in once place. But another reason was that parsing an article list from messy tables-based HTML was harder than it is today with HTML5. There's even a feed attribute `h-feed` available today, which effectively turns list pages into feeds. Nobody uses it. The problem with the \"single lightweight endpoint\" is that it has to be maintained. RSS is literally a whole shadow site, with finicky XML validation to worry about on top. I've worked on multiple projects where the RSS endpoint was broken much of the time. It's both fragile and not very visible. A solution involving client parsing of semantic markup at least has the benefit of requiring zero maintenance. reply rglullis 7 hours agorootparentprev> But hey, instead of fixing some HTML tags lets reinvent a completely new format and require every singe website on the planet to adopt that, that'll sure work out well... It worked amazingly well! It worked so well that it became a problem for the publishers when they realized the standard for syndication has become so widely adopted that people were not visiting the websites anymore and they had lost control of content gatekeeping. > Mozilla had half a billion dollars each year to work with, I am sure they could have figured something out if they cared. I agree with you that Mozilla has shown that they don't really care about an open web, but I think you are reversing cause and effect.

Why? You can‚Äôt bombard RSS with advertising like you can on browsers and if people could get the information they need from RSS they won‚Äôt see ads. I recall the dropping of RSS happened over 6 months to my recollection. RSS was here and every website of merit used it, then all of a sudden Chrome, FireFox and Safari all dropped RSS support. You could go and install a separate RSS client but few people did that (extra steps and all) and then websites saw no one was using RSS and dropped support.

    "originBody": "Sleep disorders affect a large population, with demand for sleep support on the rise. Although previous research has explored the relationship between specific nutrients and insomnia, comprehensive analyses of daily eating patterns of macro- and micronutrients remain limited. Diets high in sodium, low in potassium, or both, have been associated with altered nocturnal blood pressure decrease (when blood pressure does not decline as much as it normally does at night). At the same time, nocturnal hypertension has been linked to sleep disturbances. As such, a cross-sectional study in Japan examined the relationship between potassium and sodium intake and insomnia among healthy Japanese adults. Dietary data on energy intake and consumption of protein, fat, carbohydrates, sodium, and potassium during breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks spanning January to February 2021 were derived from Asken, a widely used Japanese food-logging mobile app. Users can input ingredients, dishes, and portion sizes into the app, which automatically calculates calorie and nutritional intake by referencing the Standard Tables of Food Composition in Japan, 2020 (Eighth Revised Edition), as determined by the country‚Äôs Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. The app boasts over 11.2m downloads as of November 2024. Self-reported food records accumulated on the app have been validated as reliable for research purposes. As part of the study, online survey responses were obtained from 4,568 app users (3,320 women and 1,248 men) aged between 20 and 64 at the end of January 2021. Sleep disturbances were assessed using the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), a self-administered psychometric questionnaire designed to evaluate sleep disorders, particularly insomnia. The questionnaire consists of eight items, with total scores classified into three groups according to symptom severity ‚Äî normal (scores of 3 or less), subclinical insomnia (scores of greater than 3 but less than 6), and clinical insomnia (scores of 6 or more). The results showed that total daily potassium intake was inversely associated with log AIS score (p = 0.034). When consumption during each meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks) was analysed, only potassium intake at dinner remained significantly associated with AIS score (p = 0.003). ‚ÄúOur findings suggest that potassium intake may be related to sleep quality. Higher potassium intake, especially at dinner, indicates fewer sleep disturbances [based on AIS scores]. This study provides a foundation for future intervention studies and personalised dietary recommendations,‚Äù the authors wrote. Potassium power Previous studies have shown that lower potassium intake is associated with short sleepers, sleepiness during the day, poor sleep quality and sleep efficiency, and nighttime awakening. There are several potential mechanisms explaining the relationship between potassium intake and sleep. Firstly, adequate potassium levels are critical for proper muscle contraction and relaxation, as the mineral plays a key role in transmitting electrical signals in nerve fibres and muscle cells, thereby regulating overall muscle function and contributing to sleep patterns. Additionally, potassium is essential for neurotransmitter function, which is crucially involved in regulating sleep and wakefulness. Studies have also demonstrated that potassium reduces both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Given the well-documented association between poor sleep and hypertension, these findings suggest that potassium intake could lead to better sleep by regulating blood pressure. However, the mechanism underlying why dinner intake is particularly significant remains to be investigated. ‚ÄúTo better understand the observed association between potassium intake and insomnia, future research should include both dietary records and blood pressure data. Longitudinal and intervention studies will also be needed to establish causal relationships and explore other factors influencing sleep.‚Äù Link between sodium intake and sleep to be verified Several studies have found sodium or salt intake to be associated with sleep maintenance difficulties, later sleep times, and a higher probability of insomnia. For example, a Japanese cross-sectional study showed that energy-adjusted sodium intake was positively correlated with sleep duration among healthy Japanese adult men. In the present study, however, no significant association between sodium intake and AIS scores was discovered. This calls for further evidence to verify the relationship between sodium intake and sleep. The Japanese diet is characterised by high sodium and low potassium intake, or a high sodium-to-potassium ratio. The sodium-to-potassium ratio is recognised as a superior indicator for assessing blood pressure outcomes and hypertension incidence, compared to individual measures of sodium or potassium. The sodium-chloride cotransporter (NCC), expressed in the kidneys, is a key molecule in the regulation of urinary potassium excretion. Consuming a low-potassium diet activates the NCC, promoting sodium reabsorption. Conversely, a high-potassium diet strongly suppresses NCC activation, resulting in increased urinary sodium and potassium excretion. Nevertheless, the results in this study did not find any meaningful association between the sodium-to-potassium intake ratio and AIS scores.

RDA for potassium intake is 3500-5000mg daily for an adult male. Most people do not get close to this amount. Potassium supplements are 99mg per pill.

I have also been consuming electrolyte mixes containing potassium to help with muscle recovery from training, and have found them to help with physical soreness & general well-being. reply Nemi 4 hours agoparentI also take magnesium for sleep. I swear by it. I also believe I have an underlying kidney disorder that was causing all sorts of subtle problems and after researching for years decided to try potassium supplements and it relieved the acute symptoms I was having (daytime sleepiness after meals) and also a whole slew of symptoms I didn‚Äôt realize I was having (poor workout performance and recovery, constant thirst from sodium/potassium imbalance, heart palpitations, especially at night when lying in bed, temperature regulation when trying to sleep, restless legs at night, and sleep quality). Sleep was the most surprising. I used to wake at around 3am and just couldn‚Äôt get back to sleep. I still wake up to pee, but I get right back to sleep. The single most surprising thing is the quality of my sleep. I now sleep like a rock. So unbelievably hard. And when I wake I feel so rested and more clear headed. I don‚Äôt need to sleep as many hours anymore and feel better than when i would sleep 9 hours. Recently several sleep studies started talking about how sleep is not a passive activity, but a ‚Äòwashing‚Äô of CSF over your brain. I could get some details wrong since I am going off of memory, but I believe the amount of CSF movement and production basically triples when you sleep. I hypothesize that this is simply your bodies way of cleaning the waste products out of your brain. Do you know what precursors are to create CSF? Electrolytes like sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate. It is my hypothesis that I was ‚Äòusing up‚Äô all the potassium available with the first couple of sleep cycles and once it was gone I was unable to effectively create more CSF, rendering my sleep ineffective. All I need to take is a couple of 99mg tablets right before bed (along with some magnesium chloride) and I sleep like I did when I was 10. I am 57. To say it has transformed my life would be an understatement. reply mmorse1217 2 hours agorootparentI have every single one of your symptoms and arrived at almost the same conclusion: taking electrolytes tablets intended for workout recovery (just sodium, magnesium and potassium, no sugar) improves alleviates almost all of my symptoms and gives me energy I haven't had since I was 12. I haven't been able to get a doctor to take me seriously for ten years. I will try the potassium + magnesium tablets at night instead of a generic multivitamin. Thank you so much for your comment. Do you have any additional information about this relationship between CSF and electrolyte deficiency? Do you know anything about possible upstream causes of electrolyte deficiency? Any pointers would be super helpful. reply Nemi 1 hour agorootparentI also started with general ‚Äúelectrolytes‚Äù but found that one of my problems was that I was getting way too much sodium and not enough potassium. This was the primary driver of my post-meal somnolence. Most general electrolyte supplements are primarily sodium, and this was exacerbating my symptoms in some cases. I now only eat meals that have a reasonable amount of sodium and then take a couple of potassium tablets a couple of hours after eating if I feel myself starting to get a little sleepy. 30 minutes later I am ‚Äòback to normal‚Äô, whereas I used to be sleepy for several hours as my body tried to bring my electrolytes back into balance. I also would have massive unquenchable thirst during this that I now don‚Äôt have. I have read no studies that link CSF production with electrolyte deficiencies. This is a hypothesis of my own with no backing, so take it for what it is worth. Having said that, there have been many posts on HN on the recent studies on CSF https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39723704. I made the connection with CSF production and electrolytes when I was reading more about CSF production and it jumped off the page at me that potassium and other electrolytes are used to create CSF. It all just came together for me why taking potassium has helped me so much. reply Nemi 1 hour agorootparentprevSorry, you asked about ‚Äòpossible upstream causes of electrolyte deficiency‚Äô. In my case I believe it is caused by an undiagnosed kidney problem loosely called ‚Äòsalt-wasting syndrome‚Äô. There are many types, but they all revolve around a genetic disorder where the tubules in your kidneys that are responsible for removing different electrolytes from the urine and retaining them are malformed and are not able to keep the electrolytes like a normal kidney does. Here are a few I found in my research: -Bartters Syndrome- https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/bartters-syndrome/ Many different variants, so this is a possibility. Type 5? ------------------------- -Gitelman syndrome- https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/8547/gitelman-syn... Symptoms include tingling of face ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî Fanconi Syndrome https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/kidney-and-urinary-tract-d... I my particular case, I believe I have a type that does not impact sodium, but does potassium. When I eat a high sodium meal it causes me to pee a lot to try to get the my sodium levels back to normal. However, my body can‚Äôt retain potassium when it does this (and since I was eating much more sodium and much less potassium than my body required) I end up with normal sodium levels but low potassium levels. Taking potassium a few hours after a meal ‚Äúfixed‚Äù this. Short of genetic issue like this I am not sure what could cause it. I think this can be an early symptom of Diabetes, but don‚Äôt know much about that. What I am talking about here has got to be rare, so it may not be applicable to you. Just another anecdote ‚Äì when reading some of these links it made me remember another interesting symptom I used to have that I did not know was related: I would get ‚Äúfacial numbness‚Äù. Specifically, my lips and the immediate surrounding area would feel slightly numb. Usually in the morning after a poor night of sleep. I would remember feeling this on the way to work in the car. It would contribute to that dazed feeling I felt like I would swimming through a mental fog. Oh, and one more! I also don‚Äôt get nearly so hung over from drinking! This was a surprise for me. I have always drank a lot of water while drinking alcohol, but I would always have the worst drained feeling the next day with such a headache. The headache would last all day. However, if I now take some potassium while drinking and throughout the night (depending on how much I drink), I often don‚Äôt have much of a hangover. This amazes me! I am 57 and used to drink a lot when I was in my 20‚Äôs. I had some friends that could be normal the next day and it always blew my mind. Now I think I know why.

Why is it dirty? It's not dirt, and it's not oil breakdown (in most cases). The oil is drawing components from the food into itself. Forget the frying for a second; most fries are parboiled or blanched -- this also leeches material away from the vegetable, this time it leaves with the water used for blanching. A french fry is delicious, but it's different than a potato -- even if it's made from one. reply hilux 10 hours agorootparentprevI guess that depends how hot you fry it. reply rbanffy 5 hours agorootparentHow hot would it need to be do fission a stable isotope of Potassium? reply lostlogin 11 minutes agorootparentMaybe it‚Äôs fusion and potassium content increases? reply nick__m 4 hours agorootparentprevA temperature so hot that the atoms of the potato would violently collide into each other, probably at least tens of millions of degrees and you would need something to confine the potato plasma! reply OJFord 4 hours agorootparent> confine the potato plasma And once that's done, The Sims has almost loaded. reply pertymcpert 16 hours agorootparentprevI don't know about the case of potassium specifically, but in general I thought that the bioavailability of elements can vary with different types of cooking? reply bowsamic 11 hours agorootparentprevWhy would something being an element mean that heating it as part of a food wouldn‚Äôt act as a catalyst for some chemical interaction? reply echoangle 9 hours agorootparentThere would still be potassium in there, unless it‚Äôs pulled out by the frying oil. Elements can‚Äôt get lost in a chemical reaction. You can only change the molecule they‚Äôre part of, so it might not be processable by the human body, but the potassium isn‚Äôt going to disappear. reply jaapz 7 hours agorootparentIt's not going to dissappear, but it could dissolve into the cooking oil, leaving less in the finished product. This happens with boiling as well. The fact that the element cannot physically vanish into thin air is not really relevant here reply echoangle 6 hours agorootparentIt is relevant because I replied to this: > Why would something being an element mean that heating it as part of a food wouldn‚Äôt act as a catalyst for some chemical interaction? It sounds like the person thinks that chemical reactions can make elements change/disappear, which is not the case. And I specifically mentioned the Oil removing the potassium as an option. reply rbanffy 5 hours agoparentprevWhat it won't help with is mosquitos. They LOVE banana-flavored people.

I always get evaporated and condensed mixed up. reply OJFord 3 hours agorootparentCondensed milk is evaporated milk + added sugar. I sometimes buy evaporated because it is a big time-saver, but never sweetened condensed because it's quick and easy to add sugar myself, and leaves me in control of how much relative to the other ingredients. Both are thicker, creamier, and even sweeter than milk - because even without the added sugar the natural sweetness of the milk is concentrated by the reduction, removing all that water. reply mmikeff 10 hours agorootparentprevI‚Äôve mixed them up too and that was the worst Mac and Cheese I ever made! reply lostlogin 5 minutes agorootparentI once had mac and cheese where the usually-excellent cook mixed up the cheese sauce with the dessert custard.

You cannot expect the same level of rigour from journalists that try to sensationalise findings to get more clicks. reply OutOfHere 2 hours agorootparentNews articles have a valid purpose of popularizing journal articles for the vast majority of people who will feel lost looking at a journal article directly.

Wow, how well all those people must sleep! As someone scoring 12, it's pretty bad and I am suffering a lot while trying to sleep and during day time because I did not sleep well. If my understanding of statistics, standard deviations and the standardized partial regression coefficient are correct, potassium supplementation in the evening only DECREASES this score by about 0.2178 (Beta ‚àí0.066, multiplied with SD of 3.3), which is kinda worthless. Please correct me if I am wrong. reply mkl 7 hours agoparentJust scored 14. May have a bit of a problem. https://toolonline.net/en/AIS, https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbti/assets/user-content/documents... reply OutOfHere 10 hours agoparentprevIt decreases the score. It doesn't increase the score. An increase would be harmful. The beta is negative. The abstract is wrong. It is not worthless. For good sleep, potassium levels have to be adequate. Once one improves the level, one can move on to other factors. As for what works for me, avoiding caffeine after 12 pm helps, as does sunlight exposure in the daytime. With regard to a supplement stack, these help: collagen hydrolysate 12g, magnesium citrate, calcium, B6 as P5P, melatonin 4 mg, L-theanine 100-200 mg, and various sleep promoting herbs. Ensure your BP is optimal, well below 120/80 for most people under 70. Uncorrected acid reflux too worsens sleep, but avoiding consumption in the last three hours and also famotidine help. reply Traubenfuchs 9 hours agorootparent> It decreases the score. Yes DECREASE instead of INCREASE. What I was going for in my head was \"improve\" I guess. Thanks for pointing that out. > B6 as P5P Don't forget it's one of the few nutrients that accumulates and that you can get too much of. It causes nerve damage and mystery sores. > melatonin 4 mg That's probably too much: https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/E4cKD9iTWHaE7f3AJ/melatonin-... reply OutOfHere 2 hours agorootparentThe P5P form harms less if in excess. This is in contrast to the default form which is pyridoxine. I have found 20 mg of P5P twice daily to be quite useful for keeping stress spikes in check. Regarding melatonin, newer data up to 2024 in https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38888087/ confirms that 4 mg is an optimal dose for sleep.

Can anyone here clarify the pros/cons of this? It's quite wretched by itself, but if used very sparingly is not bad with many foods. As I'm sure all know, K in supplemental form is FDA regulated and one would need to take up to 1/2 a bottle to reach the RDA, whereas in salt sub form a single, unpleasant serving can get close to the RDA.

      "A Japanese study using data from the Asken food-logging app investigated the relationship between potassium and sodium intake and insomnia in 4,568 adults. - Findings indicated that higher potassium intake, particularly at dinner, was associated with fewer sleep disturbances, as measured by the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS). - While sodium intake has been previously linked to sleep issues, this study found no significant association with AIS scores, highlighting the need for further research on dietary impacts on sleep."

    "commentSummary": [
      "A study suggests that higher potassium intake at dinner is associated with fewer sleep disturbances, potentially due to its ability to neutralize stomach acid reflux. - The findings are debated, with some arguing that more stomach acidity is necessary to prevent reflux, indicating the need for further research. - While potassium may improve sleep, excessive intake can pose heart risks, particularly for individuals on specific medications; magnesium supplements are also mentioned for enhancing sleep quality."

    "commentBody": "Using ChatGPT is not bad for the environment (andymasley.substack.com)200 points by returningfory2 14 hours agohidepastfavorite248 comments crakhamster01 20 minutes agoOne miss in this post is that the author tries to make their point by comparing energy consumption of LLMs to arbitrary points of reference. We should be comparing them to their relevant parallels. Comparing a ChatGPT query to an hour long Zoom call isn't useful. The call might take up ~1700 mL of water, but that is still wildly more efficient than what we used to do prior - travel/commute to meet in person. The \"10x a Google search\" point is relevant because for many of the use cases mentioned in this post and others like it (e.g. \"try asking factual questions!\"), you could just as easily get that with 1 Google search and skimming the results. I have found use for LLMs in software development, but I'd be lying if I said I couldn't live without it. Almost every use case of an LLM has a simple alternative - often just employing critical thinking or learning a new skill. It feels like this post is a long way of saying \"yes, there are negative impacts, but I value my time more\". reply andymasley 4 minutes agoparentI basically do think that at some threshold it's important to weigh your time against negative impacts. I personally avoid taking flights whenever I can because of the climate and think that's worth my time relative to the emissions saved, but I also never worry about optimizing the energy use of my digital clock because that would take too much time relative to the emissions I could save. ChatGPT exists somewhere between those two things, and my argument in the post is that it's much closer to the digital clock. reply Retric 1 minute agorootparentOn a logarithmic scale, it‚Äôs closer to the flight. reply marcelsalathe 5 minutes agoprevA very nice article. But the google search and LLM energy estimates are outdated. More recent work put both at 10x less. https://engineeringprompts.substack.com/p/does-chatgpt-use-1... reply scottcha 13 hours agoprevYet we also see that hyperscale cloud emissions targets have been reversed due to AI investment, Datacenter growth is hitting grid capacity limits in many regions, and peaker plant and other non-renewable resources on the grid are being deployed more to handle this specific growth from AI. I think the author, by qualifying on \"chatgpt\" maybe can make the claims they are making but I don't believe the larger argument would hold for AI as a whole or when you convert the electricity use to emissions. I'm personally on the side that the ROI will probably work out in the long run but not by minimizing the potential impact and keeping the focus on how we can make this technology (currently in its infancy) more efficient. [edit wording] reply wmf 13 hours agoparentVoluntary conservation was only working by accident and guilt tripping never works. The grid needs to become clean so that we can have new industries. reply shafyy 1 minute agorootparentEven if grid the was 100% renewable, this does not mean that there's no environmental cost to producing electricity. As a society, we need to decide what is important and try to minize energy consumption for things that are not important. And shoving LLMs into every nook and cranny of every application, so just tech giants who run the data centers can make more money and some middle managers get automatic summaries of their unnecessary video calls and emails is, I would argue, not important. But once again, the fundamental issue is late-stage capitalism. reply XorNot 11 hours agorootparentprevYep, this is the real answer. It's also the only answer. The big fiction was everyone getting hopped on the idea that \"karma\" was going to be real, and people's virtue would be correctly identified by overt environmentalism rather then action. Fossil fuel companies won, and they won in about 1980s when BP paid an advertising firm to come up with \"personal carbon footprint\" as a meaningful metric. Basically destroyed environmentalism since...well I'll let you know when it stops. reply fmbb 11 hours agorootparentprevThe grid being clean means not having any fossil power. We can only get there by shutting down all fossil fuel power plants. We can not get there by adding new power generation. reply celticninja 1 hour agorootparentWell you need the latter to replace the former. So you need to add new power generation to allow you to shut down fossil fuel plants. And to be honest what we need to do is replace them with nuclear power stations to manages the base load of nations power requirements. Either that or much better power storage is required reply caseyy 46 minutes agorootparentprev> We can only get there by shutting down all fossil fuel power plants. We can not get there by adding new power generation. https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1433498-no-take-only-throw \"No add new power plants, only transform our grid to greener\". reply YetAnotherNick 11 hours agoparentprevWhy do you belive this? Datacenter uses just a 1-1.3 percent of electricity from grid and even if you suppose AI increased the usage by 2x(which I really doubt), the number would still be tiny. Also AI training is easiest workload to regulate, as you can only train when you have cheaper green energy. reply kolinko 10 hours agorootparentI also had doubts, but asked chat and it confirms it‚Äôs an issue - including sources. https://chatgpt.com/share/678b6b3e-9708-8009-bcad-8ba84a5145... The issue is that they are often localised, so even if it‚Äôs just 1% of power, it can cause issues. Still, by itself, grid issues don‚Äôt mean climate issues. And any argument complaining about a co2 cost should also consider alternative cost to be reliable. Even if ai was causing 1% or 2% or 10% of energy use, the real question is how much it saves by making society more efficient. And even if it wasn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs again more of a question about energy companies polluting with co2. Microsoft, which hosts OpenAI, is famously amazing in terms of their co2 emissions - so far they were going way beyond what other companies were doing. reply YetAnotherNick 6 hours agorootparentWhat do you mean by confirms the issue? What's the issue exactly? reply oneplane 58 minutes agorootparentThe issue is that when you have a high local usage your grid loses the ability to respond to peaks since that capacity is now always in use. Essentially it raises the baseline use which means your elasticity is pretty much gone. A grid isn't a magic battery that is always there, it is constantly fluctuating, regardless of the intent of producers and consumers. You need to be able to have enough elasticity to deal with that fact. Changing that is hard (and expensive), but it is the only way (such as the technical reality). The solution is not to create say, 1000 extra coal-fired generating facilities since you can't really turn them on or off at will. Same goes for gas, nuclear etc. You'd need a few of them for your baseline load (combined with other sources like solar, wind, hydro, whatever) and then make sure you have your non-renewable sources have margin and redundancy and use storage for the rest. This was always the case, and it will always be the case. But now with information technology, the degree to which you can permanently raise demand on the grid to an extreme degree is where the problem becomes much more apparent. And because it's not manufacturing (which is an extreme consumer of energy) you don't really get the \"run on lower output\" option. You can't have an LLM do \"just a little bit of inferencing\". Just like you can't have your Netflix send only half a movie to \"save power\". In the past we had the luxury of nighttime lower demand which means industry could up their usage, but datacenters don't sleep at night. And they also can't wait for batch processing during the day. reply YetAnotherNick 3 minutes agorootparentExcept neither ChatGPT and nor sources say this. First source says: > Gas-fired generation could meet data centers‚Äô immediate power needs and transition to backup generation over time, panelists told the Northwest Power and Conservation Council. What you are saying has nothing to do with local, but has to do with large abrupt changes in electricity usage, and datacenter electricity usage is generally more predictible and smooth than most other industry. seanmcdirmid 13 hours agoparentprevIs that true though? Data centers can be placed anywhere in the USA, they could be placed near a bunch of hydro or wind farm resources in the western grid which has little coal anyways outside of one line from Utah to socal. The AI doesn‚Äôt have to be located anywhere near to where it is used since fiber is probably easier to run than a high voltage power line. reply wmf 13 hours agorootparentThat was already done years ago and people are predicting that the grid will be maxed out soon. reply seanmcdirmid 13 hours agorootparentBuild new data centers near sources of power, and grid capacity isn‚Äôt going to be a problem. Heck, American industry used to follow that (building garment factories on fast moving rivers before electricity was much of a thing, Boeing grew up in the northwest due to cheap aluminum helped out by hydro). Why is AI somehow different from an airplane? reply wmf 12 hours agorootparentThey'll have to build new power generation and build the data centers next to it. reply sitkack 12 hours agorootparentprevYou are massively conflating what is possible with what is done. reply seanmcdirmid 12 hours agorootparentI know data centers are built next to wind farms for these reasons already. We have an abundance of those projects out here in the PNW. reply scottcha 12 hours agorootparentprevThere are a large number of reasons the AI datacenters are geographically distributed--just to list a few off the top of my head which come up as top drivers: latency, data sovereignty, resilience, grid capacity, renewable energy availability. reply Karrot_Kream 12 hours agorootparentWhy does latency matter for a model that responds in 10s of seconds? Latency to a datacenter is measured in 10s or 100s of milliseconds, which is 3-4 orders of magnitude less. reply scottcha 12 hours agorootparentTwo reasons that I understand 1. not all these AIs are LLMs and many have much lower latency SLAs than chat and 2. These are just one part of a service architecture and when you have multiple latencies across the stack they tend to have multiplicative effects. reply recursivecaveat 11 hours agorootparentprevIf you look at a model with a diverse competitive provider set like llama 3 the latency is 1/4 second, and it will definitely improve at a minimum incrementally if quality is held constant: https://artificialanalysis.ai/models/llama-3-3-instruct-70b/... Remember that as long as you experience the response linearly (very much the case for audio output for eg) then the first-chunk latency is your actual latency, not to stream the entire response. reply getwiththeprog 14 hours agoprevThis is a great article for discussion. However articles like this must link to references. It is one thing to assert, another to prove. I do agree that heating/cooling, car and transport use, and diet play massive roles in climate change that should not be subsumed by other debates. The flip side to the authors argument is that LLMs are not only used by home users doing 20 searches a day. Governments and Mega-Corporations are chewing through GPU hours on god-knows-what. New nuclear and other power facilities are being proposed to power their use, this is not insignificant.

Still, LLM queries are not made equal. The environmental justification does not take into account for models querying other services, like the famous case where a single ChatGPT query resulted in thousands of HTTP requests. reply simonw 13 hours agorootparentI see people complaining that ChatGPT usage is unethical for environmental reasons all the time.

The keystone statement is incredibly vague, and likely misleading. What is \"an AI model\"? From what I found, this is referring to GPT-2, reply gloflo 10 hours agorootparentJust 200 flights? I would expected a number at least 100 times that. 200 flights of that range are what, 0.1% of a single day of global air traffic? All of that is crazy in terms of environmental destruction but this makes AI training seem nothing to focus on to me. reply mmoskal 12 hours agorootparentprevI assume this comes from the 60GWh figure, which does translate to about 200 flights (assuming energy density of gasoline; in actual CO2 emissions it was probably less since likely cleaner energy was used than for running planes). reply moozilla 10 hours agorootparentprevThe link the article uses to source the 60 GWh claim (1) appears to be broken, but all of the other sources I found give similar numbers, for example (2) which gives 50 GWh. This is specifically to train GPT-4, GPT-3 was estimated to have taken 1,287 MWh in (3), so the 50 GWh number seems reasonable. I couldn't find any great sources for the 200 plane flights number (and as you point out the article doesn't source this either), but I asked o1 to crunch the numbers (4) and it came up with a similar figure (50-300 flights depending on the size of the plane). I was curious if the numbers would be different if you considered emissions instead of directly converting jet fuel energy to watt hours, but the end result was basically the same.

Say you want to do 30 minutes of video (h265) or 30 minutes of LLM inferencing on a generic consumer device, ignoring the source of the model or source of encoded video, you get about 4x difference: Energy usage for 30 minutes of H.265 decoding: ~15‚Äì20 Wh. Energy usage for 30 minutes of Llama3 inference: ~40‚Äì60 Wh. This is optimised already, so a working hardware H.265 decoder is assumed, and for inferencing, something on the level of an RTX 3050, but can also be a TPU or NE. While not the most scientific comparison, it's perhaps good to know that video decoding is practically always local, and for streaming services it will use whatever is available and might even switch codecs (i.e. AV1, H.265, H.264 depending on what is available, and what licenses are used). And if you have older hardware, some codecs won't even exist in hardware, to the point where you start doing software decoding (very inefficient). AI inferencing is mostly remote (at least the heavy loads) in a datacenter because local availability of hardware is pretty hit and miss, models are pretty big and spinning one up every time you just wanted to ask something is not very user friendly. Because in a datacenter you tend to pay for amperage per rack, you spec your AI inferencing hardware to eat that power since you're not saving any money or hardware life when you don't use it. That means that efficiency is important (more use out of a rack) but scaling/idling isn't really that big of a deal (but it has slowly dawned on people that burning power 'because you can' is not really a great model). That AI inferencing in a datacenter is more power-hungry as a result, because they can, because it is faster, and that's what attracts users. I would estimate that the local llama3 inferencing uses less power than when done in a datacenter, because there simply is less power available locally (try finding an end-user device that is used mass-market with enough power available, you won't; only small markets like gaming PCs and workstations will do). reply semiquaver 46 minutes agorootparent20 Wh for 30 minutes of hardware accelerated h265 decoding is an order of magnitude too high at any bitrate. Please cite your sources. reply oneplane 35 minutes agorootparentAs I wrote in my reply, I don't have \"sources\". Pure decode excluding any other requirements is probably pretty low, but running a decoder isn't all you need. There's network, display, storage and RAM so your OS can run etc. There will probably be plenty of variation (brightness, environment, how you get your stream in since a 5G modem is probably going to be different energy-wise compared to WiFi or Ethernet), and if you have something like a decoder in the CPU or in the GPU and if that GPU is separate, more PCIe involvement etc. But we can still estimate: Hardware decoding (1080p video): ~5‚Äì15 W for the CPU/GPU Overall system power usage (screen, memory, etc.): ~25‚Äì45 W for a typical laptop. Duration (30 minutes): If we assume an average of 35 W total system power, the energy consumption is: Energy = 35W √ó 0.5h ours = 17.5 Wh We can do a similar one for inference, also recognising you'll have variations either way: CPU inference: ~50 W. GPU inference: ~80 W. Overall system power usage: ~70‚Äì120 W for a typical laptop during LLM inference. Duration (30 minutes): Assuming an average of 100 W total system power: Energy = 100W √ó 0.5 hours = 50Wh We could pretend that our own laptop is very good at some of these tasks, but we're not taking about the best possible outcome, we're talking about the fact that there is a difference between decoding a video stream and doing LLM inference, and the fact that that difference is big enough to make someone's point that video streaming is somehow 'worse' or 'as bad as' LLM usage moot. Because it's not. LLM training and LLM inference eats way more energy. Edit: looking at some random search engine results, you get a bunch of reddit posts with screenshots from people asking where the power consumption goes on their locally running LLM inferencing: https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/17vr3uu/what_ex... It seems their local usage hovers around 100W. Other similar posts hover around the same, but it seems to be throttle based as other machines with faster chips also throttle around the same power target while delivering better performance. Most local models use a quantised model which is less resource-hungry, the cloud-hosted models tend to use much larger (and thus more hungry models). Edit2: looking at some real-world optimised decoding measurements, it appears you can decode VP9 and H.265 on 1 year old hardware below 200mW. So not even 1W. That would mean LLM inferencing is orders of magnitude more power hungry than video decoding. Either way: LLM power usage > Video Decode power usage, so the article trying to put them in the same boat is nonsense. reply liontwist 59 minutes agoparentprevLuckily we don‚Äôt have to do such a calculation.

Let's start with not incentivizing, then disincentivizing the mass production and importation of plastic garbage waste and e-waste that not only create greenhouse gas emissions but pollute the environment in other, irreversible ways.

Just incredibly stupid and inneficient. I know what you're thinking right now: fine-tuning, etc. That is the \"reusable\" analogy to that, is it not?

If you don't want to use ChatGPT because you're worried about creating more demand, that's more legit, but worry about the emissions associated with individual searches right now on their own is a silly distraction.

An LLM that is 50% better at diagnosing a common cold but missed sepsis 10% more often would not be an overall improvement. reply dragonwriter 11 hours agorootparentprevChatGPT is probably adequate to provide a slightly more user-friendly but also slight-less-reliable replacement for a reliable consumer-oriented medical reference book or website for the task of determining whether self-care without seeing a doctor or seeing a doctor is appropriate for symptoms not obviously posing an immediate emergency. reply ekianjo 13 hours agorootparentprevMost doctor visits are for benign matters... reply BobaFloutist 13 hours agorootparentThe point of the doctorate is for them to make that determination. reply gertlex 13 hours agorootparentMore constructively, the middle ground of asking a doctor about some minor symptoms over async messaging or tele-appointments (whatever the term for those is), is probably always something to consider for the trivial stuff. reply elevaet 13 hours agorootparentprevMy partner works in emergency.

Can it keep up the ruse?: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/sep/15/data-cent... reply pixelesque 13 hours agoprevSort of off-topic, but it does make one think about usage of compute (and the backing energy / resources required for that)... i.e. it doesn't seem too much of an exaggeration to say that we might be getting closer and closer to a situation where LLMs (or any other ML inference) is being run so much for so many different reasons / requests, that the usage does become significant in the future. Similarly, going into detail on what the compute is being used for: i.e. no doubt there are situations currently going on where Person A uses a LLM to expand something like \"make a long detailed report about our sales figures\", which produces a 20 page report and delivers it to Person B. Person B then says \"I haven't time to read all this, LLM please summarise it for me\". So you'd basically have LLM inference compute being used as a very inefficient method of data/request transfer, with the sender expanding a short amount of information to deliver to the recipient, and then the said recipient using an LLM on the other side to reduce it back again to something more manage-able. reply lioeters 13 hours agoparentThat sounds like the opposite of data compression (inflation?) where the data size is increased before sending, then on receiving it is compressed back to a smaller form. reply WD-42 12 hours agorootparentLossy data inflation. reply hexage1814 14 hours agoprevTo me the \"ChatGPT is destroying the environment \"card always felt somewhat like bad faith arguing from the anti-AI crowd trying to find any excuse for being against AI. Like, the same people who complained about \"using AI is destroying environment\" seemed to have no issue with boarding a plane which would emit a bunch of CO2 so that they can have a vacation in Europe or the like. Selective environmentalism. reply drawfloat 12 hours agoparentWho is this person you‚Äôre constructing? Being concerned about plane emissions and travel is an incredibly common thing and people are adjusting their lifestyles accordingly - lots of overnight sleeper train lines are reopening due to demand. reply minimaxir 13 hours agoparentprevIt's less bad faith, more a meme that has become so prevalent that it's impossible to dispell as it's something too nuanced for social media. I've seen more than a few social media posts asking \"do they really cut down a rainforest every time someone generates an AI image?\" reply noirbot 13 hours agoparentprevI mean, it's a literal net new expenditure of power and water. I also deeply doubt they have \"no issue\" with plane travel. You're just assuming the worst and most hypocritical position to someone, which seems deeply bad faith as well. It's literally true that most of the AI vendors and their data center partners are writing off energy and water conservation targets they'd had for the near future because of LLM money. That is actually bad in the short and likely long term, especially as people use LLMs for increasingly frivolous things. Is it really necessary to have an LLM essentially do a \"I'm Feeling Lucky\" Google Search for you at some multiple of that environmental cost? Because that's what most of my friends and coworkers use ChatGPT for. Very rarely are they using it to get anything more complex than just searching wikipedia or documentation you could have had bookmarked. A person has a choice of if they take a flight and if it's worth it for them. They have no power except for raising a complaint in public on if OpenAI or Google or whoever spends vast amounts of money and power to train some new model. If your bar is that no one is allowed to complain about a company burning energy unless they live a totally blameless life farming their own food without electricity then random companies will get to do any destructive act they want. reply croes 11 hours agoparentprevYou are talking about hypocrites. What about the people who take the protection of the environment seriously? They got now a setback because not only didn‚Äôt we reach our previous goals on lowering energy consumption but know we put new consumption on top of that. Just because the existing one ate worse doesn‚Äôt make it good. There is a reason why MS missed its CO2 targets and why everyone is kn search for more energy sources. They all create more CO2. reply blkhawk 14 hours agoprevwhat does \"water used by data center\" even mean? Does it consume the water somehow? What does it turn into? Steam? So uploading a 1GB file boils away nearly 1 liter of water? Or is it turned into bits somehow in some kind of mass to energy conversion? I sorta doubt that. Also this means data centers would have cooling towers like some power stations. Are we talking about the cooling towers of power stations? I think at least that graph is complete non-sense. I will try and have chatGPT explain it to me. reply dragonwriter 13 hours agoparent> what does \"water used by data center\" even mean? This doesn't clarify what exactly it includes, but there are two main things that generally are included: (1) Direct water use for cooling, (which, yes, ends up as steam rom cooling towers), and (2) Water used in generating electricity consumed by data centers, which, yeah, is again evaporated in cooling towers. reply quickthrowman 1 hour agoparentprev> what does \"water used by data center\" even mean? It‚Äôs referring to water lost to evaporation in evaporative cooling towers, both at the data center and at the power generating plant. reply stonogo 13 hours agoparentprevYes, datacenters have cooling towers. There are lots of good articles about this topic. A good starting point is \"water usage effectiveness\" (WUE) which is one way this is tracked. reply blkhawk 13 hours agorootparentThe one near here just has heat exchanges. But even if all the others use evaporators then potential water usage is extremely misleading because its not like the water is consumed - its just temporarily unavailable. Also why doesn't uploading a 1GB file to my NAS boil a liter of water? are maybe all the switches and routers used between me and the datacenter water-cooled? I mean I can see such switches existing but I don't see them be the norm. Why doesn't the DSLAM on the Street outside emit steam. Is there maybe one bad switch somewhere that just spews steam? What I am saying is that at least that graph is without further explanation... bad. reply dragonwriter 13 hours agorootparent> The one near here just has heat exchanges. But even if all the others use evaporators then potential water usage is extremely misleading because its not like the water is consumed Water consumption in all contexts is mostly fresh water returned from immediately usable form to either evaporation or the ocean. It is not \"extremely misleading\", because when it returns to immediately usable form by, e.g., precipitation, that's when new water is considered to be made available. The normal definitions are internally consistent and useful. reply blkhawk 13 hours agorootparentI did a bit of research and even water just \"involved\" in the process is counted as used in this context. For instance river water that is used for cooling and returned is counted. I think these sort of graphs are simply misleading and should not be used. reply Forbo 4 hours agorootparentIs that actually a common configuration? I could find very little on data centers being cooler by river water, and the few I found sounded like they were doing something novel. reply celticninja 1 hour agoprevThis used to be the stick they used to beat bitcoin with. I guess it's a good stick because you can hit any technology with it and you can conveniently forget all the terrible uses to which electricity is put. reply folken 11 hours agoprev\"personal carbon footprint\" is a term invented by BP and is the single hack that derailed the environment discussion by making people personally responsible and removing the actual polluters from the discussion. reply asmor 11 hours agoparentThe article could indeed be written by the same kind of people, given it glances over training cost as if AI companies aren't pushing datacenter power/gpu capacities to the limit to produce incrementally better models by brute force. It all falls apart as soon as you stop individualizing the numbers and add back in all of the supposedly non-recurring (but actually recurring because we can't stop ourselves from redoing it) cost. reply croes 11 hours agoprevThe use of ChatGPT doesn‚Äôt replace the others it comes on top of that.

So we should focus on optimizing transport, heating, energy and food. reply palata 10 hours agoprev> and it‚Äôs completely clear to me that one side is getting it entirely wrong and spreading misleading ideas What a great way to start an article. I get it as: \"I am not open to listening to your arguments, and in fact if you disagree with me, I will assume that you are a moron\". It reminds me of people saying \"planes are not the problem: actually if you compare it to driving a car, it uses less energy per person and per km\". Except that as soon as you take a passenger in your car, the car is better (why did you assume that the plane was full and the car almost empty?). And that you don't remotely drive as far with your car as you fly with a plane. Obviously planes are worse than cars. If you need to imagine people commuting by car to the other side of the continent to prove your point, maybe it's not valid? The fact is that the footprint of IT is increasing every year. And quite obviously, LLMs use more energy than \"traditional\" searches. Any new technology that makes us use more energy is bad for environment. Unless you don't understand how bad the situation is: we have largely missed the goal of keeping global warming to 1.5C (thinking that we could reach it is absurd at this point). To keep 2C, we need to reduce global emissions by 5% every year. That's a Covid crisis every year. Let's be honest, it probably won't happen. So we'll go higher than 2C, fine. At the other end of the spectrum, 4C means that a big stripe (where billions of people live) around the equator will become unlivable for human beings (similar to being on Mars: you need equipment just to survive outside). I guess I don't need to argue how bad that would be, and we are currently going there. ChatGPT is part of that effort, as a new technology that makes us increase our emissions instead of doing the opposite. reply ben_w 10 hours agoparentI take your general point, but: > Except that it doesn't work if you don't drive your car alone (if you assume the plane is full of passengers, why not assuming that the car is, as well?) These can be measured for averages. Lots of cars with one person in them, seldom cars fully packed; lots of planes fully packed, seldom (but it does happen) that the plane is almost empty. > we have largely missed the goal of keeping global warming to 1.5C (thinking that we could reach it is absurd at this point). Probably, yes; last year passed the threshold ‚Äî it would be a pleasant *surprise* if that turned out to have been a fluke 14* years early. * 14 because it would take 14 years for the exponential ‚Äî seen for the last 30 years ‚Äî for PV to replace all forms of power consumption; not just electricity, everything. But even then we'd also need to make rapid simultaneous progress with non-energy CO2 sources like cattle and concrete. > around the equator will become unlivable for human beings (similar to being on Mars: you need equipment just to survive outside) In so far as your bracket, sure; but there's a huge gap in what equipment you would need. The comparison I often make is that Mars combines the moisture of the Sahara, the warmth of the Antarctic, the air pressure of the peak of Mount Everest, and the soil quality of a superfund cleanup site, before then revealing that it's actually worse on all counts. reply palata 10 hours agorootparent> These can be measured for averages. Lots of cars with one person in them Sure, but the point should be that we should strive to share cars, not that it's okay to take the plane!
