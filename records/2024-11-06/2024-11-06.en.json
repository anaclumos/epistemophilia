Low inflation doesn't imply low prices. -Aggregate statistics don't necessarily explain individual outcomes. The Dems failed on this count massively, and have, for maybe the last 40 years, which is about the amount of time it took for my state to go from national bellwether (As goes Ohio, so goes the nation) to a reliably red state. This cost one of the most pro-union Senators (Sherrod Brown) his job. reply UncleOxidant 36 minutes agoparent> The Dems failed on this count massively What was their failure here? The failure to explain to the economically illiterate that while inflation is now about where it was prior to covid that prices won't be going down (unless there's some sort of major recession leading to deflation)? reply crazygringo 28 minutes agorootparentYup, there's nothing they could have done. That's the tragedy of it. You can't just educate people in a campaign that the President doesn't cause inflation, when it's the result of a global pandemic. They just don't listen and don't care. The different campaign messages get tested among focus groups. The ones that try to teach economics or explain inflation perform terribly. This isn't a failure of Democrats at all. This is just pure economic ignorance among voters. reply _DeadFred_ 11 minutes agorootparentYou will never win in a democracy if your stance is 'the voters failed me'. That the dems have chosen that mindset saddens me. It's not the voters job to come to a party, it's the party's obligation to figure out how to appeal to voters. The dems chose to tell people who are suffering that 'the economy is great, this is what we think a good economy looks like and we are patting ourselves on the back for it'. To voters that are suffering that seems like 'our version of good doesn't GAF about you'. Not a great message. You could have the best economics professors/communicators in the world explaining it, people still aren't voting for that. reply drawkward 21 minutes agorootparentprevTo paraphrase Rumsfeld: \"You go to elections with the populace you have.\" If the Dems don't/won't/can't account for it by changing their messaging, devising better or more readily understood platforms, then it is on them. You have to meet people where they are, not where you think they should be. reply dclowd9901 3 minutes agorootparentThere is no competing message to be had. The people believe that whoever is in charge is bad because their lives are terrible. They just ping pong between parties without caring to investigate policies. You can’t appeal to voters like this apart from not being the person in charge. reply crazygringo 14 minutes agorootparentprevBut the Dems did. They did everything you're asking for. Their messaging was totally different from 2020, everything was clear and understandable. That's what's so sad. The Democratic campaign was A+ in execution. The Republican campaign was a disaster in execution, but they won anyway. The message of this election isn't that Democrats did something wrong. It's that they did everything right, and a majority of voters simply still don't care. They don't think the insurrection mattered, and they think Trump will fix inflation because he's a strong businessman. And they don't listen to anyone who says otherwise. I don't see anything the Dems could have done about that. You can't force people to listen, you can't force people to understand economics. That's not something campaigns can do. reply drawkward 8 minutes agorootparent>The Democratic campaign was A+ in execution. Objectively untrue; Harris lost. >You can't force people to understand economics You're correct. So you have to reformat the message. The Dems failed to do this. I can tell you have never been a teacher: teachers are forever having to change their messaging because different people understand in different ways. reply _DeadFred_ 9 minutes agorootparentprevThe democrats told people who are suffering 'the economy is great, this is what great looks like to us'. How is that a winning message with people suffering? reply indigo0086 2 minutes agorootparentprev> The Democratic campaign was A+ in execution. She had 0 counties where she outperformed 2020 biden. si1entstill 9 minutes agorootparentprevIts hard to say what happened internally, but Biden could have stepped down in time for them to have a proper primary. reply nxm 16 minutes agorootparentprevCovid was coming to an end, and yet Democrats decided to still go on another trillion dollar spending spree, inevitably leading to inflation. It's incorrect to characterize this as \"pure economic ignorance among voters\" reply schmidtleonard 13 minutes agorootparentTrump printed $4T in a year, Biden printed $1.5T in 3 years. 80mph vs 10mph. The 80mph is what got us to inflation town. If someone looks at 80mph and 10mph and says \"I'll elect the 80mph guy because 10mph is irresponsible\" then yeah, I'm pretty comfortable characterizing that as pure economic ignorance. reply indigo0086 1 minute agorootparentGlad someone understands inflation. This is true and all we can hope is that someone close to him understands this. drawkward 29 minutes agorootparentprevYes! That is exactly their failure! As explained by the venerable poets, \"The Doobie Brothers\": >But what a fool believes, he sees >No wise man has the power to reason away >What seems to be >Is always better than nothing >Than nothing at all By failing to meet the economically illiterate at their level, the DNC campaign looked completely oblivious to those they were trying to help. reply liveoneggs 10 minutes agorootparentprevThey failed to articulate that they understood the frustration with high prices + low wages in a way that made people feel motivated enough to vote for them. reply _DeadFred_ 16 minutes agorootparentprevNot pro Trump here. The Dems failed to understand that telling people who are really struggling (my community is really struggling, it's sad to see people in the grocery store barely able to afford food, this is the reality, heck I'm struggling) that the economy is doing great isn't a winning message. They should have ran on 'we are working really hard on fixing things and this is what we have accomplished'. But a campaign telling people suffering that 'the economy is doing great' resonates 0% and just tells those struggling that the campaign doesn't see them/care that they are suffering. reply jaapbadlands 8 minutes agorootparentI never once heard Harris say 'the economy is doing great'. reply JumpCrisscross 34 minutes agorootparentprev> What was their failure here? One, that last round of stimulus. Two, not agreeing to cutting spending when prices continued going up. Three, not massively greenlighting permitting around new energy and fossil fuels to bring energy prices into a deflationary stance. (Note: this is Monday-morning QB’ing from me.) reply tunesmith 29 minutes agorootparentThat stimulus thing seemed like a double bind. Lower stimulus would have meant less inflation but worse unemployment, right? The whole pattern feels like a repeat of the country using Democrats to clean up messes (in this case, the mess was more Covid's than Republicans'), at which point they kick out the Democrats again. I don't think another massive tax cut (or extension of the last one) is a good idea. reply JumpCrisscross 24 minutes agorootparent> Lower stimulus would have meant less inflation but worse unemployment, right? Yes, but you can target where that unemployment goes. Democrats were probably too fair in distributing the pain. (As well as the fruits. Both the IRA and CHIPS Acts massively invested in counties that would have always voted Republican. That boosted turnout in an adversarial way.) reply UncleOxidant 24 minutes agorootparentprev> Lower stimulus would have meant less inflation but worse unemployment, right? Yes, this is likely what would have happened. And in that case the Dems would still lose because people would be upset about the high unemployment. reply schmidtleonard 33 minutes agorootparentprevAll tiny next to the money trump printed. reply JumpCrisscross 30 minutes agorootparentSure. But that’s the last guy. The question is what Democrats could have done in power. With the benefit of hindsight, it would have been massively over correcting on prices and the border. reply einrealist 20 minutes agorootparentprevIndeed, and now we can sit back and watch when those his voters realize, that Trump will not \"fix\" inflation either. In fact, if he executes on what he advertised during his campaign, it will get much worse. reply bni 16 minutes agorootparentThen they can just blame it on \"the deep state\", how convenient reply schmidtleonard 35 minutes agorootparentprevThey failed to hammer home that Trump printed the goddamn money. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2NS reply UncleOxidant 32 minutes agorootparentI'm not sure this would've helped. It require more than a 10 second attention span. Explaining inflation is a 120IQ problem whereas most campaigns are aiming at sub 100IQ communication. reply schmidtleonard 27 minutes agorootparentI'm sure that the idea was raised in Democratic campaign strategy meetings and likely rejected for exactly that reason, but I don't think the reasoning is correct. \"Trump printed the money\" isn't hard to understand. Hard to believe, perhaps, and I'm sure he would deny it, but it puts him on the defense and beats the hell out of a thundering silence that implicitly accepts his premise that Dems were responsible for inflation. reply meta_x_ai 31 minutes agorootparentprevExcept Trump's stimulus was needed because of the lockdown (and people were losing jobs). Biden stimulus was the one that a) Ignited demand > Supply b) provided no incentives for people to go back to work (Biden also had extended mortgage, rent, loan payment programs) which exacerbated inflation reply schmidtleonard 25 minutes agorootparent$4T in 1yr vs $1.5T in 3 years. Trump was printing at 80mph, Biden was printing at 10mph. Must have been a pretty fast 10mph. reply iinnPP 15 minutes agorootparentBut if Trump didn't print it then somehow Biden would've worked with 1.5T? reply cryptonector 59 minutes agoparentprevThe second derivative of prices hurts people hard when it is strongly positive because real wages lag real prices. reply NickM 34 minutes agorootparentEven when real wages keep up with real prices, people still hate inflation, because they attribute their rising wages to their own successes more than macroeconomic changes. To most people it feels like \"I'm working hard and getting big raises for it, only to be stymied by rising prices\" rather than \"this is all happening due to forces outside my control\". reply _heimdall 2 hours agoparentprev> Inflation is not prices; it is the rate of change in prices. Inflation is actually the increase in the money supply. The term is used wrong almost everywhere today. Price indexes like the CPI are what measure the change in prices of a set of goods. Inflation can influence prices since the supply of money changed, but they aren't directly linked. Edit: getting plenty of requests for a source here, especially because you will find countless sources online using the price increase definition. https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/economic-commentar... reply coryfklein 1 hour agorootparentThis is oddly reflective of the elitism that cost the DNC it's victory. \"Well actually, my poor man, a tomato is a fruit and every PhD economist knows that inflation is connected to fiscal policy's influence on the monetary supply\" The every day person uses the culinary definition of tomato, and inflation means that those tomatoes cost more at Walmart. reply _heimdall 1 hour agorootparentI would expect a botanist to know that a tomato is technically a berry, just like I would expect an economist to know that inflation is technically defined as an increase in the money supply. Everyday people can use whatever definition they want. That doesn't mean economists, the Fed, etc should say \"inflation\" when they mean \"price of goods\". reply FollowingTheDao 55 minutes agorootparentThe tomato price is too damn high! Get it yet? reply aydyn 34 minutes agorootparentThis exchange is like a microcosm of the educated elite trying to talk to ordinary people. reply drawkward 7 minutes agorootparentThis comment made my day. schmidtleonard 38 minutes agorootparentprevYeah, so instead they voted for the guy who printed the money. That'll show the DNC! reply _heimdall 36 minutes agorootparentBoth parties have been printing money since Clinton was in office. I don't really see debt or inflation as a problem of one party. reply tootie 36 minutes agorootparentprevIt's actually libertarian gibberish. reply adastra22 2 hours agorootparentprev> Inflation is actually the increase in the money supply. The term is used wrong almost everywhere today. The word has multiple meanings. That’s monetary inflation. The primary meaning in use today is price inflation. reply erulabs 1 hour agorootparent> Word X means Y, NOT Z Wittgenstien would like a word. Words always mean whatever the hell the speaker thinks they mean, which is always unverifiable. We should always endeavor to understand what people _think they mean_ instead of insisting on some (faulty) denotation. The inflation argument is always frustrating. In a vacuum, inflating the _supply of money_ would delate the _price of money_ which inflates the _prices of goods_. Most people say \"inflation\" to mean the price of goods, but it does no good to insist that one definition means you can't use the word in other ways! reply _heimdall 2 hours agorootparentprevnext [8 more] Its used in many ways, that doesn't redefine the word though. Inflation is a policy of increasing the money supply, nothing more and nothing less. Inflation is not price increases. If that is the definition then the metric is effectively useless. Prices can increase for any number of reasons, looking only at price changes doesn't tell us anything meaningful or actionable. reply adastra22 2 hours agorootparent“Inflation” doesn’t mean anything by itself. It is a shorthand for either price inflation or monetary inflation. Or inflating a balloon. Context is needed. reply _heimdall 1 hour agorootparent> “Inflation” doesn’t mean anything by itself. It absolutely does when the correct definition is still used. Inflation is an increase in money supply, that's really all there is to it. Your point is why the use of \"inflation\" to mean price increases is so meaningless. Prices change for any number of reasons and you need context. When \"inflation\" still means in increase in the money supply there is no context required to know what it means, though obviously that's not all the information you need to understand the economy. reply interestica 1 hour agorootparentWhat's \"shrinkflation\"? reply jjk166 1 hour agorootparentprev> Its used in many ways, that doesn't redefine the word though. That's exactly how words get redefined. reply monktastic1 2 hours agorootparentprevIt's not just \"used in many ways,\" it has several definitions. The one that almost everybody uses -- including the Fed[0], US Dept of Labor[1], and the ECB[2] -- is about rise in prices. Nobody is saying that your definition is bad or wrong, but to claim that it's the only (or even primary) one is disingenuous. [0] https://www.clevelandfed.org/center-for-inflation-research/i... [1] https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/statistics/inflation [2] https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb-and-you/explainers/tell-me-mor... reply _heimdall 1 hour agorootparentSure, though it makes sense that most economists use the price inflation term. The change in how \"inflation\" was being used largely goes back to Keynes and Modern Monetary Theory. Most economists today fall into that bucket, of course they use the term in the same way. That doesn't change the fact that the attempt to redefine it both co-opted the word and made it functionally useless. Prices change for all kinds of reasons. The amount of change alone is meaningless and using that meaning of the word allows economists today to play a lot of shell games with the numbers. reply JumpCrisscross 13 minutes agorootparent> change in how \"inflation\" was being used largely goes back to Keynes and Modern Monetary Theory This is totally false. It dates to the inter-War period, specifically, to describe Weimar hyperinflation. (If you just look at money supply, it was bad. If you look at prices it was the disaster that it was.) reply barrkel 5 minutes agorootparentprevInflation is increase in the cost of living. You've linked to a privately written article (\"The views authors express in Economic Commentary are theirs and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland \") by someone who worked for the Cleveland Fed, who blames printing currency for inflation. No doubt that debasement of the currency increases the nominal prices of things. But it's hard to square the idea that that's all there is to inflation when you consider that lots of countries had inflation after COVID. They didn't all coordinate on printing currency. reply JumpCrisscross 32 minutes agorootparentprev> Inflation is actually the in the money supply No, that is expansion of the monetary base. Inflation is an increase in price levels. If a country’s money supply contracts while prices rise that’s inflation. The problem with the metallic definition is a country that loses half its territory and most of its reserves after losing a 19th-century war, thereby setting off double-digit price increases across its economy, doesn’t “inflate” from a monetary base perspective. Once we understood these concepts were separate, we segregated the terms. Insisting inflation refers exclusively to monetary-base expansion is phlogiston-theory stuff. reply wasabi991011 2 hours agorootparentprev> Inflation is actually the increase in the money supply. The term is used wrong almost everywhere today. I'm sorry I just can't find a single source backing you up. All sources I find define inflation as increase in prices. reply AdhemarVandamme 1 hour agorootparent> I'm sorry I just can’t find a single source backing you up. As adastra22 points out: some authors define the term inflation primarily as the increase in the money supply (“monetary inflation”), others primarily as an increase in (consumer good) prices (“price inflation”). At least in modern economic literature and usage, the term “inflation” (without modifier) is more often used to denote price inflation rather than monetary inflation. The insistence that the term “inflation” ought be primarily rather used for “monetary inflation” goes back to at least Ludwig von Mises, The Theory of Money and Credit, 1912: “In theoretical investigation there is only one meaning that can rationally be attached to the expression inflation: an increase in the quantity of money (in the broader sense of the term, so as to include fiduciary media as well), that is not offset by a corresponding increase in the need for money (again in the broader sense of the term), so that a fall in the objective exchange-value of money must occur.” reply wasabi991011 20 minutes agorootparentThank you reply _heimdall 2 hours agorootparentprevhttps://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/economic-commentar... Here's a good one I just found as so many here were asking for sources. reply idunnoman1222 29 minutes agorootparent“Inflation” is measured based on the prices of a predefined list of goods. reply rodiger 1 hour agorootparentprevThis doesn't support your assertion- in fact it does the opposite. The definition(s) of inflation has changed over time. That does not make the current definition(s) less correct reply _heimdall 28 minutes agorootparentWell I did try to caveat it that its one of the few sources I could even find that reference the fact that the definition was changed. My argument isn't with the fact that \"inflation\" is in fact being used to mean \"price increase of goods.\" My issue is that economists co-opted the word at all and made it functionally useless, especially in isolation as it is often mentioned with no other context of why prices changed. The use of \"inflation\" to mean money supply increase goes all the way back to the roman empire. reply echoangle 2 hours agorootparentprev> Inflation is actually the increase in the money supply. The term is used wrong almost everywhere today. Do you have a source that this is the „correct“ definition? Wikipedia for example uses the definition you think is wrong, and specifically says that CPI measures inflation. reply _heimdall 2 hours agorootparentYou can see glimmers of the original definition on the wikipedia page, but the term has been misused for decades noe and basically anything you try to find for a definition of inflation will talk only about prices. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation I can't get deep links in wikipedia on my mobile browser for some reason, but here's the full page. The \"Terminology\" section vaguely references the original Latin word and gives a few nods to when currency was tied to gold. It is a bit hand wavy, though when it talks about new gold supplies being found or later mentions when the cost of money changes, those are both related to the original (correct) definition. Finding more gold increased the money supply, which may change prices though it doesn't have to. Toman history sometimes covers the idea well as they inflated the currency by minting more coins to increase supply. I can't find a great link at the moment that covers it well from that angle though, I'll try to come back here when I'm at my desk if I find a good link down that rabbit hole. reply try_the_bass 7 minutes agorootparentIf a word has been \"misused for decades\", its definition has changed. It's a fool's errand to try to claim the original definition is the \"right\" or \"only\" definition at that point. You've lost this semantic battle against the world, and it's honestly pretty exhausting to see you wasting effort trying to continue fighting a lost cause. reply drawkward 57 minutes agorootparentprev>the term has been misused for decades now Am I out of touch? No it is all of modern economists who are wrong.jpg reply _heimdall 25 minutes agorootparentWait, is your argument that modern economists couldn't possible be wrong? Or in this case, that modern economists couldn't possibly have co-opted the term to better work with Keynesian economics and MMT? If physicists decide to reuse the word \"meter\" for a unit of measuring volume does that mean anyone that uses it as a measure of distance is wrong? Wouldn't it make more sense to create a new term for the new need, a term that doesn't collide with centuries of use? reply drawkward 14 minutes agorootparent>If physicists decide to reuse the word \"meter\" for a unit of measuring volume does that mean anyone that uses it as a measure of distance is wrong? Wouldn't it make more sense to create a new term for the new need, a term that doesn't collide with centuries of use? Perfect question! In fact, the definition of \"meter\" has changed over time, and if you stick with the old definition, you'd be off by 0.2 millimeters: https://www.nist.gov/si-redefinition/meter Science changes as it needs to. (And the word \"science\" is doing a lot of heavy lifting here when we are discussing economics, aka the dismal science.) reply braincat31415 1 hour agorootparentprevThere are many faces of inflation. The \"money supply\" you are talking about was not the primary driver in the last few years and there was robust demand for the treasury issuance. You will see the money supply inflation pick up when treasury auctions start to fail. I believe this will happen down the road but not soon. Most of the inflation was driven by other factors: low-income labor shortage, and a supply side shortage that fueled an increase of prices for commodities and anything else up the chain. reply _heimdall 1 hour agorootparent> The \"money supply\" you are talking about was not the primary driver in the last few years and there was robust demand for the treasury issuance. Unless I'm mistaken, I don't believe we can be sure of that. The economy is extremely complex, ferreting out the impact of any one intervention is nearly impossible. On the surface it seems very unlikely to me that printing trillions in new money and giving it to banks, businesses, and directly to every citizen had no impact on prices. The supply of money increased dramatically and the cost of money (interest rates) was also extremely low. Beyond my hunch though, I haven't found any data that has clearly isolated the inflation out of the equation to be able to show that the price increases weren't driven by the new money at all. reply asdasdsddd 2 hours agorootparentprevThe increase in money supply means nothing if goods and services are produced in larger quantities. reply RpmReviver 1 hour agorootparentI'm not sure I understand this thought, it's possible producing larger quantities would actually increase the velocity of money which would increase money supply reply _heimdall 1 hour agorootparentVelocity of money itself is a funny term in modern economics. Modern monetary theory, or at least the economists that follow it, argue that the velocity of money doesn't mean anything and they basically ignore it. Arguably, with a fiat currency where they can freely manipulate the money supply, they aren't wrong. That's a problem of fist in my opinion though, there are too many moving pieces and the data can be too easily manipulated to say whatever you want it to say. reply FrustratedMonky 6 minutes agorootparentprev\"Inflation is actually the increase in the money supply.\" NO. It is the cost of the goods. What people will pay. Inflation Contributors: 30% money supply 30% was corporations raised prices specifically under cover of people blaming the government. This was actually listed on earnings calls, for profit. 30% supply chain shortages. reply drawkward 2 hours agorootparentprevI am sorry, but you are wrong, since about the 1960s.

The common use of the term to mean a change in prices is a useless definition. Its extremely common to hear \"inflation\" used to describe price changes, but the number is then used in isolation. Prices change for countless reasons and without detailed context related to supply/demand, strength of the dollar, etc you have NP idea why prices changed. Maybe we printed trillions and prices went up because the supply of money went up Maybe prices increased because demand is outpacing supply. The response to those situations and economic sentiment should be wildly different, but the inflation number may be exactly the same. reply drawkward 53 minutes agorootparentIt's pretty cheeky, random internet guy, to tell multiple central banks--whose function can be placed squarely in the realm of economics--that they are wrong about what inflation is. reply lazyeye 21 minutes agorootparentThis Hacker News, people on here think they have a much better understanding than the experts about everything.

Heres a good source I just found as so many were looking for sources here. I believe it was around the 1960s or 1970s when most economists started using \"inflation\" to mean price increases. The history there is pretty fascinating, it was basically a reaction by modern monetary theorists who really had to redefine it for their economic system to make sense. A core goal in MMT is to have a fiat currency and controls in place to let you manipulate the money supply quickly in an attempt to move the economy in one direction or another. With the original definition, inflation is actually the tool used by MMT rather than an indicator of economic health. reply consteval 3 hours agoparentprevTrump's economic plans are extremely inflationary, and even a freshman economics student can point that out. It's just that nobody really cares, they just like Trump and will fill in the gaps to justify it. You can't put extreme tariffs like 200% and expect prices to come down. The reality is post-covid was an inflationary period because of hyper consumerism. Demand shot up, extremely quickly, and supply was still lagging due to covid. There was really nothing anyone could do. It's unfortunate, but voters don't consider these things. They just see the prices, see a blue president, and go from there. reply _heimdall 2 hours agorootparentI don't think hyper consumerism goes deeply enough to answer the question of why we saw prices change so rapidly. We printed trillions of dollars and flooded the economy with new money. We had extremely low interest rates, again creating more new money in the system. We stopped student debt payments, meaning people had more money in their pockets to spend. We also stopped evictions, though you would really have to be a special kind of asshole to skip paying rent so you can buy more random consumer goods. Its worth noting that printing new money was the actual inflation, inflation is a measure of the increase in the money supply itself. Prices did go up, or you could say the dollar lost value, but price changes aren't actually inflation (prices are tracked by indexes). reply intended 53 minutes agorootparentPrice rises are tied to higher energy costs, that are linked to the war in Ukraine. reply _heimdall 37 minutes agorootparentEnergy touches basically every corner of the economy. It seems like it'd be difficult to narrow down price increases to just one cause, especially a base resource. It looks like US electricity costs are up around 10% since 2022. How do you peel that apart to know electricity prices changed first, and that that is what caused all other prices to go up? reply doctorpangloss 28 minutes agorootparentprev> You can't put extreme tariffs like 200% and expect prices to come down. I used to believe this, but the truth is we haven't been able to import food, energy or homes from China for a while. That leaves autos, and it's very hard to predict how auto tariffs would affect inflation, since people have always purchased more expensive cars over cheaper ones, for a variety of reasons. Meanwhile for stuff you and I care about like computers, well most of what you are paying for is software, which is all made here. Services like health care and education are insensitive to tariffs, and since grocery stores have to provide health care to some employees all the same, it affects prices for goods. Home prices rising is supported by both parties, and besides inflation the government basically guarantees market returns but risk free in owner-occupied real estate in this country. I wish what you were saying were true - that bringing tariffs down to zero would eliminate inflation - but if it were that simple it would have been done already. reply sangnoir 30 minutes agorootparentprev> The reality is post-covid was an inflationary period because of hyper consumerism That was just an outgrowth of high monetary supply during COVID to shore up the numbers and prevent economic collapse due to a steep and sudden drop of economic activity.

I don't mean that as an insult to 1/3 of the country. Trump wins because he messages in a way that EVERY person can understand.

Past that propaganda piece, nobody cares. reply drawkward 35 minutes agorootparentAs I tried to imply in my original post: Harris' talk about low inflation or fighting inflation loses on a technicality, which is that people tend to experience inflation as the current price not the rate of change in the current price. Thus, when Harris is talking about inflation fighting and inflation cooling down, you have a bunch of people who look at the price of eggs/pizza/houses and say, \"this shit is still expensive, Dems are full of shit.\" They are not looking at the CPI, and calculating the year-over-year change. Let me share an anecdote: I worked on a project to estimate household-level price sensitivities to the market basket of goods commonly used in CPI calculations. (My employer had shopper-card/upc/transaction-level data from tons of major grocery chains across the USA with which to attempt this project.) I tried to read through the docs on how CPI is calculated, and let me tell you: major snoozefest, and I consider myself \"a numbers guy.\" I doubt the run-of-the-mill American can accurately define inflation.

Charisma was a part of it sure, but ultimately people can look past that. Bush Sr. had zero charisma. The bigger part, amongst other things, Harris is part of the current administration, people are not happy about how things are going, or how much their groceries cost. People are not happy to get censored or called nazi's for having different opinions. When asked on a left-leaning show \"The View\" with people all on her side, what she would change about the last 4 years, she answered, \"there is not a thing that comes to mind\". Charisma didn't kill her, not being able to ask layup questions killed her. The American people are not as dumb as the Harris voters are now screaming about on Reddit/TikTok/X, the American people want to know what their president is going to do to change their lives.

Consider a planar model with two dimensions: social and economic policy. Trump combined conservative social policy with populist economic policy. Harris promoted liberal social policy. However, in her last town hall, framed herself as a \"pragmatic capitalist\" (her emphasis). This is a continuation of Democratic rightward shift, the Neoliberal compromise, that was crystallized by Clinton with NAFTA in the 90s. In this election, like 2000, the US public had to choose: a liberal social policy -or- a populist economic policy.

We should be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. Trans issues should not be difficult to 'pontificate' on. There is gender affirming health care for trans individuals, Democrats broadly support those individuals having access to that care. Democrats are also the party that is aggressive on healthcare and supporting government programs for reducing healthcare costs. In all seriousness, do trans issues actually impact your day to day in any way? Trans people seem to live rent free in people's minds and I only ever hear about it in a political scenario. It seems like the most manufactured issue aside from immigration in recent memory. reply astroid 38 minutes agorootparentI think a lot of people are probably not exactly thrilled about the 'extra' provisions for \"first generation home buyers\" (meaning the parents didn't own one). In the current political climate, with the current border policy, that sounds an awful lot like a two-tier entitlements system where the more significant help will go to 'illegal immigrants', 'asylum seekers' etc. https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/harris-propose-25k-payment-s... Also $25,000 really doesn't mean much when the entire housing market is set to double or even triple when you look at the last 5 years and project into the future. If your mortgage is still going to be $2,500 for a run-down house that would have cost $40,000 25-30 years ago but it's more like $400,000 and rising now... it's not exactly the 'lift' I think most people want. Honestly as someone who has been scrimping and saving to try to buy a home for the last 6 years, I would be somewhat annoyed if suddenly every broke first generation person is thrust to first in line for the limited housing supply we have, driving prices up further. The fact that it is specifically structured to exclude people with roots here is kind of a slap in the face -- there is no reason it shouldn't just be tied to income, so suddenly it is needlessly political. My point isn't really to argue the merits of either approach though - just wanted to give you some insight into why as a 'first time' but not 'first generation' potential home buyer I find her plan to be a short-sighted attempt at grabbing votes. Not that it matters now - clearly there is a mandate to swing the opposite direction we have been going. I'll also add this though: Under the last Trump presidency, I made literally 50% less than I do now (thankfully got a solid 50% bump right before covid happened) and I had MUCH more disposable income. It's crazy that I am longing for the days and economy where I made $60k and could go out AND save money regularly. Now I have to plan any extra expenses, I have moved back in with family to be able to save, and even without the $1,800 rent payment I am still behind where I was in the last Trump economy. I can't be the only one. reply rwyinuse 13 minutes agorootparentYea, inflation sucks. But it's not like Trump can fix the fact way too much money was printed during COVID crisis.

How do you have less disposable income with 50% more money? reply DebtDeflation 42 minutes agorootparentprevNot sure why you're being downvoted, as this is spot on. The Democratic part has completely lost touch with the working class. Harris struggled to articulate any sort of economic policy other than \"we're going to ban price gouging, give money to people to start businesses, and help people make down payments on houses\" with no details. Meanwhile, they latched onto some of the most fringe culture war issues like making sure that trans men can compete in women's sports. I voted for her because another Trump presidency is literally an existential threat to the country, but I saw this coming from a mile away. reply rwyinuse 20 minutes agorootparentprevI agree. It actually looks quite similar to the situation here in EU, with traditional leftist parties losing popularity to right-wing populists. Leftist parties should focus first and foremost on protecting worker's rights, anything else should come second. Supporting open migration policy in particular is problematic, as it drives down wages to the very workers who might want to vote leftist parties. People who are struggling financially also don't particularly enjoy hearing how they are privileged because of their gender/skin color or whatever. The left should simply recognize that distribution of wealth and means of production is the number one factor affecting equality.

The DNC also was required to consult with the campaign about all other staffing, budgeting, data, analytics, and mailings.” “The funding arrangement with HFA and the victory fund agreement was not illegal, but it sure looked unethical,” Brazile notes. “This was not a criminal act, but as I saw it, it compromised the party’s integrity.” reply leereeves 1 hour agorootparentprev_fs didn't say she wasn't a big name, only that \"no big names ran against her.\" reply SoftTalker 1 hour agorootparentprevBut she was very divisive on the R side.

Here we have someone sharing a real world example of out of control inflation, which is true across all groceries no one grounded in reality would deny that. Rather than acknowledge these concerns in anyway, you took time out of your day to imply because they used 1 unhealthy example this runaway inflation is actually a good thing because they will be forced to eat 'healthier'. Completely ignoring how expensive those 'healthy' items are as well (and that they continue to rise). Then you use your anecdotal experience to further your dismission with 'well, ackkkstually ime prices don't go down so your concerns are invalid.'

Say you've got a directory that has scripts or data files related to some thing you do. For example I've got several scripts that I use when I scan books with my book scanner. I only need these when doing book scanning stuff so don't want to put them somewhere in $PATH. I want to be able to easily run them from scripts that aren't in that directory, but I don't want to hard code the path to that directory. Solution: in the directory with the book scanning scripts I make a file named ID that contains a unique string. I currently use 16 byte random hex strings [1]. I have this script, named find-dir-by-ID, somewhere in $PATH: #!/bin/zsh ID=${1:?Must specific ID} IDSHA=`echo $IDshasumcut -d ' ' -f 1` mdfind $ID 2>/dev/nullgrep /IDwhile read F; do FSHA=`shasum $Fcut -d ' ' -f 1` if [ $IDSHA = $FSHA ]; then dirname $F exit 0 fi done exit 1 If some script wants to use scripts from my book scanning script directory, it can do this: SCRIPT_DIR=`find-dir-by-ID 54f757919a5ede5961291bec27b15827` if [ ! -d $SCRIPT_DIR ]; then >&2 echo Cannot find book scanning scripts exit 1 fi and then SCRIPT_DIR has the full path to the scanning script directory. The IDs do not have to be hex strings. If I'd thought about it more I probably would have made IDs look like this \"book-scanning:54f757919a5ede59\" or \"arduino-tools:3b6b4f47bf803663\".

    "originBody": "PC Components CPUs For the first time ever, AMD outsells Intel in the datacenter space News By Anton Shilov published yesterday But both fall far behind sales of Nvidia's AI GPUs. Comments (19) When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. (Image credit: AMD) For well more than two decades, Intel has been the undisputed leader in the market for datacenter CPUs. Intel's Xeon processors powered the vast majority of servers, whereas AMD's processors commanded a single-digit market share just some seven or eight years ago. However, the situation has changed drastically. While Intel's Xeon CPUs still power the majority of servers, the most expensive machines now use AMD's EPYC processors. This is why AMD's datacenter business unit now outsells Intel's datacenter and AI business group, as observed by SemiAnalysis. Indeed, AMD's datacenter segment revenue reached $3.549 billion in the third quarter, whereas Intel's datacenter and AI group's earnings were $3.3 billion in Q3 2024. Just two years ago, Intel's DCAI group earned $5 billion - $6 billion per quarter. But as AMD's EPYC processors have gained competitive advantages over Intel's Xeon CPUs, Intel has had to sell its server chips at significant discounts, which has reduced the company's revenue and profit margins. It is noteworthy that Intel's flagship 128-core Xeon 6980P 'Granite Rapids' processor costs $17,800, making it the company's most expensive standard CPU ever. By contrast, AMD's most expensive 96-core EPYC 6979P processor costs $11,805. If demand for Intel's Xeon 6900-series processors remains high and the company can supply these CPUs in decent volumes, then Intel's datacenter revenue will likely get back on track and surpass AMD's datacenter sales. However, Intel still has to ramp up production of its Granite Rapids products. While both Intel and AMD now earn around $3-3.5 billion per quarter selling datacenter CPUs, Nvidia earns much more from its datacenter GPUs and networking chips, which are required to make AI processors work in concert in datacenters. In fact, sales of Nvidia's networking products totaled $3.668 billion in the company's second quarter of fiscal 2025. Meanwhile, compute GPU sales reached $22.604 billion in Q2 FY2025, which far surpasses the combined sales of Intel and AMD datacenter hardware. Altogether, Nvidia sold nearly $42 billion worth of AI and HPC GPUs in the first half of this year, and it is likely that the company will sell even more datacenter processors in the second half.

Reply jeremyj_83 \"By contrast, AMD's most expensive 96-core EPYC 6979P processor costs $11,805.\" The 6979P is an Intel part. For the Epyc 9654 (Zen 4) cost that much on launch in 2022/23, however, that isn't the top SKU anymore with Zen 5 Epycs now out. Reply ottonis I am glad that all the great work at AMD is now paying for itself and generating as much or more revenue in the datacenter market as Intel does with its history of morally doubtful business practices. Of course, as the article mentions, not all is roses, though, as nVidia is clearly showing where the really big revenues are coming from: the (AI)-compute GPU market. To my knowledge, AMD does have decent AI-GPU accelerator cards that may or may not (I think the latter is true) outperform nVidias latest and greatest but that still will find many pockets willing to pay for them as nVidia is either too expensive or just cannot entirely deliver the huge numbers of cards the AI-market demands. Now, AMD only needs to actively and massively support developers with impeccable documentation, technical support, and easy to use developer tools for their AI-compute GPUs. Then, and only then, it may sorten the gap to nVidia.

Servethehome did a review of the newest Zen 5 CPUs when they were released. The 128c Zen 5 was overall faster than the 128c Xeon. The 192c Zen 5c was even better and they found out that PCIe 4 SSD and 100GbE wasn't fast enough to keep these (192c) CPUs fed with data. When they went with PCIe 5 SSD and dual port 200GbE, performance increased by up to 15% (IIRC). Reply Pierce2623 prtskg said: Since data is for both datacentre gpu and cpus, it'll still take some time for AMD to reach 50% share in datacentre cpus. Pretty sure instinct is still in Radeon and Ponte Vecchio is still in XCG. Neither one is counted in their respective Data Center group because companies always try to keep strongly performing and poor performing units separate. That way they can say “look how great Data Center is doing and our only poor performance is in graphics…blah blah blah”. Reply YSCCC If true, intel is having serious trouble of not only losing market in the DIY market where fans always say it's unimportant, if the brand image get damaged so badly it will be difficult to gain back momentum, just like Nokia in the phone world Reply FrostByteVA While Intel's Xeon CPUs still power the majority of servers, the most expensive machines now use AMD's EPYC processors. The title of the article is AMD Outsells Intel in the datacenter space. The article says that \"Intel still powers the majority of servers\" but that \"the most expensive machines now use AMD\". So what specific space is AMD outselling Intel? GPU enabled servers but not standard servers? Don't get me wrong, we have AMD Gen3 and Gen4 and are looking at 5 for the next order. However, the article does not state in what space AMD is outselling Intel. Reply TTech002 I don't understand how you could write an article about servers, and not mention the, Epic 5 9755 128 Cores, and the Epic 5c 9965 192 Cores.

When the Intel 80386-33 came out we thought it was the pinnacle of CPUs, running our Novell servers! We now had a justification to switch from arcnet to token ring. Our servers could push things way faster! Then, in the middle 1991, the AMD 80386-40 CPU came out. Mind completely blown! We ordered some (I think) Twinhead motherboards. They were so fast we could only use Hercules mono cards in them; all other video cards were fried. 16Mb token ring was out, so some of my clients moved to it with the fantastic CPU. I have seen some closet-servers running Novell NetWare 3.14 (?) with that AMD CPU in the late '90s. There was a QUIC tape & tape drive in the machine that was never changed for maybe a decade? The machine never went down (or properly backed up). reply taspeotis 19 hours agoparentSome AMD 80386DX-40 drama: > While the AM386 CPU was essentially ready to be released prior to 1991, Intel kept it tied up in court.[2] Intel learned of the Am386 when both companies hired employees with the same name who coincidentally stayed at the same hotel, which accidentally forwarded a package for AMD to Intel's employee.[3] reply justinclift 18 hours agorootparentWonder if the hotel had a liability problem from that? After all, it sounds like they directly caused a \"billion dollar\" type of problem for AMD through their mistake. reply firecall 18 hours agorootparentprevFar out LOL That's amazing! reply gerdesj 17 hours agoparentprevNW 3.12 was the final version I think. I recall patching a couple for W2K. NetWare would crash a lot (abend) until you'd fixed all the issues and then it would run forever, unless it didn't. I once had a bloke writing a patch for eDirectory in real time in his basement whilst running our data on his home lab gear, on a weekend. I'm in the UK and he was in Utah. He'd upload an effort and I'd ftp it down, put it in place, reboot the cluster and test. Two iterations and job done. That was quite impressive support for a customer with roughly 5,000 users. For me the CPU wasn't that important, per se. NWFS ate RAM: when the volumes were mounted, the system generated all sorts of funky caches which meant that you could apply and use trustee assignments (ACLs) really fast. The RAID controller and the discs were the important thing for file serving and ideally you had wires, switches and NICs to dole the data out at a reasonable rate. reply gkanai 19 hours agoparentprevToken ring networks! So glad we moved on from that. reply addaon 15 hours agorootparent> So glad we moved on from that. Don't look too closely at the collision avoidance mechanism in 10base-T1S, standardized in 2020. Sure looks like a virtual token ring passing mechanism if you squint... reply crest 18 hours agorootparentprevQuick! Everyone! Someone dropped the token. Get up and look behind your desks. reply intothemild 19 hours agoparentprevI remember that 386-40. That was a great time. reply fijiaarone 16 hours agoparentprevIn 1996 we set up a rack (department store surplus) of Cyrix 586 (running on 486 socket C motherboards) running at 75mhz with 16mb of RAM and could serve 100 concurrent users with CGI scripts and image maps doing web serving and VOIP with over 1 million requests a month on a single T1 line. Good luck doing that on a load balanced rack of 96 core AMD servers today. reply einsteinx2 7 hours agorootparentAre you seriously arguing that a rack of modern servers can’t handle 100 concurrent users? reply simfree 12 hours agorootparentprevPeak requests per second (and whether a SIP invite or CGI script being run) would be very useful to know. SIP hasn't gotten much heavier, nor CGI scripts, and tiny distros like OpenWRT can do a lot with little iron. Heard lots of rough ADSL era VoIP stories, hopefully you weren't struggling with that back then. reply gautamcgoel 22 hours agoprevDamn, first Intel missed out on Mobile, then it fumbled AI, and now it's being seriously challenged on its home turf. Pat has his work cut out for him. reply kevin_thibedeau 21 hours agoparentThey didn't miss out. They owned the most desirable mobile platform in StrongARM and cast it aside. They are the footgun masters. reply hajile 21 hours agorootparentThey killed StrongARM because they believed the x86 Atom design could compete. Turns out that it couldn't and most of the phones with it weren't that great. Intel should be focused on an x86+RISC-V hybrid chip design where they can control an upcoming ecosystem while also offering a migration path for businesses that will pay the bills for decades to come. reply kimixa 20 hours agorootparentI'd argue that the Atom core itself could compete - it hit pretty much the same perf/watt targets as it's performance-competitive ARM equivalents. But having worked with Intel on some of those SoCs, it's everything else that fell down. They were late, they were the \"disfavored\" teams by execs, they were the engineer's last priority, they had stupid hw bugs they refused to fix and respin, they were everything you could do to set up a project to fail. reply RussianCow 19 hours agorootparent> They were late This was the main thing, as by that point, all native code was being compiled to Arm and not x86. Using x86 meant that some apps, libraries, etc just didn't work. reply mkl 19 hours agorootparentIntel and Google developed libhoudini to do binary translation of the native code to solve that problem. https://github.com/SGNight/Arm-NativeBridge, https://www.anandtech.com/show/5770/lava-xolo-x900-review-th..., http://blog.apedroid.com/2013/05/binary-translation-vs-nativ... reply hajile 18 hours agorootparentprevMedfield was faster than A9 and Qualcomm Krait in performance, but not so much in power (see Motorola Razr i vs M where the dual-core ARM version got basically the same battery life as the single-core x86 version). Shortly after though, ARM launched A15 and the game was over. A15 was faster per clock while using less power too. Intel's future Atom generations never even came close after that. reply raverbashing 13 hours agorootparentprevMaybe the Atom core itself was performant, but I doubt they could take all the x86 crap around it to make it slim enough for a phone reply kimixa 12 hours agorootparentThey were SoCs, fundamentally the same as any ARM-based phone SoC - some atom SoCs even had integrated modems. The BoM was pretty identical to other devices. reply ksec 6 hours agorootparentExactly. Most people still dont get it. What killed Atom on Phone wasn't x86. It was partly software and mostly hardware and cost. It simply wasn't cost competitive, especially when Intel were used to high margin business. reply deelowe 11 hours agorootparentprevThey killed strongarm because of nepotism. That's been the issue at Intel for decades. They are the epitome of ego over merit and x86 was king. reply DanielHB 8 hours agorootparentNepotism? Like execs from different divisions fighting each other? To me it seems they just want to keep their lock-in monopoly because they own x86. Very rational albeit stupid, but of course the people who took those decisions are long gone from the company, many are probably retired with their short-term focused bonuses. reply arcanemachiner 14 hours agorootparentprev> Intel should be focused on an x86+RISC-V hybrid chip design where they can control an upcoming ecosystem while also offering a migration path for businesses that will pay the bills for decades to come. First I've heard of this. Is this actually a possibility? reply mshockwave 12 hours agorootparentRP2350 is using a hybrid of ARM and RISCV already. Also it's not really hard to use RISCV not as the main computing core but as a controller in the SoC. Because the area of RISCV cores are so small it's pretty common to put a dozen (16 to be specific) into a chip. reply Keyframe 20 hours agorootparentprevMaybe I'm just spitting out random BS, but if I understood Keller correctly when he spoke about Zen that (for it) it's not really a problem to change frontend ISA as large chunk of work is on the backend anyways. If that's the case in general with modern processors, would be cool to see a hybrid that can be switched from x86_64 to RISC-V and, to add even more avangarde to it, associate a core or few of FPGA on the same die. Intel, get on it! reply vel0city 20 hours agorootparentThere were consumer devices with a processor designed to be flexible on its instruction set presented to the user. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmeta_Crusoe https://youtu.be/xtuKqd-LWog?t=332 reply Keyframe 20 hours agorootparentaka the company where Linus worked! reply nineteen999 17 hours agorootparentthat also kinda failed to reach their goals unfortunately. reply dwattttt 19 hours agorootparentprevIf you think about it, that's what Thumb mode on ARM is. reply kevin_thibedeau 13 hours agorootparentPlus the original Jazelle mode. reply neerajsi 12 hours agorootparentprevFrom what I gather the one time I got to speak with chip engineers is that real estate is still at a premium. Not necessarily the total size of the chip, but certain things need to be packed close together to meet the timing requirements. I think that means that you'd be paying a serious penalty to have two parallel sets of decoders for different ISAs. reply mshockwave 12 hours agorootparentprevReminds me that's also many people's speculation on how Qualcomm builds their RISCV chips -- swap an ARM decoder for a RISCV one. reply mschuster91 16 hours agorootparentprev> and, to add even more avangarde to it, associate a core or few of FPGA on the same die The use cases for FPGAs in consumer devices are ... close to zero unless you're talking about implementing copy protection since reverse engineering FPGA bitstreams is pretty much impossible if you're not the NSA, MI6 or Mossad with infinite brains to throw at the problem (and more likely than not, insider knowledge from the vendors). reply formerly_proven 20 hours agorootparentprev\"not really a problem to change\" in the context and scope of a multi-billion dollar project employing thousands of people full time. reply raverbashing 13 hours agorootparentprevSounds like Intel has a big boomer problem reply ThrowawayB7 18 hours agorootparentprevThey had a second attempt with x86 smartphone chips and bungled that too: https://www.pcworld.com/article/414673/intel-is-on-the-verge... reply chx 14 hours agorootparentprevYeah Otellini disclosed Jobs asked them for a CPU for the iPhone and he turned the request down because Jobs was adamant on a certain price and he just couldn't see it. Even if it was hard to foresee the success of the iPhone, he surely had the Core Duo in his hands when this happened even if it didn't launch yet so the company just found its footing again and they should've attempted this moonshot: if the volume is low, the losses are low. If the volume is high then economies of scale will make it a win. This is not hindsight 20/20, this is true even if no one could've foreseen just how high the volume would've been. reply jsheard 22 hours agoparentprevNot to mention that ARM keeps closing in on their ISA moat via Apple, Ampere, Graviton and so on. Their last bastion is the fact that Microsoft keeps botching Windows for ARM every time they try to make it happen. reply DanielHB 8 hours agorootparentNot so much with the latest ARM windows laptops reply pjmlp 7 hours agorootparentprevNot really Microsoft, rather the Windows developer ecosystem, backwards compatibility is the name of the game in PC land, and as such there is very little value to add additional development costs to support ARM alongside x86, for so little additional software sales. Apple doesn't matter beyond its 10% market share, they don't target servers any more. Ampere is a step away to be fully owned by Oracle, I bet most HN ARM cheering crowd is blessifuly unaware of it. Graviton is only relevant for AWS customers. reply cheema33 21 hours agoparentprevIntel has come back recently with a new series of \"Lunar Lake\" CPUs for laptops. They are actually very good. For now, Intel has regained the crown for Windows laptops. Maybe Pat has lit the much needed fire under them. reply pityJuke 19 hours agorootparentWorth noting, > Future Intel generations of chips, including Panther Lake and Nova Lake, won’t have baked-on memory. “It’s not a good way to run the business, so it really is for us a one-off with Lunar Lake,” said Gelsinger on Intel’s Q3 2024 earnings call, as spotted by VideoCardz.[0] [0]: https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24285513/intel-ceo-lunar-... reply phkahler 19 hours agorootparent“It’s not a good way to run the business, so it really is for us a one-off with Lunar Lake,” When you prioritize yourself (way to run the business) over delivering what customers want you're finished. Some companies can get that wrong for a long time, but Intel has a competitor giving the customers much more of what they want. I want a great chip and honestly don't know, care, or give a fuck what's best for Intel. reply nyokodo 18 hours agorootparent> When you prioritize yourself Unless “way to run the business” means “delivering what the customer wants.” reply wongogue 17 hours agorootparentCustomer being the OEMs. reply coder543 16 hours agorootparentI thought the OEMs liked the idea of being able to demand high profit margins on RAM upgrades at checkout, which is especially easy to justify when the RAM is on-package with the CPU. That way no one can claim the OEM was the one choosing to be anti-consumer by soldering the RAM to the motherboard, and they can just blame Intel. reply unnah 11 hours agorootparentOEMs like it when it's them buying the cheap RAM chips and getting the juicy profits from huge mark-ups, not so much when they have to split the pie with Intel. As long as Intel cannot offer integrated RAM at price equivalent to external RAM chips, their customers (OEMs) are not interested. reply hnav 13 hours agorootparentprevIntel would definitely try to directly profit from stratified pricing rather than letting the OEM keep that extra margin (competition from AMD permitting). reply pantalaimon 21 hours agorootparentprevThe only ugly (for Intel) detail being that they are fabbed by TSMC reply otabdeveloper4 10 hours agorootparentprev> Windows laptops A dying platform and as relevant as VAX/VMS going forward. reply CoastalCoder 6 hours agorootparentYou just made me nostalgic for amber screens, line printers, and all-nighters with fellow students. reply hollandheese 21 hours agorootparentprevSnapdragon X Plus/Elite is still faster and has better battery life. Lunar Lake does have a better GPU and of course better compatibility. reply hajile 20 hours agorootparentX Elite is faster, but not enough to offset the software incompatibility or dealing with the GPU absolutely sucking. Unfortunately for Intel, X Elite was a bad CPU that has been fixed with Snapdragon 8 Elite's update. The core uses a tiny fraction of the power of X Elite (way less than the N3 node shrink would offer). The core also got a bigger frontend and a few other changes which seem to have updated IPC. Qualcomm said they are leading in performance per area and I believe it is true. Lunar Lake's P-core is over 2x as large (2.2mm2 vs 4.5mm2) and Zen5 is nearly 2x as large too at 4.2mm2 (Even Zen5c is massively bigger at 3.1mm2). X Elite 2 will either be launching with 8 Elite's core or an even better variant and it'll be launching quite a while before Panther Lake. reply eBombzor 19 hours agorootparentprevLNL is a great paper launch but I have yet to see a reasonably priced LNL laptop so far. Nowadays I can find 16GB Airs and X Elite laptops for 700-900 bucks, and once you get into 1400 territory just pay a bit more for M4 MBPs which are far superior machines. And also, they compete in the same price bracket as Zen 5, which are more performant with not that much worse battery life. LNL is too little too late. reply phonon 16 hours agorootparentAn M4 Macbook Pro 14 with 32 GB of RAM and 1 TB storage is $2,199... a Lunar Lake with the same specs is $1199.

They make garbage. reply hedora 16 hours agorootparentprevYeah, but can they run any modern OS well? The last N intel laptops and desktops I’ve used were incapable of stably running Windows, MacOS or Linux. (As in the windows and apple ones couldn’t run their preloaded operating systems well, and loading Linux didn’t fix it.) reply ahartmetz 16 hours agorootparentVery strange. Enough bad things can be said about Intel CPUs, but I have never had any doubts about their stability. Except for that one recent generation that could age to death in a couple of months (I didn't have any of these). AMD is IME more finicky with RAM, chipset / UEFI / builtin peripheral controller quality and so on. Not prohibitively so, but it's more work to get an AMD build to run great. No trouble with any AMD or Intel Thinkpad T models, Lenovo has taken care of that. reply Dalewyn 18 hours agorootparentprevLunarrow Lake is a big L for Intel because it's all Made by TSMC. A big reason I buy Intel is because they're Made by Intel. We will see whatever they come out with for 17th gen onwards, but for now Intel needs to fucking pay back their CHIPS money. reply justinclift 18 hours agorootparentAre they being fabbed by TSMC in the US, or overseas? reply vitus 6 hours agorootparentTSMC doesn't have any cutting-edge fabs in the US yet.

No idea when/what/how/etc that'll translate to actual production. --- Doing a bit more poking around the net, it looks like \"first half 2025\" is when actual production is pencilled in for TSMC Arizona. Hopefully that works out. reply bryanlarsen 22 hours agoparentprev> seriously challenged on its home turf. Is it? I presume that a large chunk of the AMD's $3.5B is MI3XX chips, and very little of Intel's $3.5B is AI, so doesn't that mean that Xeon likely still substantially outsells EPYC? reply adgjlsfhk1 5 hours agorootparentnot necessarily. in the past 5 years, the x86 monopoly in the server world has broken. arm chips like graviton are a substantial fraction (20%?) of the server CPU market. reply nine_k 14 hours agoparentprevYou forgot the 10 nm / 7 nm node troubles that continued for years and held back their CPU architectures (which honestly kept improving). reply rafaelmn 21 hours agoparentprevHis work now boils down to prepping Intel for an acquisition. reply Wytwwww 21 hours agorootparentBy whom though? I don't see how any company directly competing with Intel (or even orthogonal e.g. Nvidia and ARM) could be allowed to by Intel (they'd need approval in the US/EU and presumably a few other places) unless it's actually on the brink of bankruptcy? reply shiroiushi 18 hours agorootparent>unless it's actually on the brink of bankruptcy?

To be \"dominant\" in this space means more than raw performance or value. One must also dominate the details. It has taken AMD a long time to iron out a large number of these details, including drivers, firmware, chipsets and other matters, to reach real parity with Intel. The good news is that AMD has, finally, mostly achieved that, and in some ways they are now superior. But that has taken time: far longer than it took AMD to beat Intel at benchmarks. reply acdha 22 hours agoparentprevOne thing to remember is that the enterprise space is very conservative: AMD needed to have server-grade CPUs for all of the security and management features on the market long enough for the vendors to certify them, promise support periods, etc. and they need to get the enterprise software vendors to commit as well. The public clouds help a lot here by trivializing testing and locking in enough volume to get all of the basic stuff supported, and I think that’s why AMD was more successful now than they were in the Opteron era. reply j_walter 20 hours agoparentprevServer companies have long term agreements in place...waiting for those to expire before moving to AMD is not unexpected. This was the final outcome expected by many. reply ksec 21 hours agoparentprevIntel did an amazing job at holding on to what they had. From Enterprise Sales connection which AMD had very little from 2017 to 2020. And then bundling other items, essentially discount without lowering price, and finally some heavy discount.

Performance per watt was better for Intel, which matters way more when you're running a large fleet. Doesn't matter so much for workstations or gamers, where all that matters is performance. Also, certification, enterprise management story, etc was not there. Maybe recent EPYC had caught up? I haven't been following too closely since it hasn't mattered to me. But both companies were suggesting an AMD pass by. Not surprising at all though, anyone who's been following roadmaps knew it was only a matter of time. AMD is /hungry/. reply dhruvdh 21 hours agorootparent> Performance per watt was better for Intel No, not its not even close. AMD is miles ahead. This is a Phoronix review for Turin (current generation): https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-epyc-9965-9755-benchmark... You can similarly search for phoronix reviews for the Genoa, Bergamo, and Milan generations (the last two generations). reply pclmulqdq 21 hours agorootparentYou're thinking strictly about core performance per watt. Intel has been offering a number of accelerators and other features that make perf/watt look at lot better when you can take advantage of them. AMD is still going to win a lot of the time, but Intel is better than it seems. reply adrian_b 10 hours agorootparentThat is true, but the accelerators are disabled in all cheap SKUs and they are enabled only in very expensive Xeons. For most users it is like the accelerators do not exist, even if they increase the area and the cost of all Intel Xeon CPUs. This market segmentation policy is exactly as stupid as the removal of AVX-512 from the Intel consumer CPUs. All users hate market segmentation and it is an important reason for preferring AMD CPUs, which are differentiated only on quantitative features, like number of cores, clock frequency or cache size, not on qualitative features, like the Intel CPUs, for which you must deploy different program variants, depending on the cost of the CPU, which may provide or not provide the features required for running the program. The Intel marketing has always hoped that by showing nice features available only in expensive SKUs they will trick the customers into spending more for the top models. However any wise customer has preferred to buy from the competition instead of choosing between cheap crippled SKUs and complete but too expensive SKUs. reply CoastalCoder 6 hours agorootparentI think Intel made a strategic mistake in recent years by segmenting its ISA variants. E.g., the many flavors of AVX-512. Developers can barely be bothered to recompile their code for different ISA variants, let alone optimize it for each one. So often we just build for 1-2 of the most common, baseline versions of an ISA. Probably doesn't help that (IIRC) ELF executables for the x86-64 System V ABI have now way to indicate precisely which ISA variants they support. So it's not easy during program-loading time to notice if your going to have a problem with unsupported instructions. (It's also a good argument for using open source software: you can compile it for your specific hardware target if you want to.) reply pclmulqdq 6 hours agorootparentprevWise customers buy the thing that runs their workload with the lowest TCO, and for big customers on some specific workloads, Intel has the best TCO. Market segmentation sucks, but people buying 10,000+ servers do not do it based on which vendor gives them better vibes. People seem to generally be buying a mix of vendors based on what they are good at. reply adrian_b 58 minutes agorootparentIntel can offer a low TCO only for the big customers mentioned by you, who buy 10000+ servers and have the force to negotiate big discounts from Intel, buying the CPUs at prices several times lower that their list prices. On the other hand, for any small businesses or individual users, who have no choice but to buy at the list prices or more, the TCO for the Intel server CPUs has become unacceptably bad. Before 2017, until the Broadwell Xeons, the TCO for the Intel server CPUs could be very good, even when bought at retail for a single server. However starting with the Skylake Server Xeons, the price for the non-crippled Xeon SKUs has increased so much that they have been no longer a good choice, except for the very big customers who buy them much cheaper than the official prices. The fact that Intel must discount so much their server CPUs for the big customers is likely to explain a good part of their huge financial losses during the last quarters. reply andyferris 21 hours agorootparentprevAre generic web server workloads going to use these features? I would assume the bulk of e.g. EC2 spent its time doing boring non-accelerated “stuff”. reply everfrustrated 20 hours agorootparentIntel does a lot of work developing sdks to take advantage of its extra CPU features and works with open source community to integrate them so they are actually used. Their acceleration primitives work with many TLS implementations/nginx/SSH amongst many others. Possibly AMD is doing similar but I'm not aware. reply kkielhofner 19 hours agorootparentICC, IPP, QAT, etc are definitely an edge. In AI world they have OpenVINO, Intel Neural Compressor, and a slew of other implementations that typically offer dramatic performance improvements. Like we see with AMD trying to compete with Nvidia software matters - a lot. reply pclmulqdq 19 hours agorootparentprevAMD is not doing similar stuff yet. reply kimixa 18 hours agorootparentprevBut those accelerators are also available for AMD platforms - even if how they're provided is a bit different (often on add-in cards instead of a CPU \"tile\"). And things like the MI300A mean that isn't really a requirement now either. reply pclmulqdq 11 hours agorootparentThey are not, at the moment. Google \"QAT\" for one example - I'm not talking about GPUs or other add-in cards at all. reply Tuna-Fish 7 hours agorootparentYou might not be, but the parent poster is. QAT is an integrated offering by Intel, but there are competing products delivered as add-in cards for most of the things it does, and they have more market presence than QAT. As such, QAT provides much less advantage to Intel than Intel marketing makes it seem like. Because yes, Xeon (including QAT) is better than bare Epyc, but Epyc + third party accelerator beats it handily. Especially in cost, the appearance of QAT seems to have spooked the vendors and the prices came down a lot. reply tecleandor 6 hours agorootparentI've only used a couple QAT accelerators and I don't know that field much... What relatively-easy-to-use and not-super-expensive accelerators are available around? reply aryonoco 21 hours agorootparentprevPerformance per Watt was lost by Intel with the introduction of the original Epyc in 2017.

[irrational market grumbling intensifies] reply belval 19 hours agoparentThe market can hardly be called irrational on this. AMD's market value pretty much already priced in that they would take over Intel's place in the datacenter, their valuation is more than double Intel's with a PE of 125, despite them being fabless and ARM gaining ground in the server space. That's why you are seeing big swings in prices, because anything short of \"we are bankrupting Intel and fighting Nvidia in the AI accelerator space\" is seen as a loss. reply dhruvdh 19 hours agorootparent> despite them being fabless That's not how it works. You need to pump money into fabs to get them working, and Intel doesn't have money. If AMD had fabs to light up their money, they would also have a much lower valuation. The market is completely irrational on AMD. Their 52-week high is ~225$ and 52-week low is ~90$. 225$ was hit when AMD was guiding ~3.5B in datacenter GPU revenue. Now, they're guiding to end the year at 5B+ datacenter GPU revenue, but the stock is ~140$? I think it's because of how early Nvidia announced Blackwell (it isn't any meaningful volume yet), and the market thinks AMD needs to compete with GB200 while they're actually competing with H200 this quarter. And for whatever reason the market thinks that AMD will get zero AI growth next year? I don't know how to explain the stock price. Anyway, they hit record quarterly revenue this Q3 and are guiding to beat this record by ~1B next quarter. Price might move a lot based on how AMD guides for Q1 2025. reply belval 14 hours agorootparent> That's not how it works. Being fabless does have an impact because it caps AMD's margins and makes x86 their only moat. They can only extract value if they remain competitive on price. Sure that does not impact Nvidia, but they get to have fat margins because they have virtually no competition. > The market is completely irrational on AMD. Their 52-week high is ~225$ and 52-week low is ~90$. That's volatility not irrationality. As I wrote AMD's valuation is built on the basis that they will keep executing in the DC space, Intel will keep shitting the bed and their MI series will eventually be competitive with Nvidia. These facts make investor skittish and any news about AMD causes the stock to move. > the market thinks AMD needs to compete with GB200 while they're actually competing with H200 this quarter. And for whatever reason the market thinks that AMD will get zero AI growth next year? The only hyperscaler that picked up MI300X is Azure and they GA'ed it 2 weeks ago, both GCP and Azure are holding off. The uncertainty on when (if) it will catch on is a factor but the growing competition from those same hyperscaler building their own chip means that the opportunity window could be closing. It's ok to be bullish on AMD the same way that I am bearish on it, but I would maintain that the swings have nothing to do with irrationality. reply trogdor 3 hours agorootparent> The only hyperscaler that picked up MI300X is Azure and they GA'ed it 2 weeks ago What does “GA” mean in this context?

    "originBody": "Full Of Themselves An analysis of title drops in movies by Dominikus Baur + Alice Thudt A title drop is when a character in a movie says the title of the movie they're in. Here's a large-scale analysis of 73,921 movies from the last 80 years on how often, when and maybe even why that happens. Back to the Future 1985 ★ 8.5/10.0 2 00:30:00 01:30:00 ↓ Jump straight to the full Movie Explorer I'm sure you all know the part of the movie where one of the characters says the actual title of the movie and you're like The overall meta-ness of this is - of course - nothing new. And filmmakers and scriptwriters have been doing it since the dawn of the medium itself*. It's known in film speak as a title drop. Consequently, there's tons of examples throughout movie history that range from the iconic (see Back to the Future's above) via the eccentric, the very much self-aware to the downright cringe. But how common are these title drops really? Has this phenomenon gained momentum over time with our postmodern culture becoming ever more meta? Can we predict anything about the quality of a film based on how many times its title is mentioned? And what does a movie title mean, anyway? There have been analyses and oh so so many listicles of the title drop phenomenon before, but they are small and anecdotal. Here's the first extensive analysis of title drops for a dataset of 73,921 movies that amount to roughly 61% of movies on IMDb with at least 100 user votes*. I'm looking at movies released between 1940 and 2023. Special thanks go to my friends at OpenSubtitles.com for providing this data! Let's talk data I started out with two datasets: 89,242 (English) movie subtitles from OpenSubtitles.com and metadata for 121,797 movies from IMDb. After joining them and filtering them for broken subtitle files I was left with a total of 73,921 subtitled movies. With that out of the way, I realized that the tougher task was still ahead of me: answering the question what even was a title drop? The naïve approach is - of course - to simply look for the movie's name anywhere in the subtitles. Which is a fantastic approach for movies like Back to the Future with a nice unique title: Back to the Future 1985 ★ 8.5/10.0 2 00:30:00 01:30:00 But this quickly breaks down if we look at movies like E or I *, which lead to way too many matches. We also run into problems with every movie that is a sequel (Rocky III, Hot Tub Time Machine 2) since none of the characters will add the sequel number to character names/oversized bathing equipment. Similarly, the rise of the colon in movie titles would make for some very awkward dialogue (LUKE: \"Gosh Mr. Kenobi, it's almost like we're in the middle of some Star Wars Episode Four: A New Hope!\"). (See also the He Didn't Say That meme.) So I applied a few rules to my title matching in the dialogue. Leading 'The', 'An' and 'A's and special characters like dashes are ignored, sequel numbers both Arabic and Roman are dropped (along with 'Episode...', 'Part...' etc.) and titles containing a colon are split and either side counts as a title drop. So for The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring either \"Lord of the Rings\" or \"Fellowship of the Ring\" would count as title drops (feel free to hover over the visualizations to explore the matches)! Loading... ? With the data cleaning out of the way, let's get down to business! Stats Alright, so here's the number you've all been waiting for (drumroll): 36.5% - so about a third - of movies have at least one title drop during their runtime. Also, there's a total of 277,668 title drops for all 26,965 title-dropping movies which means that there's an average of 10.3 title drops per movie that title drops. If they do it, they really go for it. So who are the most excessive offenders in mentioning their titles over the course of the film? The overall star when it comes to fiction only came out last year: it's Barbie by Greta Gerwig with an impressive 267 title drops within its 1 hour and 54 minutes runtime, clocking in at a whopping 2.34 BPM (Barbies Per Minute). On the non-fiction side of documentaries the winner is Mickey: The Story of a Mouse with 309 title drops in only 90 minutes, so 3.43 Mickeys Per Minute! Top ten number of title drops in one movie Fiction only Fiction + Documentaries Loading... ? Loading... ? Loading... ? Loading... ? Loading... ? Loading... ? Loading... ? Loading... ? Loading... ? Loading... ? What's interesting about the (Fiction) list here is that it's pretty international: only two of the top ten movies come from Hollywood, 6 are from India, one from Indonesia and one from Turkey. So it's definitely an international phenomenon. Names in titles Looking at the top ten list you might have noticed this little icon signifying a movie where the data says it's named after one of its characters*. Unsurprisingly, movies named after one of their characters have an average of 24.7 title drops, more than twice as much as the usual 10.3. Protagonists have a tendency to pop up repeatedly in a film, so their names usually do the same. Similarly, movies named after a protagonist have a title drop rate of 88.5% while only 34.2% of other movies drop their titles. A note on the data here An interesting category are movies named after a character that only have a single title drop - making it all the more meaningful? Movies named after a character with single title drops Loading... ? Loading... ? Loading... ? Loading... ? Loading... ? Loading... ? Loading... ? Loading... ? Loading... ? Loading... ? \"Real\" title drops Title-drop connoisseurs might sneer at this point and well-actually us that a \"real\" title drop should only happen once in a film. That there's this one memorable (or cringe-y) scene where the protagonist looks directly at the camera and declares the title of the film with as much pathos as they can muster. Or as a nice send-off in the last spoken line. Such single drops happen surprisingly often: 11.3% of all movies do EXACTLY ONE title drop during their runtime. Which means that there's about twice as many movies having multiple title drops than single ones. In the single drop case it is more likely that the filmmakers were adding a title drop very consciously. Highest rated single drop movies Fiction only Fiction + Documentaries Loading... ? Loading... ? Loading... ? Loading... ? Loading... ? Loading... ? Loading... ? Loading... ? Loading... ? Loading... ? Single drops often happen in a key scene and explain the movie's title: what mysterious fellowship the first Lord of the Rings is named after. Or that the audience waiting for some dark knight to show up must simply accept that it's been the Batman all along. Title drops over the years One suspicion I had was that the very meta act of having a character speak the name of the movie they're in would be something gaining more and more traction over the last two or three decades. And indeed, if we look at the average number of movies with title drops over the decades we can see that there's a certain upwards trend. The 1960s and 1970s seemed to be most averse to mentioning their title in the film, while it's become more common-place over the last years. Highest title drops by decade 1940 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 2020 Most drops Best rated (at least 1 drop) Loading... ? Loading... ? Loading... ? Loading... ? Loading... ? If we dig deeper, this growth over the decades comes with a clearer explanation: splitting up movies by single- and multi-title drops shows that while the tendency of movies to drop their title exactly once keeps more or less steady, the number of multi-drop films is on the rise. Your explanation for this (More movies are being named after their protagonists? Movies are more productified so brand recognition becomes an important concern?) is probably as good as mine 🤷 A sign of quality? Another question I wanted to answer was if a high number of title drops was a sign of a bad movie. Think of all the trashy slasher and horror movies about Meth Marmots and Killer Ballerinas - wouldn't their characters in the sparse dialogues constantly mention the title for brand recognition and all that? Interestingly though, there's no strong connection between film quality (expressed as IMDb rating (YMMV)) and the probability of title-dropping. Genres and title drops An aspect that certainly does have an impact on the probability of a title drop though is the genre of a film. If you think back to the discussion about names in titles from earlier, genres like Biography and other non-fiction genres like Sport and History - almost by definition - mention their subject in both the title and throughout the film. Accordingly, the probability of a title drop varies wildly by genre. Non-fiction films have a strong tendency towards title-dropping, while more fiction-oriented genres like Crime, Romance and War don't. What does a movie title mean? Finally, we can ask the question: what even is a movie title? I couldn't find a complete classification in the scientific literature (\"What's in a name? The art of movie titling\" by Ingrid Haidegger comes the closest). Movie titles are an interesting case, since they have to work as a description of a product, a marketing instrument, but also as the title of a piece of art. Consequently, it's a field ripe with opinions, science and experimentation and listicles. The most extensive classification of media titles in general I could find is TVTropes' Title Tropes list which lists over 180 (!) different types of tropes alone. Some of those tropes are: the Deceptively Silly Title which comes across as innocent while hiding something horrible (for example in The Babadook) the MacGuffin Title where the movie is named after some important object everyone's chasing (see The Fifth Element or Raiders of the Lost Ark) or the Never Trust A Title title where the title is misleading (example: no actual mermaids in Mermaids) or even has nothing to do with the movie itself (underground favorite The Room isn't set in a single room) While naming a movie is a very creative task and pretty successfully defies classification, we can still look at the overall shape of movie titles and see if that has any impact on the number of title drops. One such simple aspect is the length of the title itself. As you would expect there's a negative correlation (if only a slight one*) between the length of a title and the number of title drops it does. Still, there are some fun examples for reaaaaally long movie titles that nevertheless do at least one title drop: Loading... ? Loading... ? Loading... ?

    "commentBody": "Title drops in movies (titledrops.net)405 points by gaws 16 hours agohidepastfavorite137 comments GolDDranks 10 hours agoWhile the 1995 Japanese anime series, Neon Genesis Evangelion revolves around human-shaped weapons called \"Evangelions\", the \"Neon Genesis\" part of the title is neither part of the original Japanese name, nor its direct translation. The Japanese name is 新世紀エヴァンゲリオン / Shin-seiki evangerion, \"Evangelion of a new era/century\". The series has other non-direct translations too, and apparently this style was approved of the original creators, but it was always a bit of a mystery whether the gap in the interpretation was intentional or not. However, over two decades later, with the re-boot movie series Rebuild of Evangelion, in the final scenes of the final movie, the protagonist name-drops the words \"neon genesis\" in appropriate context. I've never grinned as hard in movie theater. reply miltonlost 3 hours agoparentNeon is relating to \"new\" via neo- prefix, with -n added on because the Western idea in the 90s of Japanese aesthetic was futuristic neon. Genesis is for as beginning to the new era. It's etymology is Greek for \"origin, creation, generation\" which is a sort of an \"era\". Plus a looser translation provides the extra wordplay and thematic heft with the Angels due to Genesis being first book of the Bible. Not a translator but I write a lot of poetry, and that's what would be going through my mind as I see the difference between the literal translation and the English decision and the additional capabilities this translation gives. In my mind, the initial translator 100% intended this \"gap\", which is less a gap and more of an additional layering. reply Telemakhos 8 minutes agorootparentThey're both ancient Greek, but different grammatical genders: neon (νέον) is neuter, while γένεσις is feminine. Better might have been \"nea genesis\" if those two words were to be interpreted together. But, \"evangelion\" (εὐαγγέλιον) is also Greek and neuter, meaning the gospel, good news, or a reward owed a messenger for his good news. I always figured the \"new\" of \"neon\" belonged with the \"evangelion,\" and \"genesis\" was just kind of hanging around for no particular reason. reply nine_k 1 hour agorootparentprevBTW neon the gas was called so because it was a new discovery (in a well-searched area, the composition of air). The name basically means \"a new something\", neuter gender, could be \"lo nuevo\" in Spanish or \"das neue\" in German. Since \"evangelion\" and \"genesis\" clearly are taken from Greek, so was apparently \"neon\". reply twic 3 hours agoparentprevWhat does the dialogue say in Japanese? Neon genesis or new era? reply darepublic 5 hours agoprevIntentionality matters. \"It\" should not count as a title drop. Nor Barbie (or any movie where the title is the characters name). But I understand it would be way more difficult to run the numbers with such a constraint. But this is a case where, to me, the results are very much tainted and thus I had to stop reading. To me this is like when developers run into a hard issue and somehow play a game of semantics with the wording of a ticket to avoid putting together something useful for the user reply TheGeminon 5 hours agoparentIf you read a bit further he excludes instances like that and listed films with only a single (likely intentional) title drop. reply zellyn 4 hours agoparentprevAs noted by other commenters, the author addresses this, although I would have loved to have had a version of all the _statistics_ with name-based drops elided. reply cgriswald 1 hour agoparentprevI think a case could be made for “It” being a quasi-name and therefore a different word that is spelled the same or, because “it” is a pronoun it only counts when it is used to refer to the thing that the title itself refers to. reply GuB-42 5 hours agoparentprevWhile it is somewhat arbitrary, I am sure that \"Barbie\" is intentional, the somewhat obnoxious repetition of the word \"Barbie\" fits the theme. Also, maybe you stopped reading a little too early as the case where the title is a character name is specially addressed. \"It\" may be the the special case here, as it is a very common word by itself but that a movie is named like this is notable enough for it to be included. reply quirino 4 hours agorootparentI was more surprised by the fact that \"Barbie\" was said more times than \"it\", even though all of the \"wrong\" instances of \"it\" were counted as well. reply dkdbejwi383 3 hours agorootparentIt's possible there are just more lines of dialogue in Barbie than It, given the conventions around each genre. I haven't seen It, but I can assume with It being a horror film there are longer periods with no dialogue for suspense etc. reply GauntletWizard 15 minutes agorootparentBarbie also has multiple characters named Barbie; There are times where Barbie is said three or four times in a single paragraph and even a sequence that's just a complete graph of Barbies saying \"Hi Barbie\" to each other. reply vundercind 14 hours agoprevIncluding films where the title is a character name makes the data set less interesting. “Barbie title-drops a ton!” yeah ok. reply seba_dos1 10 hours agoparentHave you stopped scrolling once you realized that? The article acknowledges that, and even has a special category of movies named after characters with just a single title drop. That said, Barbie is a funny case indeed, as it's named after about half of its characters :P reply account42 9 hours agorootparentThe problem is that there aren't any lists for title drops excluding boring cases like that. So all the lists get dominated by those cases. reply Terretta 7 hours agorootparentprevMight acknowledge, but fails to fix. For instance, leading genre is biography since they aren't excluding 'name dropping'. reply n2d4 9 hours agorootparentprevYes, but it would've been much more interesting to read about title drops where this is not the case. The top titledrops listed that are not names of a character are all names of something else, like locations or objects. reply beAbU 7 hours agoparentprevI agree, I think this analysis can benefit from some data sanitisation. It is a silly one to include, because the word it is picked up by their analysis. Need to remove all hits except where the characters are referencing Pennywise directly. I also noticed that in some cases a namedrop was registered where the eponymous character speaks, e.g. ALIENS: hisses. These need to be removed as well. Movies where the name of the movie is the name of the leading character needs to be removed as well, or at least filterable from the list. All of this makes the site a little less interesting imo. A good title drop in a movie is a fun little easter egg, especially if the name a bit more conceptual, e.g. The Phantom Menace. The way this site is set up at the moment makes it a bit more difficult to find those really good title drops. reply onionisafruit 13 hours agoparentprevIncluding “It” on the list made it seem like a parody. reply jhbadger 12 hours agorootparentExactly. If they had limited it to cases where \"it\" is referring to Pennywise, that would be one thing, but not when anyone uses a very common pronoun! reply tczMUFlmoNk 11 hours agorootparentI think it's quite interesting to include.

He specifically calls out `\"real\"` title drops just a few sections later. reply quuxplusone 22 minutes agorootparentTo be fair, the article starts out seeming real for about the first third. It's only after the first list — Barbie, Damini, Sita,... Azhar, It — that it descends into obvious parody. Quote: \"What's interesting about the (Fiction) list here is that it's pretty international: only two of the top ten movies come from Hollywood, 6 are from India, one from Indonesia and one from Turkey. So it's definitely an international phenomenon.\" Here the writer slides seamlessly from talking about movies with title drops to talking about movies with single-word titles which are also the name of the main character, but is still saying things like \"What's interesting about this list...\" and \"...an international phenomenon,\" as if those are remotely the defining characteristics of the list he just gave. (The defining characteristic, again, is \"movies named after the protagonist.\" That's all.) Then there's a section break. Since the article clearly outed itself as parody right before the break, I think it's totally reasonable for anyone to stop reading it at that point. (Although maybe not 100% reasonable to come back and comment on HN about it, except maybe to express disappointment and save other people the bother of reading that far themselves.) Anyway, after the break the author says, \"You might have noticed [an icon on each movie that is] named after one of its characters.\" But scroll back up and you'll see that icon is missing from 4 of the movies in that list of 10: \"Saina\", \"Nussa\", \"Arif v. 216\", and \"It\". Of those 4, 3 are clearly named after a main character. The fourth (like \"Ecks vs. Sever\") is named after two characters (Arif and 216) but the graph shows that the author is counting instances of the name \"Arif\" alone, not instances of the phrase \"Arif v 216\". So not only is the article trying to be funny, it's not even playing by consistent rules — it's a parody of an academic paper but also just flat-out lying about the data! That's not only annoying but uncool. I would actually be interested in reading a real article on the phenomenon of title drops in movies, e.g. by someone who'd gone through a bunch of movies and tallied which of them contain title drops. But the linked article is just garbage. reply tedunangst 13 hours agoparentprevI'm imagining some film school student explaining how Barbie would have been a better movie, a real film even, without mentioning the character's name. reply wmf 13 hours agorootparentIn The Ghost Writer the main character's name is never mentioned. reply bregma 1 hour agorootparentNow watch Rebecca. reply jachee 11 hours agorootparentprevFight Club, either. reply aidenn0 13 minutes agorootparentIt's implied that his name is \"Jack,\" assuming the poetry written from the point of view of Jack's organs were an earlier coping mechanism for the MC. reply zwp 10 hours agorootparentprevAnd Layer Cake reply whatsgolden 12 hours agorootparentprevBarbie could be en even better movie if one did a shot each time the name was heard. reply dredmorbius 10 hours agorootparentThat would make it a Fatal Attraction. reply PittleyDunkin 13 hours agorootparentprevThey could have just named the character and avoided this too reply kqr 6 hours agoparentprevIndeed, and this contaminates all other analyses as well. Sure, shorter titles are dropped more frequently – but that sounds like it could be just because character names tend to make for short titles. reply adriand 7 hours agoprevHow sure are we that these so-called title drops are what this article purports them to be rather than the name of the film coming from the content and/or dialogue that is contained within it? An analogy: when someone writes a song and then they need to name it, they will frequently choose a word or phrase that appears in the lyrics. When Leonard Cohen sings “hallelujah” in the song of the same name, is that a “title drop”? I assume not. reply latexr 6 hours agoparent> How sure are we that these so-called title drops are what this article purports them to be What does the article purport them to be? Right at the top I see: > A title drop is when a character in a movie says the title of the movie they're in. That makes no distinction if the title or the script came first. The article does call out movies who do that in a cringe or obvious way (like Suicide Squad, which had prior art) but also includes movies where that is unavoidable, such as Barbie. More importantly, it doesn’t matter which came first. As soon as you make a line and a title the same, the line becomes a title drop. The audience sees the final product, not the process. > An analogy That analogy doesn’t work. Songs are typically repetitive and a few minutes long. Everyone expects them to name the title. A movie, on the other hand, is an experience that asks suspension of disbelief from you, it tries to engross you in its world over the course of multiple hours. When a character title drops, in a second you’re suddenly and forcefully pulled back from the illusion and reminded you’re watching a movie. reply nkozyra 6 hours agorootparent> What does the article purport them to be? Right at the top I see: It seems to imply a concerted effort to mention the title of the movie in the script in a meta, fourth wall breaking sort of way. In some cases that's obviously true - Hot Tub Time Machine, Suicide Squad from their examples - but other times an untitled script just needs a title and it's plucked from the script. I think there's a distinction there, because the latter is less of an Easter Egg sort of thing and more \"ok now we need a title.\" reply latexr 6 hours agorootparent> It seems to imply a concerted effort to mention the title of the movie in the script in a meta, fourth wall breaking sort of way. It makes zero difference to the movie watching experience if the script line came from the script or the other way around. While you’re watching the movie, the effect is exactly the same. So even if you took a line of dialog to make your title, it becomes a title drop nonetheless because the audience doesn’t know (nor should they care) which came first. reply amp108 26 minutes agorootparent> It makes zero difference to the movie watching experience if the script line came from the script or the other way around. While you’re watching the movie, the effect is exactly the same. Certainly not true in the case of a work adapted from another source like a novel. The words \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" are never uttered in The Fellowship of the Ring, and Peter Jackson's ham-fisted insert there was obvious even to people who hadn't read it, but especially to those of us who have. And, by that token, if the dialogue suddenly seems awkward and stunted for no other reason than to insert the title, most people would probably conclude that the title came first. reply latexr 5 minutes agorootparentAnd as I pointed out several hours ago, that complaint is about bad writing, which can happen in either direction. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42062800 nkozyra 5 hours agorootparentprev> It makes zero difference to the movie watching experience if the script line came from the script or the other way around. I disagree; if it's a quote that serves the narrative and isn't jammed in as a reference it doesn't have the same effect as the meta examples. Less of a fourth wall break. reply latexr 4 hours agorootparentThat’s just called good writing. You could decide on a title first then skilfully add it as a quote that servers the narrative. Again, as an audience member you don’t know¹, except when it’s glaringly bad. It’s the toupée fallacy. ¹ I hope it’s obvious I’m excluding cases where someone deliberately seeks behind-the-scenes information. We’re talking about having only the result of the work as context. reply cgriswald 1 hour agorootparentIt’s like anything in film. The viewer can speculate how it was constructed based on evidence in the work itself. The writing divide is certainly not the only source of evidence. More generally we are not limited only to the film when trying to categorize based on this distinction. The distinction exists even if it is not always discernible. That said, I think trying to construct separate lists based on this distinction would be nearly impossible. reply metabagel 5 hours agorootparentprevI don’t think anyone would regard using Barbie’s name in the movie as a title drop. reply latexr 4 hours agorootparentThe article does: > Unsurprisingly, movies named after one of their characters have an average of 24.7 title drops, more than twice as much as the usual 10.3. And this thread started exactly with the point of what the article considers title drops. The article also highlights the interesting case of “movies named after a character with single title drops”. I’m willing to bet that in those movies, if the name is proffered late enough in the runtime, it may feel like a title drop because the the audience suddenly becomes aware the name had never been said before. When the name is said all the time or once but too early (so you’ll be primed to expect it more often) then the effect is bound to be lessened. reply darepublic 5 hours agorootparentprevThe movie \"It\" neither uses title drops, nor was the title plucked from the script. reply jsbg 3 hours agorootparentprev> it doesn’t matter which came first imo it does matter and is the difference between cringe (sometimes intentional) and not reply latexr 3 minutes agorootparentIt’s not the order of the writing that determines that, but the quality.

    "originBody": "Tracker Beeper Posted on Aug 29 2022 A week ago, I finally got round to implementing an idea I’d been toying with for years: what if your computer made a little bit of noise every time it sent data to Google? From studying logs, I’d long known just how many sites send all your visits and clicks to (at least) Google, but a log that you have to manually create first and then analyze is not very dramatic. You need to work on it and finally you think “well yeah that is a lot”. The video above beeps only on Google, and it shows how the official Dutch government jobs site (which also advertises for the intelligence and security services) sends your every click to Google - despite never asking for your permission to do so. It also reports to Google if you clicked the button “apply for this job”, or even “call us for information”. Nice. I announced the tool in a tweet: And within a week, the video received a million views. This spurred me on to add support for Facebook and dozens of the other trackers that infest our sites. Behold the noise when you visit some well known news sites: Media appearances RTLNieuws.nl 9to5Google it-daily.net Stadt Bremerhaven Tarnkappe.info Status of the software For now, it is still pretty rough stuff, suitable only for Linux, OSX and BSD users comfortable entering command lines. The goals are: Continue development on Linux until the necessary features are implemented and stable Perhaps simultaneously make an Apple / OSX version available that runs with a single click Create a Windows version Perhaps perhaps try to implement something similar on iOS and Android, which will not be easy: phones prefer to snitch on you in full privacy Live demo installation I would also love to turn this into a live demo for use on phones and tablets. The idea would then be to have a low power WiFi network. There’s a big QR code (on a poster or a big screen). If you scan that, your phone asks you if you want to join the demo WiFi. And when you do and use your phone, big speakers make the tracker noises. For extra points, make one speaker per tracker, so a huge Google speaker, one for Facebook and dozens of smaller ones. Especially Android phones leak information 24/7 so this should be a pretty convincing demo. If anyone wants to help make this happen, let me know. All it requires is a Raspberry Pi and another phone to deliver internet connectivity. Further Goals Support all popular trackers Configurable which ones you want to hear about With configurable sounds (also in stereo, so “google” in the middle, “Facebook” on the right speaker) Tags: privacy",

Sure, this is a joke today, but if we continue down our current path, we would probably hit ultrasonic rates in the not too distant future. The video was fun and insightful to watch. Big fan of sonification of computer processes. We can hear such a large and important range of frequencies (more than the 'audible range' because we hear impulses in the subsonic range as events) and it works as a nice complementary in real time for an experience that charts can't convey. reply teekert 11 hours agoparentSo true. Although I often prefer silence, the sounds my devices make can be really nice. For example I open my Nextcloud app on my phone and the drives in my server start rattling. I find it soothing. Reminds me of Picard lecturing a young engineer on how in the old days they “were trained to detect some warp core misalignment of .2 micron” (or something). I understand that some astronomers listen to radio telescope outputs and my car mechanic can often hear what’s wrong in a heartbeat. reply stavros 11 hours agorootparentBack when HDDs were noisy, I could tell when my computer was stressed, or about to crash, or hung, etc just from the drive noise. Similarly now with when my 3D printer is leveling, or about to finish the print, or which part it's printing. reply lynx23 11 hours agoparentprevI talked to a scientist who works on sonificantion over a cofee once. Whats interesting is, that they keep finding applications where sonification is superior to visualisation. it boils down to continuous monitoring being more efficient via an audio channel, because humans are not really able to focus on a monitor without occasional distractions. If you do the sonification right, its also easier to detect subtle changes over time. reply Lammy 13 hours agoprevChrome's combined search + address bar seems like a fantastic data source for reverse search warrants: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_search_warrant Imagine a reverse warrant for any person who has searched “torproject.or” in the process of navigating to torproject.org reply smolder 13 hours agoprevThis would be like the old school computing environment where you get an audible beep every time something is written to your hard disk.

It's insane how 0 privacy, we humans have, given WE created this, every word we type, every word we speak, to some point is tracked reply rockskon 13 hours agoparentI tire of the notion that if we don't have the technical acumen to remove technical changes that provide data to third parties and know the implications of what it means that we opted ourselves into no privacy. As opposed to the reality of these changes being relentlessly forced on us with often opaque privacy implications. You are blaming a blind man for not seeing what people are taking from him. The very framing that we've opted ourselves into a privacy-less world is a lawyer's shoehorned logic applied to modern technology. It's a tortured conception of the world. reply varenc 12 hours agorootparentI interpreted the GP comment very differently. I took it to just mean that “we” as “humanity as a whole” have constructed the no privacy world we inhabit. Which seems quite true. I don’t get any sense of casting blame on individuals for lacking the technical acumen to secure their own data. I absolutely agree with your sentiment though. reply card_zero 12 hours agorootparentHumans aren't a cohesive team acting with a common goal, so we do a lot of things to other humans that would be crazy if those other humans counted as \"ourselves\" and we were a team, such as trade sanctions, closed borders, chemical warfare, resource competition, Coldplay, and of course greenhouse gas emissions.

Would be interesting to run this with and without ad blockers and other filter lists to see how good they do at actually protecting you from tracking. reply tracerbulletx 13 hours agoparentPresumably it's google analytics. Some ad blockers will block google analytics. Also Google Analytics claims to not do cross site tracking or build user profiles, whether you believe that is up to you, but it's incredibly commonly used by website owners to track their own traffic. reply ErigmolCt 12 hours agoparentprevThis kind of setup could reveal which blockers are best at keeping data reply dylan604 13 hours agoprevI absolutely hate the combined location/search bar.

You can see Google suggestions popping under the address bar as you type on many browsers: Safari, Firefox, etc. reply dylan604 13 hours agorootparentSome people can, but I've disabled that shite. Also, I don't use Chrome, so it would still be interesting if the default search was not Google in Chrome to see if Chrome still sends the keystrokes to Googs. It's one of those things that I've always hoped Chrome keylogging was just a conspiracy theory, but never cared to look one way or the other. There are some things that even for science I just don't have the time, so hoping others will/do. reply uzyn 12 hours agoprevSearch suggestions are hardly ever useful, but cause a massive privacy leak. They are shipped on by default for most browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari), but at lease they can be disabled (search for \"search suggestions\" in config). reply Ferret7446 11 hours agoparentSounds like an anecdote. I find search suggestions useful as it saves typing a lot of the time. reply goodlinks 13 hours agoprevFor me the two things that show this well are: 1. Quick and easy: Install pihole and add every reasonable list you can find of tracker urls to block. And just watch the live log. 2. Takes a bit more time: install opnsense or pfsense. Block dns out of your network (but allow pihole) and watch the live log of blocked dns requests. Assuming everythong has been told to use pihole 3 (bonus round). A bit more time again: create vlans or similar put the devices that you have checked every do not call home option on and block their internet access. And watch the live logs of blocked traffic Its quite a depressing process and not sure its worth maintaing as a live setup, but its certainly an eye opener. Each one of these steps blocks an order of magnitude less stuff, but is interesting whats in each bucket. Pihole gets hits at an astounding rate reply lokimedes 12 hours agoparentI tried this exact setup with a combination of Ubiquiti and pihole config. It is really unmaintainable and I missed a verification / audit layer, especially for verifying that the Chinese grass/vacuum robots didn’t leak data, etc. It would be a full time job, and then some, when the kids’ apps didn’t work due to my block lists… Since then I have surrendered and now use a custom Cloudflare DNS endpoint. reply goodlinks 11 hours agorootparentFwiw ubiquity devices are some of the \"set every setting to never call home but still did\" devices. I cant remember if they also tried to bypass the configured dns. :( reply lokimedes 8 hours agorootparentYeah, I have noticed that I may have bought into a bit too much \"slick Apple UX\" syndrome with my Ubiquiti \"conversion\", but it was sooo pretty. reply goodlinks 50 minutes agorootparentI still use it but keep the devices on a vlan that cannot dial out. And use the software not an appliance to manage it. Its not just the slick ui, its the devices themselves, and how well it all works. I got fed up of wifi at home not being as good as at work.

No need to break TLS or do anything other than encourage people to make as many network connections as possible all the time, record the fact that a given IP address has sent or received data, and wait days/weeks/years for enough correlations to filter out from the unbelievable volume of noise. TLS-all-the-things actually makes this problem worse because now every single connection has to leave my network to hit some “““trusted””” origin/Cloudflare/whatever server instead of just being cached at my gateway. reply calrain 13 hours agoparentprev>> But that data is reasonably only accessible by the people who instrumented that tracking. ... and Google... and the people they sell aggregated traffic data to...

PJ–1 Images Gallery Organization About JunoCam Images Welcome! This is where we post raw images from JunoCam. We invite you to download them, do your own image processing, and we encourage you to upload your creations for us to enjoy and share. The types of image processing we’d love to see range from simply cropping an image to highlighting a particular atmospheric feature, as well as adding your own color enhancements, creating collages and adding advanced color reconstruction. One of the biggest challenges for Juno is Jupiter's intense radiation belts, which are expected to limit the lifetime of both Juno’s engineering and science subsystems. JunoCam is now showing the effects of that radiation on some of its parts. PJ56 images show a reduction in our dynamic range and an increase in background and noise. We invite citizen scientists to explore new ways to process these images to continue to bring out the beauty and mysteries of Jupiter and its moons. For those of you who have contributed – thank you! Your labors of love have illustrated articles about Juno, Jupiter and JunoCam. Your products show up in all sorts of places. We have used them to report to the scientific community. We are writing papers for scientific journals and using your contributions – always with appropriate attribution of course. Some creations are works of art and we are working out ways to showcase them as art. PJ–1 Images The first perijove pass of Jupiter was a test run for JunoCam. The set of 28 images taken were designed to find optimal viewing geometries and camera settings. For example, we took 4 images of the north pole. We used two different settings for the time-delayed-integration (TDI), which determines the integration time, to see which would be best for the polar region and a very high TDI level (long exposure) to try to detect Jupiter’s aurora. We imaged at two different geometries, looking directly down at the pole and looking at closest range at a more oblique angle, to see which would give us the best results. We ran through a similar set of tests for the south pole. Another comparison we made was to test different compression settings. We have a methane filter, included for the polar science investigation, that is almost at the limits of our detector’s wavelength range. To get enough photons for an image we need to use a very long exposure. In some images this results in scattered light in the image. For science purposes we will simply crop out the portions of the image that include this artifact. Work is in progress to determine exactly what conditions cause stray light problems so that this can be minimized for future imaging. Gallery Organization The gallery displays images from JunoCam itself, as well as uploads from the community. The JunoCam images are identified by a small spacecraft icon. You will see both raw and processed versions of the images as they become available. The JunoCam movie posts have too many images to post individually, so we are making them available for download in batches as zip files. You can filter the gallery by many different characteristics, including by Perijove Pass, Points of Interest and Mission Phase. If you have a favorite “artist” you can create your own gallery. Click on “Submitted by” on the left, select your favorite artist(s), and then click on “Filter”. A special note about the Earth Flyby mission phase images: these were acquired in 2013 when Juno flew past Earth. Examples of processed images are shown; most contributions are from amateurs. About JunoCam Images Like previous MSSS cameras (e.g., Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter’s Mars Color Imager) Junocam is a \"pushframe\" imager. The detector has multiple filter strips, each with a different bandpass, bonded directly to its photoactive surface. Each strip extends the entire width of the detector, but only a fraction of its height; Junocam's filter strips are 1600 pixels wide and about 155 rows high. The filter strips are scanned across the target by spacecraft rotation. At the nominal spin rate of 2 RPM, frames are acquired about every 400 milliseconds. Junocam has four filters: three visible (red/green/blue) and a narrowband \"methane\" filter centered at about 890 nm. The spacecraft spin rate would cause more than a pixel's worth of image blurring for exposures longer than about 3.2 milliseconds. For the illumination conditions at Jupiter such short exposures would result in unacceptably low SNR, so the camera provides Time-Delayed-Integration (TDI). TDI vertically shifts the image one row each 3.2 milliseconds over the course of the exposure, cancelling the scene motion induced by rotation. Up to about 100 TDI steps can be used for the orbital timing case while still maintaining the needed frame rate for frame-to-frame overlap. For Earth Flyby the light levels are high enough that TDI is not needed except for the methane band and for nightside imaging. Junocam pixels are 12 bits deep from the camera but are converted to 8 bits inside the instrument using a lossless \"companding\" table, a process similar to gamma correction, to reduce their size. All Junocam products on the missionjuno website are in this 8-bit form as received on Earth. Scientific users interested in radiometric analysis should use the \"RDR\" data products archived with the Planetary Data System, which have been converted back to a linear 12-bit scale. Submission Guidelines We invite you to download raw JunoCam images posted here and do your own image processing on them. Be creative! Anything from cropping to color enhancing to collaging is fair game. Then upload your creations here. Please refrain from direct use of any official NASA or Juno mission logos in your work, as this confuses what is officially sanctioned by NASA and by the Juno Project. We ask that you refrain from posting any patently offensive, political, or inappropriate images. Let’s keep it clean and fun for everyone of any age! Remember, this section is moderated so inappropriate content will be rejected. But creativity and curiosity in the scientific spirit and the adventure of space exploration is highly encouraged and we look forward to seeing Jupiter through not only JunoCam’s eyes, but your own. Have at it!

In college my son worked on the FFT engine that processed the radar data. He has code circling Jupiter! reply virtue3 2 hours agoparentI have a close friend that worked on the mars rover. He uses me as a reference. As soon as they start being like “can he use the latest android libraries and techniques” or some crap. I just shoot back: “The man has code on another planet, he’s more than capable of picking up anything” They shut up so fast lol reply latexr 2 hours agoparentprevThat would be a hilarious (and confusing) bumper sticker. When other parents say “my son is an honour student” you can smugly reply “yeah, but does he have code circling Jupiter?” Congratulations, by the way. I’m being (trying to be) funny but I genuinely think that is cool and a reason to be proud. reply KWxIUElW8Xt0tD9 5 hours agoparentprevI worked with a guy once back in the 80s who did the radar preamp on Pioneer Venus I believe it was. Very bright individual. reply awanderingmind 6 hours agoparentprevThat's really cool, something to be proud of :) reply Aachen 7 hours agoprevThese come from Juno, a mission sent in 2011 and orbiting Jupiter since 2016. Must say it wasn't really on my radar anymore, but looking at the timeline on Wikipedia, it's still going around and getting close (\"perijove\") every month and a week or so, at an ever-increasing longitude https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_(spacecraft)#Timeline The planned end of the mission is in about a year. The camera was \"included in the payload to facilitate education and public outreach [but] later re-purposed to study the dynamics of Jupiter's clouds\" reply foobarbecue 4 hours agoparentYeah, they had to fight so hard to get that camera on there! It was not included in the initial designs since it wasn't necessary for the science objectives. reply Aachen 2 hours agorootparentMakes me wonder what it costs to send a \"simple\" camera along. Factors that make it probably not so simple: even 200 grams of camera (and extra solar panels to supply +10W while operating) probably costs many thousands of euros in rocket fuel and emission taxes. The engineering time to properly fixate it onto the spacecraft, integrate the software, and test the whole thing cost probably a few ten thousands in salaries. Radiation may be a big problem for what's otherwise off-the-shelf hardware, that might mean the hardware costs much more (tens of thousands instead of a couple hundred euros potentially?) and gets significantly heavier from shielding, but I wouldn't know how much. Is that about right, am I missing something major and/or am I off on orders of magnitude somewhere? reply dr_orpheus 2 hours agorootparentYeah, you got a lot of it and the ripple effect of things that go out from it. In addition to the extra mass of the camera and solar arrays, there is extra mass for the harnessing to connect the camera to the computer and engineering design for that as well. Integration of anything else on the spacecraft will have to go through Failure Modes Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA). Basically, this gets in to pretty detailed circuit design analysis and makes sure that any failure on the camera itself (like a short circuit or babbling idiot data bus) won't impact the rest of the spacecraft. Potential cost of increased storage onboard the spacecraft if it is significant data volume. Cost of downlinking the data to the ground, time on the DSN is expensive. I think the cost data sheets for DSN usage are online and it depends on data rate, what dish you are using, etc. but costs for usage are on the order of thousands per hour and data rates from Jupiter are pretty slow. The cost of the camera itself is likely on the order of a couple hundred thousand. I've seen similar costs for small radiation hardened cameras and star trackers. The difference in parts cost for some things can be absolutely insane. Passive electrical components certainly cost more, but for active circuits it can be insane. A radiation hardened equivalent of a $20 FPGA can be something like $20,000. All told, cost of integration and use over the mission is likely at least a few million. But on a $1.1 billion mission it still doesn't seem like a lot. reply grahamj 1 hour agorootparentI’m reminded of the thread from the other day about “just” doing something. We’ll just add a camera, no biggie! Still, I’m very glad they did it. Arguably the second most beautiful planet :) reply ClumsyPilot 2 hours agorootparentprev> It was not included in the initial designs That’s why NASA is poor and pentagon is rich.

Jupiter's mass is 2 x 10^27. The smallest stars are 8 x 10^28. On an exponential scale, Jupiter is closer to being a star than it is to being Earth. So... maybe you could say that Jupiter is almost a star. With such loose definitions talking about astronomical scales, there's a lot of room for interpretation and exaggeration.

You can't even say it's to protect life, because some forms of life will do way better in a warmer planet too.

Jupiters sphere of influence is full of radiation, meaning the sat needs a lot of shielding which makes it very heavy. Additionally, you need a lot of thrust to not only get to Jupiter, but to be able to get into a geosync orbit around a planet other than earth, so youre gonna need a lot of fuel. And finally, time... Europa Clipper just left earth, it will be 8 years before it arrives at jupiter. The windows for launch are long but very spread out, so mission timing would be important too. And, funfacts time.. Clipper is going to europa but will be spending much of its time in orbit around jupiter, passing closely to europa every orbit. This was done to limit the amount of radiation the sat will get during its mission, and that orbit is uuuge, in order to avoid as much of the radiation as possible. The area of Jupiter and its moons is probably one of the most hostile space environments in our system, catching asteroids, radiation, huge planet full of gasses that would corrode you and your ship if you dipped in, and a huge gravity well that makes it difficult to leave again once youre there. Not many other planets in our system are as dangerous as jupiter and friends. reply KWxIUElW8Xt0tD9 5 hours agorootparentI was under the impression that we now know how to do low-fuel paths through the solar system using gravity. It's more a question of how long do you want to take to get where you're going. reply foobarbecue 4 hours agorootparentIf you want to go faster, you need more fuel, and eventually you max out the biggest rocket available. Clipper is the most massive planetary probe ever-- they had to use falcon heavy in fully expendable mode to get it up there. reply dr_orpheus 2 hours agorootparentYep, for reference Europa Clipper is 6,065 kg [0]. It is an absolutely massive interplanetary probe. It is getting close in size to some of the largest GEO communication satellites. And to get it out to Jupiter they definitely need some of the gravity assist trajectories. On the opposite end of the spectrum, New Horizons was only 478 kg [1] and still holds the record for the fastest thing ever launched from Earth. It also did a gravity assist flyby around Jupiter and it still took 9 years to get to Pluto. [0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_Clipper [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Horizons reply adolph 4 hours agorootparentprevYes, this specific specific duration has to do with the choice of launch vehicle. (No shade for any particular program as all have different tradeoffs and I'm gratified to see the probe successfully on its way.) The SLS option would have entailed a direct trajectory to Jupiter taking less than three years. ... The move to Falcon Heavy saved an estimated US$2 billion in launch costs alone. NASA was not sure an SLS would be available for the mission since the Artemis program would use SLS rockets extensively, and the SLS's use of solid rocket boosters (SRBs) generates more vibrations in the payload than a launcher that does not use SRBs. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_Clipper reply grahamj 1 hour agoparentprevYou need line of sight to talk to it and I’m pretty sure the sun is going to be in the way sometimes. reply -5m 9 hours agoprevThese are beautiful!

Still a lot of color though! This[2] paper studies the ovals but has some details on the atmosphere, including the colors: The reddish color is usually attributed to red “chromophores”, which are products of a series of complex chemical reactions, such as the UV photolization of ammonia with acetylene. These chromophores can act as coating material for the ammonia particles. The cloud structure of the Jupiter's atmosphere, and in particular the nature of vortex features, as the [Great Red Spot] and the white ovals, is still puzzling. This[3] paper tries to reproduce the reactions in the lab and compare them with the observed colors. It goes into some more details around the potential color formation. I also want to just include this picture[4] because I just love the tiny fluffy clouds, which shadows provides amazing depth feeling.

It seems to be a trend lately like the recent images of the Moon and Pluto. They might even be translating non-visible spectra to color so the material composition can be distinguished better, like they do with nebula and such.

    "originBody": "98.css A design system for building faithful recreations of old UIs. Intro 98.css is a CSS library for building interfaces that look like Windows 98. See more on GitHub. My First VB4 Program Hello, world! OK Cancel This library relies on the usage of semantic HTML. To make a button, you'll need to use a . Input elements require labels. Icon buttons rely on aria-label. This page will guide you through that process, but accessibility is a primary goal of this project. You can override many of the styles of your elements while maintaining the appearance provided by this library. Need more padding on your buttons? Go for it. Need to add some color to your input labels? Be our guest. This library does not contain any JavaScript, it merely styles your HTML with some CSS. This means 98.css is compatible with your frontend framework of choice. Here is an example of 98.css used with React, and an example with vanilla JavaScript. The fastest way to use 98.css is to import it from unpkg.You can install 98.css from the GitHub releases page, or from npm. npm install 98.css Components Button A command button, also referred to as a push button, is a control that causes the application to perform some action when the user clicks it. — Microsoft Windows User Experience p. 160 A standard button measures 75px wide and 23px tall, with a raised outer and inner border. They are given 12px of horizontal padding by default. Click me Show code When buttons are clicked, the raised borders become sunken. The following button is simulated to be in the pressed (active) state. I am being pressed Show code Disabled buttons maintain the same raised border, but have a \"washed out\" appearance in their label. I cannot be clicked Show code Button focus is communicated with a dotted border, set 4px within the contents of the button. The following example is simulated to be focused. I am focused Show code Checkbox A check box represents an independent or non-exclusive choice. — Microsoft Windows User Experience p. 167 Checkboxes are represented with a sunken panel, populated with a \"check\" icon when selected, next to a label indicating the choice. Note: You must include a corresponding label after your checkbox, using theelement with a for attribute pointed at the id of your input. This ensures the checkbox is easy to use with assistive technologies, on top of ensuring a good user experience for all (navigating with the tab key, being able to click the entire label to select the box). This is a checkbox Show code Checkboxes can be selected and disabled with the standard checked and disabled attributes. When grouping inputs, wrap each input in a container with the field-row class. This ensures a consistent spacing between inputs. I am checked I am inactive I am inactive but still checked Show code OptionButton An option button, also referred to as a radio button, represents a single choice within a limited set of mutually exclusive choices. That is, the user can choose only one set of options. — Microsoft Windows User Experience p. 164 Option buttons can be used via the radio type on an input element. Option buttons can be grouped by specifying a shared name attribute on each input. Just as before: when grouping inputs, wrap each input in a container with the field-row class to ensure a consistent spacing between inputs. Yes No Show code Option buttons can also be checked and disabled with their corresponding HTML attributes. Peanut butter should be smooth I understand why people like crunchy peanut butter Crunchy peanut butter is good Show code GroupBox A group box is a special control you can use to organize a set of controls. A group box is a rectangular frame with an optional label that surrounds a set of controls. — Microsoft Windows User Experience p. 189 A group box can be used by wrapping your elements with the fieldset tag. It contains a sunken outer border and a raised inner border, resembling an engraved box around your controls. Select one: Diners Drive-Ins Dives Show code You can provide your group with a label by placing a legend element within the fieldset. Today's mood Claire Saffitz Brad Leone Chris Morocco Carla Lalli Music Show code TextBox A text box (also referred to as an edit control) is a rectangular control where the user enters or edits text. It can be defined to support a single line or multiple lines of text. — Microsoft Windows User Experience p. 181 Text boxes can rendered by specifying a text type on an input element. As with checkboxes and radio buttons, you should provide a corresponding label with a properly set for attribute, and wrap both in a container with the field-row class. Occupation Show code Additionally, you can make use of the field-row-stacked class to position your label above the input instead of beside it. Address (Line 1) Address (Line 2) Show code To support multiple lines in the user's input, use the textarea element instead. Additional notes Show code Text boxes can also be disabled and have value with their corresponding HTML attributes. Favorite color Show code Other types of HTML5 text inputs are also supported. Email Password Favorite Number Show code Slider A slider, sometimes called a trackbar control, consists of a bar that defines the extent or range of the adjustment and an indicator that shows the current value for the control... — Microsoft Windows User Experience p. 146 Sliders can rendered by specifying a range type on an input element. Volume: Low High Show code You can make use of the has-box-indicator class replace the default indicator with a box indicator, furthermore the slider can be wrapped with a div using is-vertical to display the input vertically. Note: To change the length of a vertical slider, the input width and div height. Cowbell Show code Dropdown A drop-down list box allows the selection of only a single item from a list. In its closed state, the control displays the current value for the control. The user opens the list to change the value. — Microsoft Windows User Experience p. 175 Dropdowns can be rendered by using the select and option elements. 5 - Incredible! 4 - Great! 3 - Pretty good 2 - Not so great 1 - Unfortunate Show code By default, the first option will be selected. You can change this by giving one of your option elements the selected attribute. 5 - Incredible! 4 - Great! 3 - Pretty good 2 - Not so great 1 - Unfortunate Show code Window The following components illustrate how to build complete windows using 98.css. Title Bar At the top edge of the window, inside its border, is the title bar (also reffered to as the caption or caption bar), which extends across the width of the window. The title bar identifies the contents of the window. — Microsoft Windows User Experience p. 118 Include command buttons associated with the common commands of the primary window in the title bar. These buttons act as shortcuts to specific window commands. — Microsoft Windows User Experience p. 122 You can build a complete title bar by making use of three classes, title-bar, title-bar-text, and title-bar-controls. A Title Bar Show code We make use of aria-label to render the Close button, to let assistive technologies know the intent of this button. You may also use \"Minimize\", \"Maximize\", \"Restore\" and \"Help\" like so: A Title Bar A Maximized Title Bar A Helpful Bar Show code You can make a title bar \"inactive\" by adding inactive class, useful when making more than one window. An inactive title bar Show code Window contents Every window has a boundary that defines its shape. — Microsoft Windows User Experience p. 118 To give our title bar a home, we make use of the window class. This provides a raised outer and inner border, as well as some padding. We can freely resize the window by specifying a width in the container style. A Complete Window Show code To draw the contents of the window, we use the window-body class under the title bar. A Window With Stuff In It There's so much room for activities! Show code Status Bar A status bar is a special area within a window, typically the bottom, that displays information about the current state of what is being viewed in the window or any other contextual information, such as keyboard state. — Microsoft Windows User Experience p. 146 You can render a status bar with the status-bar class, and status-bar-field for every child text element. A Window With A Status Bar There are just so many possibilities: A Task Manager A Notepad Or even a File Explorer! Press F1 for help Slide 1 CPU Usage: 14% Show code TreeView A tree view control is a special list box control that displays a set of objects as an indented outline based on their logical hierarchical relationship. — Microsoft Windows User Experience p. 178 To render a tree view, use an ul element with the tree-view class. The children of this list (li elements), can contain whatever you'd like. We can put ✨ Whatever ✨ We want in here Show code To make this a tree, we can nest further ul elements (no class needed on these). This will provide them with a nice dotted border and indentation to illustrate the structure of the tree. To create expandable sections, wrap child lists inside of details elements. Table of Contents What is web development? CSS Selectors Specificity Properties JavaScript Avoid at all costs Unless HTML Special Thanks Show code Tabs A tab control is analogous to a divider in a file cabinet or notebook. You can use this control to define multiple logical pages or sections of information within the same window. — Microsoft Windows User Experience p. 193 To render a tab list, use a menu element with the [role=tablist] attribute. The children of this menu (li elements), should get a [role=tab] attribute. Tabs should be managed by adding custom javascript code. All you need is to add the [aria-selected=true] attribute to the active tab. Hello, world! Desktop My computer Control panel Devices manager Hardware profiles Performance the tab content Show code To create multirows tabs, add a multirows class to the menu tag. Hello, world! Desktop My computer Control panel Devices manager Hardware profiles Performance Users Network Programs Services Resources Advanced the tab content Show code TableView To render a table view, use a table element. Wrap it with a div element with sunken-panel class to provide proper border and overflow container. With a bit of extra scripting you can make table view interactive. Give interactive class to table element to show pointer cursor when hovering over body rows. Table rows can be given highlighted class to appear selected.

Interesting how retro computing, like old games and operating systems, can be comforting and even healing. I've had similar experience with emulators - playing Gameboy and Nintendo games from childhood, or running Macintosh System 9. Reminds me of Pico-8, SerenityOS, TempleOS. There's a common thread of a retro-style computing environment that can be entirely understood and controlled by the user. I imagine there's deeper psychological dynamics to this, like a safe \"sandbox\" as a therapeutic tool. It also says something about design with empathy and focus on user experience. There are so many hostile dark patterns these days in technology and society, that it's a relief to find some space (physical or mental) that's designed for your comfort. reply metadat 1 hour agoprev98.css is an HN Classic, for all the best reasons.

We did this for our browser-based Intranet applications in 1998, which made them look a bit more \"native\". reply sbarre 4 hours agoparentI did a bit of digging and it seems this was generalized into CSS System Colours at some point: https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color/#css-system-colors And all these old colours were deprecated: https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color/#deprecated-system-colors reply myfonj 8 hours agoprevNB, that style does not play well with non-native DPI (e.g. when you have monitor set to 150% scale); to see it mapped to physical pixels, try running this in the browser's console: with(document.documentElement.style){ transform = `scale(${ 1 / devicePixelRatio })`; transformOrigin = 'top left'; } (multiply the scale by whole number to get it \"crisply zoomed\"). Still not 100% perfect, but much closer to intended rendering, I guess. reply klaussilveira 2 hours agoprevIt sucks that the fonts will never look amazing as they once were in CRT monitors in 800x600. reply smusamashah 5 hours agoprevI made this Obsidian theme (now defunct) using lots of source from 98.css https://github.com/SMUsamaShah/Obsidian-Win98-Edition reply agluszak 7 hours agoprevI'd claim that this is way better than what we've got after years of UX/UI \"research\" and \"improvements\". And it's not that I'm some old boomer. In '98 I was one year old. I just hate buttons which don't look like buttons, tabs which don't look like tabs, text fields that you have to click to discover they're editable etc. reply mrweasel 4 hours agoparentHave much UX/UI research been put into operation systems UIs since Windows 95? I suppose Apple must have done some research for MacOSX, but in the past two decades it feels like features are just be thrown in, especially on mobile, with no concept of discoverability or consistency. More than anything I think companies desire to have \"consistent branding\" or \"unique look\" is to blame for much of this. reply bityard 1 hour agorootparentYes, Apple at one time had a phenomenal Human Interface Guide for native OS X applications which was based on actual UX testing and research. Things like, \"make your application features discoverable,\" \"clearly delineate functional areas and controls,\" and \"use verb+noun on action buttons.\" It was Good Stuff and it heavily informed a lot of UX decisions for the prominent Linux desktops at the time. It's still around but I flipped through it recently and it seems to be a mix of the absurdly general (\"don't build an app for a specific screen size\") to the very specific (MacOS and iOS APIs). Maybe there's some gold buried in there still, but I'm not sure where to find it. reply jandrese 4 hours agoparentprevThat said I'm not a fan of the black text over dark gray background.

I think it's almost the mantra that we need breathing room, e.g., between different options in a radio-group box list of items... but I find lesser space (as was characteristic of older UI's) to be more honest... more respectful to me as an end-user, more information-dense. I don't want to discard whatever innovation has been done, but man I find myself being nostalgic of old UI quite often. reply bityard 31 minutes agorootparentThere's nothing preventing information-dense layouts today, except that the \"flat design\" crowd has decreed that no work spaces, toolbars, or controls shall have any borders or lines to delineate visual separation. Too much \"clutter.\" So the only thing left is to separate things with vast volumes of whitespace which doesn't actually work all that well when you have to deal with different screen sizes. reply culi 36 minutes agorootparentprevIt goes back to an accessibility study that found that 1.5x line-height is the most readable. As with a lot of things in ux accessibility research, these results were never replicated but the idea was seared into all our brains permanently. We know from research on fonts that ultimately, the most accessible font is the one the user is most used to. Sans vs. Serif vs. etc all don't seem to make a consistent difference across demographics. I suspect line spacing is something that's due for a relook reply blenderob 5 hours agorootparentprevWith old 640 x 480 or 800 x 600 resolutions, the screen real estate came at premium. There wasn't much room to use generous padding and still make all the buttons and UI fields fit in the low resolution displays. reply marginalia_nu 5 hours agorootparentModern smartphones aren't that far off in terms of (logical) pixel counts.

XP's UI is my favorite of all the Windows UIs. It had just enough modernity to feel sleek but still had contrast to be easily seen and read and understood. Windows 7 UI was a bit too flashy and employed looks over readability and Windows 98 was too old fashioned and also suffered from a lack of contrast with all the grey. reply mrighele 7 hours agorootparentI never enjoyed the XP one. Somebody called the Fisher-Price ui, and I think the remark is not too off. I would always switch to the \"classic\" UI, which I think was the same as Windows 2000, which in my opinion is the best of all (it is a similar but different from the one of Windows 98, especially in color choice and icon) reply stavros 10 hours agorootparentprevWas XP your first OS, by any chance?

The font rendering looks very similar (if not identical) to what I remember it in Win98 -- no antialiasing, 1px thick, very easy to spot the pixels on curved strokes, very easy to spot the pixels on bold style, etc. The style looks incredible accurate to what I remember, although there are some differences: - The opened dropdown menu, as my parent suggested. - I don't remember textareas being resizable. - I remember stepped sliders had little marks indicating where each step is. Only continuous sliders (e.g., the one in the Windows volume control) had no marks. - The tabs don't look like as I remember from Win95/98, these ones look more like Win 3.1. Too much padding, the border is too thick, and the border radius is too big. - In tables, the headers looked like buttons because they were actually buttons (you could press them to sort the table). However, here they are not clickable. reply Aardwolf 6 hours agorootparentInteresting, I tried zooming in now and when zooming in far enough the font does look alright! It might be that it just happens to look bad on high resolution screens, and/or maybe some browser fractional scaling issue As an example, one of the text fields on the page contains the word \"Incredible\".

By Gaby Del Valle, a policy reporter. Her past work has focused on immigration politics, border surveillance technologies, and the rise of the New Right. Nov 5, 2024, 10:19 PM UTC Share this story Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge The Mozilla Foundation laid off 30 percent of its workforce and completely eliminated its advocacy and global programs divisions, TechCrunch reports. While Mozilla is best known for its Firefox web browser, the Mozilla Foundation — the parent of the Mozilla Corporation — describes itself as standing up “for the health of the internet.” With its advocacy and global programs divisions gone, its impact may be lessened going forward. “Fighting for a free and open internet will always be core to our mission, and advocacy continues to be a critical tool in that work. We’re revisiting how we pursue that work, not stopping it,” Brandon Borrman, the Mozilla Foundation’s communications chief, said in an email to The Verge. Borrman declined to confirm exactly how many people were laid off, but said it was about “30% of the current team.” This is Mozilla’s second round of layoffs this year. In February, the Mozilla Corporation laid off around 60 workers said it would be making a “strategic correction” that would involve involve cutting back its work on a Mastodon instance. Mozilla shut down its virtual 3D platform and refocused its efforts on Firefox and AI. The Mozilla Foundation had around 120 employees before this more recent round of layoffs, according to TechCrunch. In an email sent to all employees on October 30th, Nabhia Syed, the foundation’s executive director, said that the advocacy and global programs divisions “are no longer part of our structure.” “Navigating this topsy-turvy, distracting time requires laser focus — and sometimes saying goodbye to the excellent work that has gotten us this far because it won’t get us to the next peak,” wrote Syed, who previously worked as the chief executive of The Markup, an investigative news site. “Lofty goals demand hard choices.” Most Popular Most Popular Elon Musk’s ‘top 20’ Diablo IV claim is as real as his self-driving cars PS5 Pro review: how close is your TV?

I suspect the corporation employs more people than the foundation? So stuff like development is not included in that count. I do wonder if the cuts are because of anticipation of lower search revenue from Google with tech restricting legislation on the horizon and google's focus pivoting to AI. reply gsnedders 12 hours agoparent> I suspect the corporation employs more people than the foundation?

It’s like when I cancel Netflix. Compared to my other spending it’s not a lot, and to be honest I won’t even notice the savings. But if the value isn’t there, why spend money on it? Granted I’m not moralizing about the actual value or correctness of this decision, I know nothing about Mozilla’s inner workings or the work of this division in particular. reply necovek 13 hours agoprevA job for advocacy division is to, uhm, advocate for the product and mission.

Power is increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few megacorps so you and I can't, for example, run our own email servers if we expect to actually be able to communicate with users of Google or Microsoft.

I don't see how Mozilla could have shifted the needle on the rise of big web properties. In fact, I want a browser to be completely agnostic, so if Mozilla had, e.g., prevented the rise of Facebook, then I'd probably conclude that they were anti-open. What I do want is web standards. IE built its moat, partly, by breaking standards. To be charitable, perhaps standards were moving too slowly. The sane thing is ming again with chrome. Now, by my choice not to use a chrome engine, i have patches of nonfunctionality.

I think that's the right thing to do. Honestly V3 is pretty reasonable. It's just that uBlock Origin is so important and trusted it should be an exception. It should be built into the browser, only conflicts of interest prevent this.

Not all of them ever even worked for Mozilla Foundation or its subsidiaries—some simply got reassigned by the company that was actually paying them.

This company seems to have major structural problems, and cutting some stuff here and there isn't going to fix it. Its expenses are huge, and it pays its executives obscene amounts of money, and meanwhile they've been wasting tons of money on stuff like Pocket, AI crap, and now they're pissing off supporters by getting into ads. I think what we really need is for a new company to get started in some other country, where the cost of living and the cost of executive salaries is much, much cheaper. Have that company fork the Firefox codebase, and then only concentrate on Firefox (Newfox? Betterfox?) browser development and maintenance, and nothing else. They could work more like Wikipedia, just taking donations and building up an endowment with that to fund themselves, and keeping their operations very lean so they don't need that much money to begin with. reply bawolff 18 hours agorootparentWhat they should have done was build an endowment when they were getting crazy google money. It obviously wasn't going to last forever. reply shiroiushi 17 hours agorootparentYes, definitely. It would have been easy back then to build an endowment if they hadn't blown money on so much BS and prepared for a future where they wouldn't have all that money coming in. I think it's too late for them now, and I don't see how they can possibly trim things down into a lean, efficient organization, especially not in the US. That's why I think someone in a cheaper country needs to fork the thing and take over Firefox development. This will probably have to wait until Mozilla is teetering on the edge of bankruptcy though. reply neilv 17 hours agorootparentWhy haven't some EU and/or Latin American countries funded a Web browser in a meaningful way, in an effort to be less under the thumb of US tech companies? They could fork Firefox or Chromium, poach some current developers, hire some more, and assert a strong presence on standards. reply I_AM_A_SMURF 14 hours agorootparentMicrosoft gave up on building a Web Browser engine and you think a government can? Browser engines are really hard to build. They requires a lot of (very expensive) niche technical talent. Not to mention the need to keep up with the rate of Google's improvements to Chrome/Blink. We're at a point where Chrome has a 10 year head start to any other engine other than Firefox, building a general purpose new engine from scratch is basically off the table, and hard forking Chrome/Blink is also off the table (because why would you toss the ~1bn$ Google puts into chrome every year?). We're in a world of a single browser engine, no way to go back for the foreseeable future. reply marto1 29 minutes agorootparent> you think a government can? Browser engines are really hard to build.

Do I think a government can fund a group of developers to fork some existing code and run with it? Yes, I do. Radical concept, I know... reply alternatex 10 hours agorootparentI think you severely underestimate the size and complexity of something like Chromium. Not every project is fork and work material. reply shiroiushi 10 hours agorootparentWell, a bunch of volunteers seem to have little trouble forking Firefox and creating Pale Moon, Waterfox, LibreWolf, and IceCat. You think a government can't do that? All they have to do really is throw some money to these existing groups. Why do you keep bringing up Chromium anyway? We're talking about Firefox here. reply krige 5 hours agorootparentYes, yes, and now Pale Moon is four years of web development out of date, Waterfox is not really recommended, LibreWolf has some sketchy history and so on. Forking is easy - keeping it updated and secure is hard. reply shiroiushi 16 hours agorootparentprev>Why haven't some EU and/or Latin American countries funded a Web browser in a meaningful way, in an effort to be less under the thumb of US tech companies? As with many things, it's just like Dark Helmet said in Spaceballs: \"Evil will always triumph, because good is dumb.\" Not to say that the US (or Mozilla or Google) is evil and the EU and LATAM are good (LATAM in particular is a really screwed up place, with a few exceptions that aren't as broken like Chile), but while the US obviously has its problems and does really stupid stuff (see the current election), other places do incredibly stupid stuff too (see Germany disarming, shutting down all its nuclear power and trying to make itself dependent on Russian fossil fuel energy). Honestly, I think the main reason the US is still doing as well as it is (see the strength of the USD) is because everyone else is so busy shooting themselves in the foot with a shotgun. So yes, I totally agree: theoretically it should be pretty simple to just fork Firefox (or Chromium, though I think the former is a much better choice so we don't the whole web dependent on a single browser engine, if for no other reason), poach some current devs, hire some new ones locally, and then become the new \"open standard\". But good luck getting some national government (or even a group of them, like with the EU) having some vision and backing such a move. reply emmelaich 15 hours agorootparentNot sure that'd even work. The best developers would get paid a lot more by working for a for-profit company, probably US-based. It's just too tempting. reply neilv 14 hours agorootparentIME, the best developers tend to be genuinely passionate about principles. They aren't necessarily working for Mozilla now, because they can see right through a lot of obviously bad moves Mozilla has made, and ridiculously overpaid executives. \"Go where the biggest paycheck is\" is people who care more about career than mission. Why would you even want those people, unless you can't get the mission ones. reply shiroiushi 15 hours agorootparentprevMaybe, but if you actually want to poach people, you have to make large pay offers to get them to jump ship. So instead of just paying the prevailing rate for SWEs in $country, they need to actually look at how much those devs are making in the US and match that. Sure, it'll be expensive, but if it's only a handful of key people, it doesn't matter. reply aphantastic 14 hours agorootparentprevTrick is to start some sort of commune in Colombia and attract talent with the local amenities. Nice private community full of 10-15 software engineers, private chefs, security, etc would be less than $1-2k/month per person. Maybe turn it into a vacation spot: “tired of your work? Take 6 month sabbatical to come party in LATAM while making meaningful software. Work hard/play hard - apply by linking to the most meaningful PR you have contributed to an FOSS project.” Honestly not a bad plan. reply tcfhgj 15 hours agorootparentprevnot that easy if your money source is your competitor... conflict of interest reply shiroiushi 15 hours agorootparentGoogle being the source of their money did not, in any way, prevent Mozilla from spending their money more wisely and putting some into an endowment. reply kbelder 14 hours agorootparentAnd yet, it did. reply shiroiushi 12 hours agorootparentHow exactly? reply briantakita 15 hours agorootparentprevEither they need to do drastic cuts & focus on fundamentals. Or a fork with less funding entanglements can. Or an alternative project like LadyBird can. reply Loughla 17 hours agoparentprevWhat's wrong with Firefox? It's my daily browser and works great. What am I missing? reply bluGill 17 hours agorootparentThe managemant behind firefox does not care about web browsers. They carre about their vision of social justice and the browser is just a tool to get funds for that. reply Loughla 16 hours agorootparentThat doesn't really have anything to do with how it works though. I was looking more into its actual operation as a browser. reply bluGill 4 hours agorootparentIf management cared about the browser they would have never had this staff in the first place, a similar amount of staff for programming, testing, and marketing their browser would have been effective at making a better browser and getting more market share. reply briantakita 15 hours agorootparentprevI use FF as well. I think the problem is lack of focus on core workflows. This is a problem with all major browsers. For example, why is the address bar so tiny on high resolution screens? One would think this is an easy fix that would improve the UX for many people. Yet years go by with unresolved issues in the trackers. reply tpxl 10 hours agorootparent> For example, why is the address bar so tiny on high resolution screens Because in the year of our lord 2024, we for some reason still don't know how big a pixel is. Making a textbox 1cm tall should be trivial, but is for some reason either impossible or never done. reply bluGill 4 hours agorootparentFor a browser UI 1cm is NEVER a useful measurement. 1cm is useful if you are writing CAD software (which you could write as a web app so firefox should know what 1cm is only for purposes of supporting such web apps), so you can touch a physical part to your monitor and visually verify it fits before having a one off part made to do further verification of your design. For everything else what matters isn't the physical size, but if it is visible, which in turn is a function of how far away the monitor is from your eyeballs and your glasses. My phone, laptop, desktop, and movie room (I don't have all of the above, but someone does) all need different sizes of address bar to be useful. reply briantakita 10 hours agorootparentprevI would be happy to be able to adjust the font size. It's almost as if these orgs don't use their product...or the effort to make this small change would require a major re-architecture. reply trallnag 1 hour agorootparentprevWhat's high resolution for you? I'm using Firefox on a 32 inch 4k display and would not want the address bar to be bigger. Of course I could make it smaller / bigger thanks to Firefox supporting custom CSS reply hackingonempty 12 hours agorootparentprevNow that few people use it, major sites are not just no longer testing on Firefox they are actively blocking it.

    "originBody": "Only 5.3% of welders in the US are women. After years as a writing professor, I became one − here’s what I learned Published: November 5, 2024 8:44am EST Author Jo Mackiewicz Professor of Rhetoric and Professional Communication, Iowa State University Disclosure statement I work for Howe's Welding and Metal Fabrication part-time, as I discuss in my article. Partners Iowa State University provides funding as a member of The Conversation US. View all partners The author welds a headboard. Jo Mackiewicz Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn Although I have a good gig as a full professor at Iowa State University, I’ve daydreamed about learning a trade – something that required both my mind and my hands. So in 2018, I started night courses in welding at Des Moines Area Community College. For three years, I studied different types of welding and during the day worked on a book about the communication between welding teachers and students. I wasn’t the only woman who became interested in trades work during this time. Recognizing the good pay and job security, U.S. women have moved in greater numbers into skilled trades such as welding and fabrication within the past 10 years. From 2017 to 2022, the number of women in trades rose from about 241,000 to nearly 354,000. That’s an increase of about 47%. Even so, women still constitute just 5.3% of welders in the United States. When I received my diploma in welding in May 2022, I’d already found the place I wanted to work: Howe’s Welding and Metal Fabrication. I’d met the owner, Jim Howe, when I visited his three-man shop in Ames, Iowa, in January 2022 for research on a second book about communication in skilled trades. Howe’s shop focuses on repairs and one-off fabrication, not large-scale production of single items. Under Howe’s tutelage, I’ve fabricated skis for the machines that make the rumble strips in the road, shepherd’s hooks for bird feeders, fence poles and stainless-steel lampshade frames. I’ve repaired trailers, wheelchair ramps, office chairs and lawn mowers. Work tables at Howe’s. My table is the one in front with the pans on it. It’s difficult to use the table in the middle because everyone piles parts there. Jo Mackiewicz I fixed the slats on an aluminum lawn chair by bending aluminum strips and TIG welding them to the chair’s sides. Jo Mackiewicz Both my experience at Howe’s and my research at nine other fabrication facilities in Iowa have shown me that – at least for the time being – tradeswomen must find workarounds for commonly encountered challenges. Some of these challenges are physical. These could include being unable to easily reach or move necessary material and tools. Or they could be emotional, such as encountering sexism. As I explore in my forthcoming book, “Learning Skilled Trades in the Workplace,” this is true even in a welcoming environment like Howe’s shop, where I work with a supportive and helpful boss and co-workers. The machine shop at Howe’s houses various lathes, mills and drill presses, as well as other machines. Jo Mackiewicz Questions of competence Being a tradeswoman means being scrutinized for competence. One of the tradeswomen I interviewed for the book told me this story about being tested by more experienced tradesmen: “I remember them tacking together a couple of pieces of metal for me and saying, ‘Okay, I want you to weld a six millimeter weld here and an eight millimeter weld here,’ and I was so nervous because these are the guys that I’m going to work with, and I just was so nervous and I laid down the welds and put my hood up and the guy goes, ‘Well, goddamn, bitch can weld,’ and I was like, ‘Oh my god, thank god.’” I’ve felt this same scrutiny from Howe’s customers. Once, two customers watched me as I used the ironworker to punch ovals in rectangular tubing. I had to step on the pedal to lower the punch, find the indentation of the spot to punch, hold a combination square against the metal to ensure the oblong shape was parallel to the tubing’s edge, step on the pedal and pull the stripper toward me. I could feel my legs turn to jelly as I performed the steps and – as I perceived it – represented the trade competence of all womankind. I’m resentful of these silent evaluations, particularly when I’m learning something new and trying to keep all my fingers. I welded an arm back onto a large umbrella. Jo Mackiewicz Overcoming the environment The standards established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, don’t necessarily account for all the physicality of trades work. On the day Jim told me to bend 20 pieces of ½-inch round stock, I had to use all my weight to pull the Hossfeld bender’s arm to make the S shapes. My boss, Jim Howe, sets up the Hossfeld bender. That’s the same Hossfeld that I’ve used to make parts of lampshade frames, fence stakes and S hooks. Jo Mackiewicz The 20 S hooks would hang on a bar and hold the 18 come-alongs that Jim had accumulated. Tired after I’d finished all the bending, I sighed as Jim told me to hang all the come-alongs on a mobile rack he had bought at auction for just this purpose. I had to squat to pick each one up and use my legs and then arms to lift each to a newly made hook. But I didn’t complain. Stoicism is a workaround to credibility. Making S hooks on the Hossfeld bender wore me out even before I had to hang the come-alongs on them. Jo Mackiewicz Navigating sexist comments My interactions with Howe’s customers have been peppered with low-grade sexism. Trying to determine the reason for my presence, one customer asked me, “Are you the new secretary?” Another man commented on my appearance, comparing me to my co-worker: “You’re better looking than the guy I talked to before.” Such harassment remains common for tradeswomen and ranges from mild, to violent, to just plain creepy, as when one man, paying his bill at the front desk, whispered, “Your hands are dirty.” Women in trades have reported encounters with customers who doubted their competence and who refused to deal with them, seeking a man instead. I made a sign for Ada Hayden Park in Ames, Iowa. The metal stand holds a placard naming the donors who funded a kayak launch. Jo Mackiewicz Some customers at Howe’s fit this pattern. I’ve noticed that if I’m at the front desk with a male co-worker, men will often look past me and address them, even though I’m older and, as far as they know, more experienced. Other customers like to tell me how to do my job. One man, watching me while I cut 8-foot lengths of tubing for him, told me that I could simply hook my tape measure over the saw blade and subtract ⅛-inch to find the correct length. Piqued after I explained why his method wouldn’t work for a precise measurement, he responded by quizzing me on something I wasn’t likely to know: the purpose of the black diamonds on my tape measure. The man in the audience at the academic conference who wants to lecture rather than ask a question of the woman who is the speaker has become a trope. The pontificating metal-shop customer should be, too. Like other tradeswomen, I’ve learned to work around unwanted comments, including uninvited conversations with men bent on signaling their expertise. Tape measures have diamonds every 19 3/16 inches. The diamonds, called truss marks, indicate the correct spacing of engineered floor joists. Jo Mackiewicz Toward greater expertise My soon-to-be-published book doesn’t focus solely or even mostly on my experiences as a woman in a welding and fabrication shop. Rather, it looks at the nonlinear process of learning skilled trades – a process that is, for tradeswomen, sometimes frustrated by scrutiny, physical challenges and sexism, which require workarounds. Nevertheless, along this journey, I’ve leaned on the strength of the tradeswomen before me. Although these women have been “alone in a crowd,” they’ve consistently worked around challenges toward broader and deeper expertise.

After years as a professor, I became one (theconversation.com)188 points by Michelangelo11 18 hours agohidepastfavorite261 comments naming_the_user 17 hours agoWhat comes across from the article to me is the class barrier more than the gender one - basically it's a posh person finding out what the \"real world\" looks like. Shop talk and banter are fairly universal. Any difference is going to be a target. Thin bloke who doesn't look strong enough? Ginger hair? Tall guy, short guy? Weird tattoo, etc. Definitely the one black guy or the one white guy is going to get shit. But is it malicious? Almost certainly not. The other thing, which in my experience is relatively common worldwide, is that working class communities are more accepting of male-female dynamics. In academia and in highbrow society the tendency is to basically sanitise every social interaction. When you're in an environment where that isn't happening then you can't suddenly ignore it any more. reply kardianos 3 hours agoparentA lot of the specifics mentioned in the article aren't specific to her being a woman. Many guys just talk about things differently; they will banter about themselves and how any lady is easier on the eyes then any man. That's not sexism; that's just reality of what a guy thinks and banters about. And an average guy is stronger then the average girl; that's biology. Most guys don't care what sex you are, so long as you can do the work, don't complain much, and can afford banter to make the day go by faster. reply Neil44 3 hours agorootparentI thought similar.

I don't think it would be a struggle. Would it be different? Of course... physical labor is the complete opposite of office work. Would it be harder than sitting in a chair pressing buttons?... sure. But it wouldn't be a struggle. It would be more of a struggle working with people that don't understand what context is or what nuances are. It's not the work or the culture, it's the people. The type that would call you a vagina for wanting water on a hot day to avoid dehydration. Or the boss that will tell you \"you think too much\" when you come to them with an idea that increases productivity. But ya, the work or culture would be a piece of cake to navigate.

There is plenty of low key sexism (and racism) like that among white collars too so it is not restricted to trades (as acknowledged by the article's author), but this goes beyond banter like just teasing someone because they have red hair. reply orwin 8 hours agorootparentI think GP is right though. Real sexism is way more present among middle-class/white-collar workers (whatever their gender is) than between blue collar workers. You will have poorly worded jokes from your coworkers, but the ass-grab or demeaning remarks will always be from managers (the kind of manager who don't know the trade or inherited the job) or customers. reply notahacker 4 hours agorootparentSee, I kind of agree that there are certain types of sexism like assumptions that women won't get their hands dirty or patronising artificial politeness that are purely middle class constructs.

Which is wild. reply orwin 2 hours agorootparentIt is only when someone think they have power over someone else that they allow themselves to be inappropriate on the workplace. My mom was a nurse before forming nurses, and lived through that (from doctors especially). Her best friend was a security guard at diverse places, but she started at a mall (where she has \"wild\" stories as you put it. Confirmed 100% always her manager or customers, once the day manager was put on ice for harassment, his replacement ended the night by touching her butt the day he arrived. Crazy that people do that). But even closer to me, and more recently: i know a woman who work in a call center, and she explained to me the reason why it's always managers on the workplace: the other don't have the time to play powergames with each other, they have too much work (for her it was a female manager who learned of her homosexuality who started to get touchy). I stand by that. Obviously it is different in non-work settings, but at work? reply RHSeeger 2 hours agorootparentMy guess would be that it's less about \"position of power\" and more about \"less likely to face consequences\".

Your link is in absolute units of fatalities, their claim is a rate. At the very least, you need the number of workers (which is also available in BLS data) to refute their claim. The data shows roughly 454k workers in the welders, solderers, and brazers occupation series. With their claim of 3.5 severe injuries per 100 worker-careers, that's about 16k severe injuries. If you assume an average career is about 25 years, that's about 636 severe injuries per year, compared to the 48 fatalities per year. So it's an order of magnitude higher (which I think is the direction most people would expect). reply lazide 1 hour agorootparentthanks for tracking that down! I stand corrected. reply tikhonj 2 hours agorootparentprevEh, the way to actually be safe—not just feel safe—is not to be macho and tough but to be uncompromisingly professional. reply mock-possum 52 minutes agorootparentprevWhy would the risk of either being injured or treating injury require you to be the target of bullying or a bully? Wouldn’t it be in your best interest to be kind and supportive to one another in such a dangerous / difficult environment? That way everyone is happy and confident and focuses on the stresses of the job, not the stress of being bullied or being cajoled into bullying for the sake of conformity? What you’re describing sounds like it really only appeals to a certain kind of person, and I don’t understand how that kind of person makes a better welder. reply AlexandrB 34 minutes agorootparentOn some level, you're describing a difference between traditional male bonding (joking and \"razzing\") and traditional female bonding (being kind and supportive). Both of these can be positive and both can be toxic - bullying is an obvious case, but just ask anyone who has been in a supposedly \"supportive\" environment filled with backstabbing and gossip how nice that is. I don't know why there's a need to define either of these as inferior and wrong - isn't the point of diversity to allow people from different backgrounds to take different approaches? To me, personally, the \"kind, supportive\" style often comes off as insincere. It's actually a barrier to me trusting someone. But I don't know, maybe that's just me. reply brendoelfrendo 1 hour agorootparentprevWhat on earth? Yeah, if I work in a dangerous profession, I want my coworkers to be people I trust, not people who bully me because I stand out.

Still avoiding positive claims, but here are some normative claims: - I object to claiming that mocking is normal and acceptable in all groups of men - some, not all, working class subcultures use mocking as a shibboleth - this aspect of those subcultures is not a thing I think \"we\" should valorize reply mock-possum 51 minutes agorootparentprevSpeak for yourself.

Mockery is not always appropriate, or even truly funny. Mocking others is not an especially important activity or an especially important form of humor.

There’s more of an acknowledgment: that people will be attracted to each other (or not),the status/dating games people play will be out and open. It will be acceptable to talk about physical/sexual qualities of your coworkers, etc. That when you are in physically close proximity you might see each others sexual parts and comment on them. It will be understood that after a breakup people will be less amicable. You can also see this in literature: look at Les Miserables. In the factory they talk about sexual fantasies of the foreman. Whereas in the context of the upper classes it’s talked about in context of love/romanticism. Contrary to popular believe, I find this much healthier. Emotions expressed can be dealt with and moved on. Emotions suppressed grow and fester. If it’s normal to talk about who’s is attracted to who, then everyone is aware of the sexual exploits of the general manager. Therefore people know where to set boundaries.

You don't even need to be inappropriate to have workplace banter. Nobody ever said that a light environment has to be built on jokes that bust chops. In fact, busting chops kind of blows. There's plenty of room for clowning around outside of that, and plenty of ways to build camaraderie, too.

I'm not fully convinced. I have worked with tech dorks that had a sense of humor, and that didn't bring contentious things to the working environment. Is it a lack of wit? I don't know. The more I think about it, the more confused I get, honestly. reply atq2119 3 hours agorootparentThis is an interesting question, so here's a bit of speculation. Banter is a matter of wit. You could call it an intellectual pursuit. Blue collar jobs are primarily not intellectual pursuits. They need their own kind of smarts, but these smarts are relatively orthogonal to the kind of linguistic smarts used in banter, and most importantly the work output itself is not intellectual. There's little chance of the banter directly getting into the work output, and so there's little direct motivation for bosses to police it. Software development is basically entirely an intellectual pursuit that very much overlaps the wit of banter, and banter is likely to leak into the work output. Hence easter eggs are a thing. So, bosses are more likely to want to police banter-adjacent activities, which has a likely chilling effect on banter itself. Another, more recent, factor is that more software development activity is online/remote and therefore lower bandwidth. The subtleties of banter don't convey as well as they would in-person. reply Rinzler89 12 hours agorootparentprev>Man, I'm really sick of the robotic culture of tech. It's such a stuffy bummer.

With regards to camaraderie and banter, I don't even want to talk about world views. I genuinely don't think they matter too much in that context. Really what I'm sick of is just a lack of any attempt to make a connection whatsoever. I don't need to align with a person politically or socially to build a connection and have good workplace banter. There's just such a fundamental unwillingness to do so, in my experience. That's what bugs me. And I know the difference. I've been in both blue collar and white collar environments. Blue collar people look to build the connection and bond together almost immediately, just about every time. There's a period of 'feeling each other out' when you start on a new job or with a new coworker so that they can suss out _how to connect with you_. That's right: it's such a first-class citizen to their working relationships that there's an entire art form to initiating it. Contrasting with the white collar environment... it's almost non-existent, unless you work with people who, ironically, come from blue collar environments. I think it's really sad, and I think we could benefit from being a little looser. I don't think that means we need to drag any contentious topics in, nor do I think it means that we need to drag ourselves into un-professionalism. There's just something to be said for being able to be goofy and chat with coworkers that seems to be lost on the white collar environment. Harmony is the strength and support of all institutions.

My dad and grandfather were both mechanics (not welders, but adjacent) and both contracted very similar bladder cancers most likely from skin exposure to a particular solvent bath chemical. There is no reward for macho or risky behavior, only a painful/miserable death and shorter life, and less time with family. So many male members of my mom's extended family died early from tobacco use and from industrial and agricultural hazards. That means breathing fumes, unknown substances, or fine dust without a respirator (or smoking), not using gloves while handling chemicals/coatings/etc., or putting oneself in mechanically risky situations. TL;DR: Just use PPE.

I think the average demographic here is the standard software engineering team in the US, unfortunately. I hope I'm wrong. There are some high profile HN'ers that are women (e.g. DoreenMichele comes to mind). Fun fact: in eastern Europe (and Russia too?) the gender dynamics of software engineering are much more gender equal compared to the US/EU. Probably other STEM disciplines as well. I'm not sure about welding though. I'm getting a bit side tracked with my thoughts, it's just that I think it ties into bigger issues. I remember once being in a feminism class, as the only male, making a case for getting women into stem and it fell on deaf ears. I think that's also in part because women (and men for that matter) that take feminism classes tend to skew liberal artsy. I just happen to have a liberal artsy side and a STEM side (and a cool feminism teacher that was patient enough for all my naive questions so I felt emotionally safe to take her class). I wish there were more women in the conversation but unfortunately there aren't. The last company I worked for happened to have an equal 50/50 gender split. That was cool. It confirmed what I thought about men and women: ignore gender and focus on personality and their thoughts. I've often been in situations where any form of stereotypes have been thrown out of the window and my last employer was one of them. It's beautiful. Unfortunately, HN seems to be too big for that. The culture needs to shift and I don't have much of a clue how. I think in part it's with how women versus men are socialized here. Boys that are socially excluded tend to go towards computers. Girls don't really seem to be socially excluded that often compared to boys? Just brainstorming, I might be totally off. > Are there actually any women in this conversation? I find many of the comments at YC to be obnoxiously male dominant and condescending, this comment section included. It's been frustrating me for quite a while now. I'm curious how you find them frustrating. When I was reading them, I wasn't quite sure what to think about it. By the way, I've used a throwaway because of my submission to HN, not because of this comment. I thought I was on my pseudonym account.

Indeed. Women are socialized to seek men of higher status as a partner. Thus men feel the need to seek higher status to become an attractive mate. And so men \"infiltrate\" any position that offers a chance at higher status (at least where high pay stands in as a proxy). Likewise, men are socialized to seek women with beauty rather than status, so there is little imperative for women to seek professions of status, but do benefit from careers that will preserve their beauty – so something like welding in a harsh environment that is hard on one's health is not a top choice. That said, the social norms do seem to be changing. It appears the younger generations aren't coupling up so much anymore, and if that trend continues attracting a mate may no longer be a consideration. reply bradjohnson 2 hours agorootparentYou can't just say random garbage and use it to justify a wack conclusion, dude. reply nindalf 2 hours agorootparentThat last line truly took the cake.

Whenever I'm here, I have my brainstorm and science hat on. Nothing more, nothing less. To call HN a tech bro site, it seems to be a bit of an attack and not conductive towards the discussion. I guess the definition of tech bro differs. Also, being a male that doesn't care too much about its own gender, I am probably \"well-suited\" to not care. In my case, I draw the line if they're also into sports (like going to a soccer match or something). Probably others don't. But that's why I have a bit of an issue with words like \"tech bros\". Like, do tech bros even lift? Most don't seem to. The characterization is too vague. > Women do not get paid to be condescended towards That makes sense, and I can imagine how it is experienced as such. It's sad to see. I remember being on a subreddit once and experiencing it the other way (r/womenover30 or something). When I said something I was downvoted. If a woman said the same thing, she wasn't. I can imagine some women feel that a bit here. Perhaps a lot, but my imagination fails there. I get that it sucks. > This community is obnoxiously male and condescending, to put it mildly. What does it mean to be obnoxiously male? I've seen so many different ideas on what it means to be male that I honestly stopped giving a shit about what people mean. It's too confusing, despite me being a hetero cis white male. I guess it's the autism. Whenever it comes to gender (masculinity and femininity) I mostly see rhetorical nonsense (e.g. some people saying that being emotional sensitive is a feminine quality. It is most likely true that more women are like that, but I just find that whole frame of thinking toxic as the word \"femininity\" almost implies it's inherent, which I think is highly debatable - I can go on like that for a while, also about masculinity). Could you be a bit more factual so I can make my own conclusions? I mean, I've been to a feminism class and while that was really useful, I still think the typology is silly. --- That it is seen as condenscending, that depends. With regards to condescending on women in this thread, I see that. I've also seen it to some extent in other threads. But condescending in general? No. I'm not sure if that's what you mean, but you write a little hand wavy at times. I mean, the points you make still stand, but I think they'd stand better without the labeling things so strongly that are clearly a strong interpretation that I don't understand how you get to it. I do get the general vibe of the average Hacker News person when the subject is about dating. Comments tend to steer towards hopelessness, and that particular way of being I found is strongly correlated with being out of touch with how women look at certain things. I get the sense when women write something the average HN commenter has an issue to not look past their own trauma in order to listen to what women are saying.

There is a high proportion of believers in a fantasy meritocracy where current wealth concentration is justifiable due to the sheer genius of \"founders\". This is very much a tech-bro way of thinking. The way HN regularly reduces socio-political problems into a technological gap is another tech-bro \"thing\". When someone suggests that a country switch its currency to crypto to eliminate state corruption, or suggests that biometrics scanners be installed at ports of entry to eliminate slavery and humans rights abuses, that is a tech-bro opinion. It is different from a blue collar environment because the people on this website are extremely insulated from the social issues that come up on here. Nonetheless, they feel like they have an obvious solution to a version of the problem that they've concocted in their head based on a 2 second glance at a headline.

Perhaps I'm picturing the situation wrong, but why wouldn't it work on the precision levels of a tape measure? reply michaelt 33 minutes agoparentThe most obvious reason is if your blade isn't 1/8 inch (3.17mm) thick. If you're cutting with a bandsaw - the blade is a lot thinner than that. And if cutting with a circular saw, the cutting teeth are wider than the main disk of the saw, which complicates matters - and I can't imagine it'd be easy to keep the tape measure hooked on either. And of course - subtract 1/8 inch? Are you sure you don't mean add 1/8 inch? If you're learning a clever new technique, better to practice on some scrap, not do it on a customer's material while they're watching :) At the higher level, saws have no undo function. Cut an expensive bit of metal too short? Someone has to pay $$$ for new material. Buddy on another machine did a load of work on the part before you cut it too short? He's going to have to redo it all. Who'll pay for his time? The stock you cut too short was on a long lead-time or urgent project? You just fucked up the schedule.

It's to account for the width of the tip itself when you're measuring by pushing the tip into a corner, versus measuring by hooking the tip around the edge of your material.

I can think of a few instances where I would have looked past women in trade shops and have made a concerted effort not to, but it was because the value in skilled trades work is more than the transaction. there's a significant and physical trust component involved and also an implied relationship with aspects of reciprocity that come with the work. part of that is assessing whether the person you are dealing with can signal the values to facilitate that trust. tropes about sexism don't capture that nuance. we can talk about sexism from men all day, but for men who are contenders for finding wives and having kids, when young working class women have \"a man whose boss is another woman\" in the top of their selection criteria, you will see guys lining up to welcome women into trades. until then, the stated reasons will seem inconsistent, evasive, and won't bear much scrutiny. what the criticisms and entire worldview of the prof seem to lack is an understanding of human desire. great that she learned a useful skill. not great that she's coopting it to drive a narrative from her institutional background at the expense of men for whom this is their actual livelihood. reply rurban 12 hours agoprevWomen would be much better welders than men, because they don't wear their testicle outside close to the welding area, avoiding the most common welders desease, testicular cancer.

Nov 5th, 2024 4:00am by Rob Pankow Photo by İsmail Enes Ayhan on Unsplash. The tech world has been abuzz with discussions about cloud repatriation, the practice of moving workloads from public clouds back to on-premises or private cloud environments. Recent moves by major enterprises suggest this isn’t just a theoretical discussion but a genuine strategic consideration for some organizations. Two recent high-profile cases have brought cloud repatriation into the spotlight. David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH), the founder of 37signals (the company behind Basecamp and Hey), announced their complete exit from AWS, projecting savings of $2 million annually or over $10 million over five years. Their carefully documented journey has sparked intense debate about cloud economics and infrastructure strategies. In parallel, GEICO, one of the largest automotive insurers in the United States, is actively repatriating many workloads from the cloud as part of a comprehensive architectural overhaul. Rebecca Weekly, GEICO’s VP of Platform and Infrastructure Engineering reveals a sobering reality about their cloud journey: “Ten years into that journey, GEICO still hadn’t migrated everything to the cloud, their bills went up 2.5x, and their reliability challenges went up quite a lot too.” Cloud vs. On-Prem: Comparing Long-Term Costs Cloud Providers Acknowledge the Trend Even cloud providers are recognizing this shift. In a recent UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) hearing, AWS challenged the notion that “once customers move to the cloud, they never return to on-premises.” They pointed to specific examples of customers moving workloads back to on-premises systems, acknowledging customers’ flexibility in their infrastructure choices. Despite hyperscalers’ earnings growing fast, there is a rising concern about the sustainability of that growth. Why Companies Repatriate The experiences of both GEICO and 37signals highlight several factors driving repatriation decisions. Storage costs represent a significant concern, with Weekly noting that “storage in the cloud is one of the most expensive things you can do in the cloud, followed by AI in the cloud.” For 37signals, the mounting costs of running their applications in the cloud became increasingly difficult to justify against the economics of owned infrastructure. Weekly explains that “just running legacy applications in the cloud is prohibitively expensive,” highlighting how lift-and-shift approaches often fail to deliver expected benefits. This resonates with 37signals’ experience, where they found that specific workloads performed more cost-effectively on their infrastructure. TRENDING STORIES Fear of cloud vendor lock-ins emerges as a third major factor. To mitigate that, organizations often spread data across multiple clouds, resulting in increased operational challenges and reliability issues. Managed database services in the cloud present a deceptively complex form of lock-in through their bundled architecture. When using services like AWS RDS or Azure Database, organizations surrender control over their underlying storage infrastructure — it comes pre-packaged with the cloud provider’s storage solutions. This bundling means that even if more cost-effective or higher-performing storage options become available, organizations cannot adopt them without completely restructuring their database architecture. Companies cannot implement custom optimization strategies for storage, compute resources, or data tiering, as all these elements must conform to the service provider’s predetermined configurations. As a result, there is a rising trend of companies self-hosting databases in Kubernetes for complete portability. Context Matters The decision to repatriate workloads demands careful consideration of several crucial factors. Scale and predictability are vital, as organizations with predictable workloads and stable growth patterns may benefit more from owned infrastructure. Engineering capabilities become critical, as companies need substantial in-house expertise to manage on-premises infrastructure effectively. Cloud repatriation is undoubtedly not for start-ups or scale-ups still on their way to profitability or product-market fit. For such companies, the cloud abstracts all the complexity of IT infrastructure and lets their teams focus on the business challenges. Investment capacity also significantly shapes these decisions. As Rebecca Weekly states, “There are ways of doing ‘CapEx-heavy’ in an OpEx-fashion on-prem, and most companies in the financial services space are going to be willing to make CapEx investments over a period of time.” This perspective aligns with 37signals’ approach, which views infrastructure as a long-term investment rather than an ongoing operational expense. Innovation Within Cloud Environments While the cloud repatriation debate often focuses on the binary choice between cloud and on-premises, there’s a third path emerging: staying in the cloud while embracing alternative technologies and architectures. Cloud marketplaces, such as AWS Marketplace, are fostering a new wave of innovation, offering solutions that can dramatically improve performance and cost-efficiency without the complexity of full repatriation. Organizations can now leverage specialized storage solutions, custom-built database engines, and optimized infrastructure tools within their cloud environment. This approach combines the operational benefits of cloud computing with the performance and cost advantages traditionally associated with on-premises deployments. For instance, companies can utilize cloud native NVMe-based storage solutions for their database or implement custom database hosting on cloud compute instances using Kubernetes, all while maintaining the cloud’s scalability and flexibility, avoiding any lock-in. This emerging ecosystem of alternative technologies suggests that the future of cloud computing isn’t just about location but about choosing the right tools and architectures within your chosen environment. Looking Ahead The cloud repatriation trend highlights a maturing understanding of infrastructure strategy. As the experiences of GEICO and 37signals demonstrate, success depends not just on where workloads run but also on having a coherent, well-planned approach to infrastructure management. The future isn’t about choosing between cloud and on-premises but making informed decisions based on specific business needs, workload characteristics, and economic factors. Whether an organization stays in the cloud, moves to on-premises, or adopts a hybrid approach should depend on their unique circumstances rather than following industry trends.

    "commentBody": "Why Companies Are Ditching the Cloud: The Rise of Cloud Repatriation (thenewstack.io)187 points by panrobo 22 hours agohidepastfavorite159 comments jsnell 21 hours agoI don't know that 37Signals counts as a \"major enterprise\". Their Cloud exodus can't have been more than a few dozen servers, right? Meanwhile AWS is growing at 20%/year, Azure at 33% and GCP at 35%. That doesn't seem compatible with any kind of major cloud repatriation trend. reply ksec 8 hours agoparent37signals spends more than $3M a year on cloud. So while it definitely isn't a major enterprise. It is also a lot more than a a few dozen servers. I am not anti-cloud and pro cloud. My major problem with the new trend is that a lot of people are basically rediscovering pre \"Cloud\" era. which is VPS, Dedicated server and Colocation. And people are suggesting Hetzner or OVH or many other players are equivalent to AWS. While I dont disagree AWS is charging a lot for their offering, putting AWS to other services isn't even a valid comparison. Completely ignoring the basics such as Server / CPU / RAM / SSD quality. Network quality such as interconnect, redundancy, as well as Data Center quality. If you rally want to do simple price and spec comparison you might as well go to Lowendbox to find a low cost VPS which some people have been doing since 2008. I really wish there is a middle ground somewhere before using Hyperscalers. Both DO / Linode couldn't reach a larger scale. Hetzner is expanding their Cloud offering only and no dedicated outside EU. reply RateMyPE 6 hours agorootparentYep, Hetzner, OVH or even DO aren't even close to offering what AWS offers. Once you start exploring all the things they have to offer you understand why so many large companies use hyperscalers. Although to be fair, most hobbyists only need basic services like cloud servers/VMs, and hyperscalers like AWS are an awful deal compared to other options if you only need compute + storage + bandwidth. You don't need to use S3, Lambdas and Cloudfront to host a personal blog, a simple VPS will be more than enough. It feels like most devs nowadays prefer using services that abstract away the infrastructure, at the cost of not developing SysOps skills, so I don't see a future where the Cloud is going to lose relevance. reply mbreese 5 hours agorootparent> Hetzner, OVH or even DO aren't even close to offering what AWS offers But I think the argument is - do they need to be? How much of the services of AWS (Google/azure/etc) are really needed by the majority of customers? For companies that need hyperscaling services, I get it. There are definite benefits to the cloud when operating at extremes (auto scaling up and down). But for the majority of workloads, I think you could be well served by a more barebones offering. reply itake 41 minutes agorootparent> are really needed by the majority of customers? Some companies want the space to grow into it. At my job, we just started getting into video decoding. AWS has elastic video processing services. Where as DO would cost way more to setup those services on our own. reply nottorp 3 hours agorootparentprev> Yep, Hetzner, OVH or even DO aren't even close to offering what AWS offers. I think it was mentioned in the article what AWS offers. Lock-in. reply littlestymaar 6 hours agorootparentprev> you understand why so many large companies use hyperscalers. While there are valid use-case where you get value from the extra services the hyperscaller are providing, most of the time people go for AWS “because everybody does it” or because the choice was made by a consulting company that doesn't pay the final cloud bill and is optimizing their own added value at the expenses of the customer's one. I've been doing freelance work for 7 years now for roughly two dozens if companies of various size, and I can't tell you how many massively underused AWS / Azure VPS I've seen, but it's more than half the cloud bills of the said companies (or division for big companies since I obviously only had the vision on the division I worked for and not the whole company). reply kredd 5 hours agorootparentprevI totally agree, but I’ve also worked on a project with 0 customers spending about $2M/year on AWS, and there was absolutely zero incentive from the stakeholders to reduce the cost. There’s a certain disconnect between boots on the ground engineers, and decision makers when it comes to infra management. reply dumbledoren 3 hours agorootparentprev> Server / CPU / RAM / SSD quality I had no issues with Hetzner's component and especially network quality for a decade now. Before that, yeah, there could be some hiccups and issues. But they stopped being issues a long time ago.

Wish we hadn't. Managed to multiply costs 8x (no joke). reply thrw42A8N 7 hours agorootparentNo way that is true if you did it properly. Practically nobody has a workload where this could be true - and it's definitely not a workload smaller than several DCs. It doesn't work out well if you just create some long lived EC2 instances and call it a day. But that's not really using a cloud, just a VPS - and that has indeed never been cheaper than having your own servers. You need to go cloud native if you want to save money. reply kasey_junk 7 hours agorootparentAny egress heavy workload can quickly cost more on cloud than on prem. Especially if you’ve got consistent egress bandwidth that can be negotiated against. reply thrw42A8N 6 hours agorootparentIf it's so heavy that you pay 8x the price of deployment and maintenance of physical servers then you're either very small in which case I'm surprised you don't need the flexibility, or you have many options to make a deal. Don't accept the listed prices. reply kasey_junk 2 hours agorootparentCan I suggest that perhaps I have extensive experience with very large aws deployments and negotiations and stand by what I said. reply thrw42A8N 2 hours agorootparentSorry but this claim makes me seriously question your experience with this particular regard. I'm an AWS partner and this (negotiating better prices) is what we do every week for our clients. There is no way egress causes your costs to 8x compared to on-premise deployment, even if you pay the listed price, and definitely not if you pick up the phone and call the first partner in registry. If you said 2 times I'd think it's overestimated but okay, let's not dwell on details. 3x is bullshit and so is the rest. Perhaps you're comparing apples and oranges - yes, it's possible to do a much less capable on-premise deployment that will obviously cost much less. But if we're comparing comparable - just the internet subscription you'd need in your DC to match the AWS offer in availability, connectivity and stability would make any egress costs pale in comparison. Saying this as someone who used to run a hosting company with 3000 servers before the clouds made it obsolete. And lastly, yes - paying people to do stuff for you usually costs more than time and materials. If you fuck it up, it's up to you to fix it. If AWS fucks it up, you're compensated for it - part of the price are guarantees that are impossible to get with a DIY deployment. Maybe you don't need it, so choose accordingly - a cheaper hosting provider, or even the less capable on premise. But matching the cloud offer all by yourself is not going to be cheaper than the cloud unless you're on AWS scale. reply theamk 1 hour agorootparentThere are so many blogposts about AWS egress being crazy expensive. Here is one: https://www.vantage.sh/blog/cloudflare-r2-aws-s3-comparison . Their example \"image hosting\" has ~$7K for AWS, vs $36 on R2, mostly due to egress costs. Yeah, maybe \"AWS partner\" can give a discount but I bet it'd be 10% for most, or maybe 30% tops. This won't turn $7K into $36. reply thrw42A8N 13 minutes agorootparentCloudflare networking solution doesn't nearly match - and to be fair, they're not trying - what AWS offers. Cloudflare is a small, focused service; AWS is enterprise universal do everything and stay secure&compliant while doing it solution. Don't conflate the two - use whatever is better for your use case, budget/margin, risk profile, reliability requirements etc, but each has some and the price is justified. Ad the linked example - AWS offers Cloudfront as an alternative to Cloudflare. Serving traffic straight from your S3 is wrong. Add Cloudfront and your costs will instantly lower multiple times. AWS tells you this during S3 bucket creation when you try to make it public, btw - it's not hidden. dlisboa 6 hours agorootparentprev> No way that is true if you did it properly. It's quite easier to mess up in a hyperscaling cloud because it's extremely forgiving. In a different setting you wouldn't be able to make as many mistakes and would have to stop the world and fix the issue. reply hggigg 7 hours agorootparentprevIt’s easy. Lift and shift, then fuck it up by not quite completely migrate everything to numerous badly managed kubernetes clusters. That’s what we did. reply tomcam 11 hours agorootparentprevI assume you just run everything on prem and have a high speed up/down connection to the Net? Do you have some kind of AWS/Heroku/Azure -type thing running locally or just use something like Apache or what? reply threeseed 9 hours agorootparentprevBut you have provided zero evidence for any of it. reply WaxProlix 21 hours agoparentprevHow much of that is what technologists would consider \"cloud\" (IAAS, PAAS) versus what someone on the business side of things would consider \"cloud\" - office365, google gsuite, etc? reply tiffanyh 21 hours agorootparentGiven that AWS is doing $100B in annual revenue and still growing at 17% YoY ... and they do NOT have a collaboration suite (office/gsuite) - it'd say at least for AWS it's nearly all IaaS/PaaS. https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/01/amazon_q1_2024/ reply travem 12 hours agorootparentIt may not be as popular but they do have Amazon WorkDocs > Amazon WorkDocs is a document storage, collaboration, and sharing system.

Just curious. I don’t az itself is the largest aws customer anymore. reply gonzo41 21 hours agorootparentprevI'd agree on IaaS/PaaS being the main driver. Id guess that everyone is running away from serverless offerings from all the main cloud providers. It's just day 1 lock in to a platform with no shared standards. It's very uncompetitive and kind of slow to innovate. reply discodave 21 hours agorootparentAmazon loves it when you run idle EC2 instances ($$$) rather than using Lambda. Most real workloads I've seen (at 3 startups, and several teams at Amazon) have utilization under 10%. reply _heimdall 16 hours agorootparentThat's really where you see that no answer is right across the board. I worked at a very small startup years ago that leaned heavily on EC2. Our usage was pretty bipolar, the service was along the lines of a real-time game so we either had a very heavy work load or nothing. We stood up EC2 instances when games were lice and wound them down after. We did use Lambda for a few things, mainly APIs that were rarely used or for processing jobs in an event queue. Serverless has its place for sure, but in my experience it have been heavily over used the last 3-5 years. reply Dylan16807 7 hours agorootparentprevI think the solution to that problem is usually to have fewer and smaller EC2 instances. And you only need to get utilization up to like 15% to make reserved instances significantly better than lambda. reply jiggawatts 20 hours agorootparentprevWe’re migrating over a hundred apps to Azure App Service. One has an issue with the platform-enforced HTTP timeout maximum values. I migrated that app back to a VM in an hour. It turns out that the “integration” for something like App Service (or CloudRun or whatever) is mostly just best practices for any kind of hosting: parameters read from environment variables, immutable binaries with external config, stateless servers, read only web app folders, monitoring with APMs, etc… Sure, you’ll experience lockin if you use Durable Functions or the similar Lambda features… but no worse than any other workflow or business rules platform. Ask people how easy it is to get off BizTalk or MuleSoft… reply kreims 14 hours agorootparentprevI’d suspect there is significant growth of businesses acting as intermediaries for cloud storage. I think that other software providers have also realized that ransoming users data is a great way to extract predictable, hedge-fund-owner-pleasing revenue without performing useful work. AEC software providers all do this. ProjectWise is worse than owning or renting a plain file server in every way I can imagine, yet every consultant in transportation dutifully cuts Bentley a five-figure check or larger every year so they can hold your project files hostage and pretend to develop software. I pray for a merciful asteroid to end it all. reply mr_toad 14 hours agorootparentprevI’ve worked with a few organisations that I’d call “late adopters” to the cloud, and it’s rare for them to use IAAS or even PAAS. It’s all SAAS and serverless, and while they all say they’re doing devops it’s almost always clickops. reply jsnell 21 hours agorootparentprevFor Azure, all of it. Microsoft clumps Azure together with their server software (e.g. Windows Server, SQL Server) licensing when reporting the revenue, but give more fine-grained information on growth rates. This is the latter. (We also know the Azure business was already massive at $34 billion in 2022, since it got revealed during one of Microsoft's ongoing antitrust cases.) For Google, I'm not aware of a reliable way of estimating the GCP vs. Workspace numbers. But they get asked it during earnings calls, and the answer has always been that the GCP growth is substantially faster than the Workspace growth. reply Izikiel43 21 hours agorootparentprevAfaik, MSFT shows growth in Azure and Office as separate things during earning reports, so the % mentioned before is just Azure, and 31% is huge. reply everdrive 3 hours agoparentprevI sincerely doubt 37 signals has \"a few dozen servers.\" Every company I've been in has a huge, sprawling cloud and that no one has governance over. New instances are stood up by individual teams in order to avoid bureaucratic delay, and these propagate indefinitely. reply 1vuio0pswjnm7 18 hours agoparentprev\"In parallel, GEICO, one of the largest automotive insurers in the United States, is actively repatriating many workloads from the cloud as part of a comprehensive architectural overhaul.\" Is GEICO a major enterprise reply adamc 12 hours agorootparentPer google, more than 30,000 employees, so I'd say enterprise-scale, sure. One of the biggest? No, but not tiny or even medium-sized. reply disgruntledphd2 9 hours agorootparentInsurance companies tend to have far more capital than their employee numbers would suggest. Particularly Geico, who are famously cheap. reply wbl 1 hour agorootparent\"Have\" is an interesting word. Much of that capital is covering a bad year in Florida or California. reply panrobo 21 hours agoparentprevaws and other hyperscalers will keep growing, no doubt. Public cloud adoption is at around 20%. So the new companies that migrate into the cloud will keep the growth going. That doesn't deny the fact that some might be repatriating though. Especially ones that couldn't get the benefits out of the cloud. reply windexh8er 14 hours agorootparentOne thing I've seen in every startup I've been in over the last decade is that cloud asset management is relatively poor. Now I'm not certain that enterprise is better or worse, but ultimately when I think back 10+ years ago resources were finite. With that limitation came self-imposed policing of utilization. Looking at cloud infrastructure today it is very easy for organizations to lose sight on production vs frivolous workloads. I happen to work for an automation company that has cloud infrastructure monitoring deployed such that we get notified about the resources we've deployed and can terminate workloads via ChatOps. Even though I know that everyone in the org is continuously nagged about these workloads I still see tons of resources deployed that I know are doing nothing or could be commingled on an individual instance. But, since the cloud makes it easy to deploy we seem to gravitate towards creating a separation of work efforts by just deploying more. This is/was rampant in every organization I've been a part of for the last decade with respect to cloud. The percentage of actual required, production workloads in a lot of these types of accounts is, I'd gather, less than 50% in many cases. And so I really do wonder how many organizations are just paying the bill. I would gather the Big cloud providers know this based on utilization metrics and I wonder how much cloud growth is actually stagnant workloads piling up. reply happymellon 44 minutes agorootparentThe major corps I've worked in that did cloud migrations spent so much time on self-sabotage. Asset management is always poor, but thats half because control over assets ends up being wrestled away from folks by \"DevOps\" or \"SREs\" making K8S operators that just completely fuck up the process. The other half is because they also want \"security controls\" and ensure that all the devs can't see any billing information. How can I improve costs if I can't tell you the deltas between this month and last? reply joshdavham 21 hours agoparentprev> That doesn't seem compatible with any kind of major cloud repatriation trend. Agreed. I don't think this is a real trend, at least not right now. Also, fwiw, I'm really not a fan of these types of articles that identify like a small handful of people or organizations doing something different and calling it a \"trend\". reply weikju 19 hours agorootparentSubmarine like articles trying to create a trend I suppose. reply andrewstuart 11 hours agoparentprev37 Signals has enterprise scale influence in some software development circles.I’m no fan of them but they have it right on this one. Revolutions cannot start huge, they must start small. reply 0xbadcafebee 12 hours agoprevGEICO is moving away from the cloud because their IT is a joke. They had a horrible on-prem infrastructure, so they moved to the cloud not knowing how, and they made the same mistakes in the cloud as on-prem, plus the usual mistakes every cloud migration runs into. They are moving away from the cloud because their new VP's entire career is focused on running her own hardware. What we know about their new setup is absolutely bonkers (like, K8s-on-OpenStack-on-K8s bonkers). Look to them for what not to do. 37signals is like the poster child for NIH syndrome. They keep touting cost savings as the reason for the move, but from what I have gathered, they basically did nothing to save cost in the cloud. It is trivial to save 75% off AWS's list price. They will even walk you through it, they literally want you to save money. That, plus using specific tech in specific ways, allows you to reap major benefits of modern designs while reducing cost more. 37signals didn't seem to want to go that route. But they do love to build their own things, so servers would be a natural thing for them to DIY. Almost every argument against the cloud - cost inefficiency, fear of vendor lock-in, etc - has easy solutions that make the whole thing extremely cost competitive, if not a way better value, than trying to become your own cloud hosting provider. It's very hard to estimate the real world costs, both known and unknown, of DIY hosting (specifically the expertise, or lack of it, and the impacts from doing it wrong, which is very likely to happen if cloud hosting isn't your core business). But it's a 100% guarantee that you will never do it better than AWS. AI is the only place I could reasonably imagine somebody having an on-prem advantage. At the moment, we still live in a world where that hardware isn't a commodity in the way every other server is. So you might just be faster to deploy, or cheaper to buy, with AI gear. Storage is similar but not nearly as tight a market. But that will change eventually once either the hype bubble bursts, or there's more gear for cheaper for the cloud providers to sell. reply darkwater 9 hours agoparent> Almost every argument against the cloud - cost inefficiency, fear of vendor lock-in, etc - has easy solutions that make the whole thing extremely cost competitive, if not a way better value, than trying to become your own cloud hosting provider. It's very hard to estimate the real world costs, both known and unknown, of DIY hosting (specifically the expertise, or lack of it, and the impacts from doing it wrong, which is very likely to happen if cloud hosting isn't your core business) Please define your concept of self-hosting here. Does it mean you need to have your very own DC? Renting a few racks that you fill yourself? Rent CPU, storage and networking, with remote hands and all the bells and whistles? Depending on the scenario it changes dramatically the burden of ownership (at a monetary cost, obviously). And depending on the size of the company and the variability of the workload, it can (or can not) make sense to be on-prem. But being like \"cloud is perfect for everyone and everything, if you tune it well enough\" seems a bit too much black&white to me. reply vidarh 8 hours agoparentprevIt's very easy to estimate the real-world cost of on-prem or dedicated hosting - there is a wide range of providers that will quote you fixed monthly prices to manage it for you (including me) because we know what it costs us to manage various things for you. AI is the only place I don't currently see much on-prem advantage, because buying SOTA equipment is hard, and it gets outdated too quickly. For pretty much everything else, if you can't save 70%+ TCO, maintenance/devops included, over an optimized cloud setup, you're usually doing something very wrong, usually because the system is designed by someone who defaults to \"cloud assumptions\" (slow cores, too little RAM, too little fast storage, resulting in systems that are far more distributed than they need be is the typical issue). reply vbezhenar 10 hours agoparentprevThe main problem with AWS is their outrageous pricing on some aspects like traffic. And some very unexpected pricing nuances which could burn thousands of dollars in a blink of an eye. While AWS engineers are more competent, may be you don't need that much competency to run simple server or two. And expense structure will be more predictable. reply cdchn 11 hours agoparentprev>K8s-on-OpenStack-on-K8s bonkers Do what now??? reply p_l 10 hours agorootparentIt's actually quite reasonable if for bad reasons. TL;DR setting up OpenStack was so horrible I think SAP started deploying it through k8s. So if you want to setup local \"private cloud\" kind of setup it makes sense to set up OpenStack on k8s. If you then want to provide multiple clusters cloud-style to the rest of the organization... well, it's just layered again. In fact, at least one significantly-sized european vendor in on-prem k8s space did exactly that kind of sandwich, to my knowledge. reply viraptor 9 hours agorootparentOpenstack on k8s is basically giving up on openstack on openstack. https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/TripleO You need some kind of orchestration for the control plane. Either you create it from scratch or use something existing. reply karmakaze 21 hours agoprevIt's a short simple post that comes down to this: > Weekly explains that “just running legacy applications in the cloud is prohibitively expensive,” highlighting how lift-and-shift approaches often fail to deliver expected benefits. Yes, if you have a mature business without active development at a scale where compute/storage costs is a substantial accounting line item, then it makes sense to run on hardware that doesn't have the flexibility and cost of the cloud. There is an in-between that makes much more sense for most though. Running on provisioned bare metal. Lots of providers offer this as a better performance/price option where you don't have to deal with provisioning hardware but do everything else from the OS+maintenance and up. At one company we used large bare-metal machine instances provisioned for stable parts of the application architecture (e.g. database and webapp instances) and the cloud for new development where it made sense to leverage capabilities, e.g. DynamoDB with cross-region replication. reply hylaride 21 hours agoparentI can't tell you how often I've run into cloud deployments that were lift-and-shifts, pushed on by bean counters wanting OPEX instead of CAPEX. They then run into actual cashflow expenses, less stability, more complex security (now you get IAM on top of basic networking!), and the ability for one underpaid person to easily do a lot of damage - because you're certainly not going to hire top-tier cloud talent - these are bean counters running things after all. It makes it really clear why you so many data leaks via badly configured s3 buckets of dynamo tables... reply maccard 10 hours agorootparentIt’s a bit naive to think that this sort of an org went from hiring top tier sysadmin staff to bottom of the barrel developers for cloud dev. It’s likely they were a thundering mess when they managed their own hardware too. reply coredog64 15 hours agoparentprevVery large mature businesses that don’t see IT as a core function have probably outsourced management to a third party. There’s not much daylight between that third party’s margin and just paying a hyperscaler. reply efitz 21 hours agoprevThere are certain workloads that have never been really economical to run in cloud. Cloud economics is based on multi-tenancy, eg if you have a lot of hardware that is sitting idle a lot of the time, then cloud may be economical for you as the cloud provider can share it between you and others. Cloud is also good for episodic use of expensive exotic systems like HPC and GPU fleets, if you don’t need them all the time- I call this serial multi-tenancy. Cloud is not economical for massive storage, especially if you’re not willing to use backup solutions and reduced availability. For example, AWS S3 default keeps multiple copies of uploaded data; this is not comparable to typical on-premises RAID 1 or RAID 3. You can save money with reduced redundancy storage but then you have to take on more of the reliability burden. Likewise compute is cheap if you’re buying multi-tenant instances, but if you want dedicated instances or bare metal, then the economics aren’t nearly as attractive. Cloud is also good for experimentation and rapid development - it’s so much faster to click a few buttons than to go through the hardware acquisition processes at many enterprises. The companies that regret cloud due to financial concerns usually make two mistakes. First, as noted above, they pay for premium services that are not directly comparable to on-prem, or they use workloads in cloud that are not cloud economical, or both. Second, they don’t constrain random usage enough. It is super easy for a developer doing some testing to spin up thousands of dollars of bill. And it’s even worse if they leave it at the end of the day and go home- it’s still racking up hourly usage. And it’s downright ugly if they forget it and move on to something else. You have to be super disciplined to not spin up more than you need and turn it off as soon as you’re done with it. reply cyberax 20 hours agoparent> but if you want dedicated instances or bare metal Multitenant instances on AWS statically partition the hardware (CPU, RAM, network), so tenants don't really share all that much. Memory bandwidth is probably the only really affected resource. > Second, they don’t constrain random usage enough. AWS now has billing alerts with per-hour resolution and automatic anomaly detection. There are third-party tools that do the same. reply efitz 13 hours agorootparent> Multitenant instances on AWS statically partition the hardware (CPU, RAM, network), so tenants don't really share all that much. You are missing several points: First, density. Cloud providers have huge machines that can run lots of VMs, and AWS in particular uses hardware (”Nitro”) for hypervisor functionality so they have very low overhead. Cloud providers also don’t do “hardware” partitioning for many instance types. AWS sells “VCPUs” as the capacity unit; this is not necessarily a core, it may be time on a core. Cloud providers can also over-provision; like airlines can sell more seats than exist on a plane, cloud providers can sell more VCPUs than cores on a machine, assuming (correctly) that the vast majority of instances will be idle most of the time, and they can manage noisy neighbors via live migration. And lots of other more esoteric stuff. reply cyberax 12 hours agorootparent> Cloud providers can also over-provision But they don't. AWS overprovisions only on T-type instances (T3,T4,T5). The rest of the instance types don't share cores or memory between tenants. I know, I worked with the actual AWS hardware at Amazon :) AWS engineers have always been pretty paranoid about security, so they limit the hardware sharing between tenants as much as possible. For example, AWS had been strictly limiting hyperthreading and cache sharing even before the SPECTRE/Meltdown. AWS doesn't actually charge any premium for the bare metal instance types (the ones with \".metal\" in the name). They just cost a lot because they are usually subdivided into many individual VMs. For example, c6g.metal is $2.1760 per hour, and c6g.16xlarge is the same $2.1760. c6g.4xlarge is $0.5440 > And lots of other more esoteric stuff. Not really. They had some plans for more esoteric stuff, but anything more complicated than EC2 Spot does not really have a market demand. Customers prefer stability. EC2 and other foundational services like EBS and VPC are carefully designed to stay stable if the AWS control plane malfunctions (\"static stability\"). reply coredog64 15 hours agoparentprevS3 has two more cost saving dimensions: How long will you commit to storing these exact bytes and how long are you willing to wait to get them.

Turns out someone had pushed the big red stop button, which remains pushed in until reset. That would have been a major problem if we'd had a nighttime power outage. After that we ran regular switchover testing :) The other time we ran into trouble was after someone drove a car into the local power substation. Our systems all ran fine for the immediate outage, but the power company's short term fix was to re-route power, which caused our voltage to be low enough for our UPS batteries to slowly drain without tripping over to the generator. That was a week or two of manually pumping diesel into the generator tank so we could keep the UPS batteries topped up. reply roydivision 11 hours agorootparentprevI have, and least power. I worked in a DC with 4 very large diesel generators, each backed up by a multi-ton flywheel that managed the transition between a power cut and the generators taking over.

The first saves us hundreds of thousands in skilled labor and the second lets us take on new customers with thousands of agents in a matter of days without having to provision in advance. reply packetlost 20 hours agorootparent1) You may more than pay for that labor in cloud costs, but you can also pretty easily operate rented dedicated hardware with a 3-man team if they know how to do it, the tools to scale are there they're just different. 2) I don't know what your setup looks like, but renting a dedicated server off of Hetzner takes a few minutes, maybe hours at most. My personal opinion is that most workloads that have a load balancer anyways would be best suited to a mix of dedicated/owned infrastructure for baseline operation and dynamic scaling to a cloud for burst. The downsides to that approach are it requires all of skillset A (systems administration, devops) and some amount of skillset B (public cloud), and the networking constraints can be challenging depending on how state is managed. reply Salgat 12 hours agorootparentJust to clarify, AWS lets you provision bare-metal too if your goal is to just rent hardware someone else is maintaining.

You need to handle power outages, need redundant internet connections, ect, ect. reply kuon 16 hours agorootparentYes, but for example a 10Gbit/s pipe is about 3PB of transfer capacity per month which is about 150 000$/month in S3 traffic. A 40kW UPS which can handle about 2 racks (2x42U) of high density servers, with a generator cost about 50k$. A redundant link with your own AS so you can BGP should cost about 5k$ per month (at least here in switzerland). Of course it really depends on the application, but if you host something like a streaming video service where bandwidth is the main factor, you can quickly reach a point where self hosting is cheaper. reply viraptor 9 hours agorootparent10Gbps is one \"teen with a stolen credit card\" DDoS event away from being unusable.

Pretty much every price advantage comes from using the fact that the cloud provider absorbs the cost of idle resources instead of you. So you either adopt serverless patterns (the kind of serverless that means scale to zero and pay nothing when you do) or you adopt auto-scaling, where you shut down instances when traffic is lower, to minimize idle time. Or both. reply JackSlateur 6 hours agorootparentprevlift & shift = move your instances, which are expensive and not at all competitive cloud native = use more serverless products (pay as you go with no base price) For instance, one could implement internal DNS using instance which run bind, and connect everything through some VPC, and put a load balancer in front of the instances. One could also rework its DNS architecture and use route53, with private hosted zones associated with all the appropriate VPCs Another real example: one could have hundreds of instance running gitlab runners, running all day, waiting for some job to do. One could put those gitlab runners into an autoscaled kubernetes, where nodes are added when there are lots of jobs, and deleted afterwards. One could even run the gitlab runners on Fargate, where a pod is created for each job, to run that job and then exit. No job = no pod = no money spent. Of course, some work is required to extract the best value of cloud providers. If you use only instances, well, surprise: it costs a lot, and you still have to manage lots of stuff. reply maccard 5 hours agorootparentI ran our CI on fargate at my last job. It was a mess. The time from api request for an instance to it being ready to handle a job was minutes. It was about 50x slower than running on a mid range laptop that I occasionally used for development, and in order to work around that we kept hot EBS volumes of caches around (which cost $$$$ and a decent amount of developer time). Just before I left I was investigating using hetzner instead - our compute bill would have been about 15% cheaper, we would have had no cache storage costs (which was about 5x our compute costs), and the builds would have finished before fargate had processed the request. Our numbers were small fry, but we spent more on that CI system than we did on every other part of our infra combined. reply kjellsbells 5 hours agorootparentprevOf course, while this move to cloud native, along the path from IaaS to PaaS to SaaS, saves money on one dimension, it also binds the customer more and more immovably to the cloud vendor... reply tg180 10 hours agorootparentprevIn simple terms, yes. The term “native” refers to adopting the vendor’s technology stack, which typically includes managed data stores, containerized microservices, serverless functions, and immutable infrastructure. reply Agingcoder 2 hours agorootparentThanks. I work for a very large org, and cloud benefits are not obvious to me ( ie we’re large enough to absorb the cost of a team managing k8s for everyone, another team managing our own data centers around the world etc ). I view cloud as mutualizing costs and expertise with other people ( engineers and infra), but adding a very hefty margin on top of it, along with vendor lockin. If you’re big enough to mutualize internally, or don’t need some of the specific ultra scale cloud products, it’s not an obvious fit to me ( in particular , you don’t want to pay the margin ) I understand that for a significant chunk of people it’s useful provided that they use as many mutualizing levers as possible which is what going native is about. Is my understanding correct ? reply fancythat 11 hours agoprevI will use an opportunity to confirm that cloud is ill-suited for almost all but niche business cases and majority of users were dragged into cloud platforms either by free credits or (my suspicion) some grey kick-back schemes with C-level guys. At my current project (Fortune 500 saas company, was there for both on-prem to cloud and then cloud-to-cloud migration): a) Resources are terribly expensive. Usual tricks you find online (spot instances) usually cannot be applied for some specific work related reason. In our estimates, in contrast to even the hw/sw list-prices, cloud is 5x-10x more expensive, of course depending on the features you are planning to use. b) There is always a sort of \"direction\" cloud provider pushes you into: in my case, costs between VMs and Kubernetes are so high, we get almost weekly demands to make the conversion, even though Kubernetes for some of the scenarios we have don't make any sense. c) Even though we are spending 6 figures, now maybe even 7 figures on the infrastructure monthly, priority support answer that we receive are borderline comical and in-line with one response we received when we asked why our DB service was down, quote: \"DB has experienced some issues so it was restarted.\" d) When we were having on-prem, some new features asked from ops side, were usually implemented / investigated in a day or so. Nowadays, in most cases, answers are available after week or so of investigation, because each thing has its own name and lingo with different cloud providers. This can be solved with specific cloud certifications, but in real-world, we cannot pause the business for 6 months until all ops are completely knowledgeable about all inner workings of the currently popular cloud provider. e) Performance is atrocious at times. That multi-tenancy some guys are mentioning here is for provider's benefit not for the customer. They cram ungodly amount of workload on machines, that mostly works, until it doesn't and when it does not, effects are catastrophic. Yes, you can have isolation and dedicated resources, but a) f) Security and reliability features are overly exaggerated. From the observable facts, in the last year, we had 4 major incidents lasting several hours strictly related to the platform (total connectivity failure, total service failure, complete loss of one of the sites, etc).

Timothy B Lee Nov 05, 2024 90 Share this post Why the deep learning boom caught almost everyone by surprise www.understandingai.org Copy link Facebook Email Note Other 10 6 Share During my first semester as a computer science graduate student at Princeton, I took COS 402: Artificial Intelligence. Toward the end of the semester there was a lecture about neural networks. This was in the fall of 2008, and I got the distinct impression—both from that lecture and the textbook—that neural networks had become a backwater. Neural networks had delivered some impressive results in the late 1980s and early 1990s. But then progress stalled. By 2008, many researchers had moved on to mathematically elegant approaches such as support vector machines. I didn’t know it at the time, but a team at Princeton—in the same computer science building where I was attending lectures—was working on a project that would upend the conventional wisdom and demonstrate the power of neural networks. That team, led by Prof. Fei-Fei Li, wasn’t working on a better version of neural networks. They were hardly thinking about neural networks at all. Rather, they were creating a new image dataset that would be far larger than any that had come before: 14 million images, each labeled with one of nearly 22,000 categories. Fei-Fei Li speaking at a Clinton Global Initiative meeting in September. (Photo by Craig Barritt/Getty Images for Clinton Global Initiative) Li tells the story of ImageNet in her recent memoir, The Worlds I See. As she worked on the project, she faced a lot of skepticism from friends and colleagues. “I think you’ve taken this idea way too far,” a mentor told her a few months into the project in 2007. “The trick is to grow with your field. Not to leap so far ahead of it.” It wasn’t just that building such a large dataset was a massive logistical challenge. People doubted the machine learning algorithms of the day would benefit from such a vast collection of images. “Pre-ImageNet, people did not believe in data,” Li said in a September interview at the Computer History Museum. “Everyone was working on completely different paradigms in AI with a tiny bit of data.” Ignoring negative feedback, Li pursued the project for more than two years. It strained her research budget and the patience of her graduate students. When she took a new job at Stanford in 2009, she took several of those students—and the ImageNet project—with her to California. ImageNet received little attention for the first couple of years after its release in 2009. But in 2012, a team from the University of Toronto trained a neural network on the ImageNet dataset, achieving unprecedented performance in image recognition. That groundbreaking AI model, dubbed AlexNet after lead author Alex Krizhevsky, kicked off the deep learning boom that has continued until the present day. AlexNet would not have succeeded without the ImageNet dataset. AlexNet also would not have been possible without a platform called CUDA that allowed Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) to be used in non-graphics applications. Many people were skeptical when Nvidia announced CUDA in 2006. So the AI boom of the last 12 years was made possible by three visionaries who pursued unorthodox ideas in the face of widespread criticism. One was Geoffrey Hinton, a University of Toronto computer scientist who spent decades promoting neural networks despite near-universal skepticism. The second was Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, who recognized early that GPUs could be useful for more than just graphics. The third was Fei-Fei Li. She created an image dataset that seemed ludicrously large to most of her colleagues. But it turned out to be essential for demonstrating the potential of neural networks trained on GPUs. Subscribe Geoffrey Hinton A neural network is a network of thousands, millions, or even billions of neurons. Each neuron is a mathematical function that produces an output based on a weighted average of its inputs. Suppose you want to create a network that can identify handwritten decimal digits like the number two in the red square above. Such a network would take in an intensity value for each pixel in an image and output a probability distribution over the ten possible digits—0, 1, 2, and so forth. To train such a network, you first initialize it with random weights. Then you run it on a sequence of example images. For each image, you train the network by strengthening the connections that push the network toward the right answer (in this case, a high probability value for the “2” output) and weakening connections that push toward a wrong answer (a low probability for “2” and high probabilities for other digits). If trained on enough example images, the model should start to predict a high probability for “2” when shown a two—and not otherwise. In the late 1950s, scientists started to experiment with basic networks that had a single layer of neurons. However, their initial enthusiasm cooled as they realized that such simple networks lacked the expressive power required for complex computations. Deeper networks—those with multiple layers—had the potential to be more versatile. But in the 1960s, no one knew how to train them efficiently. This was because changing a parameter somewhere in the middle of a multi-layer network could have complex and unpredictable effects on the output. So by the time Hinton began his career in the 1970s, neural networks had fallen out of favor. Hinton wanted to study them, but he struggled to find an academic home to do so. Between 1976 and 1986, Hinton spent time at four different research institutions: Sussex University, the University of California San Diego (UCSD), a branch of the UK Medical Research Council, and finally Carnegie Mellon, where he became a professor in 1982. Geoffrey Hinton speaking in Toronto in June. (Photo by Mert Alper Dervis/Anadolu via Getty Images) In a landmark 1986 paper, Hinton teamed up with two of his former colleagues at UCSD, David Rumelhart and Ronald Williams, to describe a technique called backpropagation for efficiently training deep neural networks. Their idea was to start with the final layer of the network and work backwards. For each connection in the final layer, the algorithm computes a gradient—a mathematical estimate of whether increasing the strength of that connection would push the network toward the right answer. Based on these gradients, the algorithm adjusts each parameter in the model’s final layer. The algorithm then propagates these gradients backwards to the second-to-last layer. A key innovation here is a formula—based on the chain rule from high school calculus—for computing the gradients in one layer based on gradients in the following layer. Using these new gradients, the algorithm updates each parameter in the second-to-last layer of the model. Then the gradients get propagated backwards to the third-to-last layer and the whole process repeats once again. The algorithm only makes small changes to the model in each round of training. But as the process is repeated over thousands, millions, billions, or even trillions of training examples, the model gradually becomes more accurate. Hinton and his colleagues weren’t the first to discover the basic idea of backpropagation. But their paper popularized the method. As people realized it was now possible to train deeper networks, it triggered a new wave of enthusiasm for neural networks. Hinton moved to the University of Toronto in 1987 and began attracting young researchers who wanted to study neural networks. One of the first was the French computer scientist Yann LeCun, who did a year-long postdoc with Hinton before moving to Bell Labs in 1988. Hinton’s backpropagation algorithm allowed LeCun to train models deep enough to perform well on real-world tasks like handwriting recognition. By the mid-1990s, LeCun’s technology was working so well that banks started to use it for processing checks. “At one point, LeCun’s creation read more than 10 percent of all checks deposited in the United States,” wrote Cade Metz in his 2022 book Genius Makers. But when LeCun and other researchers tried to apply neural networks to larger and more complex images, it didn’t go well. Neural networks once again fell out of fashion, and some researchers who had focused on neural networks moved on to other projects. Hinton never stopped believing that neural networks could outperform other machine learning methods. But it would be many years before he’d have access to enough data and computing power to prove his case. Jensen Huang Jensen Huang speaking in Denmark in October. (Photo by MADS CLAUS RASMUSSEN/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images) The brains of every personal computer is a central processing unit (CPU). These chips are designed to perform calculations in order, one step at a time. This works fine for conventional software like Windows and Office. But some video games require so many calculations that they strain the capabilities of CPUs. This is especially true of games like Quake, Call of Duty, and Grand Theft Auto that render three-dimensional worlds many times per second. So gamers rely on GPUs to accelerate performance. Inside a GPU are many execution units—essentially tiny CPUs—packaged together on a single chip. During gameplay, different execution units draw different areas of the screen. This parallelism enables better image quality and higher frame rates than would be possible with a CPU alone. Nvidia invented the GPU in 1999 and has dominated the market ever since. By the mid-2000s, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang suspected that the massive computing power inside a GPU would be useful for applications beyond gaming. He hoped scientists could use it for compute-intensive tasks like weather simulation or oil exploration. So in 2006, Nvidia announced the CUDA platform. CUDA allows programmers to write “kernels,” short programs designed to run on a single execution unit. Kernels allow a big computing task to be split up into bite-sized chunks that can be processed in parallel. This allows certain kinds of calculations to be completed far faster than with a CPU alone. But there was little interest in CUDA when it was first introduced, wrote Steven Witt in the New Yorker last year: When CUDA was released, in late 2006, Wall Street reacted with dismay. Huang was bringing supercomputing to the masses, but the masses had shown no indication that they wanted such a thing. “They were spending a fortune on this new chip architecture,” Ben Gilbert, the co-host of “Acquired,” a popular Silicon Valley podcast, said. “They were spending many billions targeting an obscure corner of academic and scientific computing, which was not a large market at the time—certainly less than the billions they were pouring in.” Huang argued that the simple existence of CUDA would enlarge the supercomputing sector. This view was not widely held, and by the end of 2008 Nvidia’s stock price had declined by seventy per cent… Downloads of CUDA hit a peak in 2009, then declined for three years. Board members worried that Nvidia’s depressed stock price would make it a target for corporate raiders. Huang wasn’t specifically thinking about AI or neural networks when he created the CUDA platform. But it turned out that Hinton’s backpropagation algorithm could easily be split up into bite-sized chunks. And so training neural networks turned out to be a killer app for CUDA. According to Witt, Hinton was quick to recognize the potential of CUDA: In 2009, Hinton’s research group used Nvidia’s CUDA platform to train a neural network to recognize human speech. He was surprised by the quality of the results, which he presented at a conference later that year. He then reached out to Nvidia. “I sent an e-mail saying, ‘Look, I just told a thousand machine-learning researchers they should go and buy Nvidia cards. Can you send me a free one?’ ” Hinton told me. “They said no.” Despite the snub, Hinton and his graduate students, Alex Krizhevsky and Ilya Sutskever, obtained a pair of Nvidia GTX 580 GPUs for the AlexNet project. Each GPU had 512 execution units, allowing Krizhevsky and Sutskever to train a neural network hundreds of times faster than would be possible with a CPU. This speed allowed them to train a larger model—and to train it on many more training images. And they would need all that extra computing power to tackle the massive ImageNet dataset. Subscribe Fei-Fei Li Fei-Fei Li at the SXSW conference in 2018. (Photo by Hubert Vestil/Getty Images for SXSW) Fei-Fei Li wasn’t thinking about either neural networks or GPUs as she began a new job as a computer science professor at Princeton in January of 2007. While earning her PhD at Caltech, she had built a dataset called Caltech 101 that had 9,000 images across 101 categories. That experience had taught her that computer vision algorithms tended to perform better with larger and more diverse training datasets. Not only had Li found her own algorithms performed better when trained on Caltech 101, other researchers started training their models using Li’s dataset and comparing their performance to one another. This turned Caltech 101 into a benchmark for the field of computer vision. So when she got to Princeton, Li decided to go much bigger. She became obsessed with an estimate by vision scientist Irving Biederman that the average person recognizes roughly 30,000 different kinds of objects. Li started to wonder if it would be possible to build a truly comprehensive image dataset—one that included every kind of object people commonly encounter in the physical world. A Princeton colleague told Li about WordNet, a massive database that attempted to catalog and organize 140,000 words. Li called her new dataset ImageNet, and she used WordNet as a starting point for choosing categories. She eliminated verbs and adjectives as well as intangible nouns like “truth.” That left a list of 22,000 countable objects, ranging from ambulance to zucchini. She planned to take the same approach she’d taken with the Caltech 101 dataset: use Google’s image search to find candidate images, then have a human being verify them. For the Caltech 101 dataset, Li had done this herself over the course of a few months. This time she would need more help. She planned to hire dozens of Princeton undergraduates to help her choose and label images. But even after heavily optimizing the labeling process—for example, pre-downloading candidate images so they’re instantly available for students to review—Li and her graduate student, Jia Deng, calculated it would take more than 18 years to select and label millions of images. The project was saved when Li learned about Amazon Mechanical Turk, a crowdsourcing platform Amazon had launched a couple of years earlier. Not only was AMT’s international workforce more affordable than Princeton undergraduates, the platform was far more flexible and scalable. Li’s team could hire as many people as they needed, on demand, and pay them only as long as they had work available. AMT cut the time needed to complete ImageNet down from 18 to two years. Li writes that her lab spent two years “on the knife-edge of our finances” as they struggled to complete the ImageNet project. But they had enough funds to pay three people to look at each of the 14 million images in the final data set. ImageNet was ready for publication in 2009, and Li submitted it to the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, which was held in Miami that year. Their paper was accepted, but it didn’t get the kind of recognition Li hoped for. “ImageNet was relegated to a poster session,” Li writes. “This meant that we wouldn’t be presenting our work in a lecture hall to an audience at a predetermined time, but would instead be given space on the conference floor to prop up a large-format print summarizing the project in hopes that passersby might stop and ask questions… After so many years of effort, this just felt anticlimactic.” To generate public interest, Li turned ImageNet into a competition. Realizing that the full dataset might be too unwieldy to distribute to dozens of contestants, she created a much smaller (but still massive) dataset with 1,000 categories and 1.4 million images. The first year’s competition in 2010 generated a healthy amount of interest, with 11 teams participating. The winning entry was based on support vector machines. Unfortunately, Li writes, it was “only a slight improvement over cutting-edge work found elsewhere in our field.” The second year of the ImageNet competition attracted fewer entries than the first. The winning entry in 2011 was another support vector machine, and it just barely improved on the performance of the 2010 winner. Li started to wonder if the critics had been right. Maybe “ImageNet was too much for most algorithms to handle.” “For two years running, well-worn algorithms had exhibited only incremental gains in capabilities, while true progress seemed all but absent,” Li writes. “If ImageNet was a bet, it was time to start wondering if we’d lost.” But when Li reluctantly staged the competition a third time in 2012, the results were totally different. Geoff Hinton’s team was the first to submit a model based on a deep neural network. And its top-5 accuracy was 85 percent—10 percentage points better than the 2011 winner. Li’s initial reaction was incredulity: “Most of us saw the neural network as a dusty artifact encased in glass and protected by velvet ropes.” “This is proof” Yann LeCun testifying before a Senate committee in September. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) The ImageNet winners were scheduled to be announced at the European Conference on Computer Vision in Florence, Italy. Li, who had a baby at home in California, was planning to skip the event. But when she saw how well AlexNet had done on her dataset, she realized this moment would be too important to miss: “I settled reluctantly on a twenty-hour slog of sleep deprivation and cramped elbow room.” On an October day in Florence, Alex Krizhevsky presented his results to a standing-room-only crowd of computer vision researchers. Fei-Fei Li was in the audience. So was Yann LeCun. Cade Metz reports that after the presentation, LeCun stood up and called AlexNet “an unequivocal turning point in the history of computer vision. This is proof.” The success of AlexNet vindicated Hinton’s faith in neural networks, but it was arguably an even bigger vindication for LeCun. AlexNet was a convolutional neural network, a type of neural network that LeCun had developed 20 years earlier to recognize handwritten digits on checks. (For more details on how CNNs work, see the in-depth explainer I wrote for Ars Technica in 2018.) Indeed, there were few architectural differences between AlexNet and LeCun’s image recognition networks from the 1990s. AlexNet was simply far larger. In a 1998 paper, LeCun described a document recognition network with seven layers and 60,000 trainable parameters. AlexNet had eight layers, but these layers had 60 million trainable parameters. LeCun could not have trained a model that large in the early 1990s because there were no computer chips with as much processing power as a 2012-era GPU. Even if LeCun had managed to build a big enough supercomputer, he would not have had enough images to train it properly. Collecting those images would have been hugely expensive in the years before Google and Amazon Mechanical Turk. And this is why Fei-Fei Li’s work on ImageNet was so consequential. She didn’t invent convolutional networks or figure out how to make them run efficiently on GPUs. But she provided the training data that large neural networks needed to reach their full potential. The technology world immediately recognized the importance of AlexNet. Hinton and his students formed a shell company with the goal to be “acquihired” by a big tech company. Within months, Google purchased the company for $44 million. Hinton worked at Google for the next decade while retaining his academic post in Toronto. Ilya Sutskever spent a few years at Google before becoming a cofounder of OpenAI. AlexNet also made Nvidia GPUs the industry standard for training neural networks. In 2012, the market valued Nvidia at less than $10 billion. Today, Nvidia is one of the most valuable companies in the world, with a market capitalization north of $3 trillion. That high valuation is driven mainly by overwhelming demand for GPUs like the H100 that are optimized for training neural networks. Subscribe Sometimes the conventional wisdom is wrong “That moment was pretty symbolic to the world of AI because three fundamental elements of modern AI converged for the first time,” Li said in a September interview at the Computer History Museum. “The first element was neural networks. The second element was big data, using ImageNet. And the third element was GPU computing.” Today leading AI labs believe the key to progress in AI is to train huge models on vast data sets. Big technology companies are in such a hurry to build the data centers required to train larger models that they’ve started to lease out entire nuclear power plants to provide the necessary power. You can view this as a straightforward application of the lessons of AlexNet. But I wonder if we ought to draw the opposite lesson from AlexNet: that it’s a mistake to become too wedded to conventional wisdom. “Scaling laws” have had a remarkable run in the 12 years since AlexNet, and perhaps we’ll see another generation or two of impressive results as the leading labs scale up their foundation models even more. But we should be careful not to let the lessons of AlexNet harden into dogma. I think there’s at least a chance that scaling laws will run out of steam in the next few years. And if that happens, we’re going to need a new generation of stubborn nonconformists to notice that the old approach isn’t working and try something different.

But really it was three academics. Jensen Huang, reasonably, was desperate for any market that could suck up more compute, which he could pivot to from GPUs for gaming when gaming saturated its ability to use compute. Screen resolutions and visible polygons and texture maps only demand so much compute; it's an S-curve like everything else. So from a marketing/market-development and capital investment perspective I do think he deserves credit. Certainly the Intel guys struggled to similarly recognize it (and to execute even on plain GPUs.) But... the technical/academic insight of the CUDA/GPU vision in my view came from Ian Buck's \"Brook\" PhD thesis at Stanford under Pat Hanrahan (Pixar+Tableau co-founder, Turing Award Winner) and Ian promptly took it to Nvidia where it was commercialized under Jensen. For a good telling of this under-told story, see one of Hanrahan's lectures at MIT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk4fvqaOqv4 Corrections welcome. reply markhahn 1 hour agoparentJensen embraced AI as a way to recover TAM after ASICs took over crypto mining. You can see that between-period in NVidia revenue and profit graphs. By that time, GP-GPU had been around for a long, long time. CUDA still doesn't have much to do with AI - sure, it supports AI usage, even includes some AI-specific features (low-mixed precision blocked operations). reply cameldrv 40 minutes agorootparentJensen embraced AI way before that. CuDNN was released back in 2014. I remember being at ICLR in 2015, and there were three companies with booths: Google and Facebook who were recruiting, and NVIDIA was selling a 4 GPU desktop computer. reply dartos 4 minutes agorootparentWell as soon as matmul has a marketable use (ML predictive algorithms) nvidia was on top of it. I don’t think they were thinking of LLMs in 2014, tbf. reply aithrowawaycomm 7 hours agoprevI think there is a slight disconnect here between making AI systems which are smart and AI systems which are useful. It’s a very old fallacy in AI: pretending tools which assist human intelligence by solving human problems must themselves be intelligent. The utility of big datasets was indeed surprising, but that skepticism came about from recognizing the scaling paradigm must be a dead end: vertebrates across the board require less data to learn new things, by several orders of magnitude. Methods to give ANNs “common sense” are essentially identical to the old LISP expert systems: hard-wiring the answers to specific common-sense questions in either code or training data, even though fish and lizards can rapidly make common-sense deductions about manmade objects they couldn’t have possibly seen in their evolutionary histories. Even spiders have generalization abilities seemingly absent in transformers: they spin webs inside human homes with unnatural geometry. Again it is surprising that the ImageNet stuff worked as well as it did. Deep learning is undoubtedly a useful way to build applications, just like Lisp was. But I think we are about as close to AGI as we were in the 80s, since we have made zero progress on common sense: in the 80s we knew Big Data can poorly emulate common sense, and that’s where we’re at today. reply j_bum 6 hours agoparent> vertebrates across the board require less data to learn new things, by several orders of magnitude. Sometimes I wonder if it’s fair to say this. Organisms have had billions of years of training. We might come online and succeed in our environments with very little data, but we can’t ignore the information that’s been trained into our DNA, so to speak. What’s billions of years of sensory information that drove behavior and selection, if not training data? reply aithrowawaycomm 4 hours agorootparentMy primary concern is the generalization to manmade things that couldn’t possibly be in the evolutionary “training data.” As a thought experiment, it seems very plausible that you can train a transformer ANN on spiderwebs between trees, rocks, bushes, etc, and get “superspider” performance (say in a computer simulation). But I strongly doubt this will generalize to building webs between garages and pantries like actual spiders, no matter how many trees you throw at it, so such a system wouldn’t be ASI. This extends to all sorts of animal cognitive experiments: crows understand simple pulleys simply by inspecting them, but they couldn’t have evolved to use pulleys. Mice can quickly learn that hitting a button 5 times will give them a treat: does it make sense to say that they encountered a similar situation in their evolutionary past? It makes more sense to suppose that mice and crows have powerful abilities to reason causally about their actions. These abilities are more sophisticated than mere “Pavlovian” associative reasoning, which is about understanding stimuli. With AI we can emulate associative reasoning very well because we have a good mathematical framework for Pavlovian responses as a sort of learning of correlations. But causal reasoning is much more mysterious, and we are very far from figuring out a good mathematical formalism that a computer can make sense of. I also just detest the evolution = training data metaphor because it completely ignores architecture. Evolution is not just glomming on data, it’s trying different types of neurons, different connections between them, etc. All organisms alive today evolved with “billions of years of training,” but only architecture explains why we are so much smarter than chimps. In fact I think the “evolution” preys on our misconception that humans are “more evolved” than chimps, but our common ancestor was more primitive than a chimp. reply visarga 50 minutes agorootparentI don't think \"humans/animals learn faster\" holds. LLMs learn new things on the spot, you just explain it in the prompt and give an example or two. A recent paper tested both linguists and LLMs at learning a language with less than 200 speakers and therefore virtually no presence on the web. All from a few pages of explanations. The LLMs come close to humans. https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16575 Another example is the ARC-AGI benchmark, where the model has to learn from a few examples to derive the rule. AI models are closing the gap to human level, they are around 55% while humans are at 80%. These tests were specifically designed to be hard for models and easy for humans. Besides these examples of fast learning, I think the other argument about humans benefiting from evolution is also essential here. Similarly, we can't beat AlphaZero at Go, as it evolved its own Go culture and plays better than us. Evolution is powerful. reply car 20 minutes agorootparentprevIt’s all in the architecture. Also, biological neurons are orders of magnitude more complex than NN’s. There’s a plethora of neurotransmitters and all kinds of cellular machinery for dealing with signals (inhibitory, excitatory etc.). reply RaftPeople 3 hours agorootparentprev> Organisms have had billions of years of training. We might come online and succeed in our environments with very little data, but we can’t ignore the information that’s been trained into our DNA, so to speak It's not just information (e.g. sets of innate smells and response tendencies), but it's also all of the advanced functions built into our brains (e.g. making sense of different types of input, dynamically adapting the brain to conditions, etc.). reply lubujackson 3 hours agorootparentprevGood point. And don't forget the dynamically changing environment responding with a quick death for any false path. Like how good would LLMs be if their training set was built by humans responding with an intelligent signal at every crossroads. reply SiempreViernes 2 hours agorootparentprevThis argument mostly just hollows out the meaning of training: evolution gives you things like arms and ears, but if you say evolution is like training you imply that you could have grown a new kind of arm in school. reply horsawlarway 2 hours agorootparentTraining an LLM feels almost exactly like evolution - the gradient is \"ability to procreate\" and we're selecting candidates from related, randomized genetic traits and iterating the process over and over and over. Schooling/education feels much more like supervised training and reinforcement (and possibly just context). I think it's dismissive to assume that evolution hasn't influenced how well you're able to pick up new behavior, because it's highly likely it's not entirely novel in the context of your ancestry, and the traits you have that have been selected for. reply rjsw 6 hours agoparentprevMaybe we just collectively decided that it didn't matter whether the answer was correct or not. reply aithrowawaycomm 4 hours agorootparentAgain I do think these things have utility and the unreliability of LLMs is a bit incidental here. Symbolic systems in LISP are highly reliable, but they couldn’t possibly be extended to AGI without another component, since there was no way to get the humans out of the loop: someone had to assign the symbols semantic meaning and encode the LISP function accordingly. I think there’s a similar conceptual issue with current ANNs, and LLMs in particular: they rely on far too much formal human knowledge to get off the ground. reply nxobject 1 hour agorootparentBarring a stunning discovery that will stop putting the responsibility for NN intelligence on synthetic training set – it looks like NN and symbolic AI may have to coexist, symbiotically. reply rjsw 4 hours agorootparentprevI meant more why the \"boom caught almost everyone by surprise\", people working in the field thought that correct answers would be important. reply kleiba 6 hours agoprev> “Pre-ImageNet, people did not believe in data,” Li said in a September interview at the Computer History Museum. “Everyone was working on completely different paradigms in AI with a tiny bit of data.” That's baloney. The old ML adage \"there's no data like more data\" is as old as mankind itself. reply evrydayhustling 5 hours agoparentNot baloney. The culture around data in 2005-2010 -- at least / especially in academia -- was night and day to where it is today. It's not that people didn't understand that more data enabled richer + more accurate models, but that they accepted data constraints as a part of the problem setup. Most methods research went into ways of building beliefs about a domain into models as biases, so that they could be more accurate in practice with less data. (This describes a lot of PGM work). This was partly because there was still a tug of war between CS and traditional statistics communities on ML, and the latter were trained to be obsessive about model specification. One result was that the models that were practical for production inference were often trained to the point of diminishing returns on their specific tasks. Engineers deploying ML weren't wishing for more training instances, but better data at inference time. Models that could perform more general tasks -- like differentiating 90k object classes rather than just a few -- were barely even on most people's radar. Perhaps folks at Google or FB at the time have a different perspective. One of the reasons I went ABD in my program was that it felt industry had access to richer data streams than academia. Fei Fei Li's insistence on building an academic computer science career around giant data sets really was ingenius, and even subversive. reply bsenftner 4 hours agorootparentThe culture was and is skeptical in biased manners. Between '04 and '08 I worked with a group that had trained neural nets for 3D reconstruction of human heads. They were using it for prenatal diagnostics and a facial recognition pre-processor, and I was using it for creating digital doubles in VFX film making. By '08 I'd developed a system suitable for use in mobile advertising, creating ads with people in them, and 3D games with your likeness as the player. VCs thought we were frauds, and their tech advisors told them our tech was an old discredited technique that could not do what we claimed. We spoke to every VC, some of which literally kicked us out. Finally, after years of \"no\" that same AlexNet success begins to change minds, but now they want the tech to create porn.

I started with ML in 1994, I was in a small poor lab - so we didn't have state of the art hardware. On the other hand I think my experience is fairly representative. We worked with data sets on spark workstations that were stored in flat files and had thousands or sometimes tens of thousands of instances. We had problems keeping our data sets on the machines and often archived them to tape. Data came from very deliberate acquisition processes. For example I remember going to a field exercise with a particular device and directing it's use over a period of days in order to collect the data that would be needed for a machine learning project. Sometime in the 2000's data started to be generated and collected as \"exhaust\" from various processes. People and organisations became instrumented in the sense that their daily activities were necessarily captured digitally. For a time this data was latent, people didn't really think about using it in the way that we think about it now, but by about 2010 it was obvious that not only was this data available but we had the processing and data systems to use it effectively. reply kleiba 4 hours agoparentprevAnswering to people arguing against my comment: you guys do not seem to take into account that the technical circumstances were totally different thirty, twenty or even ten years ago! People would have liked to train with more data, and there was a big interest in combining heterogeneous datasets to achieve exactly that. But one major problem was the compute! There weren't any pretrained models that you specialized in one way or the other - you always retrained from scratch.

But my point is that the quote \"people didn't believe in data\" is not true. Back in 2019, when GPT-2 was trained, the reason they didn't use the 3T of today was not because they \"didn't believe in data\" - they totally would have had it been technically feasible (as in: they had that much data + the necessary compute). The same has always been true. There has never been a stance along the lines of \"ah, let's not collect more data - it's not worth it!\".

In 2022 (IIRC), Google released the Chinchilla paper about the compute-optimal amount of data to train a given model, for a 1B model, the value was determined to be 20B tokens, which again is 3 orders of magnitude below the current state of the art for the same class of model. Until very recently (the first llama paper IIRC, and people noticing that the 7B model showed no sign of saturation during its already very long training) the ML community vastly underestimated the amount of training data that was needed to make a LLM perform at its potential.

My only surprise is how long it took to get to imagenet, but in retrospect, I appreciate that a number of conditions had to be met (much more data, much better algorithms, much faster computers).

What actually happens is somebody (maybe a student at a university) has an insight or new idea for an algorithm that's near $0 cost to implement a proof-of concept. Then everybody else notices the improvement and then extra millions/billions get directed toward it. New ideas -- that didn't cost much at the start -- ATTRACT the follow on billions in investments. This timeline of tech progress in computer science is the opposite from other disciplines such as materials science or bio-medical fields. Trying to discover the next super-alloy or cancer drug all requires expensive experiments. Manipulating atoms & molecules requires very expensive specialized equipment. In contrast, computer science experiments can be cheap. You just need a clever insight. An example of that was the 2012 AlexNet image recognition algorithm that blew all the other approaches out of the water. Alex Krizhevsky had an new insight on a convolutional neural network to run on CUDA. He bought 2 NVIDIA cards (GTX580 3GB GPU) from Amazon. It didn't require NASA levels of investment at the start to implement his idea. Once everybody else noticed his superior results, the billions began pouring in to iterate/refine on CNNs. Both the \"attention mechanism\" and the refinement of \"transformer architecture\" were also cheap to prove out at a very small scale. In 2014, Jakob Uszkoreit thought about an \"attention mechanism\" instead of RNN and LSTM for machine translation. It didn't cost billions to come up with that idea.

A Prolog query is explainable precisely because, by construction, it itself is the explanation. And you can go step by step and understand how you got a particular result, inspecting each variable binding and predicate call site in the process. Despite all the billions being thrown at modern ML, no one has managed to create a model that does something like what Prolog does with its simple recursive backtracking. So the moral of the story is that you can 100% trust the result of a Prolog query, but you can't ever trust the output of an LLM.

For instance, Minsky and Papert's Perceptrons book, credited in part with prompting the 1980s AI winter, gives a valid mathematical proof about inability of networks within their framework to represent the XOR function. This function is easily solved by multilayer neural networks, but Minsky/Papert considered those to be a \"sterile\" extension and believed neural networks trained by gradient descent would fail to scale up. Or more contemporary, Gary Marcus has been outspoken since 2012 that deep learning is hitting a wall - giving the example that a dense network trained on just `1000 -> 1000`, `0100 -> 0100`, `0010 -> 0010` can't then reliably predict `0001 -> 0001` because the fourth output neuron was never activated in training. Similarly, this function is easily solved by transformers representing input/output as a sequence of tokens thus not needing to light up an untrained neuron to give the answer (nor do humans when writing/speaking the answer). If I claimed that it was topologically impossible to drink a Capri-Sun, then someone comes along and punctures it with a straw (an unaccounted for advancement from the blindspot of my model), I could maybe cling on and argue that my challenge remains technically true and unsolved because that violates one of the constraints I set out - but at the very least the relevance of my proof to reality has diminished and it may no longer support the viewpoints/conclusions I intended it to (\"don't buy Capri-Sun\").

The thing that flummoxes me is that now that we are so obviously on this self-reinforcing cycle, how many are still insistent that AI will amount to nothing. I am reminded of how the internet was just a fad - although this is going to have an even greater impact on how we live, and our economies. reply xen0 10 hours agoparentWhat makes you think AGI is either here or imminent? For me the current systems still clearly fall short of that goal. reply madaxe_again 8 hours agorootparentThey do fall short, but progress in this field is not linear. This is the bit that I struggle to comprehend - that which was literally infeasible only a few years ago is now mocked and derided. It’s like jet engines and cheap intercontinental travel becoming an inevitability once the rubicon of powered flight is crossed - and everyone bitching about the peanuts while they cruise at inconceivable speed through the atmosphere. reply diffeomorphism 8 hours agorootparentJust like supersonic travel between Europe and America becoming common place was inevitable. Oh, wait. Optimism is good, blind optimism isn't. reply madaxe_again 6 hours agorootparentIt is yet inevitable - but it wasn’t sustainable in the slightest when it was first attempted - Concorde was akin to the Apollo programme, in being precocious and prohibitively expensive due to the technical limitations of the time. It will, ultimately, be little more remarkable than flying is currently, even as we hop around on suborbital trajectories. It isn’t a question of optimism - in fact, I am deeply pessimistic as to what ML will mean for humanity as a whole, at least in the short term - it’s a question of seeing the features of a confluence of technology, will, and knowledge that has in the past spurred technical revolution. Newcomen was far from the first to develop a steam engine, but there was suddenly demand for such beasts, as shallow mines became exhausted, and everything else followed from that. ML has been around in one form or another for decades now - however we are now at the point where the technology exists, insofar as modern GPUs exist, the will exists, insofar as trillions of dollars of investment flood into the space, and the knowledge exists, insofar as we have finally produced machine learning models which are non-trivial. Just as with powered flight, the technology - the internal combustion engine - had to be in place, as did the will (the First World War), and the knowledge, which we had possessed for centuries but had no means or will to act upon. The idea was, in fact, ridiculous. Nobody could see the utility - until someone realised you could use them to drop ordnance on your enemies. With supersonic flight - the technology is emerging, the will will be provided by the substantial increase in marginal utility provided by sub-hour transit compared to the relatively small improvement Concorde offered, and the knowledge, again, we already have. So no, not optimism - just observance of historical forces. When you put these things together, there tend to be technical revolutions, and resultant societal change. reply xen0 6 minutes agorootparent> It is yet inevitable The cool thing for you is that this statement is unfalsifiable. But what I really took issue with was your timeframe in the original comment. Your statements imply you fully expect AGI to be a thing within a couple of years. I do not. reply oersted 10 hours agoparentprevWhat do you think is next? reply madaxe_again 8 hours agorootparentAn unravelling, as myriad possibilities become actualities. The advances in innumerate fields that ML will unlock will have enormous impacts. Again, I cannot understand for the life of me how people cannot see this. reply alexander2002 6 hours agorootparentI had a hypothesis once and It is probably 1000% wrong. But I will state here. /// Once computers can talk to other computers over network in human friendly wayand such that these entities completely control our interfaces which we humans can easily do and use them effectively multi-modality then I think there is a slight chance \"I\" might belive there is AGI or atleast some indications of it reply selimthegrim 4 hours agorootparentprevInnumerable? reply BriggyDwiggs42 10 hours agoparentprevDownvoters are responding to a perceived arrogance.

They have real-time location data. They get constant pings when you do anything on your device. Their applications bypass firewalls and VPNs. If you don't opt out, they have full unencrypted device backups, chat logs, photos and files. They made a big fuss about protecting you from Facebook and Google, then built their own targeted ad network. Opting out of all tracking doesn't really do that. And even if you trust them despite all of this, they've repeatedly failed to protect users even from external threats. The endless parade of iMessage zero-click exploits was ridiculous and preventable, CKV only shipped this year and isn't even on by default, and so on. Apple have never been punished by the market for any of these things. The idea that they will \"lose credibility\" if they livestream your AI interactions to the NSA is ridiculous. reply afh1 1 hour agorootparentprev> There's literally NOTHING you can do to stop that specific attack vector. E2E. Might not be applicable for remote execution of AI payloads, but it is applicable for most everything else, from messaging to storage. Even if the client hardware and/or software is also an actor in your threat model, that can be eliminated or at least mitigated with at least one verifiably trusted piece of equipment. Open hardware is an alternative, and some states build their entire hardware stack to eliminate such threats. If you have at least one trusted equipment mitigations are possible (e.g. external network filter). reply warkdarrior 1 hour agorootparentE2E does not protect metadata, at least not without significant overheads and system redesigns.

Also, many are unaware or unable to make the determination who or what will own their data before purchasing a device. One only accepts the privacy policy after one taps sign in... and is it really practical to expect people to do this by themselves when buying a phone? That's why regulation needs to step-in and enforce the right decisions are present by default. reply mossTechnician 58 minutes agorootparentprevBut if you don't trust Google with your data, you can buy a device that runs Google's operating system, from Google, and flash somebody else's operating system onto it.

They don't even need to do that. They don't need to do anything different than they say. They already are saying only that the data is kept private from . That opens the door wide for them to share the data with anyone outside of that very limited subset. You just have to read what they say, and also read between the lines. They aren't going to say who they share with, apparently, but they are going to carefully craft what they say so that some people get misdirected. reply isodev 1 hour agoparentprevIndeed, the attestation process, as described by the article, is more geared towards unauthorized exfiltration of information or injection of malicious code. However, \"authorized\" activities are fully supported where that means signed by Apple. So, ultimately, users need to trust that Apple is doing the right thing, just like any other company. And yes, it means they can be forced (by law) not to do the right thing. reply halJordan 2 hours agoparentprevIts not that they couldn't, its that they couldn't without a watcher knowing.

What's desperately missing on the client side is a switch to turn this off. It's really intransparent which Apple Intelligence requests are locally processed and which are sent to the cloud, at the moment. The only sure way to know/prevent it a priori is to... enter flight mode, as far as I can tell? Retroactively, there's a request log in the privacy section of System Preferences, but that's really convoluted to read (due to all of the cryptographic proofs that I have absolutely no tools to verify at the moment, and honestly have no interest in). reply jagrsw 4 hours agoprevIf Apple controls the root of trust, like the private keys in the CPU or security processor used to check the enclave (similar to how Intel and AMD do it with SEV-SNP and TDX), then technically, it's a \"trust us\" situation, since they likely use their own ARM silicon for that? Harder to attack, sure, but no outside validation. Apple's not saying \"we can't access your data,\" just \"we're making it way harder for bad guys (and rogue employees) to get at it.\" reply skylerwiernik 4 hours agoparentI don't think they do. Your phone cryptographically verifies that the software running on the servers is what it says it is, and you can't pull the keys out of the secure enclave. They also had independent auditors go over the whole thing and publish a report. If the chip is disconnected from the system it will dump its keys and essentially erase all data. reply hnaccount_rng 2 hours agorootparentBut since they also control the phone's operating system they can just make it lie to you! That doesn't make PCC useless by the way. It clearly establishes that Apple mislead customers, if there is any intentionality in a breach, or that Apple was negligent, if they do not immediately provide remedies on notification of a breach. But that's much more a \"raising the cost\" kind of thing and not a technical exclusion. Yes if you get Apple, as an organisation, to want to get at your data. And you use an iPhone. They absolutely can. reply HeatrayEnjoyer 3 hours agorootparentprevHow do you know the root enclave key isn't retained somewhere before it is written? You're still trusting Apple.

    "title": "Mozilla Foundation lays off 30% staff, drops advocacy division",
    "originLink": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/05/mozilla-foundation-lays-off-30-staff-drops-advocacy-division/",
    "originBody": "The Mozilla Foundation, the nonprofit arm of the Firefox browser maker Mozilla, has laid off 30% of its employees as the organization says it faces a “relentless onslaught of change.” When reached by TechCrunch, Mozilla Foundation’s communications chief Brandon Borrman confirmed the layoffs in an email. “The Mozilla Foundation is reorganizing teams to increase agility and impact as we accelerate our work to ensure a more open and equitable technical future for us all. That unfortunately means ending some of the work we have historically pursued and eliminating associated roles to bring more focus going forward,” read the statement shared with TechCrunch. According to its annual tax filings, the Mozilla Foundation reported having 60 employees during the 2022 tax year. The number of employees at the time of the layoffs was closer to 120 people, according to a person with knowledge. When asked by TechCrunch, Mozilla’s spokesperson did not dispute the figure. This is the second layoff at Mozilla this year, the first affecting dozens of employees who work on the side of the organization that builds the popular Firefox browser. Mozilla is made up of several organizations, one of which is the Mozilla Corporation, which develops Firefox and other technologies, and another is its nonprofit and tax-exempt Foundation, which oversees Mozilla’s corporate governance structure and sets the browser maker’s policies. Much of Mozilla’s work focused on advocating for privacy, inclusion, and decentralization of technologies, and “to create safer, more transparent online experiences for everyone,” which ultimately benefit the browser maker and its users. Announcing the layoffs in an email to all employees on October 30, the Mozilla Foundation’s executive director Nabiha Syed confirmed that two of the foundation’s major divisions — advocacy and global programs — are “no longer a part of our structure.” After publication, Borrman told TechCrunch that “advocacy is still a central tenet of Mozilla Foundation’s work and will be embedded in all the other functional areas,” without providing specifics. The move, according to Syed, is in part to produce a “unified, powerful narrative from the Foundation,” including revamping the foundation’s strategic communications. “Our mission at Mozilla is more high-stakes than ever,” wrote Syed in an email to staff, a copy of which was shared with TechCrunch. “We find ourselves in a relentless onslaught of change in the technology (and broader) world, and the idea of putting people before profit feels increasingly radical.” “Navigating this topsy-turvy, distracting time requires laser focus — and sometimes saying goodbye to the excellent work that has gotten us this far because it won’t get us to the next peak. Lofty goals demand hard choices,” wrote Syed. Syed, who joined the Mozilla Foundation in February, previously served as chief executive at data journalism and investigative news site The Markup.

Its a dysfunctional world that cant sort out funding for such a super-critical software piece and has let adtech have this charade and fig leaf of \"browser competition\" going on for so long. A chromium based solution would double down on the monoculture. If anything now is the time to envision what a users-first browser should be like, not what adtech wants it to be.

Likely not. If the fork would need to fight against any privacy-threatning actions, it will start to be quite different. It can be cheaper to maintain your own browser than massive, very diversed fork. And Google would get all power over web standards. You would need to fight them too if there is something controversial, and the code is getting different, again. reply jeswin 16 hours agorootparent> It can be cheaper to maintain your own browser than massive, very diversed fork. That's an extraordinary claim. reply nicce 7 hours agorootparentWe have a base assumption that they would continue with the Firefox as own browser as an alternative. The most work has been already done. The assumption is that they would want to keep going with more privacy-friendly alternative that also try to avoid web standards that would be harmful for the end-user (tracking, specific kind of remote attestation, e.g.). If they would fork Chromium, they likely want to redo the GUI. This is the easy part and that does not likely need upstream updates. That's what most forks do, and that is why they are maintainable. However, if you start changing core, extension interface e.g., and if these browsers starts go different ways due to conflicts of interests, then the challenges and extra work start appearing. Especially because of the security updates. Not all of them are CVEs, you need to look every possible bug fix if that introduced an additional issue if you used that part of the code differently. That must happen almost immediately as it is merged/notified in the upstream, or you might give too much time for someone to exploit it. The more different your fork is, the more challenging it is to get any update from the upstream. What if the upstream makes breaking internal API changes and you must adapt it, before you can merge new things. What if new CVEs are discovered after this API change that you are already lacking, and the fixed code goes for the code that has this API change? And so on.. and you can't stop merging upstream because reported bugs are much easier to exploit than discovering new ones from the new code. The above is all extra work. You still want to test your own code. Even if you had more bugs in your own browser code, you have better control them and the process is always faster. reply jowea 17 hours agorootparentprevI can't really estimate the difficulty, but are you sure about that? There's dozens of Chromium forks, would it be that hard to maintain one with a fraction of the development capacity that goes into developing an entire browser with its own rendering engine etc? reply pjmlp 10 hours agorootparentprevAt that point Web developers can update their CVs as ChromeOS developer. reply hulitu 11 hours agorootparentprev> Maybe the main FOSS browser will be a Chromium fork so it's cheaper to maintain?

I pay for my mail clients, my calendar clients, and would pay for a browser with extra features / extensions. Focus on the things people are using and not on becoming a VPN provider. That said I like, and use, Firefox for all of my work related tasks. And I have nothing against them having \"too many employees\".

Jeremy Markovich Nov 05, 2024 81 Share this post Tony Hawk wanted to track down a mysterious skateboarder from 1979. We found her. www.ncrabbithole.com Copy link Facebook Email Note Other 19 9 Share Here’s a really cool picture: tonyhawk A post shared by @tonyhawk A former colleague from my TV days, Michelle Chernicoff, sent me this picture of a young girl skateboarding underneath an umbrella on a rainy day. She saw it after Tony Hawk posted it to his Instagram page on Saturday. According to his caption, Tony really wanted to know who it was: New fav mystery skater unlocked: from Fayetteville Observer (NC), 1973. Style, grace, confidence, and… goofy footed, in the rain!! I hope she’s still around. Folks, we love two things around here: Tony Hawk and decades-old mysteries. There were two initial clues: The date and the newspaper. I plugged the picture into Google Image Search to see if I could find the original post. Back on September 21, blackarchives.co had posted a collection of images taken by Fayetteville Observer photographers between 1973 and 1987. The image of the skateboarder in the rain was the first one in the carousel. Tony Hawk himself commented the same day: “New fav skater unlocked.” Subscribe Next, I did some searches on the Observer’s website. The image showed up in a monthly roundup of old ‘70s photos that staff photographer Andrew Craft had pulled from the paper’s negative archive in 2019 (“Anytime I come across a skateboarding image I always scan it,” he said later in an Instagram comment). This photo also included a date: January 20, 1979 (not 1973, as Hawk’s post said). But that was it. No location. No name. No back story. So I turned to the people you turn to when times get tough: Librarians. John O’Connor is the manager of the Robinson-Spangler Carolina Room at the Charlotte Mecklenburg Library. He’s also a Rabbit Hole reader, and he’s helped me try to find archival material in the past. I sent him a message on Sunday morning to see if his library had Fayetteville Observer on microfilm. No, he said, but he’d call the Cumberland County Public Library as soon as they opened in the afternoon. There, library associate Matt Morgan got the film out, found the January 21, 1979 edition of the Fayetteville Observer, and sent over what he found: There, on page 1B, was the image and the caption that had the rest of the details: Shaundra Shane didn’t want to get wet, but the idea of spending a Saturday without her skateboard was to much to handle. So she got her umbrella and wheeled down Dinsmore Drive. From there, I tracked down the 10-year-old girl in the picture. She’s 56 now, still lives in Fayetteville, and her name is Shaunda, not Shaundra (the caption misspelled it). I reached out Sunday night, and we talked after she got off of work on Monday afternoon. She remembers the day the picture was taken. An Observer photographer, the late Steve Aldridge, lived across the street from her on Dinsmore Drive. “Mr. Steve saw me out there riding my skateboard in the rain,” she says. He asked her if she could get permission from her grandparents to take a picture. He also asked if she could come back with a prop. “He wanted me to have an umbrella, so I got an umbrella,” she says. “He took that picture and that was it.” A 2023 view from the area where the original picture was taken on Dinsmore Drive in Fayetteville (via Google Street View) Shaunda lived with her grandparents in a neighborhood that she loved. Family and friends were all close by. She’d been a skater for about a year, ever since her uncle brought her a little pink board with metal wheels. Her friends were more into roller skating back then, but going to the rink was kind of boring, she thought. It was limiting. Skateboarding allowed her to explore. “I was free,” Shaunda says. “You’re outside. There’s the wind. There’s just, like, a freeness, you know?” Shaunda was the only member of her group that skateboarded, and she kept doing it for years. She got faster. Started learning tricks. But she stopped skateboarding after she got her first boyfriend in middle school. As a teenager, she started spending more time with him and less time on the board. Plus, she didn’t need to skateboard to get around—he had a car. After that, skateboarding and the image of her doing it faded from her life. “It was just a picture in the paper,” she says. At some point, a car backed over her little pink board. Share Shaunda went on living. She moved to a new place in Fayetteville. She got married and divorced. She had three kids. She started working as a patient access specialist at Cape Fear Valley Health. Then, back in September, she got a call from a woman who still lived in her old neighborhood. She told Shaunda that she had the old picture of her skateboarding in the rain and gave it to her. A week later, the same picture started to show up on Facebook. Shaunda called up her friend, who swore that she didn’t put the image online. “I said, well, did your mom do it? And she was like, girl, my mom don’t know how to post nothing on Facebook,” she says, laughing. It was just a coincidence. Someone online had rediscovered the picture at the same time as Shaunda’s friend. And for a while, that was it. Shaunda made it her profile picture. A few friends tagged her when they saw the image online. They made comments. They liked her ponytails. They dropped fire emojis. Then Tony Hawk posted the picture. And then I called. “It's amazing,” Shaunda says. “I kind of have butterflies, you know? I definitely do know who Tony Hawk is. I have watched Tony Hawk.” The Fayetteville Observer got in touch, and they’re having her re-create the photo, 45 years later (UPDATE: Here’s the picture). A local skate shop has been in touch. Her phone is blowing up. Shaunda Shane, today. Also, she had to learn what it meant to ride “goofy footed.” It’s when you ride a board with your right foot forward instead of your left. “Oh,” Shaunda says. “Well, I am left-handed.” Shaunda said she hasn’t quite been able to re-create the freedom she felt on a board all those years ago, although riding a motorcycle comes pretty close. In any event, she doesn’t really have the time to skateboard now anyway. “I mean, literally all I do is work,” she jokes. “Trying to pay these bills.” Her son skateboards, though. And so, months ago, she got back up on a board for the first time in years. Just for a little bit. She’s a little afraid of falling, but the picture really brings back memories of a free-ranging childhood in a nice little neighborhood. “I probably would be skateboarding now,” she says, “if I really thought I could.” MANY UPDATES (11/5/24, 9:06 a.m.): First up, Tony Hawk has seen this article and name-dropped Shaunda in an Instagram story, and Shaunda is aware that Tony Hawk has name-dropped her, but she hasn’t read this story yet because she was on her way to work. We’re all leading busy lives, people! tonyhawk A post shared by @tonyhawk Also, the Fayetteville Observer posted its version of this story last night, which included the new picture of Shaunda riding a skateboard with an umbrella (you can go to their website to see it). The phenomenally talented Andrew Craft took that photo. He’s also the one who scanned the original picture of Shaunda from 1979 and posted it online, and really, there’s no story here without him. He also posted even more historical photos of skateboarders around Fayetteville, including another archival shot of Shaunda skateboarding with two friends. Check it out. Lastly, a correction: I originally said that riding goofy foot meant riding with your left foot forward. It’s actually the opposite, which I would have known had I been paying attention TO THE PICTURE THAT I BASED THIS ENTIRE STORY ON. Anyhow, I regret the error. My penance shall be listening to the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 2 soundtrack for the rest of the day (which I was gonna do anyway).

They rust very quickly ridden in the wet. reply TacticalCoder 19 hours agoparentprevBoards were fine. As another person commented it's the wheels' bearings that didn't like water that that much. But these were easy to change once in a while. reply renewiltord 20 hours agoprevFine, she doesn't know what skating goofy is, but she has to have known not to skate mongo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPV1dKMZltQ reply vvpan 20 hours agoprev [–] To reflect on HN trends for a second: people seem to really like \"uncovered\" things. Like some lost song, or archeological piece or, as here, identity of a person in a mostly inconsequential context. I also don't seem to recall these kinds of posts hitting front page much until recently. What is this? A new wave of nostalgia for long lost past on the internet? Hacker News demographic change? Discovery of a new marketing vector? Or just me seeing a pattern where there is none? reply switz 20 hours agoparentI can't speak to the trend, but for me, it's this idea that invalidates tastemakers and shows that good ideas inevitably stand on their own. Tony Hawk is widely respected, and yet, he's enamored with this forgotten photo of a young girl skateboarding in the rain. And she's holding an umbrella. We all agree-it's a wonderful photo. Turns out, the girl–in the most respectful way–is just an ordinary person, and the photographer asked her to hold an umbrella, because he felt it would be a good idea. It was a good idea, and many years later the creative result has risen to the surface. It's like when you go to a concert and witness a special moment that rocks you, and then years later you find out it has millions of views on YouTube. It's democratic validation that we are experiencing beautiful moments all the time, and that we don't need a Tony Hawk to validate them. You could argue that this wouldn't be seen without Tony, or you can reflect upon the many moments that aren't validated, and yet are filled with beauty. reply UncleOxidant 20 hours agoparentprevMaybe people are tired of the other stuff that's been crowding all the information channels (related to an event happening today) and are happy for some lighthearted news for a change? reply kelnos 20 hours agorootparentI'm on a no-politics diet today, but I would have loved this article on any day. It's just a delightful story. I think in news jargon it would be called a \"human interest\" story, which when you really think about those words, really nails it for me. I am deeply interested in other humans, especially of the non-celebrity variety. reply bink 20 hours agoparentprevI can only speak for myself, but the Internet regularly has me going down rabbit holes into unsolved mysteries that end with no solution. I find articles like this refreshing simply because I can close the tab with a smile rather than with more questions. reply devjab 19 hours agoparentprevThis isn’t new on HN, these sort of stories have been here for years. If anything there have been less of them in more recent times. I think many people here like the deep dives, and well written stories, about some specific interest. reply viraptor 19 hours agoparentprevOne reason for the popularity of that growing could be the accumulation of online things old enough to care about and enough sources to be able to track things down. I mean, only a decade ago some things were still fresh while now they're worthy of some research. See for example Jeffiot working with the community to track down the source of the vision test pattern (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D7I7fmZdOA) or the trumpet skull gif (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYcHOEjGzPA). In 2000s the information wouldn't be out there for the first one and the tools and community would be missing too. The second one would be just one of millions of gifs that nobody really cares about yet. reply soneca 19 hours agoparentprevI might be wrong, but I have the impression that this kind of post was always part of HN. Since, idk, 10 years ago. reply gralab 20 hours agoparentprevI have no data to back it up, but I believe HN saw a huge number of redditors moving here after the user protests a year or two ago. reply beeflet 20 hours agoparentprevIt's uncommon in the era of easily accessible information. Ditto for ARGs. reply whaaaaat 20 hours agoparentprevIs it a mostly inconsequential context? I think it's exactly the sort of context that is valuable and human and grounds us to events of our past. That one photo (and the collection of photos from the 70s linked in the article) say a lot about culture, about identity, about life and how things have evolved (or not evolved, or devolved) since then. It's a story too about celebrity, and how this picture exists in this moment, today, because a celebrity found and shared it. It's completely distorted this woman's day to day. While it seems like a positive for her, it highlights just how much power celebrity has in our mental economies. Should one person have the ability to completely blow up someone else's routine like this? I dunno! But social media definitely facilitates it! There's a ton of very interesting topics to cover here, in addition to the ones you raise, and I don't think they really are that inconsequential! reply ethbr1 19 hours agorootparentI've thought of the related phenomenon as \"the only thing you can't buy is time.\" I.e. there's no amount of money you can spend today to make something 45 years old So as we increasingly move into a materially post-scarcity developed world, time becomes the last scarce thing. It overlaps with nostalgia, but there's also a big component of novelty/rarity. See previous example of tracking down that song that was written for the X-Files and playing in the background in a single bar scene. Also, me blowing my friends' minds with a record I have of Richard Harris (now, \"Dumbledore\") reading selections from The Prophet: https://www.amazon.com/Kahlil-Gibran-Prophet-Musical-Interpr... reply renewiltord 20 hours agoparentprev [–] Oh I love this stuff.

Incidentally, I started watching The Crystal Maze for the first time a few months ago after finding episodes of it on Archive.org.
