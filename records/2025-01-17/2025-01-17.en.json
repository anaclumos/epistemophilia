    "originBody": "Hey Hacker News! Thanks for the feedback and suggestions, looks like many of you feel the same way. Also there's now a RSS feed. Companies squeezing every last penny out of their customers is no news. And Canon is no stranger. Last year, I've bought a Canon G5 X II camera which I wanted to use mainly for taking pictures at concerts. For me, it was the perfect match of focal range (zoom) and sensor size (more light) for any compact camera I've compared. Because I'm only using this camera for a small range of events, it's just collecting dust in the meantime. So, why don't use it as a webcam with my Macbook? Admittedly, it did not cost me the $6300 from the article's title, much closer to $900. Nonetheless, everything I'm describing translates to every other Canon camera model! Problems Problems Problems I've tried this at first in 2024 with macOS 14, which did not work. I had similar experience with FUJIFILM's X Webcam software where either the camera will not get recognized by the software or the camera feed will freeze or simply be not available within other apps. As of January 2025 with macOS 15 Sequoia, these issues have been resolved for me. Well actually, only if you are able to download the software at all. Seems like their Microsoft IIS server is having some issues. The following error page will be presented to you, after they asked you for your full legal name and mail address - without which you can not download the software. Canon.com web page throwing 500 server errors preventing download $5/mo, $50/yr So I've been really excited when I finally found a downloadable file on the Canon webpage which was not blocked by a faulty newsletter grift and saw the live feed of my camera! Well the excitement didn't last long since nearly every single setting is disabled if you're using the software without a paying Canon account. Canon EOS Webcam Utility: Paid features No brightness adjustments, no color correction, only 720p. Even in the paid version there doesn't seem to be a white balance adjustment setting. Canon EOS Webcam Utility: Paid features Canon will happily take your credit card for you to pay a small monthly price of $4.99 per month or even a discounted $49.99 per year! ** The 30-day free trial is valued at $4.99 and can be cancelled at any time during the free trial period through your MyCanon Account Dashboard. After the free trial period, your subscription will automatically be rolled over into the annual or monthly non-refundable, auto-renewable subscription selected upon enrollment in the free trial, which can be cancelled at any time through your MyCanon Account Dashboard. The current available subscription plans are $49.99/year or $4.99/month. In a support document, Canon lists all differences between the free and paid version. So you can be very gladful, they allow you to even connect the camera. Canon documentation \"How to Subscribe\" Software development isn’t free, and I’m happy to pay for software I use regularly. However, Canon is a hardware company, not a software company, and they should—due to the lack of standards—provide software that allows you to use their cameras as intended. Aside from development costs, there’s no justification for a subscription model, particularly from a company earning nearly $3 billion in profit. Why So Canon will not allow you to use your own camera on your own computer with your own cables the way you intent to without paying for another subscription. Canon, what the fuck?

The problem however wasn't Canon, but that I lived in a region (EU) that would have imposed a customs tariff on cameras that could do that, but by keeping it under that, the camera would be classed as a 'stills' camera and so was therefore exempt. Admittedly this is different from the case in the article - but it would appear that owning something that could physically do what you want it to is only half the battle for numerous reasons, and in this case it would have been my government demanding extra money to 'unlock' this functionality. reply halgir 9 hours agoparentReminds me of when lawyers successfully argued that X-Men are not human, so that their action figures would be classified as \"toys\" rather than \"dolls\" and thus charged a lower tariff. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_Biz%2C_Inc._v._United_Stat... reply walthamstow 5 hours agorootparentHoo boy we have some classics in that category in the UK. My personal fave is when morning TV host Lorraine Kelly successfully argued she wasn’t hosting as herself but acting a character called Lorraine Kelly, with very favourable tax consequences. reply seanhunter 2 hours agorootparentThere was also the famous decision in the Jaffa Cake case where the VAT treatment depended on whether or not a Jaffa cake was a cake or a biscuit https://standrewseconomist.com/2023/12/31/let-them-eat-cake-... The tribunal decided that Jaffa Cakes were cakes because when they go stale they go hard like a cake whereas a biscuit tends to go soft when it goes stale. reply ryao 1 hour agorootparentI remember hearing about this because the one who wanted it classified as a biscuit proposed the test that determined it was a cake. That is the sole reason I remember this story. reply walthamstow 38 minutes agorootparentprevThere’s another one about Walkers taste sensations poppadom snacks. Question was, is it a crisp or not? Can’t remember the outcome reply eitally 5 hours agorootparentprevThis is akin to Fox News arguing in court that it is, in fact, entertainment and not news, despite it's name. reply thunky 4 hours agorootparentIt's true though. All cable news is \"entertainment news\", not \"news\". Nobody should have been getting their \"news\" from Tucker Carlson, Don Lemon, or Rachel Maddow. IMO they shouldn't be allowed to call themselves news without putting entertainment in front. reply dingnuts 2 hours agorootparentThank you for pointing this out. Carlson and Maddow made nearly identical arguments in court and if both are not mentioned in the same breath, the speakers bias is instantly displayed to anyone who is educated on this topic. > IMO they shouldn't be allowed to call themselves news without putting entertainment in front. Agreed but the average person wouldn't understand that Entertainment News was different than News. The problem goes deeper. I despair. reply 1659447091 3 minutes agorootparent> the average person wouldn't understand that Entertainment News was different than News I think the 'average' person thinks of 'Entertainment News' as celebrity gossip, e.g., E! News[0] etc. Telling them the entertainment news/opinion/commentary they watch is not actually 'News' but is entertainment \"news\" doesn't compute [0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E!_News smallmancontrov 1 hour agorootparentprevCarlson's texts were wild, they proved that he knew he was spreading lies and did it anyway for views. That's why Fox settled with Dominion for $787 million dollars. Meanwhile, OAN sued Maddow for calling them Russian propaganda and her lawyers responded by flexing, doubling down with receipts under oath. Signing up for consequences if they were wrong, and receiving none because they were correct. So no, these are not the same, and anyone who argues that they are immediately reveals themselves to be partisan hacks. reply thunky 48 minutes agorootparentFrom https://www.courthousenews.com/ninth-circuit-backs-dismissal... [Judge Smith] found OAN and its parent company were unlikely to prevail on the defamation claim because the challenged speech was not a statement of fact and the context of Maddow’s show made it likely her audience would expect her to make political opinions. Putting the details of the court case aside, the judge is clearly saying that he does not believe that Maddow's show was \"news\" and it shouldn't be treated as such. That's what GP was pointing out: the defense of being \"not news\", which both shows have in common. reply jonhohle 1 hour agorootparentprevYou may be interested in Young v. CNN going on right now. It probably won’t be a 9 figure judgment, but could be 8. reply ipaddr 1 hour agorootparentprevThey are not the same because one had text indicating they were aware? While the other claimed to be braindead and no texts to prove otherwise? They are literally the same with one case having a text message. They are both not news and if you think that one and not the other is news than you might be the partisan you are trying to label others as. reply _n_b_ 4 hours agorootparentprevWhat Fox News argued was a bit more nuanced than that all of Fox News isn't news. Rather, \"Fox successfully argued that one particular segment on Tucker Carlson’s show could only be reasonably interpreted as making political arguments, not making factual assertions, and therefore couldn’t be defamation.\"[1] That feels like a fairly reasonable assertion for anybody watching Tucker Carlson. [1] https://popehat.substack.com/p/fox-news-v-fox-entertainment-... reply skrebbel 4 hours agorootparentI know nothing about the case but isn't that a little like saying \"look, we weren't lying, cause we never said we were saying the truth\"? reply _n_b_ 3 hours agorootparentWell, context matters in looking at defamation claims. Let's say you were involved in a freak hunting accident and shot somebody, but you were never charged with any crimes. If the Fox News \"hard news\" program (if such a thing exists) said \"skrebbel is a murderer\" that is more likely to be understood to be a statement of fact, asserting something in a legalistic sense. [IANAL, but I think even this is unlikely to be defamation, although there is a somewhat similar case where ABC settled with Donald Trump over saying he was \"liable for rape\"] If somebody on Tucker Carlson Tonight said \"You can't trust anything that skrebbel guy says, he's a murderer!\" that is more likely to be understood as an opinion based on disclosed facts, not a fact. That person isn't asserting that you committed or were convicted of a specific crime of murder, but rather that you killed somebody and it might be your fault. On a show were people are arguing and exchanging opinionated views, viewers should understand that these things are opinions. And therefore that's not defamation, because it's an opinion. reply skrebbel 3 hours agorootparent> You can't trust anything that skrebbel guy says, he's a murderer! I am deeply offended and contemplating to sue you for defamation. reply vixen99 14 minutes agorootparentprevPolitical argument, as such, is worthwhile insofar as it can cause me to reexamine my own preconceptions. Facts I can pick up almost anytime. reply TeMPOraL 26 minutes agorootparentprevIsn't it also how, many years ago, Top Gear got away with a hit job on Tesla by claiming they're just an entertainment show, so they're not obligated to do honest or truthful reviews? reply Corrado 5 hours agorootparentprevI think Steven Colbert hosted a show using himself as the host. I’m not sure about the tax implications though. reply gwbas1c 4 hours agorootparentAnd then when he tried using the \"Steven Colbert\" character on a different show, Comedy Central threatened him because Steven Colbert does not have rights to the \"Steven Colbert\" character. reply bloomingkales 3 hours agorootparentThat doesn’t seem like that should be possible. He sold his identity for life? Hollywood really does ask for your soul huh. It would make sense why he’s never even jokingly gone back into that character on his new show. reply ipaddr 1 hour agorootparentAnd others can take your identity. If you happen to have the name Michael Jordan try putting out your own running shoes under your name. reply treis 3 hours agorootparentprevIt's not his identity, though. It's a character that he plays. reply kjs3 3 hours agorootparentprevAl Shugart started Shugart Associates and pretty much created the 5 1/4\" floppy market. He sold to Xerox. He later started Shugart Technology and was promptly threatened with a lawsuit because he literally had sold his rights to his own name (in the particular context). He changed the name to Seagate Technology and the rest is history. Yes, you can be enjoined from using your own name. reply gwbas1c 2 hours agorootparent> Yes, you can be enjoined from using your own name. This is not that case. In popular media when \"The Colbert Report\" was broadcast, Steven Colbert was very open about the fact that he was playing a character on TV who happened to have the same name as him. In the case of \"The Tonight Show featuring Steven Colbert,\" he is not playing the character from the Colbert Report. The very specific bit was from after the 2017 election when Trump was elected. Steven Colbert did a bit, in character as \"Steven Colbert\", with props from \"The Colbert Report\", and a guest appearance from Jon Stewart. (Because the main focus of \"The Colbert Report\" was to mock conservatives.) Otherwise, everything Steven Colbert (the person) does on \"The Tonight Show featuring Steven Colbert\" does not involve the \"Steven Colbert\" character from \"The Colbert Report.\" reply ipaddr 1 hour agorootparentAnd that's when he stopped being funny. As a big fan I was confused by how unfunny his tonight show content was from day one compared to everything we saw upto that point. I can see why legal action when nowhere it's not the same product. Using the same name does cause confusion in the marketplace. reply Spoom 1 hour agorootparentprevTo be fair, in Steven Colbert's case, he definitely was playing a character on The Colbert Report. A ridiculously conservative one that asked guests repeatedly if George W. Bush was a great president, or the greatest president. It was very over the top. reply jonhohle 1 hour agorootparentprevPrior to the Colbert Report, Stephen Colbert was a character on the Daily Show, also a CC property. Craig Kilborn was able to leave the Daily Show and take bits like 5 questions with him. However, CC was a much smaller network at the time. reply technothrasher 5 hours agorootparentprevI'm pretty sure that was Chuck Noblet pretending to be Steven Colbert. reply DFHippie 5 hours agorootparentprevIf there were any tax implications, they were incidental. The show was parody, so the opinions he espoused in character were necessarily ones he didn't actually hold. reply panzi 4 hours agorootparentprevI'm not from the UK, but wasn't there also a cake Vs biscuits thing for tax reasons? reply Macha 2 hours agorootparentSubway fell on the wrong side of similar tax laws in Ireland - their sugar content in their bread was too high, so for tax purposes, their subs are legally cakes: https://www.npr.org/2020/10/01/919189045/for-subway-a-ruling... reply seabass-labrax 4 hours agorootparentprevYes, Jaffa Cakes - minature sponge cakes flavoured with Jaffa oranges.

Caramelized popcorn with added sugar is taxed at a higher rate of 18%.\" reply xandrius 6 hours agorootparentAll those make sense and are pretty common: bread is taxed lower than most pizza toppings. Raw ingredients are taxed less than ready-to-eat or sugar-coated ultra-processed good. And I'm totally ok with that. reply jonhohle 1 hour agorootparentBut a pizza as a whole is a ready-to-eat good. And a pizza isn’t a pizza without the crust. reply dTal 4 hours agorootparentprevThe pizza thing seemed incredibly silly to me. Surely the restaurant has already paid the tax when they bought the raw ingredients? Must any product served in a restaurant be taxed according to the rate of the most highly taxed ingredient in it, regardless of proportion? So I looked it up.

I'd love to see the data. reply rsynnott 4 hours agorootparentWell, in the end it didn't save them anything, because the EC didn't accept that having a toy basic interpreter made what was obviously a games console a PC.

If you think about the vast majority of the time when shooting moving video with a handheld or tripod mounted camera it does not involve 30+ minute long continuous takes. You could have a professional movie camera with that restriction and it wouldn't be a problem in the vast majority of cases. So the restriction ends up being between things like security cameras, vtc cameras, and traffic cameras vs all other times of cameras.

My Sony A7-III doesn't have that, for example. Neither modern Canons, AFAIK. The funnier thing is, you can't use the videos out of your camera for commercial purposes, because the video codecs inside your camera doesn't come with commercial licenses out of the box.

Yeah that seems to be the same AVC/h.264 'personal and non-commercial' text the 2010 article I linked centered on. MPEG-LA spoke to Engadget[1] (finally found a working link I could read) and said that a separate license for shooting commerical video isn't required and that distribution of commercial content via licensed providers (Google/Youtube, Apple, etc) is fine. It seems the one caveat, per the Engadget article, is directly distributing AVC video to end users (I suppose like a direct download link on a personal site) is what requires a license but that license is free to obtain.

There are other license models, which is about manufacturers, publishers and TV stations, etc. But nowhere it says \"there's a free license for these cases, just get it from here\". This all looks like a rabbit hole for me. reply infogulch 2 hours agorootparentCan't wait for AV1 to supplant these bureaucratic rent-seekers. reply LegitShady 4 hours agorootparentprevI wonder what the commercial licenses actually cost. I know there was a big movement of shooting movies and events with canons when good video on dslrs first became a thing. I never even thought about codec licenses, because that stuff shouldn't exist. the manufacturer should buy the license so the camera can use it forever, because its just a paperweight without it, and I dont think they should be able to sell cameras with hidden text licenses like that. reply ska 2 hours agorootparentThis is a problem with 'prosumer' gear in general. If camera manufactures bought a transferable commercial license for everything in it, it would be too expense for consumer use, but the people licensing IP to them want a piece if you are making money with it. Similar to software that is free or low cost for non-commercial use only, even with the same functionality.

This might not work reliably enough for simpler codecs like JPEG but for something as complicated as modern video codec where there are a million ways to generate a compatible payload it is as unique as a fingerprint. reply bayindirh 1 hour agorootparentThat’s true, but I thought of embedding a serial number and a date into the video, periodically, for example, which can be quantized as noise, but not very visible unless you filter the frame a very specific way, or pass through a tool. reply sombragris 5 minutes agoparentprevThere's the well-known case of Spain in 1985, that would impose a tariff on computers with 64 KB RAM or less.

Those taxes play important role in reducing alcohol consumption (though they are of course not the only tool), so making cheap ethanol poisonous and with different color closes the loophole in healthcare policy rather than opens a loophole in taxation.

That's pretty in the weeds of congress' internal negotiations reply wnoise 34 minutes agorootparentThe \"gunshow\" loophole is really a \"private sellers\" exemption. If you don't regularly sell guns, then you don't need an FFL to merely sell a small number, and don't have to do background checks (indeed there's no process such that you _can_ do firearms checks). Now, it might be reasonable to remove this exemption, but the only way it's a \"gunshow\" loophole is that gun shows are a place where gun fans wanting to buy are going to meet gun fans wanting to sell.

To a (considerable) extent yes.

These two companies’ kit is expensive, luxury, premium, however you want to refer to it, and so they probably felt comfortable wringing their customers a little more. Probably understandable in the case of Leica owners who will pay £250 for a viewfinder dioptre correction lens (puts hand up again) but less so for hifi owners.

Lots of people that buy that stuff don’t need it, but it’s not expensive solely for the sake of being expensive.

A standard way of doing that is… And another standard way, supported by at least some cameras, without even single extra charge never mind a subscription⁰, is apparently video over USB. > I get subscription fatigue, but this is not a good hill to die on. No users are dying on this hill¹. OP is just stating, in an exasperated tone admittedly, what the state of affairs is with this camera. Some of us are agreeing with him that it seems off, and is part of the ongoing enshitification of the software and hardware worlds. Others can use this information to help guide their choice of camera (or supplier of other equipment), or not, their choice. ---- [0] Which implies they could decide to discontinue the feature at a whim later, no matter how much the user has paid between now and then. [1] I'll refrain² from mentioning that you are putting up quite a determined fight for the “nah, this sort of thing is fine, really” hill. [2] Oops, I tell a lie… reply nohillside 6 hours agorootparentprevIndeed, we should be glad they don‘t charge us for each picture we take … reply afandian 8 hours agorootparentprevThey have already implemented it, otherwise it wouldn't work. reply brushfoot 7 hours agorootparentThe app is part of the implementation. And they're apparently subsidizing the cost by charging separately for it. Drop the fee and that's now baked into the camera's base price. reply baxtr 7 hours agorootparentprevOP expects the camera comes with some decent convenience at that price. reply brushfoot 7 hours agorootparentOP is using a camera as a webcam that's not sold as a webcam. That's fine, I do the same with mine, but it's also fine of the manufacturer to allow for that by simply providing A/V interfaces instead of trying to account for every use case. reply bhickey 5 hours agorootparentCanon advertises their cameras as webcams. reply brushfoot 5 hours agorootparentNo, they don't. They advertise that the camera can \"turn into\" a webcam with the right software or through HDMI out. reply baxtr 5 hours agorootparentThat’s basically the same though, isn’t it? reply brushfoot 5 hours agorootparentThat's what the marketers wanted us to think, sure. It's like me trying to sell you a car that can \"turn into\" a boat with the right attachments. Notice I didn't say how much the attachments cost. reply bhickey 4 hours agorootparentRespectfully, you're just making things up. reply brushfoot 3 hours agorootparentI resent that accusation. We should have a Zoom call on two Canon webcams to hash this out. reply bhickey 3 hours agorootparentPay my subscription for the next decade and we have a deal. reply bhickey 5 hours agorootparentprevYou're simply mistaken. reply brushfoot 5 hours agorootparentThe marketing material for OP's model: > Use the EOS Utility Webcam Beta Software (Mac and Windows) to turn your Canon camera into a high-quality webcam, or do the same using a clean HDMI output. reply bhickey 5 hours agorootparentMarketing material changes over time and varies between models and regions. Canon customers bought their cameras because Canon advertised a set of features. I bought mine because Canon advertised that I could use it as a webcam. I don't think you're making a persuasive argument. reply brushfoot 5 hours agorootparentYou still can use it as a webcam. It's right there in the marketing materials. Clean HDMI out. That lets you use it as a webcam. Canon advertising its potential to be used as a webcam doesn't mean it's a webcam. It means you can adapt it for use as one. And you still can. The adapter is an HDMI cable or software, which may or may not be free. reply pluc 7 hours agorootparentprevConvenience is always extra reply Eddy_Viscosity2 6 hours agoparentprevWould this approach also give you control of camera settings? I think the OP's situation, he wanted that. reply deskr 5 hours agoparentprevExactly. But why does he need to buy a USB capture card and HDMI cable? He can just hire someone to come and record the videos for him. They'll also do the post processing. Why does he even even record the videos himself? He can just hire actors to do what he wants, probably a lot better. And what's the whole thing with buying a camera? He should just buy a studio and hire a crew to manage all that stuff. reply dmix 5 hours agorootparentBuying usb capture cards is a standard accessory for content creators. It's not a big deal. reply brushfoot 4 hours agorootparentNot a big deal at all. The outrage in this thread is incredible. Buying a couple A/V adapters to adapt a non-webcam camera into a webcam is somehow seen as a terrible burden. If someone doesn't want to do that, perhaps they should buy...a webcam. No adapters needed. A camera comes with more power at the cost of simplicity for this use case. reply delta_p_delta_x 4 hours agorootparentprevThis is what's called a slippery slope. A capture card and HDMI cable together cost less than $100. Hiring someone will be at least an order of magnitude more expensive—and more so the more people you hire. reply mynameisvlad 7 minutes agorootparentWhoosh. That was the entire point of the comment, to point out the slippery slope in the HDMI/cable card argument in the first place. reply michaelt 8 hours agoparentprevHow easy and slick this setup will be depends on the camera. For example, my camera can't operate and charge over USB at the same time, so you need a supplemental power supply. And it won't autofocus continuously or keep the exposure and white balance stable unless you're recording a video. And videos can only be so long. So I've got a HDMI-to-USB converter, a special HDMI cable, a special power brick and adaptor, a special tripod so all those cables don't pull the whole setup over, and I've got to restart video recording every 30 minutes or so, and wipe the microsd card regularly. Your camera's probably better suited to this than mine :) reply jeswin 8 hours agorootparentI've been using a Sony mirrorless (anything above a5100 will work) for over 6 years now; it needed a \"dummy battery\", and an HDMI capture card (about $25 for noname brands, or $80+ for Elgato, BlackMagic etc).

Apart from obviously double-checking for leaks, we will add fire suppression to that volume and probably increase vent area. Nothing so far suggests pushing next launch past next month. https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1880060983734858130 reply perihelions 2 hours agorootparentReminds me of one of NASA's reckless ideas, abandoned after Challenger in 1986, to put a liquid hydrogen stage inside the cargo bay of the Shuttle orbiter [0]. That would have likely leaked inside that confined volume, and could plausibly have exploded in a similar way as Starship.

I'd say you add fire suppression AND ALSO try more to reduce leaks. It's got to be really difficult to build huge massive tanks that hold oxygen and other gases under pressure (liquid methane too will have some vapor of course). Are leaks inherently going to happen? This is meant to be a human rated ship of course, how will you reduce this danger? I know this stuff is hard, but you can't just iterate and say starship 57 has had 3 flights without leaks, we got it now. Since I have no expertise here, I can imagine all kinds of unlikely workarounds like holding the gas under lower pressure with humans on board or something to reduce the risk. reply wat10000 1 hour agorootparentThis might be one of those components where it just needs to be built without problems, and improved safety means fixing individual design and manufacturing flaws as you find them, until you’ve hopefully got them all. This can work. Fundamental structural components of airliners just can’t fail without killing everyone, and high reliability is achieved with careful design, manufacturing, testing, and inspection. I’m not sure if a gigantic non-leaky tank is harder to pull off that way, but they might have to regardless. We’re going to have to accept that space travel is going to be inherently dangerous for the foreseeable future. Starship is in a good position to improve this, because it should fly frequently (more opportunities to discover and fix problems) and the non-manned variant is very similar to the manned variant (you can discover many problems without killing people). But there are inherent limitations. There’s just not as much capacity for redundancy. The engines have to be clustered so fratricide or common failure modes are going to me more likely. Losing all the engines is guaranteed death on Starship, versus a good chance to survive in an airliner. All other practical considerations aside, I think this alone sinks any possibility of using Starship for Earth-to-Earth travel as has been proposed by SpaceX. reply mavhc 1 hour agorootparentprevGiven that a) most human rated rockets have had 0 flights before use, and b) I'd expect each starship to have at least 10 flights, and at least 100 in total without mishap before launching, the statistics should be good reply wat10000 1 hour agorootparentI don’t think (a) is true. The Shuttle flew with people on its maiden voyage, but that’s the only one I can think of. (b) is true and should make it substantially safer than other launch systems. But given how narrow the margins are for something going wrong (zero ability to land safely with all engines dead, for example) it’s still going to be pretty dangerous compared to more mundane forms of travel. reply raverbashing 13 hours agorootparentprevI'm not sure there's fire suppression effective enough for this type of leak (especially given rocket constraints) reply spandrew 1 hour agorootparentIt might not even be about fire suppression. Oxygen and different gases can pool oddly in different types of gravity. If oxygen was leaking, it may be as simple as making sure a vacuum de-gases a chamber before going full throttle. We know nothing, but the test having good data on what went wrong is a great starting point. reply m4rtink 9 hours agorootparentprevActually the Super Heavy (first stage) already uses heavy CO2 based fire suppression. Hopefully not that necessary in the long term, but should make it possible to get on with the testing in the short term. reply Alive-in-2025 1 hour agorootparentWhat is a long term solution for this? Is there something more than \"build tanks that don't leak\"? I'm sure spaceX has top design and materials experts, now what ;-). reply m4rtink 1 hour agorootparentI think its likely not the tanks but rather the plumbing to engines and the engines themselves leaking (sense lines, etc). Next engine revision (Raptor 3) should help, as it is much simplified and quite less likely to leak or get damaged during flight. reply raverbashing 8 hours agorootparentprevThat's interesting However if you see the stream you can see one of the tanks rapidly emptied before loss of signal It seems this was not survivable regardless of fire or not reply psunavy03 2 hours agorootparentprevAerospace fire suppression is generally Halon, which would purge the cavity with inert gas. reply echelon 3 hours agorootparentprevReplying to this comment so people can see the incredible video of the breakup taken from a diverting aircraft: https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/1i34dki/starship_... reply varjag 10 hours agorootparentprevIf you can displace the oxidizer/air remaining in the volume why not. reply littlestymaar 5 hours agorootparentThe initial tweet says: > we had an oxygen/fuel leak If that's correct, then you can't just remove air. The only option would be to cool things down so it stops burning. reply shellfishgene 4 hours agorootparentIf it was really an oxygen/fuel mix burning I don't think you can do much of anything to stop that. reply littlestymaar 4 hours agorootparentIf you cooled the mixture at low enough temperature, you'd stop it from burning (like when you pour water on top of a camp fire), but it's not clear how you're supposed to do that in a spaceship where you can't carry a few tons of water for your sprinklers. reply ben_w 1 hour agorootparent> If you cooled the mixture at low enough temperature, you'd stop it from burning (like when you pour water on top of a camp fire), but it's not clear how you're supposed to do that in a spaceship where you can't carry a few tons of water for your sprinklers. Also water would make it hotter, given this is liquid oxygen. reply varjag 2 hours agorootparentprevThere are other methods too, e.g. fire inhibitors (like Halon or whatever is allowed now) or shockwave to disrupt fire boundary. But I doubt they are very practical on a spaceship. reply m4rtink 1 hour agorootparentFirst stage (Super Heavy) is flushing the engine bay with massive ammounts of CO2. reply metalman 5 hours agorootparentprevjust increased venting to keep any vapor concentrations of fuel and oxidiser below that capable of igniting, even simple baffling could suffice as the leaks may be trasitory and flowing out of blowoff valves, so possibly a known risk. Space x is also forgoeing much of the full system vibriatory tests, done on traditiinal 1 shot launches, and failure in presurised systems due to unknown resonance is common. Big question is did it just blow up, or did the automated abort, take it out, likely the latter or there would be a hold on the next launch. reply vessenes 3 hours agorootparentThere’s no way that was anything but the automated abort — it was a comprehensive instantaneous rapid event. Or I guess I’d say, however it started, the automated abort kicked in and worked. reply api 6 hours agorootparentprevWould be unpleasant if there was crew. Of course this thing is pretty far from human eating. reply onion2k 6 hours agorootparentWould be unpleasant if there was crew. 19 people have died in the 391 crewed space missions humans have done so far. The risk of dying is very high. Starship is unlikely to change that, although the commoditization of space flight could have reduce the risk simply by making problems easier to spot because there's more flights. reply gr3ml1n 3 hours agorootparentThe higher frequency of launches seems likely to have a big impact on reliability. It's no different than deploying once per day vs once per month. The more you do it, the more edge cases you hit and the more reliable you can make it. SpaceX also has a simplification streak: the Raptor engines being the canonical example. Lower complexity generally means less unexpected failure modes. reply londons_explore 3 hours agorootparent> SpaceX also has a simplification streak: the Raptor engines being the canonical example. Not necessarily. Your engine which used to have 200 sensors perhaps now only has 8. But you now don't know when temperatures were close to melting point in a specific part of the engine. When something goes wrong, you are less likely to identify the precise cause because you have less data. Many of those sensors are not to enable the rocket to fly at all, but merely for later data analysis to know if anything was close to failure. In yesterdays launch, if the engines had more sensors musk probably wouldn't have said \"an oxygen/fuel leak\", but would have been able to say \"Engine #7 had an oxygen leak at the inlet pipe, as shown by the loud whistling noise detected by engine #7's microphone array\" reply api 3 hours agorootparentprevMy #1 rule for all engineering: simplicity is harder than complexity. I truly wish more software engineers thought this way. I see a lot of mentality in software where people are even impressed by complexity, like \"wow what a complex system!\" like it's a good thing. It's not. It's a sign that no effort has been put into understanding the problem domain conceptually, or that no discipline has been followed around reducing the number of systems or restraint over adding new ones. I've seen incredibly good software engineers join teams and have net negative lines of code contributed for some time. If we ever encountered, say, an alien race millions of years ahead of us on this kind of technology curve, I think one of the things that would strike us would be the simplicity of their technology. It would be like everything is a direct response and fit to the laws of physics with nothing extraneous. Their software -- assuming they still use computers as we understand them -- would be functional bliss that directly represented the problem domain, with every state a pure function of previous state. We might get to this kind of software eventually. This is still a young field. Simplicity, being harder than complexity, often takes time and iteration to achieve. Often there's a complexity bloat followed by a shake out, then repeat, over many cycles. reply psunavy03 2 hours agorootparent\"Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.\" -Antoine de Saint-Exupéry reply exe34 2 hours agorootparentprev> Their software -- assuming they still use computers as we understand them -- would be functional bliss that directly represented the problem domain, with every state a pure function of previous state. I love that this is also a model of reality. Everything is made of differential equations. reply BurningFrog 3 hours agorootparentprevModern space ships are very likely to change that, as designs mature and improve. Early aviation was extremely dangerous. Now a plane is among the safest places to be. reply api 5 hours agorootparentprevI could imagine the risk going down to a few times air travel after 50+ years of operating a mature launch system. reply coldtea 13 hours agorootparentprev>Apart from obviously double-checking for leaks They didn't already? And they didn't have automated systems and sensors for that? What kind of Mickey Mouse project is this? reply pmontra 10 hours agorootparentTest flights. My tests keep failing until I fix all of my code, then we deploy to production. If code fails in production than that's a problem. We could say that rockets are not code. A test run of a Spaceship surely cost much more than a test run of any software on my laptop but tests are still tests. They are very likely to fail and there are things to learn from their failures. reply notorandit 7 hours agorootparentRunning a code test doesn't require firing a rocket. How would you test a rocket? reply TypingOutBugs 6 hours agorootparentYou test components in isolation, you test integration of components, you run simulations of the entire rocket, and finally you test the rocket launch. You’ll catch issues along the way, but you can’t catch all of them before a full launch test. That’s why there are launch tests. reply notorandit 2 hours agorootparentThis can get as far as the test plan is complete, multiply iterated under different interface conditions and thorough. And you are still relying upon the adherence of the simulated models to the physical reality. Real tests do all of this at once with no option to escape reality. Again, one thing is automating thorough software tests, another one is testing physical stuff. reply brianwawok 6 hours agorootparentprevThis is the programmer fallacy if you have a bunch of code passing unit tests, it’s going to work when combined. reply SJC_Hacker 3 hours agorootparentThats not what he said. Unit tests are the first stage, and are very useful at isolating the problem. Integration tests are the next where multiple units are combined. Then there is staging. reply liontwist 3 hours agorootparentprevDid they say that? reply ceejayoz 3 hours agorootparentBoeing did, with Starliner. reply nicky0 7 hours agorootparentprevTest code by running it.

Production is when they include commercial payloads and humans. reply orwin 6 hours agorootparentprevIn production? I don't disagree that tests 'in production' are sometimes necessary (canary tests), but most of the quirks are often fixed by then. Honestly I thought they would be live testing fuel exchange in orbit by now. Seems pretty far from it sadly. reply ricardobeat 6 hours agorootparentThat might still happen this year, it’s the next step in the development plan. What makes these launches “non-production” tests is that they are not carrying any valuable payload. Blowing up rockets like this is exactly what gives the company it’s advantage over competitors who try to anticipate everything during design stages. reply emilecantin 5 hours agorootparentprevThere was no real payload on this, so I'd argue it's closer to a QA environment than production. It's true that other rocket companies are treating launches as production, but SpaceX has always been doing \"hardware-rich\" testing. reply mr_toad 4 hours agorootparentprevTesting their ability to deploy satellites is a short-term goal that will make them money now. Testing refuelling will be needed for Luna and Mars missions, but that’s a long way off anyway. reply pclmulqdq 5 hours agorootparentprevThey had that on the timeline for 2023, so it's reasonable to assume they would do it. reply penjelly 6 hours agorootparentprevlaunching a rocket is far more analogulous to shipping a release, than it is running code. reply askl 5 hours agorootparentprevThank god you're not building rockets. reply mr_toad 4 hours agorootparentTesting to failure is pretty common in rocketry. If you don’t push the limits you’ll never really know where the limits are. reply ls612 3 hours agorootparentprevThis has been SpaceX’s methodology for a long time now and has gotten them to the point where they have the most reliable western launch vehicles ever launching record amounts of mass to orbit each year at record low prices. reply ChrisClark 2 hours agorootparentprevI truly hope that if you ever design a rocket yourself, that you will test it. I have no idea why you'd think testing is a terrible thing to do if it has to do with rockets. reply prerok 1 hour agorootparentI think we all agree that you need to test eventually. I do think most of us would already be double checking for leaks. It just seems one of the obvious things that may go wrong when putting it all together. reply wat10000 1 hour agorootparentThey likely did test it, and it passed. The leak was probably caused by the somewhat violent environment of the launch, and that can’t be entirely replicated on the ground. reply inglor_cz 3 hours agorootparentprevWhy precisely? Can you elaborate? reply Cipater 5 hours agorootparentprevHe just means MORE checking for leaks. They already implemented a whole host of changes to the vehicles after the first test back in 2023. There's a list of corrective actions here. https://imgur.com/a/Y9dd43o reply 14 13 hours agorootparentprevEven NASA years into their existence has suffered catastrophic fatal failures. Even with the best and most knowledgeable experts working on it we are ultimately still in the infancy of space flight. Just like airlines every incident we try and understand the cause and prevent it from happening again. Lastly what they are doing is incredibly difficult with probably thousands of things that could go wrong. I think they are doing an amazing job and hope one day, even if I miss it, that space flight becomes acceptable to all who wish to go to space. reply rob74 8 hours agorootparentI you are referring to the two Space Shuttle accidents, both of them could have been avoided with just a little bit more care - not launching in freezing temperatures for Challenger, and making sure insulation foam doesn't fall off the tank for Columbia. reply thrwthsnw 5 hours agorootparentThe history of rocketry goes much further back than the space shuttle. The shuttle was supposed to be a step towards reusability but didn’t succeed or progress the way they thought it would. Starship is continuing that dream of full reusability and their approach is working. You can’t plan everything on paper when it comes to hardware especially when attempting things that have never been done before, you just don’t have the data in that case. You have to build prototypes and test them to destruction. All manufacturers do this. reply hnaccount_rng 6 hours agorootparentprevIn hindsight yes. The trick is knowing which of the thousands of things to do are necessary. And yes, that’s how you end up with preflight checklists reply razemio 13 hours agorootparentprevCan you name a space company with less failures? Also I think it is unfair to even compare SpaceX to anything else, because of the insane amount of starts / tests combined unparalleled creativity. According to this website their current success rate is 99,18%. That's a good number I guess? Considering other companies did not even land their stages for years. https://spaceinsider.tech/2024/07/31/ula-vs-spacex/#:~:text=.... reply pyrale 11 hours agorootparentSuccess rate isn’t a great metric for efficient initial work: it will keep improving as more launches are done, regardless of the initial work. reply HPsquared 9 hours agorootparentThere's more to \"overall success\" then launch failure rate. Cost and time are very important, which are the other dimensions they are optimizing for here. reply input_sh 11 hours agorootparentprevIt says right there in your source that that figure refers to Falcon in particular. For comparison, Starship's current track record is 3/7 launch failures (+1 landing failure). There's an order of magnitude difference between them. If they were cars, it'd be like comparing the smallest car you can think of vs one of the biggest tanks ever made. reply razemio 9 hours agorootparentI ignored those, since the starship at this stage can be considered a prototype. I am just trying to argue, that calling SpaceX unreliable, especially compared to its competitors and time to market, is bold. reply zarzavat 5 hours agorootparentprevThe usual definition of success for a rocket is getting the payload to the intended orbit. Since Starship doesn't have a payload yet, at least not a real one, its \"success rate\" is not measuring the same thing. I'd say that only the 7th mission was legitimately a failure, because there was some rerouting of flights outside the exclusion zone. The other six missions were successful tests since nothing other than the rocket itself was affected. reply inglor_cz 3 hours agorootparentprevYou cannot compare a mature product to something that is still under initial development. That would be like comparing a 1-y.o.'s ability to run to a 10-y.o.'s. Of course the younger kid doesn't yet control their legs, but that doesn't mean it's going to stumble and fall forever. reply rvnx 10 hours agorootparentprevIt’s like comparing the reliability of the Model 3 and the Cybertruck. reply askl 5 hours agorootparentprevIt's just taxpayer money they're blowing up, so it doesn't really matter. reply jacobr1 3 hours agorootparentThe taxpayer money is for r&d.

Gauging relative distance and altitude between aircraft in flight can be notoriously deceptive even to experts, especially in the case of intensely bright, massive, unfamiliar objects at very high speed and great distance. The RUD was in orbit over 146 kilometers up and >13,000 mph. I'm sure using the FlightAware tracking data someone will work out the actual distance and altitude delta between that plane and the Starship 7 orbital debris. I suspect it was many dozens of miles away and probably still nearly orbital in altitude (~100km). Spectacular light show though... reply aredox 9 hours agorootparentStupid comment. Several flights had to be diverted because of the break-up, and anyone in flight at that time would be rightly concerned about barely-visible high-speed shrapnel showering a much larger area than where the visible debris are - especially when you are responsible for keeping your hundreds of passengers safe in a very unexpected situation with no rehearsed procedure to follow. reply stouset 2 hours agorootparentNobody is saying it wasn’t prudent to divert. It would have been impossible for the pilot to know if that debris was shortly in front of them and at co-altitude or extremely far in front of them and at a significantly higher altitude. In this case it was almost certainly the latter. But the uncertainty alone was enough to warrant diverting. > Stupid comment.

In a similar way as when the moon is low on the horizon and I stand in my back yard facing it. There's the moon. It's right in front of me... :-) reply kryptn 12 hours agorootparentin a way that if they kept their heading there was a higher than acceptable risk of impact and they had to divert, yes. reply mrandish 12 hours agorootparentAs I said, the debris was likely closer to around ~100km in altitude. Commercial airliners fly around ~10km in altitude. Appearing to be at a similar altitude as the plane and \"in front\" of it was an optical illusion because the debris was intensely bright, very far away, very high and moving several times faster than a bullet. While we don't have exact data yet, I believe it is highly likely there was zero chance of that plane ever hitting that debris given their relative positions. It couldn't even if the pilots weren't mistaken about how close the debris was and they had intentionally tried to hit it. The debris was too far, too high and moving at hypersonic speeds (hence the metal being white hot from atmospheric friction). Starship's flight paths are carefully calculated by SpaceX and the FAA to achieve this exact outcome. In the event of a RUD near orbit, little to no debris will survive reentry. Any that does survive won't reach the surface (or aircraft in flight) until it is far out into the Atlantic Ocean away from land, people, flight paths and shipping lanes. For Starship launches the FAA temporarily closes a large amount of space in the Gulf of Mexico to air and ship traffic because that's where Starship is low and slow enough for debris to be a threat to aircraft. These planes were flying in the Caribbean, where there was no FAA NOTAM closing their airspace because by the time Starship is over the Caribbean, it's in orbit. If there's a RUD over the Caribbean it's already too high and going too fast for debris to be a threat to aircraft or people anywhere near the Carribean. The only \"threat\" in the Caribbean today was from anyone being distracted by the pretty light show in orbit far above them (that looked deceptively close from some angles). reply logifail 11 hours agorootparent> the debris was likely closer to around ~100km in altitude. Commercial airliners fly around ~10km in altitude (Not wishing to ask the obvious, and depending on the size of the pieces) debris at 100km altitude pretty much always ends up being debris falling through 10km ... right? reply eps 10 hours agorootparentApparently quite a bit of debris made it to the ground - > The locals here are pissed in Turks and Cacos.

People just love adding to the drama, they will later backtrack and explain that by “rain down” they meant the light show. It would be extremely unlikely due to the laws of physics, last time I checked they were still in effect. reply mrandish 10 hours agorootparentprevAt the incredible speeds Starship was moving (>13,000 mph) by the time it was over the Caribbean, debris from a Starship is expected to burn up by the time it reaches the surface. But you said \"depending on the size\", so let's imagine it's a different spacecraft carrying something that won't entirely burn up, like the Mir space station from several years back. In that scenario, debris from 100km will survive to pass through 10km. The point is: if the mass becomes debris >143km high traveling at >13,000 mph over the Caribbean - it doesn't pass through 10km anywhere near the Caribbean. Even though the friction causing tempered metal to glow white hot is slowing it, the trajectory is ballistic so by the time it slows enough to get that low (10km) it's hundreds or thousands of miles East from where the explosion happened (and where that airplane was). It's weird because given these orbital velocities and altitudes, our intuitions about up and down aren't very useful. Starship exploded in orbit over the Caribbean, so planes in the Caribbean were safe from falling debris. If it was Mir instead of Starship, planes hundreds or thousands miles to the East of the Caribbean would be at elevated risk. My high school astronomy teacher once said something like \"Rockets don't go up to reach orbit. They go sideways. And they keep going sideways faster and faster until they're going so fast, up and down don't matter anymore.\" While that's hardly a scientific summary, it does give a sense of the dynamics. You'll recall that Mir was intentionally de-orbited so it would land in a desolate part of the Indian Ocean. So, did they blow it up right over the Indian Ocean? Nope. To crash it in the Indian Ocean, given the altitude and speed, they \"blew it up\" on the other side of Earth, like maybe over Chicago (I actually don't recall where the de-orbit began, but had to be very far away). reply logifail 10 hours agorootparent> so by the time it slows enough to get that low (10km) it's hundreds or thousands of miles East from where the explosion was seen Appreciate that, the question would be, do we know that there won't be any aircraft at the right (wrong) altitude in that area(?!) With aircraft regularly travelling thousands of miles, would be interesting to know whether route choices are made to avoid being \"under\"* the track of a rocket's launch? There's apparently another video of the debris, this one appears to show very clearly that the debris is \"going sideways\"* rather than coming vertically down https://x.com/kristinafitzsi/status/1880032746032230515?s=61 * apologies for the poor phrasing :) reply mrandish 9 hours agorootparentThere are people on HN far better qualified than I to discuss both orbital mechanics and spacecraft safety assessments but I'll give it a layman's stab based purely on the high-level concepts (which is all I know). They know there's little to no risk to aircraft or people hundreds or thousands of miles to the East of a Starship RUD in orbit because they know exactly what's inside Starship and how it's built. They model how it will break up when traveling at these insane speeds and how the metal masses will melt and burn up during re-entry. They actually test this stuff in blast furnaces. It's a statistical model so it's theoretically possible a few small bits could make it to the ground on rare occasion, so we can't say debris will never happen - but there's been a lot of history and testing and the experts are confident it's extremely safe. The case of the MIR space station was very different than a Starship. MIR was built a long time ago by the Soviet Union and they used a big, heavily shielded power plant. That lead shielding was really the part that had a significant risk of not burning up fully on re-entry. Starship, Starlink satellites and other modern spacecraft are now usually designed to burn up on reentry. However, there are still some things in orbit and things we'll need to put in orbit in the future that won't entirely burn up on reentry. There will always be a very small risk of an accidental uncontrolled reentry causing a threat. However, these risks are vanishingly small both because we design these spacecraft with redundant systems and fail-safes and because Earth is mostly uninhabited oceans, much of our landmasses are unpopulated or sparely populated, even in the unlikely event one of the few spacecraft with a large mass that won't entirely burn up has failed and is de-orbiting out of control, we can still blow it up - and timing that at the right moment will still put it down in a safe place (like it did with MIR). There's no such thing as absolute 100% perfect safety. But you're far, far more likely to die from a great white shark attack than be injured by satellite debris. More to the point, a huge number of meteorites hit Earth every year and it's estimated over 17,000 survive to hit the surface. There are a bunch listed right now on eBay. Do you know anyone injured by any of the 17,000 space rocks that crashed into our planet this year or any airliners hit by one? reply m4rtink 1 hour agorootparentprevThere were quite large areas of airspace closed just for this reason via NOTAMS - with airlines grumbling about that even before launch. reply zardo 2 hours agorootparentprev> At the incredible speeds Starship was moving (>13,000 mph) by the time it was over the Caribbean, debris from a Starship is expected to burn up by the time it reaches the surface.

If my understanding is correct, it seems sensible at least in a hand-wavy way: you have a few places where things are more likely to come down either unplanned or planned (immediately around the launch site and at the planned deorbit area), but then you have a wide swath of the world where, in a relatively localized area, you -might- have something come down with some warning that it will (just because the time it takes to get from altitude to where aircraft are).

It seems like everything went like it was supposed to in terms of pre-warning, but based on the video the information didn't make it to pilots with coinciding flight plans until after the fact. As far as I understand airline pilots have a high level of authority and diverting probably was the right call depending on the lag between seeing it and knowing what it was or if there was a risk of debris reaching them. They wouldn't necessarily know how high it got or what that means for debris. reply sbuttgereit 1 hour agorootparentYeah... and ATC for a good while didn't have any estimate for time to resolution. So, do you run the airplane's fuel down to a minimal reserve level in hopes that the restrictions might lift... or just call it done and divert? I think it's an absolutely reasonable choice to just say comfortably divert rather than try to linger in hopes of it not lasting too long and possibly ending up diverting anyway... but on minimums. reply ralfd 18 hours agorootparentprevUnderstandable, but an over reaction.

Tiny people in space suits climbing down ladders to explore a new world.

Not saying to correct you, just because i think it is a lovely bit of trivia even though it has nothing to do with space debris. Both sailing and power driven vessels need to give ways to (among other things) “vessel restricted in her ability to maneuver”. And an aircraft carrier launching or recovering aircraft is considered to be restricted in her ability to maneuver (quite rightfully so, it is hard enough to land on them without the ship swerving left and right). So that means that a mighty aircraft carrier needs to (at least according to the regulations) dodge tiny sailing ships, but once they start launching or recovering aircraft it is the responsibility of the sailing ship to avoid them.

Simply speaking they come too fast so you can’t maneuver your vessel out of their way, and unless you are a warship you don’t have the tools to even know where exactly they will hit. If you try to run you might even put yourself in their path. After all from the most unlucky position they would be just bright stationary spots on the sky getting ever so slightly bigger.

I guess it doesn't really matter as FTS is just designed to intentionally cause the same kind of RUD that happened anyway. The main criteria is a RUD sufficient to ensure pieces small enough to burn up on reentry. From the looks of the explosion from the videos helpfully captured from the ground, the RUD certainly looked sufficient.

The ship blew up at 145km altitude over Turks and Caicos. Debris would fall thousands of kilometers to the east, if anything survives re-entry. EDIT: at these speeds, over 20000km/h, the falling debris will travel a very long way before coming down. For satellite re-entry, the usual estimated ground contact point is something like 8000km+ downrange [1]. There is little chance debris would come anywhere near commercial flight altitude in the area around where the videos were made. Apparently the planned splashdown was in the Indian Ocean near Australia, but this being an uncontrolled re-entry it could be far off from that, in either direction.

Without air resistance, falling 145 km takes 172 seconds, which would result in the debris falling 956 km east of the explosion point if it were moving horizontal to the ground to begin with. With air resistance, it is substantially shorter as everything is decelerating proportional to the velocity cubed. If we approximate the terminal velocity of the debris as 500 km/h, to a first order approximation it would travel approximately 79 km east. The distance from West Caicos island to Grand Turk island is 138 km, for reference. Satellites are moving much faster and at much higher altitude. Starship was not in orbit. reply s1artibartfast 19 hours agorootparentprevIm not sure what part you are skeptical about.

A possible sequence (very typical in rocket failures) is: fire, engine failure(s), loss of control, rupture due to aero forces or FTS activation, explosion due to propellant mixture.

Still, many of these are more successful than Starship: The first GSLV was still able to deploy a satellite, just in a lower orbit than intended. The first Delta IV had the same problem, satellite deployed, but in a lower orbit than planned. The first Long March 5 is classed as a full success on Wikipedia, I couldn't find info there about a failure (the second one did blow up). The Rocket Labs' Electron did get destroyed. However it was later found that nothing at all was wrong with the vehicle, it was a failure in the ground software, and an identical vehicle successfully carried out its mission 7 months later. In contrast, the first two Starships blew up completely due to engine issues, and no Starship has deployed even a test payload of some kind to orbit. In fact, until today, none even carried a payload of any kind, they have all been flying empty. reply perihelions 4 hours agorootparent- \"The first Long March 5 is classed as a full success on Wikipedia, I couldn't find info there about a failure (the second one did blow up).\" The Wikipedia entry describes it as \"suboptimal but workable initial orbit\", which I interpret as a partial failure (coming from a military entity that's universally opaque about its failings). They're not inclined for language like \"partial failure\" that we get out of transparent countries—contrast that first Delta IV-H, which also reached a \"workable\" orbit—just not the intended one. - \"However it was later found that nothing at all was wrong with the vehicle, it was a failure in the ground software, and an identical vehicle successfully carried out its mission 7 months later.\" Also true of the Ariane 5 explosion: that was a software bug (unhandled integer overflow) in the flight control unit. The important part isn't whether it's hardware or software, but whether they got it right or not, before launch. reply throw5959 1 hour agorootparentprevCompare how much money each company spent before the first/second/etc flight. The ENTIRE program has so far cost less than one set of SLS engines - that they took from older rockets without changes. They have explicitly and publicly chosen to rapidly iterate without spending billions to make sure the first try goes well - it's simply different culture. Call me when any other company achieves what Falcon9 did, then we can discuss issues of SpaceX engineering culture and how others are better. But they are not, few test flights are not interesting, what's interesting is that they are 10 years ahead of everybody else and offer by far the cheapest and by orders of magnitude most reliable orbital lift service. Others should stop waiting 10 years before the first flight and accept some risk, the world would be much better by now. reply me_me_me 6 hours agorootparentprevthis doesn't even scratch the surface.

Let's just build a body by welding steel plates together and see what happens. Let's just launch this thing to 20 miles and see if we can make it aerobrake and land it with the engines.

SpaceX gets credit and rightly so because they have achieved things which no national space agency nor private company has ever done before, and done it faster and at a lower budget than anyone has done before. Every other national space agency and private company had both infinitely more money, time, and engineers than SpaceX did (when founded) yet they were making zero progress on reusable rockets, cheap super heavy lift capacity to orbit, and America had no way of taking their own astronauts to the space station! Musk (hate him or love him) founded a company from nothing which has exceeded the capabilities of nasa and the us government, the European space agency, and the russian space agency, as well as ULA, Boeing, Lockheed etc. They have the first rocket ever made which can take payloads to orbit and then be reused. They have the most cost effective rocket ever made for taking loads to orbit. They have reused rockets up to 20 times! They have build the most powerful rocket ever built which is fully reusable. They have built the most efficient and powerful rocket engines ever built before. And they have done it all incredibly quickly starting from nothing. Oh and they also built a massive internet constellation providing fast and cheap satellite internet to the whole world, saving countless lives and also helping stimulate economies across the world as well as enabling more remote work etc. So much of what they have done was considered impossible or not economical or not practical or so difficult other countries or companies didn’t even TRY. So yes. Given their success it’s worth trying to understand their development methodology, which is iterate fast and fail lots and learn lots. Given how much they’ve kicked the shit out of the SLS program in capability and budget and also how they’ve crushed Blue Origin (which started earlier with more budget) who both operate in a more old fashioned way, I would certainly say it’s important to acknowledge they may be doing something right! reply tsimionescu 6 hours agorootparentThe achievements you quote are highly overblown. SpaceX sells capacity to orbit somewhat cheaper than anyone else on the market, but not by some huge margin - half the cost or so, at best. They also don't have any fully reusable rockets today, and Starship is still probably a year or more from being production-ready. It remains to be seen how reusable Starship will actually be, how long it will take to refurbish and get ready for spaceflight, and how many reentries it can actually take. And it still remains to be seen how much Starship will actually gain from being fully reusable, by the way - landing a rocket costs lots of extra fuel, so it's not a no-brainer that a fully reusable rocket would have a much better cost/kg-to-orbit than a non reusable one. Especially for anything higher than LEO, Starship can't actually carry enough fuel, so it depends on expensive additional launches to refuel in orbit - a maneoveur that will probably take another year or more to finalize, and that greatly increases the cost of a Starship mission beyond LEO. Finally, Starlink is nice, but it's extremely expensive for most users outside very rich areas of the world, and has in no way had the impact you are claiming. Laying out cable internet is FAR cheaper than satellite internet can ever be, especially in rural areas, so beyond cases where cables and even wireless are completely impossible (ocean, war-torn areas), it doesn't and won't ever have any major impact. I'm also very curious where you got the idea that it \"saved countless lives\". reply jve 5 hours agorootparentFeels weird to read such comments on HN. 10 years ago people were talking that landing rockets is impossible. Then whether they can be reused. Then whether there is any economical gain doing so. As for starlink - they have explosive revenue growth. Alot of businesses want one. Planes, ships, trains, military, rural areas, they are actually profiting from the operations and not loosing money and I still have to read comments like that. Btw ULA reasonable launch price of today is because of SpaceX competition > ULA was awarded a DoD contract in December 2013 to provide 36 rocket cores for up to 28 launches. The award drew protest from SpaceX, which said the cost of ULA's launches were approximately US$460 million each and proposed a price of US$90 million to provide similar launches.[16] In response, Gass said ULA's average launch price was US$225 million, with future launches as low as US$100 million. I suspect SpaceX margins are very high and they can fund the starship development. Margins/prices may change as BO reaches reusability. reply tsimionescu 4 hours agorootparent> 10 years ago people were talking that landing rockets is impossible. Maybe some. Others had been working on this in the 90s already. Not to mention Spaceshuttle, which achieved these milestones (with a vastly different design) in production. > Then whether they can be reused. Then whether there is any economical gain doing so. Reuse is currently partial. The economic advantages have largely failed to materialize, at least to the extent that they were promised. > Btw ULA reasonable launch price of today is because of SpaceX competition Why compare to ULA? Look at Ariane 6, or Soyuz-2 - they have similar numbers to Falcon 9. Falcon 9 is 22 800 kg to LEO for $70M. Ariane 6 is 21 500 kg to LEO for $115M. Soyuz-2 is 8600kg to LEO for $35-48M (so about $92-129M for a Falcon 9's worth of cargo). More expensive, but not by some huge margin. > As for starlink - they have explosive revenue growth. Alot of businesses want one. Planes, ships, trains, military, rural areas, they are actually profiting from the operations and not loosing money and I still have to read comments like that. This is a completely different take than the previous comment. Sure, it's successful in the developped world in certain industries. This is nothing like \"saving countless lives\" or \"helping stimulate economies across the world\", which is what I was responding to. reply TrapLord_Rhodo 3 hours agorootparentYour using how much they charge, not how much it costs... You seem to not understand any kind of sales strategy or atleast basic game theory here. >More expensive, but not by some huge margin. Obviously no matter what it costs them, they are going to price themselves slightly under the going rate to fill their launch manifest. Also, they get to CHARGE THIS ~20 TIMES PER VEHICLE. Reuse is cheaper... the fact that you can even begin to contemplate that makes no sense. They lose the upstage with only one engine and they even recover the fairing. The combined cost for RP-1 and LOX is approximately $300,000–$500,000. Relative to total launch cost the fuel cost makes up a tiny fraction (~0.5–1%), which is about $67 million for a Falcon 9 commercial launch. Also with your calculations you conveniently leave of the super heavy which has a ~$1,500KG per dolar with a ~$97 million price tag carrying ~63,800 kg. Which is a 1/10th of the cost of KG to LEO than their competitors. The loss of the upper stage is around $10–15 million. This includes the engine, structure, and integration. So by saving that in starship and boosting the payload to 150k KG you get a KG/LEO of 10, where the next nearest competitor is the Proton-M",

Although President-elect Donald Trump could choose to not enforce the law, it's unclear whether third-party internet service providers will support the app. Under the terms of the law, service providers such as Apple and Google will be penalized for supporting TikTok after the law's deadline. In this article AAPL Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT Jaap ArriensNurphotoGetty Images The Supreme Court on Friday upheld the law requiring China-based ByteDance to divest its ownership of TikTok by Sunday or face an effective ban of the popular social video app in the U.S. ByteDance has so far refused to sell TikTok, meaning many U.S. users could lose access to the app this weekend. The app may still work for those who already have TikTok on their phones, although ByteDance has also threatened to shut the app down. In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court sided with the Biden administration, upholding the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which President Joe Biden signed in April. \"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community,\" the Supreme Court's opinion said. \"But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok's data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary.\" Supreme Court Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Neil Gorsuch wrote concurrences. TikTok's fate in the U.S. now lies in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who originally favored a TikTok ban during his first administration, but has since flip-flopped on the matter. In December, Trump asked the Supreme Court to pause the law's implementation and allow his administration \"the opportunity to pursue a political resolution of the questions at issue in the case.\" In a post on his social media app Truth Social, Trump wrote that the decision was expected \"and everyone must respect it.\" \"My decision on TikTok will be made in the not too distant future, but I must have time to review the situation. Stay tuned!\" Trump wrote. Trump began to speak more favorably of TikTok after he met in February with billionaire Republican megadonor Jeff Yass. Yass is a major ByteDance investor who also owns a stake in the owner of Truth Social. Trump will be inaugurated Monday, one day after the TikTok deadline for a sale. TikTok CEO Shou Chew is one of several tech leaders expected to be in attendance, seated on the dais. In a video posted on TikTok, Chew thanked Trump \"for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available\" in the U.S. He said use of TikTok is a First Amendment right, adding that over 7 million American businesses use it to make money and find customers. \"Rest assured, we will do everything in our power to ensure our platform thrives as your online home for limitless creativity and discovery as well as a source of inspiration and joy for years to come,\" he said. WATCH NOW VIDEO05:51 It's pretty clear Trump likes TikTok and is going to save it, says LightShed's Rich Greenfield The nation's highest court said in the opinion that while \"data collection and analysis is a common practice in this digital age,\" the sheer size of TikTok and its \"susceptibility to foreign adversary control, together with the vast swaths of sensitive data the platform collects\" poses a national security concern. Under the terms of the law, third-party internet service providers such as Apple and Google will be penalized for supporting a ByteDance-owned TikTok after the Jan. 19 deadline. If service providers and app store owners comply, consumers will be unable to install the necessary updates that make the app functional. Representatives of TikTok did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Users look for alternatives White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre reiterated Biden's support for the law in a statement, saying \"TikTok should remain available to Americans, but simply under American ownership or other ownership that addresses the national security concerns identified by Congress in developing this law.\" \"Given the sheer fact of timing, this Administration recognizes that actions to implement the law simply must fall to the next Administration, which takes office on Monday,\" Pierre said. Attorney General Merrick Garland and Lisa Monaco, his deputy, said in a release that the decision \"enables the Justice Department to prevent the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok to undermine America's national security.\" Kate Ruane, the director of the Center for Democracy and Technology nonprofit, criticized the ruling, saying in a statement that it \"harms the free expression of hundreds of millions of TikTok users in this country and around the world.\" In December, members of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party sent letters to Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, urging the executives to begin preparing to comply with the law. Shou Zi Chew, CEO of TikTok, speaks to reporters outside the office of Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) at the Russell Senate Office Building on March 14, 2024 in Washington, DC. Anna MoneymakerGetty Images On Jan. 10, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments from lawyers representing TikTok, content creators and the U.S. government. TikTok's lead lawyer, Noel Francisco, argued that the law violates the First Amendment rights of the app's 170 million American users. U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar argued that the app's alleged ties to the Chinese government pose a national security threat. Many TikTok creators have been telling their fans to find them on competing social platforms such as Google's YouTube and Meta's Facebook and Instagram, CNBC reported. Additionally, Instagram leaders scheduled meetings after the Jan. 10 Supreme Court hearing to direct workers to prepare for a wave of users if the court upholds the law. Chinese social media app and TikTok look-alike RedNote rose to the top of Apple's app store Monday, indicating that TikTok's millions of users were seeking alternatives. The Chinese government also weighed a contingency plan that would have X owner Elon Musk acquire TikTok's U.S. operations as part of several options intended to keep the app from its effective ban in the U.S., Bloomberg News reported Monday. Should ByteDance decide to sell TikTok to a U.S. company or group of investors, potential buyers may have to pay between $40 billion and $50 billion, according to an estimate by CFRA Research Senior Vice President Angelo Zino.

See the story at https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42739855 for more details. But basically, TikTok executives had to agree to let ByteDance monitor their personal devices, swear oaths to uphold various goals of the CCP (“national unity” “socialism” etc), report to both a US-based manager and a China-based manager, uphold the CCP’s moderation/censorship scheme, and so on.

China has had such social networks for a long time. Their Weibo and Xiaohongshu are two prominent examples. Weibo started as a copycat of Twitter, but then beats Twitter hands-down with faster iterations, better features, and more vibrant user engagement despite the gross censorship imposed by the government. My guess is that TT can still thrive without American content, as long as other governments do not interfere as the US did. A potential threat to TT is that the US still has the best consumer market, so creators may still flock to a credible TT-alternative for better monetization, thus snatching away TT's current user base in other countries. reply myrloc 1 hour agorootparentAre Weibo and Xiaohongshu used widely outside of China?

This case is decided not on some strict analysis of the words written by a legislator, but on the court’s subjective view that there is a compelling national interest (which in turn seems based on speculation about the future, rather than a factual analysis of events). Textualism might give the court some useful definitions, but it is after all still called, quite literally, an opinion. reply rayiner 2 hours agoparentYou misapprehend what textualism is. It does not say that every legal case can be decided by interpreting written law. It is merely a philosophy of how to interpret written law when its meaning is what's at issue. What American lawyers call \"textualism\" is how most continental european courts interpret written laws. It would hardly merit a label, if it wasn't for a long history in the 20th century of jurists departing from written law in making decisions. In this case, there is no dispute about what the written law means. It's about applying a pre-existing legal concept, the freedom of speech, to particular facts. Another example that highlights the distinction: Justice Gorsuch, one of the Supreme Court's preeminent textualists, is also one of the biggest proponents of criminal rights. Those cases similarly involve defining the contours of pre-existing legal concepts, such as \"unreasonable search or seizure.\" Nobody denies that such questions are subjective--in referring to what's \"unreasonable,\" the text itself calls for a subjective analysis. reply lolinder 1 hour agorootparentFor anyone curious to dig into this more, the terms to read up on are \"common law\" [0] vs \"civil law\" [1].

Certain aspects of the intelligence relationships between the US and China are highly asymmetrical already. For example, Chinese nationals can enter our country and gather information on our infrastructure, corporations, and people with relative ease because English is prevalent, and foreign nationals have, with the exception of certain military/research areas, the same access that US citizens have. On the other hand, foreign nationals in China are closely monitored and have very few rights, assuming they know Chinese, are physically in China (Great Firewall), and know how to get around in the first place. China has unfettered access to our media ecosystem, research, patents, etc., and they do their best to create an uncompetitive/hostile environment for any other country to attempt the same on their territory.

Unlike those phrases, however, the general words “in commerce” and the specific phrase “engaged in commerce” are understood to have a more limited reach. In Allied-Bruce itself the Court said the words “in commerce” are “oftenfound words of art” [...] The Court’s reluctance to accept contentions that Congress used the words “in commerce” or “engaged in commerce” to regulate to the full extent of its commerce power rests on sound foundation, as it affords objective and consistent significance to the meaning of the words Congress uses when it defines the reach of a statute.[0] [0] Circuit City Stores, Inc. v.

Further more, \"Corporations are people\" implying corporations have rights isn't related to corporate personhood and is based on a (often deliberate by opposing politicians) misinterpretation of the phrase, as spoken by Mitt Romney. What Romney was saying and what is true when he said \"Corporations are people\" is confusing because people interpret it as \"Corporations are persons\" which is not what he, or the case law he was referring to implied. The singular of the phrase is much more clear, a corporation is people. The whole case was about a group of people pooling their funds to make a movie about Hilary Clinton being bad and the court found that the people still had free speech rights when acting through a corporation to pool their funds and so political donation limits didn't apply as long as no political campaign was involved.

It's not an erosion because it was already true and has been true for centuries. reply andrewmg 23 minutes agoparentprevSince I'm a reasonably well-known textualist, I'll bite: First, the court was not asked to reconsider the meaning of the First Amendment. In the US, we generally hew to the rule of \"party presentation,\" which generally provides that courts will consider the parties' arguments, not make up new ones on their own. TikTok's claim was that application of the statute in question to it violated the First Amendment's clause that \"Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech.\" The Supreme Court has considered the interpretation and application of that clause in...well, a whole lot of cases. TikTok asked the court to apply the logic of certain of those precedents to rule in its favor and enjoin the statute. It did not, however, ask the court to reconsider those precedents or interpret the First Amendment anew. Since the court was not asked to do so, it's no surprise that it didn't. Second, as noted, the court has literally decades' worth of cases fleshing out the meaning of this clause and applying it in particular circumstances. Every textualist, so far as I'm aware, generally supports following the court's existing precedents interpreting the Constitution unless and until they are overruled. Third, even if one is of the view that the Court ought to consider the text anew in every case, without deferring to its prior rulings interpreting the text, this would have been a particularly inappropriate case for it to do so. A party seeking an injunction, as TikTok was, has to show a strong likelihood of success on the merits. That generally entails showing that you win under existing precedent. A court's expedited consideration of a request for preliminary relief is not an appropriate time to broach a new theory of what the law requires. The court doesn't have the time to give it the consideration required, and asking the court to abrogate its precedents is inconsistent with the standard for a preliminary injunction, which contemplates only a preview of the ultimate legal question, not a full-blown resolution of it. Fourth, what exactly was the court supposed to do with the text in question, which is \"abridging the freedom of speech\"? The question here is whether the statute here, as applied to TikTok, violates that text. Well, it depends on what \"the freedom of speech\" means and perhaps what \"abridging\" means. It's only natural that a court would look to precedent in answering the question. Precedent develops over time, fleshing out (or \"liquidating,\" to use Madison's term) the meaning and application of ambiguous or general language. Absent some compelling argument that precedent got the meaning wrong, that sort of case-by-case development of the law is how our courts have always functioned--and may be, according to some scholars, itself a requirement of originalism. reply sjsdaiuasgdia 3 hours agoparentprevIt's opinion regardless of the specific legal philosophy.

The reason for the ban, agree with it or not, is the perceived control and data sharing with the Chinese government made possible by many things (mainly that they are HQ'd in that government's jurisdiction and then have all of these other potentially concerning details, not that they just have one of these other details). If the NYT were seen as being under significant control of and risking sharing too much user data with the Chinese government then it would indeed make sense to apply the same ban. Personally, I'm still on the fence about the ban. On one hand having asymmetry in one side banning such things and the other not is going to be problematic.

Further strengthen the Party building work of private enterprises and sincerely give full play to the role of Party organizations (党组织) as battle fortresses and to the vanguard and exemplary role of Party members. > Enhance ideological guidance: Guide private economy practitioners to increase their awareness of self-discipline; build a strong line of ideological and moral defense; strictly regulate their own words and actions [1]: https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/publi... reply kube-system 1 hour agorootparentprevChina's economic reform didn't quite embrace capitalism the same way many other places did. Their businesses still inherently do not have the same managerial independence that many have come to expect as normal in the rest of the world. While Chinese businesses are allowed to have some private control, the government still exercises control over \"private\" businesses when they decide they are important or large enough. Imagine if all Fortune 500 companies were required to have Trump appointees on their boards. That would sound crazy here, but that's how things still work in China. reply randomcatuser 1 hour agorootparentprevThe divestiture clause is just a red herring -- sure, that sounds perfectly fine. But you can substitute it (in the future) with anything. In the future, the owners of a free press will be permitted to operate if and only if there is board seat made out to a CIA member. Unions will be permitted to congregate as long as they register with the Office of Trade Security All in all, a huge blow to the potential power of individual rights (essentially goes to the Founding Fathers' point that having a list of rights set in stone is NOT the end-all, be-all, it's who decides the rights that count) reply beezlebroxxxxxx 2 hours agoparentprev> But why didn't Supreme Court find the first ammendment arguments compelling? As per first ammendment it is legal and protected to print/distribute/disseminate even enemy propaganda in the USA. > Even at the height of cold war for example Soviet Publications were legal to publish, print and distribute in the USA. That was explicitly brought up in oral arguments by the court, and the response by the US Gov was: \"The act is written to be content neutral.\" The court's opinion explains that they agree the law is \"appropriately tailored\" to remain content neutral. Whether it's \"enemy propaganda\" or not is, in their view, irrelevant to the application of the law. TikTok can exist in America, using TikTok is not banned, the owner just can't be a deemed \"foreign adversary\", which there is a history of enforcement (to some degree). reply throwaway199956 1 hour agorootparentLike such cannot be enforced for example against foreign radio stations or print publications. Then how do court justify that it stands in the case of an app. reply lcnPylGDnU4H9OF 1 hour agorootparentAs I understand, a print publication can't have a business entity in the US if it's owned by a foreign adversary. Given that, an American could still travel to the foreign country themselves and bring an issue back. That would be similar to side loading apps. In order to comply with the law, Apple and Google cannot distribute the app because it is deemed to be unlawfully owned by a foreign adversary; that's the ban. But anyone who wants to get it through other means can still do so. Presuming that's how it works, it doesn't seem to be logically different from radio/print media. reply throwaway199956 1 hour agorootparentSoviet Life Magazine for example was printed and sold in the US by the Soviet Embassy. reply arp242 8 minutes agorootparentI don't really know the exact legal situation surrounding this, but the viewpoint that in the past Soviet propaganda could be freely distributed in the US a rather curious viewpoint. The US government spent decades chasing down (alleged) communists, both using hard power and soft power, and many were effectively silenced, and many more never even dared to speak up. So whatever the exact legal situation was the time, a free speech utopia where even enemies of the US had free reign did not exist. De-facto free speech was significantly more restricted on this topic. reply lcnPylGDnU4H9OF 1 hour agorootparentprevThat makes me curious about the details; it's worth noting that the Soviet Embassy's physical location would be Soviet sovereign land that is licensed to them by the US so long as they are allowed to maintain an embassy presence. If people go onto the embassy to buy the magazine, they are literally traveling to a foreign country to buy it. reply empath75 39 minutes agorootparentprevThat something is allowed doesn't mean that it's guaranteed in the constitution. In that particular case, it was a result of an agreement with the Soviet government that allowed us to publish Amerika magazine in the USSR. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amerika_(magazine) reply beezlebroxxxxxx 1 hour agorootparentprev> Like such cannot be enforced for example against foreign radio stations or print publications. If the law and acts calling for their divestiture were deemed \"content neutral\" then they could. But an app, with algorithmic profiling, delivery, and data capture, for the purposes of modeling and influence, is not the same as a radio station or a publication, so it would probably not be easy or even possible to the SC's standards to write a content neutral law in that way. But they have deemed that with apps like TikTok, when done so carefully, it is possible and divestiture can be enforced neutral of content. We don't need to stick our head in the sand and act like TikTok is the same as a print publication. The SC's decision, and Gorsuch's opinion in particular, is carefully written to not fundamentally rewrite the First Amendment, I'd urge you to read it. reply ruilov 1 hour agoparentprevThe replies here seem slightly off base. The Court acknowledges that 1s amm. free speech issues are at play. A law can regulate non-expressive activity (corporate ownership) while still burdening expressive activity, which is the case here. In such instances, the Court grants Congress more leeway compared to laws explicitly targeting speech. It checks that (1) the govt has an important interest unrelated to speech (it does), and (2) the law burdens no more speech than necessary (arguable, but not obviously wrong) reply gwbas1c 14 minutes agoparentprevTo oversimplify: You can say whatever you want on a telephone call. BUT: The telephone network is regulated. Your cell phone must comply with FCC regulations. You personally may have a restraining order that prohibits you from calling certain people. IE, if a phone is found to violate FCC rules, pulling it from the market has little to do with the first amendment. reply DangitBobby 11 minutes agorootparentIf thise FCC rules were designed specifically with the intent to suppress speech by certain parties, they could be found in violation if your first amendment rights of challenged. IMO the text of the ruling does not convince me the purpose of the regulation was not to suppress speech. reply pantalaimon 9 minutes agorootparentprevThe FCC doesn't make rules based on who owns the telephone though. reply thinkingtoilet 1 hour agoparentprevThe first amendment doesn't apply here. You can say whatever you want anywhere else on the internet. You can print what you want anywhere you want. You can distribute what you want anywhere you want.

(It’s in the opinion.) It just isn’t the Wild Draw 4 some people imagine it to be. You can’t commit fraud or libel or false advertising and claim First Amendment protection. Similarly, there are levels of scrutiny when the government claims national security to shut down a media platform. reply throwaway199956 1 hour agorootparentprevThat is not the point of the First Ammendment, it is that Government cannot stop anyone from saying/printing/dissemination of content. So question if government has power to do so. Can they ban RT? Or even the BBC, if the government found it wise to do so? reply psunavy03 2 hours agoparentprevThis case was not about speech. It was about a vehicle for speech having a high risk of being used for espionage and PSYOPS. If TikTok was the only vehicle available for people to post on the internet, then maybe the First Amendment argument would hold water. This decision doesn't tell people they can't speak any more than, say, shutting down a specific TV station or newspaper which has been used for money laundering or which is broadcasting obscene content. reply nickelpro 2 hours agorootparentThe case is entirely about speech, and the various levels of scrutiny that apply to laws that violate the First Amendment. You should read the decision before commenting on what was argued and decided in said decision. reply nickelpro 2 hours agoparentprevThere weren't any laws passed banning Soviet associated agencies from publishing based on chain of ownership. Nothing to do with SCOTUS. Read the opinion, the law was upheld on intermediate scrutiny. It doesn't ban based on content, it bans based on the designation of the foreign parent as an adversary. Since it's not a content ban, or rather because it's a content-neutral ban, strict scrutiny does not apply. Without strict scrutiny, the law merely needs to fulfill a compelling government interest. reply nashashmi 53 minutes agoparentprevThe justices said this was not about first amendment. It was about security and securing the users in the country reply paxys 2 hours agoparentprevCreating and distributing in the USA, sure. That is allowed. This is why the government isn't regulating Chinese content on Instagram, for example. The issue here is that TikTok \"content\" (aka the algorithm that decides what content you get to see) is created abroad and controlled from abroad. The data collected by the app goes abroad. So then it becomes an import/export issue, and the government can and does regulate that. This is why the government has already agreed to letting TikTik be run by a US entity. You can have the same content and same algorithm, just kept within the borders of the USA. reply iLoveOncall 2 hours agoparentprevTikTok doesn't do speech. Users on TikTok do speech. Banning TikTok doesn't prevent any users from printing / distributing / disseminating their speech. The first amendment doesn't have any provision regarding the potential reach or enablement of distribution of the speech of the people. reply gmd63 1 hour agorootparentAgreed. TikTok allows people to speak into the app, and to receive speech, but the act of organizing and strategically disseminating the speech is not speech -- it's societal scale hormone regulation and should be controlled for the health of the national body. It's wild that so many people are up in arms about TikTok when it is a Chinese app that is banned in China, where apps are heavily restricted. For anyone who does consider these algorithms speech, I challenge you to share a single person at any social media company who has taken direct responsibility over a single content feed of an individual user. How can speech exist if nobody is willing to take ownership of it? reply Cookingboy 1 hour agorootparent>the act of organizing and strategically disseminating the speech is not speech It is, and the court acknowledged that editorial control is protected speech. The ruling was made based on data privacy ground, not First Amendment Speech ground. reply joshfee 46 minutes agorootparentThe case law around editorial control is at odds with most platforms' section 230 protection, which makes the fact that TikTok argued that its algorithm _is_ speech pretty different from how most platforms have argued to date (in order to preserve their section 230 protections) reply gmd63 33 minutes agorootparentprevI've understood that social media companies deliberately do not identify as editors because they don't want to be responsible for generated feeds of users. Is this wrong? This is why I'm asking to see evidence of a specific person from a social media company taking direct responsibility over a user's consumed content. reply cududa 2 hours agorootparentprevThat last sentence needs to be taught in every civics class.

What were those blockchain people up to again? reply reaperducer 31 minutes agorootparentan technofeudal oligarch Like the CCP? reply stefan_ 2 hours agoparentprevBecause this is not about the first amendment? This just happens to be a company that runs a social network. Congress regulates commerce with foreign nations and made the decision, as it has in many other cases, that a foreign nation can not be the beneficial owner of TikTok. TikTok then made no effort to divest, giving away the game if you want, and predictably lost this challenge. reply nickelpro 2 hours agorootparentThe arguments presented to the SCOTUS and the opinion itself are totally contained within the context of the First Amendment. No one is even arguing about anything other than the First Amendment and the exceptions permitted to that amendment. reply stefan_ 2 hours agorootparentWell, yes, because that is the only hope TikTok had - to claim it was targeted because of the speech on TikTok, and not because this is a very boring case of regulating commerce, which as said is well established and has lots of precedent. And their expensive lawyers made it happen, when they should have been looking for buyers. And then SCOTUS unanimously said nah. reply nickelpro 1 hour agorootparentSCOTUS fully agreed that the law violates the First Amendment as written, it wasn't even a question at any level from the district court on up. The decision was balanced on strict or intermediate scrutiny. At the distict court level it was observed that the case should probably be decided via intermediate scrutiny, but they upheld the ban under strict scrutiny due to \"national security concerns\". The SCOTUS didn't bother with strict scrutiny or national security, and decided that the correct analysis was intermediate scrutiny and that the ban merely needed to serve a compelling government interest (which regulation of applications controlled by foreign adversaries meets). It's entirely about speech, the only question in the entire case as decided at the district and SCOTUS level was speech. Whether the government should be allowed to violate the 1st Amendment due to compelling interest is everything the case turns on. Personally, I think using intermediate scrutiny here is wild. reply stale2002 49 minutes agorootparentEven under strict scrutiny the law survives. Thats what the district court held. So that point doesn't even matter. reply tw18328 1 hour agoparentprevPrint media is different. It is much more exhausting to read a newspaper because critical thinking circuits are automatically engaged. You are more removed from the content because everything is in the physical world. And even within a single newspaper there are so many different topics that it is hard to be in a bubble. The Internet automatically leads to bubble creation, 200 character messages and indoctrination. It is more like loudspeakers they had in villages during Mao's tenure blaring politically correct messages. Or like the Volksempfänger (radio) during the Nazi era. Interestingly, many of the most destructive revolutions happened after the widespread use of radio. Of course the Internet isn't nearly as bad, but most people are completely unable to even consider a view outside of their indoctrination bubble. reply throwaway199956 1 hour agorootparentAs far as first ammendment it does make no difference if it is print or voice or online service. reply DoneWithAllThat 1 hour agoparentprevLike you can just go read the opinion.

The First Amendment is limited by compelling government interest, which (in practice) means it can be fairly arbitrarily by SCOTUS. https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/post/what-the-first-amendmen... reply nickelpro 2 hours agorootparentprevThe SCOTUS opinion does not rely on a national security interest to justify itself, merely that the ban is content neutral and thus is subject to intermediate scrutiny. reply throwaway199956 1 hour agorootparentWhat does intermediate scrutiny mean? reply nickelpro 1 hour agorootparenthttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_scrutiny reply Spunkie 2 hours agorootparentprevThis is an especially superficial take, sure the Constitution says nothing about national security but reality sure does... Any person that has ever gotten a security clearance has given up some of their first amendment rights to do it and if they talk about the wrong thing to the wrong person they will absolutely go to jail. And as always the classic example of free speech being limited still stands. Go yell FIRE in a crowded movie and see how your dumbass 1st amendment argument keeps you out of jail. reply xigency 1 hour agorootparentBit of a non-sequitor here but the classic example of yelling 'Fire' in a theater has me thinking about public safety. Obviously there have been many crowd-crush related injuries and fatalities throughout history. But we've also come a long way since the 1800's or 1900's with fire drills, emergency exits, etc. It almost seems like any hazard or danger from a false alarm (intentional or otherwise) should be the liability of the owners or operators of a property for unsafe infrastructure or improper safety briefing. Anyway, I don't expect that to appear as a major legal issue, given this is primarily used as a rhetorical example. reply croes 2 hours agorootparentprevLets face the truth, the user get what they want, no need to manipulate.

(charleshughsmith.substack.com)375 points by spking 18 hours agohidepastfavorite922 comments tobyhinloopen 11 hours agoAmerican, living in area prone to natural disasters: \"Is the WHOLE WORLD becoming uninsurable?\" The answer is obviously \"no\" since there are other parts of the world that don't live on a hurricane highway nor build houses made from firewood in an area prone to wildfires. reply chillfox 4 hours agoparentIt’s possible that solve the hurricane problems with proper building regulations and lower the risk of huge wildfires with controlled burning. But the US as always prefers to pretend that there’s nothing to be done when other parts of the world has figured it out. We have cyclones here similar to the hurricanes in the US and usually it just blows over some trees maybe causes a power outage. The absolute worst I have experienced was 3 days without power. I have never seen a house destroyed by a cyclone here. As for wildfires, they do unfortunately claim a few houses most years. reply horsawlarway 4 hours agorootparentHurricanes are mostly just flood damage in the US, and some wind/debris damage exactly like the blown over trees you mention. Houses generally aren't destroyed by hurricanes in the sense of \"the storm literally ripped them up\", they're made uninhabitable by storm surges (flood). The scary ones are tornados. And tornados do genuinely fuck shit up. Even in those \"enlightened\" parts of the world you think have proper building regulations. If you're interested, go look at the recaps of tornado damage where they hit Europe here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_tornadoes_and... Note the number of homes destroyed and people killed - plenty of both, even in those countries that prefer brick/concrete homes. Hurricanes throw branches. Tornados throw cars. reply petsfed 1 hour agorootparentTornadoes are quite a bit less common outside of North America, and especially the US. Some of that comes down to the absence of people in the places where tornadoes occur, so there's no one there to report them. The Tornado Archive (https://tornadoarchive.com/) has a pretty well executed map to illustrate that. They report that between 2011 and 2021 (just the dates I punched in, so its possible the actual ratio is a bit different from that), the world saw ~20,000 reported tornadoes. North America reported 12,000 of them. So its not just that Americans maybe don't know how to build tornado resistant structures. Its that the US and Canada's per-capita tornado rate is quite a bit higher than the rest of the world. reply blharr 3 hours agorootparentprevTornados might be more intense but only for a short period of time and in a small area. I don't see any of those where the tornado is lasting days, causing sustained damage. There are some where there are multiple tornadoes in a span, but each individual tornado is itself quick and violent but localized within a mile or so at most. Compare some incidents with, Hurricane Sandy, for example, where it traveled across the span of a thousand miles and lasted a week of damages. reply bee_rider 2 hours agorootparentYes. Tornadoes seem like a phenomenon for which insurance is actually a pretty good part of the solution. I mean, it is very unlikely for anything in particular to get hit by a tornado, but it is really devastating. It might take an unreasonable amount of work to build everything to the level where it can sustain a direct hit by a tornado. The expected value of tornado damage is quite low overall, we just need to deal with the individual catastrophes that occur. Hurricanes… I mean, there are different sized hurricanes in different areas. For the ones that hit Florida, part of the solution is probably legitimately that we should have fewer people living there, because there’s going to be a widespread devastation there occasionally. And if you live in a hurricane-prone area, you are going to get hit by one eventually. (So like what’s the bet here? The insurance company knows they’ll probably have to pay out eventually). Just to put a number to it, 2024 was apparently an unusually busy year for tornadoes, around $6B. That isn’t nothing! But one single hurricane cost $7B in 2024… and there was a $34B one… and a $79B one… who’s insuring the southern coast of the US? Seems rough. reply Dylan16807 3 hours agorootparentprevIf you have to be inside one, pick a hurricane. But tornadoes are so much smaller. This list is like... 10-20 per year with an average of less than 1 casualty and a dozen houses damaged? That's basically zero as far as insurance and habitability go. I found a study titled \"Tornadoes in Europe An Underestimated Threat\" and it has an estimate of 10-50 million euros per year in total damage. That's not even 1 euro per house in Europe. reply 0u89e 1 hour agorootparentprevLet's not be silly here. European tornadoes are not taking apart houses to the foundations. Ripping off roofs or flipping over cars or even when trees are falling on a tourist tent and killing them in process has nothing to do with how houses are built in USA and nowadays even in UK and elsewhere. reply LeifCarrotson 2 hours agorootparentprevThe real problem is that we're politically/socially unwilling to transfer the risk to the people who are responsible for creating it: Wealthy coastal landowners believe that the cost of home insurance should be about $2000/year. If their properties actually cost $200,000 per year to insure, then that's what they should have to pay! If they don't like it, they should either build something cheaper (that's the other half of the product) or move to somewhere with less risk. Tornados are almost the perfect example of an insurable hazard: Very low probability, very high damage, very widely distributed across the affected areas: https://mrcc.purdue.edu/gismaps/cntytorn# Click around that neat interactive map, you'll see that the tornado is typically a few miles long and a few hundred yards wide, there are a few thousand severe tornadoes scattered all over the Midwest and somewhat fewer on the east coast in the past 70 years. It's not feasible to build houses everywhere that will stand up to an F5 tornado throwing cars. But they only cause a total loss of a tiny fraction of all houses in the country, and there are relatively few choices anyone east of Texas can make that would meaningfully impact their risk. You could price insurance premiums at the risk of a tornado times the cost of the insured assets, plus a 10% administrative fee/profit margin, and those rates would be affordable. Maybe a handful of people would choose to live in Colorado instead of a few hundred miles east in Kansas because the cost of this 'tornado insurance' was higher in Kansas, but even in Tornado Alley it wouldn't be unaffordable. Conversely, if you look at the hurricane incidence and storm surge risk map: https://coast.noaa.gov/hurricanes/#map=4/32/-80 https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/203f772571cb48b1b8b... and population density along the gulf coast: https://luminocity3d.org/WorldPopDen/#7/28.541/-88.011 It's clear that people are choosing to build houses in the narrow strip of low-lying land that's right along the coast and vulnerable to high-probability storm surges! If insurance was priced at cost of assets + administration times risk of loss, it would be really, really expensive. reply scarby2 57 minutes agorootparent> If their properties actually cost $200,000 per year to insure, then that's what they should have to pay! If they don't like it, they should either build something cheaper (that's the other half of the product) or move to somewhere with less risk. Or build something adapted to the risk it faces. In my home town there are houses that were built on flood plains that have recently been flooding every 5 years or so. Luckily they are brick and in order to get these covered you now need to install flood barriers over the doors, and your ground floor has to be adapted to flood without sustaining damage (tile floors, special plaster etc.) Now when we have a severe flood warning people will move their valuables upstairs if they're house floods they just have to clean out the mud. There are also a couple new houses right next to the river that float and rise and fall on stilts when the banks burst. reply nsxwolf 35 minutes agorootparentI think most people would go for adapting their designs, but insurance companies would have to make that offer first since they ultimately decide which designs are insurable for which amounts. reply imglorp 1 hour agorootparentprev> we're politically/socially unwilling to transfer the risk to the people who are responsible for creating it This is important. Insurance was invented 2000+ years ago but aggressively deploying technology that worsens floods, weather, and fires is only around ~100. reply echelon 3 hours agorootparentprevThe 2024 hurricane season damage totaled $128.072 billion. I couldn't find data for tornadoes in aggregate, only individual storms. > Economically, tornadoes cause about a tenth as much damage per year, on average, as hurricanes. Hurricanes tend to cause much more overall destruction than tornadoes because of their much larger size, longer duration and their greater variety of ways to damage property. The destructive core in hurricanes can be tens of miles across, last many hours and damage structures through storm surge and rainfall-caused flooding, as well as from wind. Tornadoes, in contrast, tend to be a few hundred yards in diameter, last for minutes and primarily cause damage from their extreme winds https://www.americangeosciences.org/critical-issues/faq/how-... reply ryao 1 hour agorootparentprevI recall reading somewhere that the Indians had done controlled burns before Europeans settled in the parts of the U.S. where fires are now a problem. European settlers who displaced them did not continue the controlled burns and then fires became a problem. Apparently, if you do regular controlled burns, the severity of fires is reduced and healthy trees survive it. When you do not, when fires do occur, all trees die and the fires spread out of control. reply 0u89e 1 hour agorootparentI recall reading the same thing, however I do recall that they were East coast native Indians, that cleared oak tree forests as a hunting grounds, so completelly unrelated to the problem in California. The story was about native land rights and if such looking after their hunting grounds can be seen as claims on property rights, which Indians did not knew as a concept, so it is a moot point anyway. The issues that plague CA seems to be chaos in organization level - from what I have read these wildfires are happening in the year, that did had moderate drought(compared to others), so I would look suspiciously in this with the mind, that if politicians are blaming climate, then it is a sign that they are absolutelly responsible for what they have not done and promised to people. But I do not own a house there and I have not voted for these people and I absolutelly would not hang them in the chimney of my house. PS Also, there are many opportunists, that were burning their houses to receive insurance or compensations, so not all of those houses were burned by wildfires. It all looks ugly, regadless from what angle you look, because if there is no responsibility - even from the ones that have taken upon resposibility, then catastrophe is expected - sooner than later. reply onlypassingthru 21 minutes agorootparentYosemite NP, especially the iconic valley, looked vastly different when the Europeans first arrived in the nineteenth century. It was sparsely forested and had lots of meadows. After a 150 years of no controlled burns, it's a dense forest down there. It turns out the native peoples were managing the forest, after all. reply rs999gti 21 minutes agorootparentprev> The truth is that the rich diversity and stunning landscapes of places like Yosemite and other natural environments in the United States were intentionally cultivated by Native Americans for thousands of years. And their greatest tool was fire. https://www.history.com/news/native-american-wildfires reply HankB99 57 minutes agorootparentprevI recall seeing a documentary on TV about this. Indigenous Americans were behind the effort to resurrect the practice. https://www.nps.gov/subjects/fire/indigenous-fire-practices-... reply pclmulqdq 4 hours agorootparentprevAs the governments in the US get increasingly incompetent, insurance prices are going to have to rise. Government services are largely there to protect you during black swan events, so if those services get less and less effective, you're going to need more insurance for those events. reply crawftv 3 hours agorootparentThis was the whole issue. California made it illegal for insurance companies to raise rates, so the insurance companies stop renewals. Leaving everybody uninsured.

It’s a wealth transfer from non-homeowners to homeowners, homeowners in low-risk areas to high-risk homeowners, and from low-value homeowners to rich ones. reply tigen 2 hours agorootparentprevIsn't this thing going to be subsidized by taxpayers in the end anyway? California already a dumb communal insurance thing, the \"California FAIR Plan\" for people who can't get insurance due to high risk. They force insurance companies who operate in the state to fund it. So basically everyone has to subsidize the high-risk people... but then the insurance companies leave. https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/california-fair-pl... reply trilobyte 56 minutes agorootparentAs someone who's home insurer pulled out of California and so I had to scramble to find another carrier, I looked at the FAIR plan and it is completely untenable for most people. My insurance was already high, ~$2000/year for coverage that would rebuild our house, and under FAIR it would have gone up to $12000/year. I mostly agree with the article that insurance is grounded in statistical measures of risk and there's no point railing against it. Norms are going to have to adapt to increased risk and how we build homes and infrastructure needs to shift away from short-term, low-cost thinking to longer-term solutions with a higher-upfront cost and lower TCO given the new constraints. Things like burying power lines, aggressively managing fire danger, and homes that are built to be more sound to natural disasters have to become the status quo. Most of these things are already possible today. In my neighborhood, PG&E did an assessment and it would cost every homeowner on the street ~$25,000 to have the power lines buried. I would have opened my wallet immediately to reduce the fire risk, but it got caught up in politics and policy. When we had some renovation on our house, my wife and I insisted on some of the work being done in ways that would make the house safer and easier to maintain over the long work. The contractor balked at first saying it would cost us an extra couple of thousand dollars. I had to point out that an extra $3000 to make sure things lasted an extra 5 - 10 years and was easier to maintain and upgrade meant nothing. But people have to insist on doing better because right now the norm is to cut corners on everything to save in many cases a negligible amount of money over the life of the work or against the cost if there is a disaster. reply onlypassingthru 11 minutes agorootparentThe building codes will need to reflect the new normal. Defensible perimeters, metal roofs and masonry or cementitious exteriors are a must for many areas going forward. Log cabins amongst the pines just aren't tenable in the West any more. ben_w 2 hours agorootparentprevAs a British citizen by birth, I'm amused by the idea that Americans may get National Insurance for houses before they do for healthcare. reply pclmulqdq 1 hour agorootparentIt does seem to be backward. In my opinion, \"insurance\" is strictly about compensation for loss, and should absolutely be a private transaction, while preventative and emergency systems should probably be public. Healthcare coverage, despite being called \"insurance,\" is really a system of preventative and emergency services, while California's state-run home insurance is the former. But this is what they get for trying to have price controls. reply Alive-in-2025 1 hour agorootparentprevThat's a great point. We'll get public insurance for houses only if the legalized bribery paid by existing insurance companies to block public ins. is less effectively applied than the money blocking public health insurance in the US. Old people don't care because they have medicare at 65+, while the rest of us slubs are going along with whatever we can find. We get what we allow or deserve here in the US. Citizens United led to our current awful outcome. reply bdndndndbve 2 hours agorootparentprevThe American ethos of \"fuck you, got mine\" in full effect.

That only guarantees you have insurance. It does not guarantee that you will be covered or made whole in an incident or emergency. See FL Citizen's insurance and other insurances of last resort as examples. What really needs to happen is premiums go up with the cost of risk. But this also means pricing people out of homes, vehicles, businesses, etc. And no politician will allow this. reply woah 33 minutes agorootparentprevPublic insurance would provide no benefit. The issue in California is that people have built their houses in dangerous areas and have not taken any measures to reduce fire risk. The state has already set limits to how much insurance costs can be increased (from a past generation of economic illiterates who wanted to stop \"middlemen siphoning value\"). Therefore, insurance companies are just pulling out, which disproves the entire idea that they are \"siphoning value\", since obviously there is no value there to siphon. The only thing that public insurance would do is to provide a way for the state to incur another massive unfunded liability. Except, unlike healthcare or pensions which have the somewhat laudable goal of taking care of poor people and old people, this would go to bailing out rich homeowners who made a bad investment of a house in a flammable area and then refused to spend money on fire safety measures, either in their home or their municipality.

I suspect the rules for making a defensible house were wrong. For example, I read an article recently that posited that most of the fire was spread by burning embers on the wind, and not by intense heat from nearby flames.

For example, a low masonry wall a few feet from the house can stop a lot of heavier burning embers from piling up against the house. If you've got a swimming pool, add a pump to it that feeds sprinklers in the yard and on the rooftop. There are a lot of homes that did not burn - look at them and figure out why they didn't burn.

The average high temperature in Phoenix in July is 106.5F (41.4C). If you are cooling to 70.0F (21.1C), that's a difference of 36.5F (20.3C). The average January low in Berlin is 28.0F (-2.2C). If you are heating to 65.0F (18.3C), that's a difference of 37.0F (20.5C). I feel like many people living in climates that don't require air conditioning have this view that it's fantastically inefficient and wasteful. Depending on how you are heating (e.g. if you are using a gas boiler), cooling can be significantly more efficient per degree of difference. Especially if you don't have to dehumidify the air, as in Phoenix. reply avianlyric 6 hours agorootparentYou’re ignoring one critical difference between these two scenarios. Humans, and all human related activities, produce heat as a waste product. It’s much easier, and consumes less additional energy, to heat an occupied space, than to cool it. Thanks to the fact that your average human produces 80W of heat just to stay alive. So every human in your cold space is 80W fewer watts of energy you need to produce to heat the space. But in a hot space, it’s an extra 80W that needs to be removed. Add to that all of the appliances in a home. It’s not unusual for a home to be drawing 100W of electricity just keep stuff powered on in standby, and that’s another 100W of “free” heating. All of this is before we get to big ticket items, like hobs, ovens, water heaters etc. So cooling a living space is always more costly than heating a living space. Simply because all the waste energy created by people living in the space reduces the total heating requirement of the space, but equally increases the cooling requirement of that same space. All of this is ignoring the fact that it’s easy to create a tiny personal heated environment around an individual (it’s called a woolly jumper). But practically impossible to create a cool individual environment around a person. So in cold spaces you don’t have to heat everything up to same temperature for the space to be perfectly liveable, but when cooling a space, you have to cool everything, regardless of if it’ll impact the comfort of the occupants. reply icehawk 4 hours agorootparent> So cooling a living space is always more costly than heating a living space.

Heat pumps get _less_ efficient when the temperature deltas are larger. See page 18 of the manual linked below for an example. As the temperature gets lower, the heating COP gets lower. The same should be the case with cooling (higher outdoor temperatures lead to lower COPs), but the data is not presented in the same way. https://backend.daikincomfort.com/docs/default-source/produc... reply bruckie 2 hours agorootparentYou are saying that heat pumps get less efficient when deltas are larger, and the parent post says they get more efficient when deltas are larger. In a sense, you're both correct. There are multiple relevant temperatures for a heat pump, and the pump is more efficient when some of those are higher and some lower. A heat pump has two heat exchangers, one on the inside of the building and one outside. Each of those heat exchangers has two temperatures: the refrigerant loop temperature at that point, and the ambient temperature (air for air source heat pumps, ground for ground source heat pumps). There's also a fifth relevant temperature that has indirect influence: the setpoint (the desired indoor ambient temperature). Efficiency increases when the temperature delta between the refrigerant and ambient temperatures is higher (both indoor and outdoor). But those temperature deltas vary inversely with the delta between the indoor and outdoor ambient temperatures. So, in summary: - Heat pumps get less efficient when the temperature delta between indoor and outdoor temperature is higher. - They get more efficient when the temperature delta between refrigerant and ambient temperature is higher. The net effect of this is that heat pumps become less efficient as the temperature becomes hotter outside in the summer and colder outside in the winter. reply EVa5I7bHFq9mnYK 3 hours agorootparentprevI see, the previous commenter stated the opposite :).

The truth is it is generally easier to cool not heat when you take into account the necessary energy input to achieve the desired action on the psychrometric chart, assuming by “ease” you mean energy (or emissions) used, given that you are operating over a large volume of air - which does align with your point about the jumper to be fair! Generally speaking, an A/C uses approx. 1 unit of electricity for every 3 units of cooling that it produces since it uses heat transfer rather than heat generation (simplified ELI5). It is only spending energy to move heat, not make it. On the other hand, a boiler or furnace or resistance heat system generally uses around 1 unit of input energy for every 0.8-0.9 units of heating energy produced. Heat pumps achieve similar to coefficients of performance as A/Cs, because they are effectively just A/Cs operating in reverse. Your point about a jumper is great, but there are local cooling strategies as well (tho not as effective), eg using a fan or an adiabatic cooling device (eg a mister in a hot dry climate). > So cooling a living space is always more costly than heating a living space. Once you move to cost, it now also depends on your fuel prices, not just your demand and system type. For instance, in America, nat gas is so cheap, that even with its inefficiencies relative to a heat pump, if electricity is expensive heating might still be cheaper than cooling per unit of thermal demand (this is true for instance in MA, since electricity is often 3x the price of NG). On the other hand, if elec is less than 3x the cost of nat gas, then cooling is probably cheaper than heating per unit of demand, assuming you use natural gas for your heating system. reply nixusg 5 hours agorootparentprevSolar power works very well in summer and can be used for cooling. reply megaman821 5 hours agorootparentprevIt is true that heat is easier to generate.

Much of the effect will depend on the orientation, shading, and properties of your windows, though. On the other hand, as another commenter pointed out, more sun in southern, cooling-dominated climate can also mean more, cheaper electricity. * If you have a heat pump water heater, it will actually _cool_ your space significantly. The heat is transferred from your home to your water and mostly goes down the drain with it. * At 65F (18.3C), most people I know would already be wearing a jumper/sweater. That's why I chose a lower target temperature for Berlin. The best source I could find[1] indicates that in November-December of 2022 (in the context of rising energy prices due to Russia's war with Ukraine), Germans actually kept their houses at 19.4C, on average. * Maybe I'm moving the goalposts a bit, but I chose Berlin mostly because the numbers worked out conveniently. As someone who grew up in the American upper midwest, I wouldn't consider Berlin to be particularly cold. Phoenix, on the other hand, is the hottest city in the country and its summers are some of the hottest in the world.

That's precisely wrong. Tl;dr heating normally uses less efficient technology than cooling and has to work across a higher temperature difference. In Alberta or Minnesota, where the delta in the winter can be as high as 60 degrees centigrade (-40 outside, +20 inside) but only 20 degrees centigrade at most in the summer (+45 outside, +25 inside), heating is far more costly. Even accounting for waste heat from appliances. Most heating is done with furnaces, not heat pumps. Air conditioners are heat pumps and are 3x as efficient as a furnace. There are also less energy intensive cooling methods - shading, fans, swamp coolers - commonly used in the developing world and continental Europe. On the other hand in a place with warm winters and hot summers, such as south east Asia, obviously cooling is more expensive because heating is unnecessary. The highest temperature ever recorded is around 60 degrees centrigrade, a mere 23 degrees above the human body. The low temperature record is like -90, 127 degrees below body temperature. Needing to heat large deltas is way more common than needing to cool high deltas. And cooling is done with heat pumps, which are more efficient than the technologies used most commonly for heating (resistive or combustion). > when cooling a space, you have to cool everything, regardless of if it’ll impact the comfort of the occupants.

Insulation makes the house more resistance to temperature change (relative to the inside and outside). One thing people forget is the delta is very different in the summer and winter. Lets say your thermostat is on 70 year round. If it is 100 degrees out you only have to cool 30 degrees. When it is 0 F out you have a delta of 70 degrees.

In some cases, trying to make a house that was resistant to floods, fires and earthquakes at the same time would have been prohibitively expensive. I'm sure that led to forming habits that have continued into more modern eras of building styles where it's less required. They're also smaller, which makes construction costs cheaper which means people are more likely to make dramatic changes when fashion changes. And then there's more of a culture of prefab house building rather than extensions etc. Planning is also a lot more liberal which allows the rebuilt house to be more different and also reduces the cost of the process. I think even in Europe some of the older houses are houses of theseus though. The exterior shell is the same, but there's plenty of buildings in the local city centre that were tenements, then small business offices, then apartments, with significant remodeling that occurred. Or the house I used to live in was built in the 1880s, extended in the 1950s and significantly modernised in the 2000s.

Some of this is maybe cultural from the time when houses in Japan were literally constructed with paper. https://www.learnedinjapan.com/no-buy-home-japan/ reply UniverseHacker 3 hours agorootparentThat is a fascinating cultural perspective and explains a lot of things to me: I've always treated cars like houses are in the USA- I buy an older higher end car like a Porsche, keep it in perfect shape, and expect it to appreciate- and it does. Most cars I've owned I ultimately sold for much more than I paid. I've never understood why anyone would waste money on a depreciating car, especially when a fully depreciated high end car is so much nicer and cheaper than a low end new one. Airplanes are not mechanically that different than a car, yet generally last and hold value if maintained. I've also never understood why people in the USA assume houses will always appreciate, as if it is a law of nature or something- when at its core houses can't appreciate forever relative to inflation, because there is a hard cap somewhere below people paying 100% of income for housing. This basically proves it is just a combination of a culture that values older housing in the USA and regulatory capture preventing new construction.

But never anything close to a loss. The only thing that could put my real estate on a serious risk are earthquakes, I guess that's a scenario where lighter built houses would have instead an advantage. reply s1artibartfast 1 hour agorootparentDefine \"cheaply built\".

I’m sure there was damage but nowhere near total loss. I’m sure when homes are rebuilt the majority will not be fire resistant. It’s possible to build for hurricanes and floods too but few do it. They build houses that get blown away and then tap insurance. Insurance rates for properties not built to withstand the stresses of their environment will go up. reply briffle 3 hours agorootparentwe had a huge wildfire in my area in 2021 that burned through a few small towns. In one town, the only houses that survived where the ones that followed the guides out there for creating defensible space.

The introduction of so much extra energy into the atmosphere is going to make weather extremes worse all over the world, and harder to predict as historical models become less relevant. Large scale pattern changes like the AMOC shutting down are going to completely change many local weather patterns so that e.g. places that have little history of tornados will start having them, or places that used to be too wet for wildfires will suddenly experience them in extreme drought conditions. Despite scientists' best efforts, we're running a global experiment with no control group and predictions will only become more difficult the harder we push the system into a new state. reply agsnu 10 hours agorootparentprevA significant portion of human structures are located close to the coast (seaborne trade having been a huge enabler of economic development for a few hundred years) and are exposed to flooding from rising sea levels, or built in valleys that are increasingly at risk from flooding due to far-above-long-term-historic-norms precipitation runoff (higher atmospheric temps lead to more energy in weather systems; see eg massive floods in Europe in the past few years). reply adrianN 9 hours agorootparentCompared to the other challenges climate change poses those are fairly simple engineering problems. The Netherlands manage fine with large parts of the country below sea level. reply avianlyric 6 hours agorootparentYou’re ignoring things like the geological conditions in the Netherlands, they have very peaty soil which is fairly impermeable to water. Which makes the task of keep the sea back pretty easy, you just build a big wall. But if you look in places like Florida, the ground conditions there are substantially more porous. If you try to keep the sea back there with a simple wall, it’ll just flow under the wall through the soil. You would have to dig all the way to bedrock and install some kind of impermeable barrier to prevent most of Florida from flooding due to sea level rise. Something that’s unbelievably cost prohibitive to do. The Netherlands only exists below sea level because their ground conditions meant it was possible to pump out the country using technology available in the 1740s. If the ground conditions weren’t basically perfect for this kind of geo-engineering, the Netherlands simply wouldn’t exist as it does today. You’re using an example that exists purely as a result of survivorship bias, as an argument that it’s practical to apply the same techniques or achieve the same outcomes anywhere else. Completely ignoring the fact that your example only exists because a unique set of geologic conditions made it possible, and those conditions are far from universal, and not in anyway correlated with places we humans would like to protect. reply wiredfool 4 hours agorootparentKarst Topography enters the room.... reply jyounker 6 hours agorootparentprevThe Netherlands has been planning for the impacts of sea-level rise for decades now.

They appear to be getting worse. More restrictive codes designed for better fireproofing buildings, for instance, can solve a number of problems in California in fire prone areas. Another thing that has a political solution is forest management. Lack of water can be solved by desalination, which becomes an energy problem rather than a water one. Very dry areas can benefit from solar panels because they reduce water loss from evaporation, thus reducing the pressure on water supplies.

This very page is an example of a realtime collaborative application. Every other cursor in the garden above is a real live person reading the page right now. Click one of the plants to change it for everyone else! Learn Yjs starts with the basics of Yjs, then covers techniques for handling state in distributed applications. We’ll talk about what a CRDT is, and why you’d want to use one. We’ll get into some of the pitfalls that make collaborative applications difficult and show how you can avoid them. There will be explorable demos and code exercises so you can get a feel for how Yjs really works. Here’s an example of an explorable demo. Each box below represents a client — a separate computer running an app that uses Yjs. When you interact with either client, the changes are automatically synced to the other one. You can control the latency with the slider on the top left to see how clients would interact over a network.

In case you're not familiar with Yjs, it's a CRDT library for building collaborative and local-first apps. The thing is, if you're not used to working with distributed state there's definitely a learning curve. Even simple things like incrementing a counter — the \"hello world\" of JavaScript framework demos — get tricky when dealing with multiple clients. Worse, a lot of tutorials are just like \"install this library and text editor integration and boom you have an app\", which doesn't give you a good mental model for what's actually happening. So we made Learn Yjs! It's an interactive Yjs tutorial. I wanted it to be really intuitive for people just getting their feet wet with local-first development, so there are lots of explorable demos and coding exercises. The idea is to use interactive examples to build an understanding from the ground up. Hope you like it :) reply KaiMagnus 11 hours agoparent> \"install this library and text editor integration and boom you have an app\", which doesn't give you a good mental model for what's actually happening. I was interested in working with CRDTs and collaboration in general for a while now and this has been the biggest issue whenever I tried to get into it. Websockets also seem a bit harder to find (free) hosting for. Btw, your other tutorials on CRDTs were also a great help. reply jakelazaroff 2 hours agorootparentThank you! As far as websocket hosting, there are a few services out there. We offer a pretty generous free tier for Y-Sweet [1] with 10GB of storage. There's also PartyKit and Liveblocks, though I'm not sure what their pricing is like.

Is there an example for building a local-first app? Also, I working with plain vanilla HTML & JS and Alpine. Can this be used in my apps? reply paulgb 13 hours agorootparentY-sweet (which this is built with) allows you to make a Yjs app local-first by passing “offlineSupport” to the provider when constructing. There’s a demo of this here: https://demos.y-sweet.dev/color-grid The source for that demo is here: https://github.com/jamsocket/y-sweet/blob/5fa6941cf5568f4a3f... That demo uses react, but there is a vanilla js version of the same demo here: https://github.com/jamsocket/y-sweet/tree/main/examples/vani... (The vanilla js version is not local first, but it would just be a matter of passing the same offlineSupport flag to make it so.) reply steve_adams_86 20 minutes agorootparentI just noticed that if you install the example service after setting up an account, it installs a version of @y-sweet/react which doesn't offer the offlineSupport prop. The version specified is ^0.5.1. After switching to 0.7.1 as the repo you linked uses, all is well. Probably not a big deal for most newcomers, but it might be worth updating dependencies in the example service. reply paulgb 19 minutes agorootparentThanks Steve, good catch! reply santa_boy 12 hours agorootparentprevThank you.

Congratulations! reply patwolf 5 hours agoprevI'm currently using Yjs to build an app that needs to work offline. It's not actually a real-time or collaborative app. However, if you think of the server as being one collaborator and the app being another, then it's easy to imagine use cases for it. reply adeptima 12 hours agoprevYjs is nice. Easy to get p2p results. Yjs backend, its persistence, eventual conflict resolution (one of editors stayed too long offline), history rewind seems like a tough engineering challenge to crack. Always wanted to have a nice experience with block editor like Platejs https://platejs.org/ There are nice attempts simplify dev experience with solutions like Liveblocks https://liveblocks.io/text-editor However most options come at the expense of controlling your data. CRDT keyword search on HN bring consistently good results and interest in the topic, but no good options on open source backend side. Checked it many times in the past.

Most people expectations it should work at least as in Google Docs or Notion, and on the dev side it should be store privately in Postgres JSONB like format without going deep into details. reply blixt 11 hours agoparentI agree. In theory you need to just distribute serialized patches but in a real world backend scenario you may need to integrate with knowledge of current document state, user identity, and possibly even some level of access control. I’ve wanted to use Y.js with a Go backend multiple times but gave up each time due to time constraints as it’s hard to find simple reference implementations. I’ve been checking back over the years but it still seems hard to do this outside of Node.js. reply adeptima 10 hours agorootparentSame experience.

It's my go-to argument against leetcode style interviews. I would rather ask a candidate to spend 30 mins and do research together on collaborative editing, or visualizing distances used in pgvector or similar vector database. Imagine how far the whole colabarative editing space moved forward if 1% of leetcode grinding were rerouted reply essentia0 9 hours agoprevSo perplexing - in the interactive demos, the latency slider acts not as a network latency but more a debounce buffer? Why? Why? I just don't get it reply paulgb 4 hours agoparentWe wanted to go with the simplest model of latency that would suffice to demonstrate the problems that come up when dealing with state mutated in multiple locations. The advantage of this approach is that we can do it without hiding any state from the reader — the pie chart exposes the only internal state that exists. It’s not meant to be an accurate network simulation, just to build intuition. reply danielEM 11 hours agoprev> The trick is a technique called fractional indexing, in which indices are fractions rather than integers. How many times you can use fractional indexing before it stops working? reply danielEM 11 hours agoparentSorry, just did that test - it is 1075, not massive, I would risk saying that may be major issue of this lib. Here is the code: let left = 0, right = 1 let rightPrevious = 2 let counter = 0; while (right > left && right < rightPrevious) { rightPrevious = right; right /= 2; counter++ } console.log(counter) Did look very briefly into repo, but didn't find a place where it is handled and don't have time to dig it, but if that issue is true I may help with resolving it. LMK reply paulgb 11 hours agorootparentGood point. Usually fractional indexing is done with arbitrary-precision numbers to avoid exactly this issue. We landed on using JS floats to teach the technique because it makes it more intuitive to understand what’s going on, but you make a good point and I’ll make sure we add that caveat and link out to an arbitrary-precision fractional index library. reply oefrha 18 hours agoprevI used Yjs in a small side project a while ago. The client side was fairly easy to learn and use. On the server side though, I wanted to deploy a single binary, but examples in languages other than Node (e.g. for the Rust port Yrs) seemed close to nonexistent, so I ended up slightly adapting https://github.com/yjs/y-websocket (Node) with persistence based on LevelDB. That's suboptimal for me. I wonder if there are good resources for implementing the server-side with persistence in, say, Rust. Btw, IIRC existing resources for the client side are heavily focused on text editor integrations, so this is really helpful. I had to fumble a bit myself because I wasn't using a text editor integration. reply paulgb 17 hours agoparentYou might like Y-Sweet[1], an open-source Rust server that powers the banner on Learn Yjs. It uses S3 or the local filesystem for storage, and it compiles down to a musl-linked binary that weighs a few megabytes. https://github.com/jamsocket/y-sweet reply oefrha 17 hours agorootparentThanks, I'll look into it. It's pretty low on the list of search results for Yjs server, I somehow missed it the last time. reply stopachka 19 hours agoprevThe interactive demos are beautiful! Is there a library you used to build it? reply jakelazaroff 19 hours agoparentThank you! The site as a whole is built with Astro and the demos are “islands of interactivity” built with React. The demos are really running Yjs under the hood — each “client” has its own document, and when the user clicks I set a timeout to simulate the latency and then manually merge the documents into each other. (There’s a third document too for the timeline in the center.) Other than that, I’m using dnd kit [1] for the drag and drop functionality in the todos demo, Motion [2] for the animations and CodeMirror [3] for the text editor.

It gives you a way to describe a JSON-like data structure (i.e. nested lists and maps), and keep them in sync across multiple devices. Yjs itself doesn't provide a platform, but it's an open protocol so there there are service providers (like ourselves[1]) that offer Yjs backends as a service (other notable providers are TipTap/Hocusocus and Liveblocks). [1] https://jamsocket.com/y-sweet reply showdown 13 hours agorootparentwhat's the main differences in your opinion between y-sweet and Hocuspocus? reply paulgb 12 hours agorootparentThe biggest difference is that Y-Sweet is built around object storage (i.e. S3 and friends) rather than a database. This allows writes to scale horizontally without a central database being the bottleneck. It’s also a much cheaper way to store lots of documents accumulating over time on S3 than in a database. This is because compute scales with how much data you actually access, not how much data you store.

    "originBody": "Thoughts On A Month With Devin Blog Our impressions of Devin after giving it 20+ tasks. Authors Hamel Husain Isaac Flath Johno Whitaker Published January 8, 2025 In March 2024, a new AI company burst onto the scene with impressive backing: a $21 million Series A led by Founders Fund, with support from industry leaders including the Collison brothers, Elad Gil, and other tech luminaries. The team behind it? IOI gold medalists - the kind of people that solve programming problems most of us can’t even understand. Their product, Devin, promised to be a fully autonomous software engineer that could chat with you like a human colleague, capable of everything from learning new technologies and debugging mature codebases to deploying full applications and even training AI models. The early demos were compelling. A video showed Devin independently completing an Upwork bounty, installing and running a PyTorch project without human intervention.1 The company claimed Devin could resolve 13.86% of real-world GitHub issues end-to-end on the SWE-bench benchmark - ~3x times better than previous systems. Only a select group of users could access it initially, leading to breathless tweets about how this would revolutionize software development. As a team at Answer.AI that routinely experiments with AI developer tools, something about Devin felt different. If it could deliver even half of what it promised, it could transform how we work. But while Twitter was full of enthusiasm, we couldn’t find many detailed accounts of people actually using it. So we decided to put it through its paces, testing it against a wide range of real-world tasks. This is our story - a thorough, real-world attempt to work with one of the most hyped AI products of 2024. What is Devin? What makes Devin unique is its infrastructure. Unlike typical AI assistants, Devin operates through Slack and spins up its own computing environment. When you chat with Devin, you’re talking to an AI that has access to a full computing environment - complete with a web browser, code editor, and shell. It can install dependencies, read documentation, and even preview web applications it creates. Below is a screenshot of one way to initiate a task for Devin to work on: One way to initiate a task with Devin - through Slack The experience is designed to feel like chatting with a colleague. You describe what you want, and Devin starts working. Through Slack, you can watch it think through problems, ask for credentials when needed, and share links to completed work. Behind the scenes, it’s running in a Docker container, which gives it the isolation it needs to safely experiment while protecting your systems. Devin also provides a web interface, which also allows you to gain access to its envirnoment and watch it work with IDEs, Web Browsers and more in real time. Here is a screenshot of the web interface: Early Wins Our first task was straightforward but real: pull data from a Notion database into Google Sheets. Devin tackled this with surprising competence. It navigated to the Notion API documentation, understood what it needed, and guided me through setting up the necessary credentials in Google Cloud Console. Rather than just dumping API instructions, it walked me through each menu and button click needed - saving what would typically be tedious documentation sleuthing. The whole process took about an hour (but only a few minutes of human interaction). At the end, Devin shared a link to a perfectly formatted Google Sheet containing our data. The code it produced was a bit verbose, but it worked. This felt like a glimpse into the future - an AI that could handle the “glue code” tasks that consume so much developer time. Johno had similar success using Devin to create a planet tracker for debunking claims about historical positions of Jupiter and Saturn. What made this particularly impressive was that he managed this entirely through his phone, with Devin handling all the heavy lifting of setting up the environment and writing the code. Scaling Up Our Testing Building upon our early successes, we leaned into Devin’s asynchronous capabilities. We imagined having Devin write documentation during our meetings or debug issues while we focused on design work. But as we scaled up our testing, cracks appeared. Tasks that seemed straightforward often took days rather than hours, with Devin getting stuck in technical dead-ends or producing overly complex, unusable solutions. Even more concerning was Devin’s tendency to press forward with tasks that weren’t actually possible. When asked to deploy multiple applications to a single Railway deployment (something that Railway doesn’t support), instead of identifying this limitation, Devin spent over a day attempting various approaches and hallucinating features that didn’t exist. The most frustrating aspect wasn’t the failures themselves - all tools have limitations - but rather how much time we spent trying to salvage these attempts. A Deeper Look at What Went Wrong At this point in our journey, we were puzzled. We had seen Devin competently handle API integrations and build functional applications, yet it was struggling with tasks that seemed simpler. Was this just bad luck? Were we using it wrong? Over the course of a month, we systematically documented our attempts across these categories: Creating new projects from scratch Performing research tasks Analyzing & Modifying existing projects The results were sobering. Out of 20 tasks, we had 14 failures, 3 successes (including our 2 initial ones), and 3 inconclusive results. Even more telling was that we couldn’t discern any pattern to predict which tasks would work. Tasks that seemed similar to our early successes would fail in unexpected ways. We’ve provided more detail about these tasks in the appendix below. Below is a summary of our experiences in each of these categories: 1. Creating New Projects From Scratch This category should have been Devin’s sweet spot. After all, the company’s demo video showed it autonomously completing an Upwork bounty, and our own early successes suggested it could handle greenfield development. The reality proved more complex. Take our attempt to integrate with an LLM observability platform called Braintrust. The task was clear: generate synthetic data and upload it. Instead of a focused solution, Devin produced what can only be described as code soup - layers of abstraction that made simple operations needlessly complex. We ultimately abandoned Devin’s attempt and used Cursor to build the integration step-by-step, which proved far more efficient. Similarly, when asked to create an integration between our AI notes taker and Spiral.computer, Devin generated what one team member described as “spaghetti code that was way more confusing to read through than if I’d written it from scratch.” Despite having access to documentation for both systems, Devin seemed to overcomplicate every aspect of the integration. Perhaps most telling was our attempt at web scraping. We asked Devin to follow Google Scholar links and grab the most recent 25 papers from an author - a task that should be straightforward with tools like Playwright. This should have been particularly achievable given Devin’s ability to browse the web and write code. Instead, it became trapped in an endless cycle of trying to parse HTML, unable to extract itself from its own confusion. 2. Research Tasks If Devin struggled with concrete coding tasks, perhaps it would fare better with research-oriented work? The results here were mixed at best. While it could handle basic documentation lookups (as we saw in our early Notion/Google Sheets integration), more complex research tasks proved challenging. When we asked Devin to research transcript summarization with accurate timestamps - a specific technical challenge we were facing - it merely regurgitated tangentially related information rather than engaging with the core problem. Instead of exploring potential solutions or identifying key technical challenges, it provided generic code examples that didn’t address the fundamental issues. Even when Devin appeared to be making progress, the results often weren’t what they seemed. For instance, when asked to create a minimal DaisyUI theme as an example, it produced what looked like a working solution. However, upon closer inspection, we discovered the theme wasn’t actually doing anything - the colors we were seeing were from the default theme, not our customizations. 3. Analyzing and Modifying Existing Code Perhaps Devin’s most concerning failures came when working with existing codebases. These tasks require understanding context and maintaining consistency with established patterns - skills that should be central to an AI software engineer’s capabilities. Our attempts to have Devin work with nbdev projects were particularly revealing. When asked to migrate a Python project to nbdev, Devin couldn’t grasp even basic nbdev setup, despite us providing it access to comprehensive documentation. More puzzling was its approach to notebook manipulation - instead of directly editing notebooks, it created Python scripts to modify them, adding unnecessary complexity to simple tasks. While it occasionally provided useful notes or ideas, the actual code it produced was consistently problematic. Security reviews showed similar issues. When we asked Devin to assess a GitHub repository (under 700 lines of code) for security vulnerabilities, it went overboard, flagging numerous false positives and hallucinating issues that didn’t exist. This kind of analysis might have been better handled by a single, focused LLM call rather than Devin’s more complex approach. The pattern continued with debugging tasks. When investigating why SSH key forwarding wasn’t working in a setup script, Devin fixated on the script itself, never considering that the problem might lie elsewhere. This tunnel vision meant it couldn’t help us uncover the actual root cause. Similarly, when asked to add conflict checking between user input and database values, one team member spent several hours working through Devin’s attempts before giving up and writing the feature themselves in about 90 minutes. Reflecting As A Team After a month of intensive testing, our team gathered to make sense of our experiences. These quotes capture our feelings best: Tasks it can do are those that are so small and well-defined that I may as well do them myself, faster, my way. Larger tasks where I might see time savings I think it will likely fail at. So no real niche where I’ll want to use it. - Johno Whitaker I had initial excitement at how close it was because I felt I could tweak a few things. And then slowly got frustrated as I had to change more and more to end up at the point where I would have been better of starting from scratch and going step by step. - Isaac Flath Devin struggled to use internal tooling that is critical at AnswerAI which, in addition to other issues, made it difficult to use. This is despite providing Devin with copious amounts of documentation and examples. I haven’t found this to be an issue with tools like Cursor, where there is more opportunity to nudge things in the right direction more incrementally. - Hamel Husain In contrast to Devin, we found workflows where developers drive more (like Cursor) avoid most issues we faced with Devin. Conclusion Working with Devin showed what autonomous AI development aspires to be. The UX is polished - chatting through Slack, watching it work asynchronously, seeing it set up environments and handle dependencies. When it worked, it was impressive. But that’s the problem - it rarely worked. Out of 20 tasks we attempted, we saw 14 failures, 3 inconclusive results, and just 3 successes. More concerning was our inability to predict which tasks would succeed. Even tasks similar to our early wins would fail in complex, time-consuming ways. The autonomous nature that seemed promising became a liability - Devin would spend days pursuing impossible solutions rather than recognizing fundamental blockers. This reflects a pattern we’ve observed repeatedly in AI tooling. Social media excitement and company valuations have minimal relationship to real-world utility. We’ve found the most reliable signal comes from detailed stories of users shipping products and services. For now, we’re sticking with tools that let us drive the development process while providing AI assistance along the way. Appendix: Tasks Attempted With Devin Below is a table of projects we gave Devin, categorized by the themes of: (1) Creating a new project, (2) research, (3) analyze an existing code base and (4) modifying a code base. 1. Create A New Project Project Name Status Description Reflections Planet Tracker Success I wanted to debunk some claims about historical positions of Jupiter and Saturn Devin nailed it. I actually talked to Devin from my phone via slack and it made it happen. Migrating data from Notion Into Google Sheets Success I told Devin to programmatically pull info from a Notion document into a Google Sheet. This was my very first project that I executed with Devin and it pulled it off nicely. Devin read notion and Google API docs by itself. Devin also navigated me to the Google Cloud console and provided me with instructions on all the different menus to click through which would have taken me quite a bit of time on my own! At the end, I was given a reasonable Python script that executed the task. This was my very first interaction with Devin and it executed exactly what I wanted it to do, which was a brand new experience for me. I was quite excited about Devin at this point. Multi-app deploys on Railway Inconclusive I asked Devin to deploy multiple applications to a single railway deployment, so that I could have different apps sharing the same local db for testing. It turns out that this task was ill-defined because it’s not actually possible to do this, if I understand correctly. However, Devin marched forward and tried to do this and hallucinated some things about how to interact with railway. Generate synthetic data and upload it to Braintrust Failure I asked Devin to create synthetic data for a LLM observability platform called Braintrust that I wanted to test. Devin created overly complex code that was hard to understand, and got stuck trying to fix errors. We ended up using Cursor to do this step by step in an iterative fashion. Create an integration between two applications Failure I asked Devin to create an integration between Circleback, my AI notes taker, and Spiral.computer with pointers to the documentation of each. I got really horrible spaghetti code that was way more confusing to read through than me trying to just write it from scratch. So I decided to not invest any more time in using Devin for this particular task. Web scraping Papers By Following Google Scholar Links Failure I asked Devin to grab the most recent 25 papers from an author on Google Scholar programmatically using playwright, and if it encountered a paywall it was ok to skip that particular document. Devin went into a rabbit hole of trying to parse HTML that it seems like it couldn’t get out of. It got stuck and went to sleep. Create minimal HTMX bulk upload example app Failure I asked Devin to read the HTMX documentation page for bulk edit example and with that and fake server code, create a minimal FastHTML version of the example for the FastHTML Gallery. The example did not work and was not minimal. Devin used objects from the request object that didn’t exist and added many unnecessary things, like toasts (which also didn’t work), and inline css styling. Create a DaisyUI Themes to match FrankenUI Theming Failure I asked Devin to create DaisyUI and highlight.js theming so that they match the frankenui themes and can be used in the same app seamlessly Devin mapped daisyUI pre-existing themes to frankenui themes, but did they did not match well in many cases. It was also a ton of code changes that I didn’t understand and I ended up not using any of it because I was too confused to know what to do with it. 2. Perform Research Project Name Status Description Reflections Research How to make a discord bot Success I asked Devin to perform research on how I could use Python to build a Discord bot that summarizes each day’s messages and sends an email. I also told it to use Claudette if possible to do so. Finally, I told it to write its findings in notebooks with small code snippets I could use to test. Devin produced research notes in the form of a markdown file as an intermediate step to creating the notebook, which I did not ask it for. However, it was quite useful to see a step-by-step plan on how an implementation might come together. The code that it provided me in the notebook was not 100% correct, but it was useful as pseudocode to give me an idea of how I might glue this together. Given that this was more of a research project and I wanted just to know the general idea, I would call this a success. Research on Transcript Summarization With Accurate Timestamps Failure One issue that I face with summarizing transcripts is that I would love to have accurate timestamps that go with notes, so that I could use it for YouTube chapter summaries or similar. Concretely, it is not a problem to get accurate time-stamps from a transcript, But it’s difficult to associate timestamps with summaries because the timestamps often get bungled. So this is kind of an AI engineering research task. Devin regurgitated related things to my problem but it did not tackle it did not do a good job of performing research or trying to tackle the problem I was trying to solve, and gave me pointers to code and examples that were not helpful. Create a minimal DaisyUI theme as an example Failure I asked Devin to create a minimal DaisyUI theme as an example. My goal was to get a starting point to start from since asking it to do it in a more complete way was unsuccessful. Devin ignored the request to make it as a FastHTML app, and it took some back and forth to get it to go down that path. Eventually, it created an app that appeared to work with different button types. While it gave a link that looked good, once I tried modifying the theme, is became clear the theme was doing nothing. The other colors in the app were from the default theme. This is not a helpful starting point. 3. Analyze Existing Code Project Name Status Description Reflections Performing a security review of a code base Inconclusive For this task, I pointed Devin at a GitHub repository and told it to assess it for security vulnerabilities. The codebase is under 700 lines of code. I told Devin to write its notes in a markdown file with sample code where necessary. Devin did identify some security vulnerabilities but was extremely overzealous and hallucinated some issues that were not there. Perhaps this was not the ideal task for Devin as this is something that would be just as good in a single call to my favorite LLM. Review blog posts and make a pull request with improvements Failure I asked Devin to review a blog post and suggest changes with a pull request. Ultimately, Devin failed because it could not figure out how the static site generator that I was using, Quarto, worked. I think that this task would have been successful inside something like Cursor. It seemed like Devin did not do a good job of learning from the project structure and existing files, so it messed up things like front matter and other conventions necessary to edit the blog post correctly. Review An Application and Identify Potential Areas of Improvement Failure I asked Devin to view the timekeeping app I had mentioned earlier and provided an open-ended task of asking it to suggest any improvements. The suggestions that it provided did not make any sense. Debug why ssh key forwarding is not working in a setup script Inconclusive I asked Devin to figure out why ssh key forwarding was not working on a server when I used a script to set it up. The issue ended up being unrelated to the script, which I thought was the problem, but Devin never suggested or implied that maybe the problem was somewhere else. It was not helpful because it did not help me uncover the root cause. 4. Modify An Existing Project Project Name Status Description Reflections Making changes to a nbdev project Failure I had a simple application for time tracking built with FastHTML and nbdev that I wanted to integrate with apple shortcuts via an API route. Devin could not figure out how to operate successfully in this environment, even though it got impressively far. One curiosity that I noticed is that Devin created Python scripts to edit notebooks rather than trying to edit the notebook itself. However, Devin gave me some useful notes there and ideas that I hadn’t considered. However, the code that it tried to write did not make sense. Eventually, I ended up using a template from someone else and not going with any of Devin’s suggestions. Migration of python Project To nbdev Failure I asked Devin to migrate a project to nbdev [prompt details omitted for brevity] It got horribly stuck and could not figure out basic nbdev setup. It seems like it didn’t do a good job of reading the nbdev docs. Integrate Styling Package Into FastHTML Failure I asked Devin to integrate MonsterUI into one of my applications. Devin could not figure out how to work with a nbdev repo. Add feature to check for conflicts between user input and database Failure I asked Devin to add a feature to an app to compare user input values to values from a database based on prior runs and give a UI if they don’t match. I spent several hours slowly working through getting it working properly before I gave up. I wrote the feature myself in about 90 minutes. Generate LLMs context file with the contents of every fasthtml gallery example Failure I asked Devin to create llms text files for the fasthtml gallery I was excited to see it created a separate markdown file for each example and then tried to roll them up in the llms context files initially. I had not thought about doing that and things seemed all there at first. When I pulled down and started digging in I started finding things I did not like: The format of the llms wasn’t correct. Even though I gave it infomration to use XML tags to seperate examples, it didn’t. It added and pinned a specific version of the markdown package as a dependency and used that, instead of using the markdown2 package with is already used and was already a dependency. It did a bunch of pytest stuff and added a dep, even though the project doesn’t use pytest. Footnotes This demo was descisively debunked by this video↩︎",

    "commentBody": "Thoughts on a Month with Devin (answer.ai)251 points by swyx 12 hours agohidepastfavorite157 comments rbren 6 hours agoI'm one of the creators of OpenHands (fka OpenDevin). I agree with most of what's been said here, wrt to software agents in general. We are not even close to the point where AI can \"replace\" a software engineer. Their code still needs to be reviewed and tested, at least as much as you'd scrutinize the code of a brand new engineer just out of boot camp. I've talked to companies who went all in on AI engineers, only to realize two months later that their codebase was rotting because no one was reviewing the changes. But once you develop some intuition for how to use them, software agents can be a _massive_ boost to productivity. ~20% of the commits to the OpenHands codebase are now authored or co-authored by OpenHands itself. I especially love asking it to do simple, tedious things like fixing merge conflicts or failing linters. It's great at getting an existing PR over the line. It's also important to keep in mind that these agents are literally improving on a _weekly_ basis. A few weeks ago we were at the top of the SWE-bench leaderboard; now there are half a dozen agents that have pulled ahead of us. And we're one launch away from leapfrogging back to the top. Exciting times! https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands reply jebarker 5 hours agoparent> code still needs to be reviewed and tested, at least as much as you'd scrutinize the code of a brand new engineer just out of boot camp > ..._massive_ boost to productivity. ~20% of the commits to the OpenHands codebase are now authored or co-authored by OpenHands itself. I'm having trouble reconciling these statements. Where does the productivity boost come from since that reviewing burden seems much greater than you'd have if you knew commits were coming from a competent human? reply lars512 5 hours agorootparentThere's often a lot of small fixes that not time efficient to do, but a solution is not much code and is quick to verify. If the cost is small to setting a coding agent (e.g. aider) on a task, seeing if it reaches a quick solution, and just aborting if it spins out, you can solve a subset of these types of issues very quickly, instead of leaving them in issue tracking to grow stale. That lets you up the polish on your work. That's still quite a different story to having it do the core, most important part of your work. That feels a little further away. One of the challenges is the scout rule, the refactoring alongside change that makes the codebase nicer. I feel like today it's easier to get a correct change that slightly degrades codebase quality, than one that maintains it. reply jebarker 5 hours agorootparentThanks - this all makes sense - I still don't feel like this would constitute a massive productivity boost in most cases, since it's not fixing time consuming major issues. But I can see how it's nice to have. reply rbren 4 hours agorootparentThe bigger win comes not from saving keystrokes, but from saving you from a context switch. Merge conflicts are probably the biggest one for me. I put up a PR and move onto a new task. Someone approves, but now there are conflicts. I could switch off my task, spend 5-10 min remembering the intent of this PR and fixing the issues. Or I could just say \"@openhands fix the merge conflicts\" and move back to my new task. reply lolinder 4 hours agorootparentprevI haven't started doing this with agents, but with autocomplete models I know exactly what OP is talking about: you stop trying to use models for things that models are bad at. A lot of people complain that Copilot is more harm than good, but after a couple of months of using it I figured out when to bother and when not to bother and it's been a huge help since then. I imagine the same thing applies to agents. You can waste a lot of time by giving them tasks that are beyond them and then having to review complicated work that is more likely to be wrong than right. But once you develop an intuition for what they can and cannot do you can act appropriately. reply drewbug01 5 hours agorootparentprevI suspect that many engineers do not expend significant energy on reviewing code; especially if the change is lengthy. reply linsomniac 5 hours agorootparentprev>burden seems much greater than... Because the burden is much lower than if you were authoring the same commit yourself without any automation? reply jebarker 5 hours agorootparentIs that true? I'd like to think my commits are less burdensome to review than a fresh out of boot camp junior dev especially if all that's being done is fixing linter issues. Perhaps there's a small benefit, but doesn't seem like a major productivity boost. reply ErikBjare 5 hours agorootparentA junior dev is not a good approximation of the strengths and weaknesses of these models. reply rbren 4 hours agorootparentAgreed! The comparison is great for estimating the scope of the tasks they're capable of--they do very well with bite-sized tasks that can be individually verified. But their world knowledge is that of a principal engineer! I think this is why people struggle so much with agents--they see the agent perform magic, then assume it can be trusted with a larger task, where it completely falls down. reply jebarker 5 hours agorootparentprevThe post I originally commented on literally made that comparison when describing the models as a massive productivity boost. reply bufferoverflow 2 hours agoparentprevWe've seen exponential improvements in LLM's coding abilities. Went from almost useless to somewhat useful in like two years. Claude 3.5 is not bad really. I wanted to do a side project that has been on my mind for a few years, and Claude coded it in like 30 seconds. So to say \"we are not even close\" seems strange. If LLMs continue to improve, they will be comparable to mid level developers in 2-3 years, senior developers in 4-5 years. reply Zanfa 2 hours agorootparent> So to say \"we are not even close\" seems strange. If LLMs continue to improve, they will be comparable to mid level developers in 2-3 years, senior developers in 4-5 years. These sorts of things can’t be extrapolated. It could be 6-months, it could be a local maxima / dead end that’ll take another breakthrough in 10 years like transformers were. See self-driving cars. reply veggieroll 2 hours agoparentprevWhat does the cost look like for running OpenHands yourself? From your docs, it looks like you recommend Sonnet @ $3 / million tokens. But I could imagine this can add up quickly if you are sending large portions of the repository at a time as context. reply CGamesPlay 7 hours agoprevAs someone who uses AI coding tools daily and has done a fair amount of experimentation with different approaches (though not Devin), I feel like this tracks pretty well. The problem is that Devin and other \"agentic\" approaches take on more than they can handle. The best AI coders are positioned as tools for developers, rather than replacements for them. Github Copilot is \"a better tab complete\". Sure, it's a neat demo that it can produce a fast inverse square root, but the real utility is that it completes repetitive code. It's like having a dynamic snippet library always available that I never have to configure. Aider is the next step up the abstraction ladder. It can edit in more locations than just the current cursor position, so it can perform some more high-level edit operations. And although it also uses a smarter model than Copilot, it still isn't very \"smart\" at the end of the day, and will hallucinate functions and make pointless changes when you give it a problem to solve. reply frereubu 6 hours agoparentWhen I tried Copilot the \"better tab complete\" felt quite annoying, in that the constantly changing suggested completion kept dragging my focus away from what I was writing. That clearly doesn't happen for you. Was that something you got used to over time, or did that just not happen for you? There were elements of it I found useful, but I just couldn't get over the flickering of my attention from what I was doing to the suggested completions. Edit: I also really want something that takes the existing codebase in the form of a VSCode project / GitHub repo and uses that as a basis for suggestions. Does Copilot do that now? reply macNchz 5 hours agorootparentI tried to get used to the tab completion tools a few times but always found it distracting like you describe. often I’d have a complete thought, start writing the code, get a suggested completion, start reading it, realize it was wrong, but then I’d have lost my initial thought, or at least have to pause and bring myself back to it. I have, however, fully adopted chat-to-patch style workflows like Aider, I find it much less intrusive and distracting than the tab completions, since I can give it my entire thought rather than some code to try to complete. I do think there’s promise in more autonomous tools, but they still very much fall into the compounding-error traps that agents often do at the present. reply CGamesPlay 3 hours agorootparentprevI have the automatic suggestions turned off. I use a keybind to activate it when I want it. > existing codebase in the form of a VSCode project / GitHub repo and uses that as a basis for suggestions What are you actually looking for? Copilot uses \"all of github\" via training, and your current project in the context. reply frereubu 3 hours agorootparent> I have the automatic suggestions turned off. I use a keybind to activate it when I want it. I didn't realise you could do that. Might give it another go. > Copilot uses \"all of github\" via training, and your current project in the context. The current project context is the bit I didn't think it had. Thanks! reply wrsh07 4 hours agorootparentprevFor cursor you can chat and ask @codebase and it will do rag (or equivalent) to answer your question reply goosejuice 6 hours agorootparentprevCopilot is also very slow. I'm surprised people use it to be honest. Just use Cursor. reply pindab0ter 5 hours agorootparentCursor requires you to use their specific IDE though, doesn't it? With Copilot I don't have to switch contexts as it lives in my Jetbrains IDE. reply goosejuice 5 hours agorootparentIt's just vscode. I greatly prefer vim but the difference between vim + ai tools and cursor is just a no brainer in terms of productivity. Cursor isn't without problems but it's leagues ahead of the competition in my opinion. reply verdverm 5 hours agorootparentI've been tempted to try Cursor because of vocal fans like yourself. Then I went to their website and forums yesterday. I am no longer tempted. reply goosejuice 1 hour agorootparentBecause of the complaints? If so, yeah I get it. I'm there amongst them. It's kind of like Tesla FSD. There are often setbacks in releases and they definitely need to work on their communication with the community. That said, for the current price it's still worth any misgivings. reply verdverm 31 minutes agorootparentThe price is one of the issues I have with this space more generally. I do not want to pay $20/m for a capped experience I want to pay $10/m to support development, and pay for my AI usage on my own, per request, by choosing my own model and provider If I was going to shell out money, it would be for Copilot, not Cursor. I prefer my AI to be a side dish, not the main course or core experience reply rob137 3 hours agorootparentprevCan you say more? reply verdverm 29 minutes agorootparentpricing model, downtime, model support, pricing model, trying to take over the experience rather than assist within my experience. This last one is big, because Cursor wants to \"reimagine\" how developers work. The problem is the AIs are so far from being competent, they need to be kept on the sidelines and sub'd in occasionally, not be the quarterback. Oh, did I mention pricing model? reply mattnewton 5 hours agorootparentprevI would try cursor. It’s pretty good at copy pasting the relevant parts of the codebase in and out of the chat window. I have the tab autocomplete disabled. reply Aeolun 6 hours agorootparentprevCursor tab does that. Or at least, it takes other open tabs into account when making suggestions. reply sincerely 5 hours agorootparentprevi’ve been very impressed with the gemini autocomplete suggestions in google colab, and it doesn’t feel more/less distracting than any IDEs built in tab suggestions reply verdverm 5 hours agorootparentI think a lot of people who are enabling copilot in vs code (like I did a few days ago), are experiencing \"suggested autocomplete as I type\" for the first time where before there was no grey text below what I am writing personally. It is a huge distraction, especially if it changes as I write more. I turned it off almost immediately. I deeply regret turning on copilot in vscode. It (M$) immediately weaseled into so many places and settings. I'm still trying to scaled it back. Super annoying and distracting. I'd prefer a much more opt in for each feature than what they did. reply the_af 5 hours agoparentprev> The best AI coders are positioned as tools for developers, rather than replacements for them. I agree with this. However, we must not delude ourselves and understand that corporate is pushing for replacement. So there will be a big push to improve on tools like Devin. This is not a conspiracy theory, in many companies (my wife's, for example) they are openly stating this: we are going to reduce (aka \"lay off\") the engineering staff and use as much AI solutions as possible. I wonder how many of us, here, understand that many jobs are going away if/when this works out for the companies. And the usual coping mechanism, \"it will only be for low hanging fruit\", \"it will never happen to me because my $SKILL is not replaceable\", will eventually not save you. Sure, if you are a unique expert on a unique field, but many of us don't have that luxury. Not everyone can be a top of the cream specialist. And it'll be used to drive down salaries, too. reply lolinder 4 hours agorootparentI remember when I was first getting started in the industry the big fear of the time was that offshoring was going to take all of our jobs and drive down the salaries of those that remained. In fact the opposite happened: it was in the next 10 years that salaries ballooned and tech had a hiring bubble. Companies always want to reduce staff and bad companies always try to do so before the solution has really proven itself. That's what we're seeing now. But having deep experience with these tools over many years, I'm very confident that this will backfire on companies in the medium term and create even more work for human developers who will need to come in and clean up what was left behind. (Incidentally, this also happened with offshoring— many companies ended up with large convoluted code bases that they didn't understand and that almost did what they wanted but were wrong in important ways. These companies needed local engineers to untangle the mess and get things back on track.) reply senordevnyc 1 hour agorootparentBut having deep experience with these tools over many years, I'm very confident... No one has had deep experience with these tools for any amount of time, let alone many years. They're literally just now hitting the market and are rapidly expanding their capabilities. We're at a fundamentally different place than we were just twelve months ago, and there's no reason to think 2025 will be any different. reply lolinder 48 minutes agorootparentI was building things with GPT-2 in 2019. I have as much experience engineering with them as anyone who wasn't an AI researcher before then. And no, we're not at a fundamentally different place than we were just 12 months ago. The last 12 months had much slower growth than the 12 months before that, which had slower growth than the 12 months before that. And in the end these tools have the same weaknesses that I saw in GPT-2, just to a lesser degree. The only aspect in which we are in a fundamentally different place is that the hype has gone through the roof. The tools themselves are better, but not fundamentally different. reply the_af 3 hours agorootparentprevI think it's qualitatively different this time. Unlike with offshoring, this is a technological solution, which understandably is received more enthusiastically on HN. I get it. It's interesting as tech! And it's achieved remarkable things. But unlike with offshoring (which is a people thing) or magical NOCODE/CASE/etc \"solutions\", it seems the consensus is that AI coding assistants will eventually get there. At least a portion of even HN seems to think so. And some are cheering! The coping mechanism seems to be \"it won't happen to me\" or \"my knowledge is too specialized\" but I think this will become increasingly false. And even if your knoweldge is too specialized to be replaced by AI, most engineers aren't like that. \"Well, become more specialized\" is unrealistic advice, and in any case, the employment pool will shrink.

Trends do not always continue, they often slow or reverse, and this one is showing all signs of doing so already.

When AI becomes able to do most non-programming tasks too, say design or solving open-ended problems (yeah, except in trivial cases it cannot -- for now) we can have this conversation again...

Sometimes their intelligence feels magical and they accomplish things within minutes that even mid level or senior software engineers would take a few hours to do. Other times, they make simple mistakes and no matter how much help you give, they run around in circles. A big quality that I value in junior engineers is coachability. If an AI agent can't be coached (and it doesn't look like it right now), then there's no way I'll ever enjoy using one. reply ipnon 10 hours agoparentMy first job I spent so much time reading Python docs, and the ancient art of Stack Overflow spelunking. But I could intuitively explain a solution in seconds because of my CS background. I used to encounter a certain kind of programmer often, who did not understand algorithms well but had many years of experience with a language like Ruby, and thus was faster in completing tasks because they didn't need to do the reference work that I had to do.

Or even know enough of the territory to realise there's something to recall. Without enough background, you'll get a whole set of amazing tools that you have no idea what to do with. For example, you may be able to write a long description of your problem with some ideas how to steer the AI to give you possible solutions. And the AI may figure out what the problem is and that the hyperloglog is something that could be useful to you. And you may have the awesome programming skills to implement that. But that's a lot of maybes. It would be much faster/easier if you knew about hyperloglog ahead of time and just asked for the implementation or library recommendation. Or even if you don't know about the actual solution, you'd have enough of CS vocabulary to ask: \"how do I get a fast, approximate distinct count from a multiset\". It would take a long imprecise description to get the same thing for a coder with no theory background. reply macNchz 5 hours agorootparentTo this point, I use AI programming assistants pretty heavily and find very frequently that they will write extremely inefficient or oddly baroque implementations of what I’m asking for in their first pass, that appear as if they don’t have the “knowledge” or ability to do it better, but then they can be prodded to re-do it very easily. Frequently I look at some generated code and write back the most cursory feedback like “looks o(n^2) can you make more efficient” or “use pointers instead of nested loops” or “how about using X approach” and it will often produce something dramatically better than the initial effort. For now at least I think these tools are still most powerful in the hands of experts. (I am a self-taught programmer but have a fair bit of experience) reply cmiles74 3 hours agorootparentprevI'm not convinced an LLM is really \"recalling\" any CS concepts when they try to solve a problem. IMHO, we're lucky if it matches the pattern of the request against the pattern of a solution and the two are actually related. I'm no expert but I don't think there's any reason to think that an LLM is taking a CS concept and applying it to something novel in order to get a solution. If they were, I believe their success rate would be much higher. In many places where someone might reach for something they remember from their CS coursework, there's often an open-source library or tool doing much the same thing. Understanding how these libraries and tools function is certainly valuable but, much of the time, people can get by with only a vague hunch; indeed, this is why they exist! IMHO, I would be happier with the LLM assistant if it picked reliable library code rather than writing up a sketchy solution of its own. I'm also familiar with this idea people who have managed to be successful in the field without a CS degree are more capable. In my opinion, this is hogwash. I think if we take a step back, we'll see that people graduating from established, top-tier CS programs are looking for higher pay than those who have come from a less expensive and (very often) business focused program. To be fair, people from each of these backgrounds has their strengths; in many organizations a developer who has done two semesters of accounting is a real benefit, in others the ability to turn a research paper into the prototype of a new product is going to be important. Years of experience often washes out much of these differences. People who have started from business oriented education programs may end up taking a handful of CS courses as they navigate their career, likewise many people with a CS background end up accruing business centered skills. In my opinion, people start out their education at a place that they can afford, a place that is familiar to them, often a place that they feel comfortable. Someone's economic background (and of their family) plays a big role on what kind of educational program they choose when they are on the cusp of adulthood. Smart and talented people can always learn what they need to learn, regardless of their starting point. reply jpc0 5 hours agorootparentprevI think honestly the meme that non-CS degree engineers are most capable is selection bias. If they had taken a CS degree they would likely be just as, of not more capable. To self-learn the topics you need to make good software takes an immense amount of effort and although the data and material is out there, takes a lot of work to figure out. I'm only recently starting to pick up on \"magic\" patterns that are actually extremely simple to understand given the right base knowledge... I can gain tons of insights from talks givem in the early 2010s but if I watched them without the correct practical experience and foundational knowledge it is the same as the title to a HN post this week[1], gibberish. With the correct time playing with the foundational patterns and learning some of the backing knowledge it unlocks amazing patterns in my mind and makes the magic seem simple. A great example, CSP[2]. I've known about and used the actor model before, which I first discovered when I found Erlang, but now with CSP I could ask the question \"Why should actors be heavy?\", you can put an actor into a light-weight task and spawn tons of them and build a tree of connections. Stuff like oneTBB flow graph[3]now makes sense and looks like a beautiful pattern with some really interesting ideas that can be implemented in more general computing than the high performance computing it was designed for. It seems niche but golang is built on those foundations, and the true power of concurrency in golang comes from embracing that. It fundamentally changes the way I want to structure and layout code and I feel like a good CS course can get you there quicker... Unfortunately a good CS course probably wouldn't accelerate the average CS grads understanding of that but can get someone dedicated and hungry there much much quicker. Someone fresh out of a JS bootcamp is maybe a decade away from that if they ever even want to search for that knowledge. 1. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42711751 2. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_pro... 3. https://oneapi-spec.uxlfoundation.org/specifications/oneapi/... reply marcyb5st 11 hours agoparentprevI completely agree with you.

I'll start believing that when I see it happening, and see actual engineers saying that AI can replace a human. I am long AI, but I think the winning formula is small, repetitive tasks with a little too much variation to make it worth it (or possible) to automate procedurally.

One of the more important features of agents is supposedly that they can stop and ask for human input when necessary. It seems it does do this for \"hard stops\" - like when it needed a human to setup API keys in their cloud console - but for \"soft stops\" it wouldn't. By contrast, a human dev would probably throw in the towel after a couple of hours and ask a senior dev for guidance. The chat interface definitely supports that with this system but apparently the agent will churn away in a sort of \"infinite thinking loop\".

Devin has tried to do too much. There is value in producing a solid code artifact that can be handed off for review to other developers in limited capacities like P2s and minor bugs which pile up in business backlogs.

Businesses like Factory AI or my own are taking that approach and we're seeing real interest in our products. reply yoavm 10 hours agoparentNot to take away from your opinion, but I guess time will tell? As models get better, it's possible that wide tools like Devin will work better and swallow tools that do one thing.

Interest isn't what tools like Devin are lacking, (un)fortunately. To be clear, I do share a lot of scepticism regarding all the businesses working around AI code generation. However, that isn't because I think they'll never be able to figure it out, but because I think they are all likely to figure it out at the end, at the same time, when better models come out. And none of them will have a real advantage over the other. reply ianbutler 10 hours agorootparentI've recently had several enterprise level conversations with different companies and what we're being asked for is specifically the simpler approach. I think that is the level of risk they're willing to tolerate and it will still ameliorate a real issue for them. The key here is my product is no worse positioned to do more things if and when the time comes, but building a solid foundation and trust, and not having the quiet part be (which I heard as early as several months ago) that your product doesn't work means we'll hopefully still have the customer base to roll that out to. I've talked to Devin's CEO once at Swyx's conference last June, they're very thoughtful and very kind so this must be very rough but between when they showed their demo then and what I'm hearing now the product has not evolved in a way where they are providing value commensurate with their marketing or hype. I'm a fan of Guillermo Rauch's (Vercel CEO) take on these things. You earn the right to take on bigger challenges and no one in this space has earned the right yet including us. Devin's investment was fueled by hyperspeculation early on when no one knew what the shape of the game was. In many ways we still don't, but if you burn your reputation before we get there you may not be able to capitalize on it.

But having said that, my experience is that for a given task in an unfamiliar codebase, an AI agent is already better at maintaining consistency than a typical junior developer, or even a mid-level developer who recently joined the team. And when explicitly given the task of refactoring the codebase while keeping the tests passing, the AI agents are already very capable. The biggest issue, which is what you may be alluding to, is that AI agents are currently very bad at recognizing the limits of their capabilities and continue trying an approach when a human dev would have long since given up and went to their lead to ask for help or for the task specification to be redefined. That's definitely an issue, but I don't see any fundamental technological limitation here, but rather something addressable via an engineering effort. In general, I've seen so many benchmarks fall to AI in the recent decade (including SWE-BENCH), that now I'm quite confident that if a task being performed by humans can be defined with clear numerical goals, then it's achievable by AI. And another way I'm looking at it is that for any specific knowledge work competency, it seems to already be much easier and time effective to train an AI to do well on it than to create a curriculum for humans to learn it and then to have every single human to go through it. reply DaveMcMartin 7 hours agoprevThis only reinforces my bias against AI agents.

I might be in some sweet spot where I am both old enough to know what is going on without using an AI but also young enough to pick up the use of AI relatively effortlessly.

Enormous time saver compared to figuring out how to do that from scratch. Never touched node in your life but want to build a simple electron app? Sure, here's how you get started. Few hours and several follow up questions later, you're comfortable and productive in the environment. Getting off the ground with new technologies is so much easier with AI it's kind of ridiculous.

They need actual guidance from somebody with much common sense; if let loose in the world, they mostly just spin around in circles because they don't have this executive intelligence. reply falcor84 5 hours agorootparentA regular single-pass LLM indeed cannot step back, but newer ones like o1/o3/Marco-o1/QwQ can, and a larger agentic system composed of multiple LLMs definitely can. There is no \"fundamental\" limitation here. And once we start training these larger systems from the ground up via full reinforcement learning (rather than composing existing models), the sky's the limit. I'd be very bullish about Deepmind, once they fully enter this race. reply weatherlite 6 hours agoprevThe whole idea of Devin is pointless and doomed to fail in my humble opinion, big tech will be quite capable on delivering A.I agents / assistants - very soon. I don't think wrappers over other people's LLMs like Devin make a lot of sense. Can someone help me understand what's the value proposition / moat of this company? reply dysoco 5 hours agoparentI'm confused here, aren't agents/assistants basically wrappers over LLMs or tools that interact with them as well? Devin seems to be in this category. reply fullstackchris 5 hours agorootparentI recommend you look at tools like Aider or Codebuff... sure they need to call some LLM at some point (could be your own, could be external), but the key thing that they are doing complex modifications of source code using things like treesitter -> i.e. you don't rely directly on the LLM modifying code, but the LLM using trees to modify the code. See in Aider's sourcecode: https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider/tree/main/aider/queries Simple copy-pasting of \"here's my prompt, give me code\" was always doomed from the start to be perfect every time, and DEFINITELY won't work for an agent. We need to start thinking about how to use these LLMs in smarter ways (like the above mentioned tools) reply verdverm 5 hours agorootparentCan Aider sit inside VS Code, understand what files I have open, and use them as context? Their docs lead me to say no, that they are an inline chat/completion experience reply ParetoOptimal 3 hours agorootparentTheir is a /chat command and an /add command so I'd assume a plugin like that is possible. reply aurareturn 11 hours agoprevWhat model does Devin use? How would it change if it used o1 or even o3 for times when it gets stuck? IE. Generate the initial code using GPT4o/Claude 3.5, then start testing the code, when it gets stuck, use o1/o3 to help. reply monkeydust 9 hours agoparentYea this is what I was wondering as well. I have o1 not o1 pro but I am gathering from reddit/youtube o1 pro if used correctly is superior for coding tasks. reply bodge5000 6 hours agoprevThe thing with AI agents I tend to find is they reveal how much heavy lifting the dev is actually doing. A personal example, my best use out of AI so far has been cases where documentation was poor to nonexistent, and Claude was able to give me a solution. But the thing is, it wasn't a working solution, nowhere close, but it was enough for me to extrapolate and do my own research based on the structure, classes and functions it used. Basically, it gave me somewhere to start from. Whether that's worth the social, economic and environmental problems is another story. reply coffeebeqn 11 hours agoprevSounds exactly like my experience with the “agents” about a year ago. Autogpt or whatever it was called. Works great 1% of the time and the rest it gets stuck in the wrong places completely unable to back out. I’m now using o1 or Claude Sonnet 3.5 and usually one of them gets it right. reply ipnon 11 hours agoparentThe current frontier models are all neocortex. They have no midbrain or crocodile brain to reconcile any physical, legal or moral feedback. The current state of the art is to preprocess all LLM responses with a physical/legal/moral classifier and respond with a generic \"I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that.\" We are fooled into thinking these golems have a shred of humanity, but their method of processing information is completely backward. Humans begin with a fight/flight classifier, then a social consensus regression, and only after this do we start generating tokens ... and we do this every moment of every day of our lives, uncountably often, the only prerequisite being the calories in an occasional slice of bread and butter. reply buremba 4 hours agoprevThe assumption with low-code tooling was that AI is so good at writing actual code in a way that it will make low-code tools redundant. Spending time with Windsurf, Cursor, and a bunch of VSCode extensions, while it was so impressive to see new projects being created autonomously, asking for new requirements or fixing bugs after >10 iterations was more complex. I had to audit the code and give specific directions on how to restructure the code to avoid getting stuck when the project gets more complex. That makes me think autonomous agents will do much better on low-code tools, as their restrictions ensure the agent is on track. The problem with low-code tools is that they also get more complicated to scale after maybe like >200 iterations. (for a medium-sized project, on average 6 months) reply pplonski86 8 hours agoprevI'm working on AI assistant in Python notebook. It aims to help with data science tasks. I'm not using it to do a full analysis. It will fail. What I ask is to create a code snippet for my next step in the analysis. Many times I need to manually change the code, but it is fine because LLM speed-up my coding a lot. And it is really fantastic in writing matplotlib code for visualization. I don't remember all matplotlib syntax to change axis labels, add annotations or change style, and LLM really can handle it good, in impressive speed. reply jboggan 6 hours agoprev\"Even more telling was that we couldn’t discern any pattern to predict which tasks would work.\" I think this cuts to the core of the problem for having a human in the loop. If we cannot learn how to best use the tool from repeated use and discern some kind of patterns of best and worst practices then it isn't really a tool. reply bsenftner 7 hours agoprevAt some point people are going to realize that using these LLM AIs is a communications problem, and by that I mean the reason various attempts to use them fail is because they are not being effectively told what to do, vague and implied requests are not enough for a inhuman statistical construct to grasp what you're asking without clearer more details and more specific instructions. reply exo-cortex 10 hours agoprevI remain sceptical about the \"Planet Tracker\"-task. The task was to debunk claims about historical positions of Jupiter and Saturn. If the task was to find those planets were NOT in a certain (claimed) position an erroneous program would still appear to \"debunk\" the claims. Did they check if Devin's code's calculated positions were actually correct? Did they check in some NASA-database? If Devin gave arbitrary positions for the planets it's much more likely that they're different than any claim and appear to debunk it. reply Yenrabbit 1 hour agoparentI was able to read the code it wrote, and check that (as hoped) it was using a good existing library to do the heavy lifting. And I had it make plots that I could visually use to check that the values were 'reasonable'. The value in that case was simply that I didn't have to leave the couch and write the code myself (although if the result was actually needed for anything more important than a smug 'i thought so' confirmation I would still have taken over and validated it kore carefully). reply jamalaramala 5 hours agoprev> Even more concerning was Devin’s tendency to press forward with tasks that weren’t actually possible. (...) > Devin spent over a day attempting various approaches and hallucinating features that didn’t exist. One of the big problems of GenAI is its inability to know what they don't know. Because of that, they don't ask clarifying questions. Humans, in the same situation, would spend a lot of time learning before they could be truly productive. reply iLoveOncall 5 hours agoparentYour statement is factually wrong, Claude 3.5v2 asks clarifying questions when needed \"natively\", and you can add similar instructions in your prompt for any model. reply sitkack 4 hours agorootparentThe default system prompts are tuned for the naive case. LLMs being all purpose text handling tools, can be reprogrammed for any behavior you wish. This is the crux of skilled use of LLMs. The better the LLMs get, the worse the average prompt quality. reply baobabKoodaa 4 hours agorootparentYep. It's fairly trivial to prompt an LLM to say \"I don't know\" when it doesn't know something. reply paradite 9 hours agoprevI also wrote my first impressions on Devin, more focused on the user experience and analysis of its capabilities (with lots of screenshots): https://thegroundtruth.substack.com/p/devin-first-impression... reply timabdulla 8 hours agoparentYour take seems much more positive than theirs. What do you think the key differences are between your experience and the one here? reply paradite 7 hours agorootparentOne possible reason is that I'm using popular tech stacks (Next.js, HTML/JS for demo website and SDK). No niche frameworks or tools like nbdev (I've never heard of that). Also I've been prompting ChatGPT and Claude for over a year, that might help with communicating with Devin. reply neves 5 hours agoprevDo you have good references about using AI coding assistants? Techniques of prompt engineering help a lot, but I really think there will be created a body of knowledge about how to use, what's the good contexts of use, and good heuristics. They are a valuable tool, but I feel it's possible to extract more value. reply brown_martin 5 hours agoprevI've been experimenting with code gen on and off for the last 18 months, and find this exactly in line with my experience. reply pcwelder 5 hours agoprevMost the problems you mentioned will likely be solved with the next iterations of Devin or similar product. I can say that because I work daily with Claude as an agent over mcp, and the problems you mentioned feel very familiar. Based on the type of the issues you mentioned, Devin isn't likely using o1 yet. A workflow like o1 for planning, Claude for Coding, o1 for review, etc., would work better. The problems you mentioned: ssh-key issue unrelated to script, code not following existing patterns or themes, instructions not being followed, extra abstractions, etc., fall into that category. Some of the issues are likely due to context length problem. For example, LLM doesn't work well with jupyter notebook because of extra junk in ipynb, which will likely remain a problem. reply elicksaur 5 hours agoparentWe’ll see! We’re just one year away from AGI. Just like we were last year! reply bpicolo 5 hours agoprevAn engineer that thinks it knows everything (but doesn't) and can't self-correct is about the worst combo I can think of. reply falcor84 5 hours agoparentWell, having read too much sci-fi, I am more afraid of an AI engineer that really does know everything. reply Over2Chars 6 hours agoprevNo matter what happens with Devin specifically, I think this is a really important topic and I enjoy reading updates on this kind of review every time.

Sometimes a task might take forever and deliver a bad result or fail completely. It seems it is targeting few specific problems and whatever else is just too hard. I also think that, thought it is expensive, it is cheap for the technology behind it and it won't be able to keep that price for long reply gtsop 10 hours agoprevHonestly, i have been bitten so many times by LLM hallucinations when I work in parallel with the LLM, I wouldn't trust it autonomously running anything at all.

The version of o1 released on 2024-12-17 so rarely hallucinates when asked code questions of basic to medium difficulty and provided with good context and a well written prompt, in my experience. If the context window is sub-10k tokens, I have very high confidence that the output will be correct.

If you appreciate this content and would like to see more of it, your subscription will help to ensure that LWN continues to thrive. Please visit this page to join up and keep LWN on the net. By Jonathan Corbet January 2, 2025 We are reliably informed by the calendar that yet another year has begun. That can only mean one thing: the time has come to go out on a limb with a series of ill-advised predictions that are almost certainly not how the year will actually go. We have to try; it's traditional, after all. Read on for our view of what's coming and how it may play out. The extensible scheduling class (sched-ext) will be a game changer. Already we have seen, in 2024, how the ability to load a CPU scheduler from user space as a set of BPF programs has unleashed a great deal of creativity; that was before sched-ext was part of a released kernel. In 2025, this feature will start showing up in more distributions, and more people will be able to play with it. The result will be a flood of new scheduling ideas, each of which can be quickly tested (and improved) on real systems. Some of those ideas will result in specialty schedulers included with focused distributions (systems for gaming, for example); others, hopefully, will eventually find their way into the kernel's EEVDF scheduler. Code written in Rust will land in the kernel at an increasing rate over the course of the year as a result of the increased availability of abstractions and greater familiarity with the language in the kernel community. The Rust code that has been merged so far is mostly infrastructure and proofs of concept; in 2025, we'll see Rust code that end users will run — but they may never notice. The number of unstable language features needed by the kernel will drop significantly as those features are stabilized by the Rust community. Another XZ-like backdoor attempt will come to light. Existing code bases have been scoured for attacks similar to those used against XZ; little has been found, but that does not mean that there are not other ongoing efforts, using different techniques, out there. The potential payoff for a government agency or other suitably well-funded organization is simply too high for all of them to ignore; somebody is surely trying something. Increasingly, single-maintainer projects (or subsystems, or packages) will be seen as risky by their users. Security incidents like the XZ backdoor attempt will be part of that, but a project with a single maintainer is also subject to all of the other problems associated with burnout and insufficient time to do the job properly. Such a project will never be as reliable as one would like. A major project will discover that it has merged a lot of AI-generated code, a fact that may become evident when it becomes clear that the alleged author does not actually understand what the code does. We depend on our developers to contribute their own work and to stand behind it; large language models cannot do that. A project that discovers such code in its repository may face the unpleasant prospect of reverting significant changes. Meanwhile, we will see more focused efforts to create truly free generative AI systems, perhaps including the creation of one or more foundations to support the creation of the models. This work will include a great deal of innovation focused on reducing the resources that these models need, driven by the much lower level of resources available. The resulting code will help to increase the access to — and control over — these systems, with unknown results; not everybody will use them for good purposes. We may also see the launch of one or more foundations aimed specifically at providing support for maintainers. Even companies that contribute enthusiastically to free-software projects often balk at supporting the maintainer role, despite the fact that projects don't work without maintainers. But perhaps some of those companies can be encouraged to support a separate entity that promises to solve — or at least improve — the maintainer situation for specific projects of interest. The maintainer role will still be severely under-supported at the end of the year, though. Foundations supporting free-software work will continue to struggle in 2025, though, continuing the trend seen in 2024. The coming year does not look like a time of increasing generosity in general, so organizations that depend on the generosity of others will have their work cut out for them. There will be more cloud-based products turned to bricks by manufacturers that go bankrupt or simply stop caring. Surveillance and data-breach problems with cloud-connected products will also happen with discouraging regularity over the course of the year; see the stories on air-fryer surveillance or the Volkswagen electric-vehicle data leak for recent examples. Perhaps 2025 will be the year when awareness of the downsides of extensive cloud connectivity will become more widespread. There is an opportunity for free-software alternatives, such as Home Assistant, to make inroads by demonstrating a better way to manage personal data. Truly taking advantage of that opportunity will require a user focus that is not always our community's strong point, but one can always hope. As a corollary to the above, more fully open hardware will become available in 2025. The OpenWrt One, which hit the market in 2024, quickly sold out its initial production run. There is clearly an appetite for hardware that can be truly owned by its purchasers, and our community has the skills and tools needed to make such hardware. Expect some interesting projects to launch in the coming year. Distributions for mobile devices will see a resurgence in interest in the coming year. In the early days of Android, it was common to replace a phone vendor's software with CyanogenMod or another derivative; it was the best way to get the most control and functionality out of the device. As Android improved, many of us stopped going to that extra effort. Increasing privacy and security concerns, paired with increasing quality on the part of the alternative distributions, will start to drive some users away from stock Android once again. Finally, global belligerence will make itself felt in our community. The world as a whole does not appear to be headed in a peaceful direction; even if new conflicts do not spring up, the existing ones will be enough to affect the development community. Developers from out-of-favor parts of the world may, again, find themselves excluded, regardless of any personal culpability they may have for the evil actions of their governments or employers. This is being written in the US, where politics have taken a distinct \"us versus them\" turn; such trends are not limited to this country, though. That attitude runs strongly against the foundations our community was built on; we are building systems for everybody, accepting the contributions of anybody who is willing and able to help. We have shown that it is possible to build a global community that can accomplish amazing things and change the world. This coming year would be a good one in which to show that we are still capable of doing that. As some strive to tear our institutions down, we can work to make our institutions stronger than ever. LWN will begin its 27th year of publication in January; we are one institution that is proud to have been a part of the Linux and free-software communities for so long, and we have no intention of stopping now. Whatever happens in 2025, we'll be here to write about it and, hopefully, spread some light and understanding. And, of course, we'll return to these predictions in December to have a good laugh at just how far off they turned out to be. Best wishes to all of you; LWN would not be what it is without our readers. We wish an especially happy and prosperous 2025 to our subscribers; without you, we would not have been around for all these years. to post comments Not a long limb Posted Jan 2, 2025 16:34 UTC (Thu) by dskoll (subscriber, #1630) [Link] Those predictions all look pretty reasonable to me!

Better support for Cygwin would be great too. The original WSL in some ways is better, cleaner, and simpler for software that doesn't need things like support for direct GPU integration, Wayland, and Vulkan, to name a few. Obligatory Joke Posted Jan 5, 2025 14:01 UTC (Sun) by mathstuf (subscriber, #69389) [Link] (2 responses) Except for all the subtle ways that it was *not* actually Linux.

Obligatory Joke Posted Jan 5, 2025 14:55 UTC (Sun) by butlerm (subscriber, #13312) [Link] (1 responses) In cases like that Microsoft should release the necessary parts under an appropriate open source license and let someone else do it.

Until then, WSL1 bugs go in the \"if you can't reproduce it on a real Linux, go talk to Microsoft\" bucket. Obligatory Joke Posted Jan 6, 2025 17:55 UTC (Mon) by tesarik (subscriber, #52705) [Link] (4 responses) That's wrong. The next step is Linux Subsystem for Windows, which will present native Windows desktop on a Linux kernel. Micosoft can then finally cut their R&D costs by maintaining only one kernel instead of two… Obligatory Joke Posted Jan 10, 2025 12:00 UTC (Fri) by anton (subscriber, #25547) [Link] (3 responses) I have expected Microsoft to implement Windows as an API layer on Linux (essentially like WINE, but with the authority and funds of Microsoft behind it) for about 20 years, with the benefit that they would get a better kernel and would need less maintenance effort. Microsoft has not gone there. I expect that they considered that approach, too, but that their current approach gives them more benefits, maybe just marketing, but maybe there are technical considerations, too: E.g., having software like Crowdstrike probably would not be very stable if they go with the mainline kernel, and sticking with one specific kernel increases the maintenance burden, so they might just as well stick with their current kernel. Obligatory Joke Posted Jan 10, 2025 19:24 UTC (Fri) by raven667 (subscriber, #5198) [Link] (2 responses) Aside from the long tail of compatibility that they want to support to keep existing business, I believe they also use the Windows kernel as the basis for Azure, so they might see it as a competitive advantage against Amazon, VMware, etc. to have their own kernel hackers and their own customization. The cost of changing might not be something they can recoup given they seem to be in a sustainable state now when it comes to base OS kernel support. Whether Exchange, SharePoint or the Azure management plane are a steaming pile or not is unrelated to the quality and brand of the underlying kernel. Obligatory Joke Posted Jan 10, 2025 20:23 UTC (Fri) by Cyberax (✭ supporter ✭, #52523) [Link] (1 responses) > I believe they also use the Windows kernel as the basis for Azure As I understand, most of the networking-level hardware in Azure actually runs Linux ( https://www.wired.com/2015/09/microsoft-using-linux-run-c... ). As for the hypervisor, the current generation of AWS products uses custom hardware to completely decouple the hypervisor from the underlying guest OS. So the type of a kernel that runs on this hardware is not really that important, in the grand scheme of things. Obligatory Joke Posted Jan 11, 2025 1:35 UTC (Sat) by raven667 (subscriber, #5198) [Link] Yeah, pretty much all datacenter networking hardware runs Linux now, AFAICT. I was thinking of the hypervisor, as you said AWS has their own in-house thing, so did VMware and effectively, so does MS. Risks versus other risks Posted Jan 2, 2025 18:35 UTC (Thu) by pizza (subscriber, #46) [Link] > Increasingly, single-maintainer projects (or subsystems, or packages) will be seen as risky by their users. ...Unfortunately, \"seen as risky\" won't actually result in additional maintainers or even non-minor contributors stepping up. And in in the situtation where that does happen, it turns out new contributors are an even riskier proposition. On Android distros Posted Jan 2, 2025 18:42 UTC (Thu) by sionescu (subscriber, #59410) [Link] (25 responses) > Distributions for mobile devices will see a resurgence in interest It will be interesting to see how this will interact with the device security attestation that's built into Android. Many banking apps will refuse to run on a device that was unlocked or has even one app installed from an unknown source (i.e. neither the Google Play store nor the manufacturer store). On Android distros Posted Jan 2, 2025 21:26 UTC (Thu) by epa (subscriber, #39769) [Link] (11 responses) Presumably if you control the distribution all the way down to the kernel, you could program it to hide the apps that are installed or change the ‘unlocked’ flag.

The \"remote attestation\" thing (read: pervasive DRM facilitated by hardware) is explicitly designed to mitigate this... unfortunate possibility (unfortunate, of course, in the eyes of the commercial interests). On Android distros Posted Jan 2, 2025 22:06 UTC (Thu) by epa (subscriber, #39769) [Link] (3 responses) Yes, I guess it depends on whether you have open hardware or there are some parts of the system (a TPM) that not even the kernel can fully control. On Android distros Posted Jan 3, 2025 2:12 UTC (Fri) by khim (subscriber, #9252) [Link] (2 responses) Most (all?) mobile devices have two systems in one chipset, one is running Android (or other high-level OS) and the other one runs proprietary RTOS and certified to drives the radio. Guess which one is in charge of everything and couldn't be easily touched and/or changed? On Android distros Posted Jan 3, 2025 8:56 UTC (Fri) by epa (subscriber, #39769) [Link] (1 responses) That’s true but I think it is not what we were talking about. A banking app does not check whether your phone’s radio is operating within FCC parameters. It may ask to list the apps installed at the Linux level or whether the user has root access (which does not give you control over the locked-down radio hardware). The question is whether there is a third piece of hardware, the TPM, which can be queried from user space but isn’t under the device owner’s control, so you cannot tell it to say you are running a particular software stack when you aren’t. If you do have root you could in principle attach a debugger to the misbehaving app and alter its memory to make it run anyway, but that wouldn’t help with a cryptographically strong attestation to a remote server using a private key locked inside the TPM. On Android distros Posted Jan 3, 2025 14:56 UTC (Fri) by khim (subscriber, #9252) [Link] > A banking app does not check whether your phone’s radio is operating within FCC parameters. Sure, but the existence of separate, “hidden” and “secret” world means this quesion > The question is whether there is a third piece of hardware, the TPM, which can be queried from user space but isn’t under the device owner’s control, so you cannot tell it to say you are running a particular software stack when you aren’t. Has very definitive and obvious answer: yes, there is such a piece of hardware. And you can not forge it. Of course many banking apps look for things that shouldn't concern them (things like what other apps are installed), and these can be easily forged by suitable firmware. But if they just look for the attestation then this couldn't be forged. > If you do have root you could in principle attach a debugger to the misbehaving app and alter its memory to make it run anyway, but that wouldn’t help with a cryptographically strong attestation to a remote server using a private key locked inside the TPM. Of course our world is not perfect and we couldn't have nice things: because in certain places hacked Chinese phones are extremely popular (they are cheaper but need hacked ROM to stop phoning to the Chinese landlords) banks couldn't just trust the attestation. Instead they invent elaborate schemes that allow the use of some of these hacked phones, but not all hacked phones. Whether it'll work on your device depends on the bank and the phase of the moon.

If an app requires that level of integrity, and is willing to sacrifice compatibility with older Android devices and niche device configurations, no amount of fiddling with software will get around it (barring severe bugs in the implementation). GrapheneOS notes that instead of using the Play Integrity API, apps could use AOSP's lower-level attestation API and choose to accept devices that match a list of \"official GrapheneOS verified boot keys\" (https://grapheneos.org/articles/attestation-compatibility...), which should provide a similar level of assurance without being tied to the proprietary Google Play Services. But I don't know if any serious apps actually do that.

On Android distros Posted Jan 3, 2025 12:08 UTC (Fri) by excors (subscriber, #95769) [Link] (2 responses) The app connects to some online service (e.g. your bank) which controls all the sensitive data this system is trying to protect. (It's not meant to protect purely offline apps). The app uses the API to get a securely signed attestation report, which it forwards to the online service for verification (checking the root certificate is signed by Google's attestation root key, the Verified Boot details say it's running trustworthy firmware, etc). The app/kernel/firmware can't forge the signatures, because the hardware does a reasonable job at keeping the private keys secret, so the server would reject a fake report and the app wouldn't have access to your money/secrets/etc. On Android distros Posted Jan 3, 2025 14:01 UTC (Fri) by epa (subscriber, #39769) [Link] (1 responses) So you're saying the signature for the attestation report comes from the TPM (not the Linux operating system). On Android distros Posted Jan 3, 2025 16:25 UTC (Fri) by excors (subscriber, #95769) [Link] Basically, yes. (Technically it's not called a TPM, probably because that's a specific ISO standard and they don't implement that, but it's a vaguely similar idea. On Pixel phones there's a small 'secure' OS running on the main CPU in parallel to Linux, using ARM TrustZone for isolation; plus a security core on the main SoC, with its own dedicated CPU/RAM/etc running another OS; plus a physically separate security chip with yet another simple OS. Some combination of those are used for Verified Boot, attestation, etc. See https://security.googleblog.com/2021/10/pixel-6-setting-n...)

Funnily enough, I've seen more issues running banking apps on stock Android. Root it and hide everything but base system stuff using MagiskHide (or whatever it is called now), and poof, the problem is gone. The day they start effectively locking rooted devices out is the day I'll quit my account there, making sure they know why (not that I expect them to care). First of all, because it's the only language they'll understand. But even more importantly in practice, dealing with such restrictions just complicates daily tasks too much. They decided I have to use their app to confirm transactions - not what I'd have preferred, but fine, I'll go along as long as it doesn't cause too much friction. But they sure as hell don't get to decide what hardware or software I'll run their app on.

I always want to be able to switch devices easily. I don't have a google account. When I'm asked to use the banking apps I ask \"why would I create an account with google or apple company now? that doesn't feel right for wanting to use online banking.\" nobody in a bank has a good answer for that and I now use a \"cardtan\" device (\"small computer\", i.e. non-connected uC-based). Similar story for the \"legal services\" app in my country where I use a fido2 key instead of an app. While the app-solutions are what people are primarily shown and using, I guess there's good reasons for why this is not the only technical solution for critical services. I hope there's even a law that requires that, not sure.

But from what I could make out, they added all the interest up front when calculating the repayments, and I didn't trust them to refund the finance charges if I repaid it early. That was what I wanted to check, and I got the distinct impression any refund was discretionary ... so if you took the loan to get the discount, then repaid it after a month or two, you could end up out of pocket.

On Android distros Posted Jan 3, 2025 17:01 UTC (Fri) by excors (subscriber, #95769) [Link] I think it's not about \"need\" - it's a tradeoff between security and compatibility. There's no practical way to do this kind of integrity verification on PCs, and blocking access from all PCs would drive away too many customers, so the banks will put up with a certain level of fraud from keylogging malware etc. But there is a practical way to do it on modern phones, and blocking access from unverified phones would only drive away a small number of customers, so they've decided the reduction in fraud makes that worthwhile. (My bank also makes the app much more convenient than the website - e.g. I can set up new payments through the app with just a fingerprint (and maybe facial recognition if it's a large amount of money), whereas on the website I need to type in my ID and password and then insert my physical card into a card reader to generate authorisation codes to type in. There's always a security vs convenience tradeoff, but the improved security of the phone platform means they can increase convenience and still keep fraud within acceptable levels.)

As has oft been noted, many companies will support developers who write device drivers for their own hardware or contribute to arch/ for their processors. Fewer are employers who are willing to underwrite more fundamental, hardware-agnostic improvements and innovation in kernel/, tools, and tests. Among the latter group, the long-term principal contributors have been Intel and Redhat. Samsung, Google, Meta and Huawei among others have been stepping up, but filling a hole left by a diminished Intel contribution would be painful indeed. Notable by its absence Posted Jan 3, 2025 15:40 UTC (Fri) by willy (subscriber, #9762) [Link] (6 responses) I think you missed at least one employer who makes significant contributions to mm, fs and other core functionality ;-) It's interesting to watch where the contributions come from; originally it was mostly distros (RH, SuSE, etc). Then the traditional Unix vendors (IBM, HP, SGI, Sun, Digital, etc). Then came the consumer HW vendors (as you say, Samsung, Huawei, etc). The big employers right now are the cloud vendors (Google, Meta, Microsoft, Oracle, Huawei, Alibaba). We survived the Intel layoffs of 2016. Anyone good got snapped up immediately, and I can promise you there is no shortage of demand to hire people who already have dozens of kernel commits. People will undoubtedly change their focus when moving to a new employer, but the pace of contributions will not slacken. Notable by its absence Posted Jan 3, 2025 22:55 UTC (Fri) by cschaufler (subscriber, #126555) [Link] (5 responses) I can't agree that the pace of contributions will not slacken. Think of the maintainers of IA64, who's specific skills may not translate well to other architectures. Maintainers who leave one job frequently find reduced support for their projects in the next. Some maintainers who are let go decide to leave the open source community entirely, either by taking unrelated positions or retiring. Notable by its absence Posted Jan 4, 2025 13:45 UTC (Sat) by willy (subscriber, #9762) [Link] (4 responses) Yes, when Intel laid me off in 2016, I had a good long think about whether I wanted to continue working on the kernel and indeed in open source at all. Ultimately I decided to keep working on the kernel, but not on DAX. Which decision has been vindicated, unfortunately, by Intel's inability to bring a successful product to market. But I disagree that the hypothetical ia64 maintainer would have few transferrable skills. An architecture maintainer must be a jack-of-all-trades. They typically know a fair bit about mm, fs, firmware, and device drivers. Anyway, my point is that kernel hackers remain in high demand and are only out of work for as long as they want to be (modulo other constraints like work visas and so on). You really have to try hard to be an unemployable kernel hacker.

But a kernel hacker's next gig might be writing out-of-tree scheduler extensions for fintech, or supporting a private fork of bcachefs.

It's happened before; one could include the Lustre folks who, while not closed source, are out of tree and make few contributions to the mainline. I certainly have had offers to do closed source projects ... and haven't accepted them. I used to get offers to be CTO at various startups which is hilarious from multiple points of view (I would be a terrible CTO). I was also offered the opportunity to work on NVMe firmware. I'm not saying I can't be bought, but it'd have to be a lot of money or a really interesting project for me to find it worth doing. I did take close to three years off from kernel contributions while I was at Intel to work on NVMe, and I think we can all agree that worked out well for everyone. There are still a lot of companies who are interested in hiring kernel developers to contribute to upstream. Anecdotally, that seems to be the largest pain point -- they want to get their changes upstream but don't know how to do it. Hiring someone with a track record of getting patches upstream is a good way of solving this problem with money.

The code is in much better shape compared to when the client was kicked out of staging. Of course, there's still a lot more to be done. But I'm optimistic Lustre could land in mainline someday.

I may be an AI Posted Jan 5, 2025 18:40 UTC (Sun) by NYKevin (subscriber, #129325) [Link] I distinctly remember writing some code for a system, that was designed to do X, to make it do Y instead of X. It was long and ugly and involved multiple nested loops. It had incredibly poor performance, taking over a minute to do something that ought to finish in seconds. One day, I had an epiphany, and restructured it so that the loops were nested differently and we iterated in a different overall order. This literally cut the execution time in half. Subsequently, I was entirely unable to explain how I saved that much performance with such a trivial refactor. It was in Python, with lots of indirection and hash map lookups, so no, this was not a simple case of cache locality. I think it probably involved early returns and avoiding some redundant iterations, but it was a long time ago and I do not remember the details. The story has a happy ending: We decided to go back to doing X (instead of Y), so the code was deleted, everything went back to reasonable performance, and nobody has to try and understand it anymore. Y was a dumb idea in the first place, and we really only did it as a stopgap as part of a tech migration, so we're probably not going to try and do it again. more fully open hardware ...

A lot of DevOps is using abstractions, yes. But using a Terraform module to deploy your managed database without reading the code and checking all options is the same as using a random library without reading the code and checking all parameters in your application. People skimping on important things exist in all roles. > people tell you \"just use this helm chart or ansible recipe from some github repo to do what you want\". What those things really install? Not documented. What can you configure? Check the code. I mean, this is just wrong. Both Ansible roles and Helm charts have normalised documentations. Official Ansible modules include docs with all possible parameters, and concrete examples how they work together. Helm charts also come with a file which literally lists all possible options (values.yaml). And yes, checking the code is always a good idea when using third party code you don't trust.

Like for example with telemetry: people who worked at Google or Meta all rave about the mythical tools they got to use in-house and how they cannot find anything equivalent outside... and yes when you check what is available \"outside\" it looks less powerful and all those solutions feel like the same. So you got the FAANG islands of tools and way to do things, the big box commercial offering and their armies of consultants and then the OpenSource and Freemium way of doing telemetry. The latter two are converging with OpenTelemetry and Prometheus and related projects. Both ways are well documented, and there are a number of projects and vendors providing alternatives and various options. People can pick what works best for them (and it could very well be open source but hosted for you, cf. Grafana Cloud). I'm not sure how that's related to \"islands of knowledge\"... observability in general is one of the most widely discussed topics in the space. reply beAbU 10 hours agorootparentprevDo other companies not have static analysis integrated into the CI/CD pipeline? We by default block any and all PRs that contain funky code: high cyclomatic complexity, unused variables, bad practise, overt bugs, known vulnerabilities, inconsistent style, insufficient test coverage, etc. If that code is not pristine, it's not going in. A human dev will not even begin the review process until at least the static analysis light is green. Time is then spent mentoring the greens as to why we do this, why it's important, and how you can get your code to pass. I do think some devs still use AI tools to write code, but I believe that the static analysis step will at least ensure some level of forced ownership over the code. reply liontwist 8 hours agorootparentI think it’s a good thing to use such tools. But no amount of tooling can create quality. It gives you an illusion of control.

You don't need to fully understand a StackOverflow answer, but you at least need to recognise if the question could be applicable. With LLMs, it makes the decisions completely for you, and if it doesn't work you can even get it to figure out why for you. I think young people today are at severe risk of building up what I call learning debt. This is like technical debt (or indeed real financial debt). They're getting further and further, through university assignments and junior dev roles, without doing the learning that we previously needed to. That's certainly what I've seen. But, at some point, even LLMs won't cut it for the problem they're faced with and suddenly they'll need to do those years of learning all at once (i.e. the debt becomes due). Of course, that's not possible and they'll be screwed. reply ben_w 6 hours agorootparent> With LLMs, it makes the decisions completely for you, and if it doesn't work you can even get it to figure out why for you.

The p95 developers who are more-or-less okay aren't really notable enough to be worth complaining about on HN, since they are us. reply ryandrake 12 hours agorootparentAnd, as OP alluded to, I bet these kinds of programmers tend to “fail upward” and disproportionately become eng managers and directors, spreading their carelessness over a wider blast radius, while the people who care stagnate as perpetual “senior software engineers”. reply bryanrasmussen 9 hours agorootparentmaybe they care more about the quality as they become managers etc. quality takes effort, maybe they don't like taking the effort but like making other people take the effort. reply redeux 6 hours agorootparentprev> Most of the rest of the time these folks just smile and nod and continue not caring, and companies can't afford the hassle of firing them, then you open LinkedIn years later and turns out somehow they've failed up to manager, architect or executive while you're still struggling along as a code peasant who happens to take pride in their work. I’ve heard this sentiment several times over the years and what I think a lot of people don’t realize is that they’re just playing a different game than you. Their crappy code is a feature not a bug because they’re expending the energy on politics rather than coding. In corporations politics is a form a work, but it’s not work that many devs want to do. So people will say the uncaring dev is doing poor work, but really they’re just not seeing the real work being done. I’m not saying this is right or wrong, it’s just an observation. Obviously this isn’t true for everyone who does a poor job, but if you see that person start climbing the ladder, that’s the reason. reply stcroixx 5 hours agorootparentThe kind of work you're describing doesn't benefit the company, it benefits the individual.

I expect things to improve, rapidly, though. reply devsda 12 hours agorootparentprev> then you open LinkedIn years later and turns out somehow they've failed up to manager, architect or executive while you're still struggling along as a code peasant That's because they come across as result oriented, go getter kind of persons while the others will be seen as uptight individuals. Unfortunately, management for better or worse self selects the first kind. LLMs are only going to make it worse. If you can write clean code in half a day and an LLM can generate a \"working\" sphagetti mess in few mins, management will prefer the mess. This will be the case for many organizations where software is just an additional supporting expense and not critical part of the main business. reply 0xEF 8 hours agorootparentprevThe LLMs are not just another tool for these folks, but for folks who should not be touching code at all. That's the scary part. In my field (industrial automation), I have had to correct issues three times now in the ladder logic on a PLC that drives an automation cell that can definitely kill or hurt someone in the right circumstances (think maintenance/repair). When asked where the logic came from, they showed me the tutorials they feed to their LLM of choice to \"teach\" it ladder logic, then had it spit out answers to their questions. Safety checks were missed, needless to say, which thankfully only broke the machines. These are young controls engineers at big companies. I won't say who, but many of you probably use one of their products to go to your own job. I am not against using LLMs as a sort of rubber duck to bounce ideas off of or maybe get you thinking in a different directions for the sake of problem solving, but letting them do the work for you and not understanding how to check the validity of that work is maddeningly dangerous in some situations. reply Cthulhu_ 9 hours agorootparentprevYou can lead a horse to water, etc. What worked for me wasn't so much a mentor telling me xyz was good / bad, but metrics and quality gates - Sonar (idk when it was renamed to sonarqube or what the difference is) will flag up these issues and simply make the merge request unmergeable unless the trivial issues are fixed. Because that's the frustrating part; they're trivial issues, unreachable code and unused variables are harmless (on paper), just a maintenance burden and frustrating for whoever has to maintain it later on. But because they're trivial, the author doesn't care about them either. Trivial issues should be automatically fixed and / or checked by tooling, it shouldn't cost you (the reviewer) any headspace in the first place. And it shouldn't need explanation or convincing to solve either. Shouldn't, but here we are. But yeah, the next decade will be interesting. I'm not really using it in my code yet because idk, the integration broke again or I keep forgetting it exists. But we integrated a tool in our gitlab that generates a code review, both summarzing the changes and highlighting the risks / issues if any. I don't like that, but the authors of merge requests aren't writing proper merge request descriptions either, so I suppose an AI generated executive summary is better than nothing. reply svilen_dobrev 3 hours agorootparentprev> failed up to manager... see, everything around can be a tool.

A junior goes on SO to copy and paste. If your answer is \"I don't know I just copied\" you're not doing any engineering and it's awful to pretend you are. Our job is literally about asking \"why\" and \"how\" until we don't need to anymore because our pattern matching skills allow us to generalize. At this point in my career I rarely ever go to SO, and when I do it's because of some obscure thing that 7 other people came across and decided to post a question about. Or to look up \"how to do the most basic shit in language I am not familiar with\", but that role was taken over by LLMs. reply mrweasel 10 hours agorootparentprevThere's nothing inherently wrong with getting help from either and LLM, or StackOverflow, it's the \"I don't know' part that bothers me. One the funnier reactions to \"I got it from StackOverflow\" is the followup question \"From the question or the answers?\" If you just adds code, without understanding how it works, regardless of where it came from and potential licensing issues, then I question your view on programming. If I have a paint come in and paint my house and get paint all over the place, floors, windows, electrical socket but still get the walls the color I want, then I wouldn't consider that person a professional painter. reply sebazzz 3 hours agorootparentprevThe LLM also tends to do a good bit of the integrations of the code in your codebase. With SO you need to do it yourself, so you at least need to understand the outer boundary of the code. And on StackOverflow it often has undergone some form of peer review. The LLM just outputs without any bias or footnote. reply DowsingSpoon 15 hours agoparentprevI am fairly certain that if someone did that where I work then security would be escorting them off the property within the hour.

It's insulting that companies are paying people to cosplay as programmers. reply ascorbic 11 hours agorootparentIt's probably more common among self-taught programmers (and I say that as one myself). Most go through the early stage of copying chunks of code and seeing if they work. Maybe not blindly copying it, but still copying code from examples or whatever.

That wasn't a luxury available in copy/paste-from-StackOverflow days (though explanations with varying degrees of depth were available there too). reply ascorbic 11 hours agorootparentYes, and I think the mistakes that LLMs commonly make are less problematic than Stack Overflow. LLMs seem to most often either hallucinate APIs, or use outdated ones. They're easier to detect when they just don't work.

I asked one of the \"AI\" assistants to do a very specific algorithmic problem for me and it did. And included unit tests which just so happened to hit all the exact edge cases that you would need to test for with the algorithm. The \"AI assistant\" very clearly regurgitated the code of somebody. I, however, couldn't find a particular example of that code no matter how hard I searched. It is extremely likely that the regurgitated code was not open source. Who is liable if I incorporate that code into my product? reply guappa 11 hours agorootparentAccording to microsoft: \"the user\". There's companies that scan code to see if it matches known open source code or not. However they probably just scan github so they won't even have a lot of the big projects. reply kybernetikos 11 hours agorootparentprevThis seems like you don't believe that AI can produce correct new work, but it absolutely can. I've no idea whether in this case it directly copied someone else's work, but I don't think that it writing good unit tests is evidence that it did - that's it doing what it was built to do. And you searching and failing to find a source is weak evidence that it did not. reply bigstrat2003 14 hours agorootparentprevTo be fair I don't think someone should get fired for that (unless it's a repeat offense). Kids are going to do stupid things, and it's up to the more experienced to coach them and help them to understand it's not acceptable.

There's a reason why college students are using LLMs, they're getting better grades for less effort. I don't assume you're proposing selecting students with worse grades on purpose? reply The_Colonel 10 hours agorootparentI wouldn't hire based on grades. I think what the junior did is a reason to fire them (then you can try again with better selection practices). Not because they use code from LLMs, but that they don't even try to understand what it is doing. This says a lot about their attitude to programming. reply LastTrain 5 hours agorootparentprevOne way to filter them out, relevant to this thread, would be to let them go if they brazenly turned in work they did not create and do not understand. reply DowsingSpoon 14 hours agorootparentprevI understand the point you’re trying to get across. For many kinds of mistakes, I agree it makes good sense to warn and correct the junior. Maybe that’s the case here. I’m willing to concede there’s room for debate. Can you imagine the fallout from this, though? Each and every line of code this junior has ever touched needs to be scrutinized to determine its provenance. The company now must assume the employee has been uploading confidential material to OpenAI too. This is an uncomfortable legal risk. How could you trust the dev again after the dust is settled? Also, it raises further concerns for me that this junior seems to be genuinely, honestly unaware that using ChatGPT to write code wouldn’t at least be frowned upon. That’s a frankly dangerous level of professional incompetence. (At least they didn’t try to hide it.) Well now I’m wondering what the correct way would be to handle a junior doing this with ChatGPT, and what the correct way would be to handle similar kinds of mistakes such as copy-pasting GPL code into the proprietary code base, copy-pasting code from Stack Overflow, sharing snippets of company code online, and so on. reply manmal 13 hours agorootparent> The company now must assume the employee has been uploading confidential material to OpenAI too.

The concern (imo) is that you should at least understand what the code is doing before you accept it verbatim and add it to your company's codebase. The potential it has to introduce bugs or security flaws is too great to just accept it without understanding it. reply dataviz1000 14 hours agorootparentI've been busy with a personal coding project. Working through problems with a LLM, which I haven't used professionally yet, has been great. Countless times in the past I've spent hours pouring over Stack Overflow and Github repository code looking for solutions. Quite often I would have to solve them myself and would always post the answer a day or two later below my question on Stack Overflow. A big milestone for a software engineer is getting to the point where any difficult problem can't be solved with internet search, asking colleagues, or asking the question no matter how well written and detailed on Stack Overflow because the problems are esoteric -- the edge of innovation is solitude. Today I give the input to the LLM, tell it what the output should be, and magically a minute later it is solved. I was thinking today about how long it has been since I was stuck and stressed on a problem. With this personal project, I'm prototyping and doing a lot of experimentation so having a LLM saves a ton of time keeping the momentum at a fast pace. The iteration process is a little different with frequent stop, refactor, cleanup, make the code consistent, and log the input and output to console to verify. Perhaps take intern's LLM code and have the LLM do the code review. Keep reviewing the code with the LLM until the intern gets it correct. reply nozzlegear 12 hours agorootparentMy experience with LLMs and code generation is usually the opposite, even using ChatGPT and the fancy o1 model. Maybe it's because I write a lot of F#, and the training data for that is probably low. When I'm not writing F#, then I like to write functional-style code. But either way, nine times out of ten I'm only using LLMs for \"rubber ducking,\" as the code they give me usually falls flat on its face with obvious compiler errors. I do agree that I feel much more productive with it LLMs though. Just being able to rubber duck my ideas with an AI and talk about code is extremely helpful, especially because I'm a solo dev/freelancer and don't usually have anyone else to do that with. And even though I don't typically use the code they give me, it's still helpful to see what the AI is thinking and explore that. reply dataviz1000 12 hours agorootparentI have had similar experiences using less popular libraries. My favorite state machine library released a new version a year ago and the LLMs, regardless of prompts telling them not to, will always use the old API. I find the LLMs are worthless when organizing ideas across multiple files. And, worst, they are not by their nature capable of consistency. On the other hand, I use d3.js for data visualization which has had a stable API for years, has likely hundreds of thousands of examples that are small contained in a single file, and has many blog posts, O'Reilly books, and tutorials. The LLMs create perfect data visualizations that are high quality. Any request to change one such as adding dynamic sliders or styling tooltips, for example, are done without errors or bugs. People who do data visualization likely will be the first to go. :( I am concerned that new libraries will not gain traction because the LLMs haven't been trained to implement them. We will be able to implement all the popular libraries, languages, and techniques quickly, however, innovation might stall if we rely on these machines stuck in the past. reply gunian 14 hours agorootparentprevExactly why devs are getting the bug bucks that is right now at some point what if someone figures out a way to make it deterministic and able to write code without bugs? reply eggnet 14 hours agorootparentThen the programming language becomes natural language and you’ll have to be very good at describing what you want.

Depending on what part of the product lifecycle you're on (proving a concept, rushing to market, scaling for the next million TPS, moving into new verticals,...) and where the team currently is, it makes a lot of sense to generate more of the codebase by AI. Write some decent tests, commit, move on. I wish my reports would use more AI tools for parts of our codebase that don't need a high bar of scrutiny, boilerplate at enterprise scale is a major source of friction and - tbh - burnout. reply not2b 16 hours agorootparentUnless the plan is to quickly produce a prototype that will be mostly thrown away, any code that gets into the product is going to generate far more work maintaining it over the lifetime of a product than the cost to code it in the first place. As a reviewer I'd push back, and say that I'll only be able to approve the review when the junior programmer can explain what it does and why it's correct. I wouldn't reject it solely because chatgpt made it, but if the checkin causes breakage it normally gets assigned back to the person who checked it in, and if that person has no clue we have a problem. reply solatic 4 hours agorootparentNot being willing to throw out bad/unused features is a different trap that organizations fall into. The amount of work that goes into, shall we say fortifying the foundations of a particular feature, ideally should be proportional to how much revenue that feature is responsible for. Test code also has to be maintained, and increasing the maintenance burden on something that has its own maintenance burden when customers don't even like it is shortsighted at the very least. reply KronisLV 11 hours agorootparentprev> I wouldn't reject it solely because chatgpt made it, but if the checkin causes breakage it normally gets assigned back to the person who checked it in, and if that person has no clue we have a problem. That's a fair point, but regardless of who wrote the code (or what tools were used) it should also probably be as clear as possible to everyone who reads it, because chances are that at some point that person will be elsewhere and some other person will have to take over. reply not2b 15 minutes agorootparentTrue, but you're talking about the difference between \"only one person understands this, that's a risk!\" and \"zero people understand this\". reply bradly 16 hours agorootparentprevYes and the team could be missing structures to support junior engineers.

It doesn't take complete blocking before there are significant implications. There are many aspects to consider, from more friction in getting access to distribution channels to the more fundamental \"forking\" of initiatives and visions.

Mostly for consumers. Advanced users in e.g. China (likely in Russia as well) use VPNs routinely already. > from more friction in getting access to distribution channels to the more fundamental \"forking\" of initiatives and visions What's in it for the devs/companies to fork just because of the geopolitical situation? A fork means more work, more costs. In some cases, like the Linux kernel, Russian companies (Baikal) are forced to fork, but I don't seem them doing this on a massive scale for projects where they don't have to. I think there is some parallel development going on in China, but that's more because of the language/cultural barrier and has always been so, so I don't expect a major change. reply dgfitz 19 hours agoprevIgnoring all the points made, this was a very pleasant reading experience.
