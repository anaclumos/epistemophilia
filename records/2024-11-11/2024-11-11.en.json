    "originBody": "IMG_0416 November 3, 2024 Between 2009 and 2012, Apple iPhones and iPod Touches included a feature called “Send to YouTube” that allowed users to upload videos directly to YouTube from the Photos app. The feature worked… really well. In fact, YouTube reported a 1700% increase in total video uploads during the first half of 2009- crediting that growth to its strong integrative ties to Apple and social networks. However, this two-click upload feature was short-lived when Apple severed ties with YouTube by removing its homegrown app in 2012. While Send to YouTube can be thoroughly analyzed as a milestone on the “frenemy” timeline between Apple and Google, I want to explore a pleasant consequence of this moment. Apple uses the ‘IMG_XXXX’ naming convention for all images and videos captured on iOS devices, where XXXX is a unique sequence number¹. The first image you take is named “IMG_0001”, the second is “IMG_0002” and so on. During the Send to YouTube era of 2009 and 2012, the title of one’s YouTube video was defaulted to this naming convention. Unwitting content creators would then upload their videos on a public site with a barely-searchable name. To this day, there are millions of these videos. Try searching for “IMG_XXXX” on YouTube, replacing “XXXX” with your favorite numbers (I used my birthday, 0416). See what you get! There’s something surreal about these videos that engages you in a way you’ve never felt. None were edited, produced, or paraded for mass viewing. In fact, many were likely uploaded by accident or with a misunderstanding that complete strangers could see it. YouTube automatically removes harmful or violent content, so what remains exists in a unique, almost paradoxical state: forbidden, yet harmless. Putting all this together, searching IMG_XXXX offers the most authentic social feed ever seen on the Internet- in video, no less! While many videos are redundant snippets of a concerts, basketball games, or kids’ recitals, you also get one-of-a-kind videos that provides a glimpse into a complete stranger’s life. You’ll see a tumultuous event that made them, their partner, or their friend say, “hey, let’s record this”. I’d like to show you three of these videos that I found in my search. IMG_0416 (Mar 17, 2015) - 23 views Permalink The video shows a woman excitedly unboxing a book she received in the mail. From context clues, she seems to be a wife and mother from Memphis who’s unboxing the first published copy of her book. She thanks the friends, family, and publishers who made this happen. After a quick Google Search, I was able to find the book: A Profit / Prophet to Her Husband: Are you ready to be a wife? The book is meant “to help wives understand who they are and who they were designed to be.” It clocks in at 94 pages and has 30 ratings on Amazon! Go IMG_0416! I don’t care what you’re creating- I’m just a fan of creators. It looks like she kept at it- making a second book in 2020! IMG_0416.MOV (June 24, 2015) - 26 views Permalink The video appears to show a woman playing a matching card game that teaches you “the basics of the potash stuff” according to the cameraman. As the woman (who I assume is the cameraman’s supportive mother) flips two matching cards, she reads off the countries who produce the most potash. I honestly didn’t know anything about potash! Turns out that it is a mineral with large amount of potassium, which is helpful as a plant fertilizer. With Canada producing the largest reserves in the world, the vast majority of Canadian potash is found in Saskatchewan. I wonder if this family lives in Canada. Or, if this is just another school project of useless facts… I miss those! IMG_0416 (Feb 8, 2011) - 114 views Permalink Let’s end on a fun one. The video shows a young man snorting powdered sugar and dealing with the consequences of it. Given his BU hoodie, Dunkin’ Donuts location, and ironic depiction of drug use, I gotta say this is a VERY Boston video. What’s genuinely heartwarming is the shared laughter between the man, the camerawoman, and the motherly figure leaving Dunkin’. The camerawoman calls her “Myra”, suggesting they all know each other. We have nothing better to do, so we’re snorting powdered sugar captures an essence of suburban America that I’m sure many of us can relate to. Edit: 11/3/24 IMG_0417 (Mar 14, 2014) - 16 views Permalink I found this after posting, and it’s just too amazing to not include… a woman filming her partner as he finds out she’s pregnant. Assuming all has gone well, the child is now almost 10 years old. I wonder if the family even knows this video still exists. After posting this on Hackernews, it looks like somebody commented on the video lol. I hope the family receives a notification about and is able to share this with their kid. ¹ Edit: The IMG_XXXX sequence isn’t truly unique—after 10,000 photos, the numbering restarts at IMG_0001 (Source).

If you select \"reject all\", the dialog instantly closes, I think with the legitimate interest cookies all in use - but I can't check, because I know of no way to get the dialog back up again, which is why I'm saying \"I think\".

I can't recommend one because I don't use this anymore. On Android this would mean using Firefox or another browser allowing extensions. Or you can give a YouTube address to MPV with the --no-video parameter. Or use NewPipe or one of its forks and open the YouTube kink with it in audio only mode. Or use invidious, but this last option is harder and harder to use.

Eventually, Apple got scared enough of being sued along with them that they caved in and removed the app, but that took far longer than I thought it would. There's a good article at https://torrentfreak.com/apple-removes-parasitic-streaming-a... reply wongarsu 17 hours agorootparentOn Android you can use NewPipe for a similar experience. For obvious reasons it's not on Google's Play Store, but you can get it from F-Droid or Github. reply mxmilkiib 17 hours agorootparentThe Tubular fork of NewPipe is worth noting, https://github.com/polymorphicshade/Tubular n a Revanced patched YT app would also work. reply l3x4ur1n 12 hours agorootparentprevI use Brave android.

NewPipe or its fork Tubular, Clipious, LibreTube, or host a local instance of Invidious or ViewTube and access them using the browser. F-Droid and the ability to still run software outside of Google's walled garden is the last remaining reason preventing me from switching to iPhone. I've tried Yattee on iOS and it's okay on Apple TV but seriously doesn't come close to the power of Tubular on Android. reply Elfener 21 hours agoparentprevFor those using firefox's autoplay blocker, http://astronaut.io/ doesn't work at all unless you whitelist it. reply mastazi 19 hours agorootparentIt works if you use the default autoplay blocker setting (\"block audio\"). Probably you are using the setting \"block audio and video\" as default (I use that too) and in our case we have to whitelist it. reply folmar 20 hours agorootparentprevWorks for me (current ESR on Linux). reply HPsquared 7 hours agoparentprevFeels like an Adam Curtis documentary. reply sharpshadow 12 hours agoparentprevI can imagine that it gets boring really quickly to skim through random untitled YouTube uploads. Maybe back then when YT did have a weak filter and initially waved through the videos there could have been something worth finding. Would be cool to see some statistics on how many videos over the years get removed with each new protection and censorship update. For example the latest medical disinformation campaign not only forces creators to avoid certain words completely, but also flagged and deleted pre-existing videos. It’s sad and dangerous that any topic could get forbidden and erased not allowed to keep a history. The Internet Archive is unfortunately a target now and efforts are being taken to undermine it partly. It’s already a thing to have records deleted from the archive which should be the most worse thing when your whole concept is to archive. I strongly suggest IA mirrors around the world in various countries with different legislations so that the censorship of each country is not reflected in the IA mirror of the other. reply MarioMan 10 hours agorootparent>It’s already a thing to have records deleted from the archive which should be the most worse thing when your whole concept is to archive. IA doesn't delete archives, they merely make them inaccessible.

I suppose the woman filming the video could have taken much longer to realize (unlikely, but possible), or chose to wait to tell the father until several months later (also unlikely, but possible), but either way, the kid is turning 10 now-ish, not 11. It's also possible that this video was posted well after it was taken, in which case we can't say much about the age of the kid, except that it likely happened before this \"Share to YouTube\" functionality was removed from iOS. reply theandrewbailey 17 hours agorootparentprevOnly if your culture measures age from conception instead of birth. reply meowster 19 hours agorootparentprevPresumably there are still about 9 months to go in that pregnancy before the child is born. reply dylan604 19 hours agorootparentprevthis is you why can't reuse calendars reply meowster 19 hours agorootparentI don't understand your comment.

That's a curious thing to say. reply averageRoyalty 18 hours agorootparentI guess as in 'dropped a beat'. The news was so surprising his heart stopped momentarily. reply pbhjpbhj 7 hours agorootparentIt's the opposite, usually. \"My heart dropped\" is a sense of doom, foreboding, a realisation of oncoming cataclysm. Like 'as I saw the second plane come into view my heart dropped'. Of course, people don't use language in a consistent way, and people will use terms thinking they mean e.g. their antonym. It's probably a common initial reaction to learning of impending parenthood. Life will never be the same.

It never gained the popularity of Periscope, likely at least partly due to its Nordic rather than Bay Area roots - but, oh boy, was it fun! At any time of the day you could go to the website and watch normal people around the globe doing random stuff. And chat with them!There weren't any real influencers at the time (at least not on the platform) and monetization wasn't possible, so people's motivations for live streaming stuff was not to make money but rather the joy of sharing a moment or just experiencing new cool technology. It got a bit less joyful when the Arabic Spring started and the platform got used by many in very dire situations but it remained incredibly interesting to follow.

They shall not contain two-byte characters or special codes. • The four characters that follow are a number between \"0001\" and \"9999\". \"0000\" shall not be used. These four digits are referred to as File number. • Files with the same file number stored in the same DCF directory are considered to be object component files as defined in 4.3.2.” reply agilob 11 hours agoparentIt's really cool that such standard exists, the worst thing about Pixel phones is stupid filenames of pictures and videos, not only it's not following this standard, but contains WRONG timestamp. For example, picture with name `PLX_20241101_115855.jpg` was taken at 12:58:55, not 11 as the name suggests, but also picture with name `PLX_20240913_191525.jpg` was taken at 19:15:25. A video on the other hand would have a timestamp offset -1, the offset changes depending on time of the year and it's different for pictures and videos. It's annoying af, because pictures and videos in the same folder will not be sorted chronologically by filename. reply rob74 9 hours agorootparentA lot of the DCF standard is designed around the limitations of FAT file systems, e.g. filenames limited to 8+3 characters, directories limited to 9999 \"items\" (which I assume is to make sure that there won't be more than 65,536 files in a directory). As Pixel phones don't use FAT, Google probably doesn't feel bound by this standard. Their naming convention allows the phones to store all photos/videos in a single directory. reply nasretdinov 11 hours agorootparentprevPotentially daylight savings related?

Why not use timestamp offset for this reply berkes 8 hours agorootparentWhile this comment is a joke, it's tragicomically true as well. Way too often have I encountered, or hacked in myself, such \"business rules\". \"Except for these seven transactions from before [random date/time] all transactions made between 01:00 and 01:15, with a round amount, are recurring payments to X. Can we not just use that instead of this data-migration that you've budgetted?\" (not literal request, but close enough). The danger -off course- lies in that this over time becomes actual business logic and that meaning is assigned to (meta)data that was never intended to carry such meaning. The solution -I've found- starts with what DDD calls \"ubiquitous language\", where everyone (within a domain!) assigns the same meaning to the same things¹. And model the software around that, never the other way. ¹ So maybe there's a 150 year old rule that states that recurring transactions are those that happen between ...etc. etc. That this is actually a settled and used meaning within the domain experts/users/stakeholders. In that case - IMO - it's far better to lean into it rather than assign some is_recurring_for_x boolean or such that has no meaning in the domain. reply jval43 9 hours agorootparentprevFWIW that is not a Pixel-specific issue. I encountered this on other cameras (IIRC Olympus and GoPro) as well. It's maddening. The issue stems from the fact that images are written with proper EXIF time and timezone metadata while videos from the same camera might only store a timestamp field.

I didn't know this feature existed back in the days, and you just cannot ignore the haptic feedback feeling when you watch original, unedited content from random people who were filming not for the sake of publishing to the mass but just for themselves and friends/family to keep these records as memories. This reminds me of the pre-smartphone era where people used to own handheld, personal cameras to capture special moments of their lives as souvenirs. Also, regarding these \"IMG_XXX\" videos, one notable pattern is that they all have very low number views, for an obvious reason. The odd one to this pattern is this pregnancy video, which had the number of views jumped from 16 in ten years to to 1,650 in 10 hours.

I miss the early days of the internet (and especially YouTube) so fucking much. I'm 28 now, and I've been online since 2009. I think 2009-2014 was the GOLDEN AGE of the internet for me, especially on YouTube. reply com2kid 15 hours agorootparentI've been on the Internet since 1995. I remember the first banner ad! Wikipedia didn't exist. It was possible to run out of websites to visit. People were, in general, super friendly, aside from the trolls on AIM trying to crash other people's clients. (IRC was a separate place though, I mostly spent time on websites.) Forums had horrible UIs, the latency was awful. Compared to dial up BBSs that came before the user experience was much worse. Everything was authentic. People just doing stuff, posting about what they loved. Uploading art they made and photos they took. The barrier to entry was high (you needed to own a scanner and be able to figure out how to set it up!), but not so high that determined non-technical users couldn't muddle through and still make great things. reply usefulcat 3 hours agorootparentSame. For me, usenet was \"social media\", long before social media was a thing. I remember in college hanging out in a newsgroup for people looking for a pen pal, and later exchanging letters with someone on the other side of the country whom I never met in person. Pretty crude by today's standards, but also a lot more genuine and less risky.

For me, the period from 1999 to 2010 was the \"golden age\" of the Internet. It was a time of exploration, creativity, and genuine connection.

But even up until 2016 it was generally tolerable. There was a point in time when every single social media changed from \"you and your friends\" to \"you and the world\". Which opened the hellscape of influencer and branding world. I'm not sure what exactly accelerated it - Facebook/IG going algo-view first, TikTok starting to get traction even when it was just a dancing app, or the entire A/B science. Oh well... reply Eisenstein 10 hours agorootparentWhat happened right around 2016 was a combination of the internet being weaponized in the political space and the destruction of of revenue for legacy media because of Facebook and Google and other walled systems which ingested their IP and served it to their users. This effectively made people paranoid of data that didn't immediately fit into their world view because the concept of any shared truth was shattered and at the same time it felt like everything and everyone on the internet was targeted to misinform you. The 'mainstream media' was never taken seriously by people savvy in the early tech spaces, so the loss of it didn't really hit us as particularly impactful. But that loss made it so that the 'mainstream' no longer had any 'ground truth' they could all fall back on that would be the arbiter of correct and incorrect information, and so truth became whatever felt most right to a person at the time. This of course has more to do with the people and culture you most identify with, rather than any kind of objective comparison of data, so groups looked more inwards and became ossified in dogma and refused to look at any other perspective in good faith.

Having followers is the best way to get followers, which creates a fame snowball. The result is that a few uploads get a bunch of attention, and most uploads get very little attention. The typical user feels lonely, isolated, neglected. Jealously means the attention-rich users, the ones with lots of followers, become targets for bullies -- and that leaves them miserable too. No one is happy. Platforms with a more equal distribution of attention, such as IRC, didn't have these problems.

There is no pretense of promotion to a large audience or virality. Anything spoonfed you on a Tiktok or Instagram feed could not be more different. The default Youtube experience is the same as mass Tiktok.

Somehow the web has been running backwards for years now. We lost flash in favor of HTML 5, which sort of fizzled out in terms of creative people actually doing a lot with it. We used to have simple application builders in IDEs like Visual Basic, Delphi, Borland JBuilder. Even Eclipse had a simple swing UI builder thing for a while. For the web we had dream weaver, frontpage, etc. I'm not saying those tools were perfect; because they weren't. But we never really got good substitutes for them. We now have people \"designing\" stuff in Figma and then handing over for implementation to some developer team that essentially then recreates the whole thing pretty much from scratch. There's something deeply stupid/wasteful about needing to do that. reply SebastianKra 2 hours agoparentI don't think visual UI builders were ever the way forward. These work well for static UIs, but once you try to express dynamic constraints, they fall apart. Figma shows this: I find it useful to absolutely position elements (and maybe work with symbols) for a quick prototype, but once I bring in autolayout, I end up dealing with exactly the same issues as with CSS-flexbox and grids - except in a vastly inferior system, where I don't have version control, refactoring tools and chatGPT. Also, subjectively, I find it much easier to work directly with XML-structure, than to double-click (or cmd-click) through 15 groups in order to select a specific component, and then modify its properties in a textual form. I'm guessing that's why Apple and Android deprecated their interface builders in favor of DSLs. reply robertlagrant 4 hours agoparentprev> We now have people \"designing\" stuff in Figma and then handing over for implementation to some developer team that essentially then recreates the whole thing pretty much from scratch. There's something deeply stupid/wasteful about needing to do that. I'm not sure how wasteful it is really. There is some overlap, but not loads in my experience. Most of the time spent on frontend is the stuff behind the components: behaviour; device interaction; security; API calls. reply sebazzz 27 minutes agorootparentThere is quite some overlap, but the CSS generated by Figma is not really useful and of a grade I’d want in my application. On the other hand, there is a gradient where building in all the behaviour you could want in a designer application, makes the application so complex that it become unusable for designers. reply ben_w 4 hours agorootparentprevI've had a weirdly large fraction of my career spent on making UI rather than business logic. That said, the business logic in apps is, half the time, a needlessly complex shim on what is ultimately \"here's a REST API you can do in one or two lines via `Codable` etc. except we're anticipating needing to support several API providers… oh no the money ran out\". reply ryandrake 2 hours agorootparent> I've had a weirdly large fraction of my career spent on making UI rather than business logic. Same here. None of my employers could go more than 2 years or so, before the head of UX would declare \"Our app is no longer 'fresh' enough, and our competitors are adding 'pop' and 'zing' to their apps! We must stop what we are doing and totally redesign our app, create custom controls, and flex our brand onto the user!\" Too much of my career has been turning a designer's Photoshop graphic pixel-for-pixel into an application, without regard to the OS's standard controls or conventions. reply TeMPOraL 1 hour agorootparentYup, which is where I suspect most of the \"visual UI builders are not the right tools to express dynamic constraints\" objections come from: people are over-constraining the problem space with irrelevant nonsense. Half of the problems stem from abandoning OS standard controls, many of the rest are managing complexity of a large and complex UI codebase that didn't need to exist in the first place. It's not like most webapp UIs are particularly well-aligned or consistent anyway, nor they are easy to visually overhaul on marketing teams' whim - so, what's the point? Why use tools that make important and impactful things between difficult and impossible? (A possibly legitimate argument against RAD tools is that they encourage mixing business logic with UI code (static and dynamic). I used to be receptive to that, but I long come into conclusion that \"separation of content and presentation\" is bullshit both conceptually and in practice. And guess what, with React & all, we're all back to mixing UI and business logic - or adding extra layers of complexity to pretend we're not.) reply itslennysfault 4 hours agoparentprev> I'm not saying those tools were perfect Bite your tongue.

I think most framework developers unfortunately forget productivity as a key metric. Might be a bit unfair however, the lack of visual tools is disappointing. reply qwertox 6 hours agorootparentThe issue today is that developers would create their own framework, most likely something TypeScript-based running in Node or Deno or some Rust-based thing like Tauri, which all might be OK, but with their own opinionated UI styleguides and features, where then half of the native OS functionality then won't work. You see a somewhat related degeneration in Redmond, where the new Windows Explorer doesn't have an icon in the address bar which is actually draggable so that a shortcut to the currently open folder can be created on the desktop or anywhere where such a shortcut can be used (think TrueLaunchBar). Now you have to go to the parent folder in order to Alt-Drag the folder to create a shortcut. It's those little things which where smartly developed during the 80s and 90s, which \"modern\" developers seem not to have noticed and therefore just ignored while re-implementing applications like the Windows Explorer. reply ryandrake 2 hours agorootparentThere are so many Chesterson's Fences[1] being destroyed with modern UX design. Everyone just wants to change things for change's sake. Or worse, to simply have another piece of unique artwork for one's portfolio. Whenever I've tried to push back on Yet Another Big UI Design, the reasons for doing it are always so vague: Our current product looks \"dated.\" It's not \"fresh.\" Competitors' products look \"sleeker.\" We're using \"outdated\" design language.

I was installing PC based CCTV systems for a living back in mid 2000s, I had a restaurant customer have their mind blown by pandoras music service while demoing the PC. They asked \"can I hear this over the restaurant speakers?\". Yeah, I got 3.5mm to RCA to BNC in the car which I can run to your AMP. Now he was really happy, felt like he got launched into the 21st century. \"Can I pause the music and make an announcement to my customers?\". I made him a shortcut on the desktop to sndvol32.exe aka sound mixer so he can talk over the speakers and then resume the music and he was again floored. \"I want my staff to be able to do this but not here in my office but at the front counter\". Easy. \"Give me a paper clip and 30 minutes\". Went to the car to grab some stranded Cat 5 and an old beige two button IBM mouse. Ran the cables from the office to the reception area, soldered a cat-5 pair to the left mouse clicker, drove a sheetrock screw threw the mouse body to mount it on the wall like a taxidermied deer head. Back in the office I soldered the leads to the paper clip so I could have a solid connection to the LPT port on the PC (I didn't carry DB-25 back then). It was easy from there: googled \"VB6 Volume Mixer\". Download that, open the checkbox for mute stereo mix, copy one liner into a timer, set interval for 100ms, check if the pins on the LPT are shorted, if so mute stereo mix, unmute the mic.

My first job at 18 was working for one of the large ActiveX component libraries, providing technical support to many developers when I wasn't one myself yet! On my first day, I found a book on my desk—\"Learn Visual Basic 3 in 21 Days\"—along with a brand new 486DX250 and a 14\" monitor. I learned a lot quickly! We answered support queries by fax back then. I never fully understood why this programming paradigm died off. Building business apps beyond Access or Excel was so straightforward. It was great to get an .EXE that you could package up with InstallShield or Wise Solutions and send to anyone. I guess the web came soon after, and trying to do WYSIWYG for HTML and CSS has never gone well—even today. FrontPage came out but died soon after, and mixing desktop apps with web apps was never great. Today, I feel .NET is overly complex and much harder for beginners compared to the old days. Sometimes, I think there are only so many ways to control the appearance of business apps. I'd constrain visuals but provide the most straightforward visual builder possible. The No-Code world is fascinating, and the best I've seen in this space is https://retool.com/, but it's expensive and locks you into their ecosystem. Even today, small businesses need to build out simple apps that were simple to do back in the Visual Basic days—a stock control system, a basic support system, sales tools, etc. Today, it's a minefield of options that can quickly get expensive. I'd love to have a visual builder that creates code you can host yourself — something like retool.com but with open source and self-hosting, or maybe I'm just too old for this now! :) reply rty32 6 hours agoparent> I never fully understood why this programming paradigm died off My two cents -- A few reasons (briefly, I could have talked a lot more) * Shift in platform: Windows is no longer the sole platform people want to build their apps for. Not a bad strategy by itself, and lots of companies still only develop for Windows (e.g. specialized software for instrument control etc), but people increasingly want their stuff to work on iPad, Chromebook etc and maybe even phones * Shift in screen size: It used to be that everyone runs Windows on a 800x600 screen. That changed, and then changed quickly. Many different resolutions and screen sizes. The drag and drop thing just doesn't work well for that. The web model, where you write \"responsive CSS\" and the browser handles the rest for you, works better. * Software and their UI got a lot more complex and require more expertise. On the other hand commercial software becomes easily available and accessible for those purposes. For the examples you mentioned -- stock control system, sales tool, they may be fine with VB6 for a prototype but can quickly get complex. And there is likely a commercial software you can buy and download within a few minutes at an affordable price. * Shift to online/cloud: vast majority of \"small VB6 applications\" were used locally, and they never connect to the Internet. That's different now. * Shift in language: BASIC/VB was often used for teaching, and it is indeed great as a first language to learn. Although Python already existed at that time, it became very popular, and I think many people would agree Python is a much better language than BASIC, in many ways. As a result, BASIC along with VB went out of fashion. reply werdnapk 5 hours agorootparentI've always found the use of anchors on UI controls to be light years ahead of what HTML/CSS have been doing. I always used to create UI forms with resizing and different screen sizes in mind. If you were coding for a hard coded 800x600 screen then that was just laziness. reply alxlaz 4 hours agorootparentprev> Shift in screen size: It used to be that everyone runs Windows on a 800x600 screen.

The web model, where you write \"responsive CSS\" and the browser handles the rest for you, works better. This... really doesn't match my experience at all. I may be thinking of later UI development tools from the .NET era (I no longer recall if VB6 had proper support for linear layouts and the like, that was forever ago) but GUI builders with responsive controls were absolutely a thing, and they ran circles around any \"responsive\" CSS we have today, if only because they had instant feedback. I don't miss most aspects of programming from that age, but this is one that I do miss tremendously. Edit: I certainly agree on the other points. I think this one was less of a technical limitation and more due to the humans in the loop; lots of people just didn't know better, information dissemination was far more limited (lots of us learned these things offline, from books and the like), and the platform didn't force you to do the right thing, either. reply stavros 6 hours agorootparentprevI think you left off the biggest reasons, commercial: * No piracy. Can't crack code you aren't running. * Immediate installs/updates. No need to tell people to ever update stuff, or to install your program in the first place. * You can charge subscriptions. It's much easier to justify a subscription when you pay for server costs, even though the customer would be happier just running your application locally. * Easier deployment. You can handle complex integrations on the server, without the customer having to open ports or whatever. reply rty32 5 hours agorootparentGood points. I was more focused on the technical side. I want to add a bit more to \"easier deployment\" -- traditional model is that you push updates at some interval (regular interval like semi annually/annually or non regular intervals), and you need to manage multiple versions and potentially patch multiple versions for severe bugs or security issues. Lots of software still works that way. But with office 365, jira etc you only have one version to worry about.

In the B2C space sometimes sure. We do business with many companies all over the world and if you can see the 100s of 1000s of apps they are using; you could've done all of them with Delphi/VB without any tricks.

So I checked the Linkedin / github's of these freelancers and had a short call with them if they could help (no, they had no time; new clients!); they were Django/Bootstrap guys before, but that sells less well than Nextjs/shadcn/tailwind, so they switched recently. What a joke. Why is this not liable really... But again, we make very good money, so please carry on! reply TeMPOraL 4 hours agorootparentprevI'd add another reason: * Idiot developers like myself. Okay, I was a teenager back when I got infected by this idea, but it did persist for some time into my start of my career too - the idea that RAD tools are inferior, they are not \"true programming\", just some lazy no-code clicking to save monkeys from understanding the program they're building as a whole, etc. I mean, sure, you could do a lot in RAD tools really quickly, and do it well - but that was cheating. Too good results for too small an effort. It wouldn't impress any of your IRC friends. (Curiously, those few I know from my \"generation\" who wrote software for e.g. their parents' business, would happily use VBA or Delphi. Wonder why...) This was all adjacent to and connected to other ideas that became influential with our cohort of developers, like \"Windows suxx, Linux rulez\", \"plaintext is best\", \"CLI is best\", \"code generation is evil\", etc. Those ideas are still deeply rooted in FLOSS, too. VBA - was not C-like, you couldn't exactly put the whole project in SVN and diff nicely, it's tied to a specific platform (that sucked), a specific vendor (at a time when we all hated the evil M$ because it was the Right Thing to Do), and to a specific software suite (which was not vim).

There was a certain level of pride in making Mac apps look very much like Mac apps. Very rarely did developers target both Windows and Mac. My take is: A lot of developers didn't feel like cluing components together in Visual Basic 6 or later Visual Studio, dragging and dropping UI elements, was \"real development\". VB-developers where looked down on as second rate programmers. If you used VB.NET and WinForms/WebForms who where not a real developer. You had to use C# and XAML, which was absolutely terrible, but \"real programming\". Same with Delphi, not something you built \"real\" applications in, no you use Java if you're a real developer. Shit like that was all to common, and yet WinForms are still around and working, but XAML is dead (Edit: Apparently it's not dead). reply troupo 5 hours agorootparentprevIt's a bit ironic how in the same breath you go from \"it's impossible to build apps for multiple resolutions with drag'n'drop hence web\" to \"software and their UI has become more complex\". While the absolute vast majority of web-based software cannot hold a candle to UIs you could trivially build in VB (or Delphi and other RADs). Most web-based software is either trivial forms or a few screens of text and images they struggle to display with any acceptable performance. As for \"many different resolutions and screens\", have you ever, I don't know, resized a desktop window? Desktop apps work at the number of crazy sizes the web would die at. reply specialist 4 hours agorootparentprevYes and: > Shift to online/cloud ... they never connect to the Internet. The fall of VB6 style RAD (for CRUD) started earlier with shift from \"workgroups\" (shared files on LANs) to client/server. This severed the direct link (ADO api) between apps and their persistence. Tragically, the ODBC (then JDBC) API interface didn't quite fully bridge the gap. Meaning some necessary metadata was no longer front and center (for both compile and runtime, like ADO had always had). Yielding mitigation attempts like DAO/DTO, ActiveRecord, ORMs, LINQ, templates, etc. That sad state of affairs is described in Ted Neward's famous \"ORMs are the Vietnam of computer science\" essay. https://web.archive.org/web/20060813030731/http://blogs.tedn... Of course, client/server had to happen. But the innovators (and critics like Neward) didn't fully understood what they were replacing, what parts were missing. (Lather, rinse, repeat.) -- It took noob me a LONG time to figure this out. (All I ever wanted was to recover the special magick of VBA + ADO.) And then even longer to attempt mitigation (cuz am noob).

A RAD tool like Visual Basic, Borland C++ Builder, Borland Delhi, QT Designer doesn't mean no code. Rapid application design helps the developer quickly build the UI using already made components and using some predefined behaviors like gluing a database table to an UI component.

I often see similar statements like that but that's not what I experienced. I did IBM DOS BASIC, MS GWBASIC and worked on VB3 to VB6 at a corporate jobs. The C#/NET workflow feels much the same rapid-development simplicity as classic VB6: Drag some GUI components like text boxes and buttons onto a form, code the controls' event handlers, build the exe. In contrast, the examples of GUI dev kits that had more complex language syntax and build steps than VB6 were original Apple iOS Objective-C, C++ Qt, Java AWT. Sure, C# is a bigger language than Visual Basic in VB6 but C# also does a lot more. E.g. in VB6, it didn't even have a built-in way to check the existence of a file. Instead, you had to declare a \"win32\" API monstrosity such as : VB6: Private Declare Function OpenFile Lib \"kernel32\" ByVal lpFileName As String, lpReOpenBuff As OFSTRUCT, ByVal wStyle As Long) As Long Function FileExists(FileName As String) As Integer Dim RetCode As Integer Dim OpenFileStructure As OFSTRUCT Const OF_EXIST = &H4000 Const FILE_NOT_FOUND = 2 RetCode = OpenFile(FileName$, OpenFileStructure, OF_EXIST) FileExists = (not OpenFileStructure.nErrCode = FILE_NOT_FOUND) C#: File.Exists() In many ways, VB6 being \"simple\" means it created a ton of extra complexity for the programmer to do basic tasks. Another example is that VB6 didn't include a datagrid. You had to buy 3rd-party VBX/OCX controls for that. C# WinForms includes a datagrid. EDIT reply to: >most definitely open files in VB, and therefore the \"File.Exists()\" function would at worse be comprised of a exception handler (on error ...) and a open call, From my memory the \"pure\" VB6 way checking existence of a file by opening a file with error handler had issues (other processes using exclusive access and/or other issues) causing false-negatives or false-positives. Therefore, the recommended way back in 1990s was the win32 api declaration using OF_EXIST flag. It looks convoluted but it was more reliable. reply AshamedCaptain 6 hours agorootparentYou chose a very poor example, since you can most definitely open files in VB, and therefore the \"File.Exists()\" function would at worse be comprised of a exception handler (on error ...) and a open call, as in many other languages. No need to import OpenFile for sure. reply coliveira 4 hours agorootparentI believe some people used that monster version because VB had simple libraries that didn't allow many options. Anything more complex required you to go down the Win32 rabbit hole. And that was the main weakness of VB, it was such a simple language that you didn't have many options to do something more complex than going straight to Win32. reply AshamedCaptain 3 hours agorootparentIt is a very different thing to claim \"the language doesn't allow simple things such as checking for a file's existence\" (which is false, the language allows many ways to do so) than to claim \"the language doesn't have many options, but allows you to interop with the entire win32 API if you need to\". The first is a valid if only false complain; the second reads to me not as a complain, but as a feature. reply jasode 2 hours agorootparent>to claim \"the language doesn't allow simple things such as checking for a file's existence\" (which is false, That's not what I wrote. I said there's no _built-in_ way to check existence of the file. A reasonable interpretation of \"built-in\" is for an obvious named function such as \"File.exists()\" _without_ cobbling together extra workarounds and hacks -- whether those workarounds include re-purposing other VB built-in functions with On Error ... or using Win32 interop. > in VB, [...] would at worse be comprised of a exception handler (on error ...) That's an example of what I meant of not being built-in to VB. I should have been more clear. We were using different meanings of \"builtin\". In any case, the following \"pure\" VB code to check for file existence is not found on Google or Bing search but I still have it from my 1995 archives and copied it here. It has many lines of code (instead of a simple \"one-liner\") because it tries to cover all the edge cases. And yet with all that defensive code, there's still a hidden timebomb of a bug in it. Can anyone spot it? The code is unmodified from Visual Basic Programmer's Journal. In contrast, the alternative using Win32 interop with OF_EXISTS doesn't have the bug. Dim strTestFilename As String strFilename = Trim(strFilename) ' To avoid problem with known bug, don't pass root directory to ' the Name function Select Case Right$(strFilename, 1) Case \"\\\": strExistsFilename = \"Root\": Exit Function Case \"\\.\": strExistsFilename = \"Root\": Exit Function Case \"\\..\": strExistsFilename = \"Root\": Exit Function End Select On Local Error Resume Next ' Enable error trapping for Name function Name strFilename As strFilename ' A trick to see if filename/path is good ' Now check the resulting err code of the Name function Select Case Err Case 5 ' Illegal function call Case 53 ' File not found Case 58 ' File exists (maybe) strTestFilename = Dir$(strFilename) If Len(strTestFilename) Then strExistsFilename = \"\" ' It's a file Exit Function Else strExistsFilename = \"Dir\" ' It's a directory Exit Function End If Case 64 ' Bad filename Case 68 ' Device unavailable Case 71 ' Disk not ready Case 75 ' Access denied Case 76 ' Path not found End Select My point was that C# builtin File.Exists() is a lot simpler than that. reply AshamedCaptain 2 hours agorootparentSo, what is so wrong about simply calling FileLen() to check if the file exists, or if you also want to distinguish between Files/Directories using GetAttr to check the directory bit ? Why do you have to go all the way to this monster of code which even hardcodes lists of errors (why do you care which error it is?) ? Your code sample renames the file, then globs anyway (when dir$ by itself can also be used to check existence). It looks too convoluted, and I cannot imagine why it needs to be so. What is exactly the corner case that you want to avoid -- and if such case really exists, why are you so sure the File.Exists() implementation would not fall into the same pit trap, considering it also simply uses the metadata? Disclaimer: I'm only familiar with VBA, not VB itself. But these file metadata functions definitely already exist in 95's VB5. (EDIT: Actually 97's. Maybe the problem is these functions did not exist in earlier VBs? But I would find it hard to imagine you could not check a file's size). The sample code smells even in the trivial-case checks. E.g. Right$(_, 1) will only return a 1-char string at most, yet it tries to compare it with 2, 3 len strings. I didn't check any further than that. reply Brian_K_White 5 hours agorootparentprevBut then you may have actually opened the file. reply AshamedCaptain 5 hours agorootparentBut if you rely on these subtleties this is hardly a \"basic feature\" that the language is lacking. In fact, I imagine File.Exists()/OF_EXISTS also opens the file (then immediately closes it). reply Brian_K_White 4 hours agorootparentIt better not! If you actually open a file, you update it's access time, and you interfere with the process that should actually open the file. Those both break perfectly simple business logic. reply AshamedCaptain 3 hours agorootparentThe documentation for OF_EXISTS literally says it will open then close it. I leave to your imagination whether this updates the (very poorly defined) access time or not, but for sure you \"interfere\" with other processes... If you want to get the access time, why don't you just query the access time? Which is likely the only thing almost universally guaranteed not to change it... And I'm sure VB6 has an API for that, considering that VBA had a global API for it (FileDateTime). (Which is, btw, yet another way to one-line check if a file exists). reply Brian_K_White 3 hours agorootparentDid you confuse the file with it's containing directory?

Gotcha! reply Brian_K_White 1 minute agorootparentWhat gotcha? I never said, either explicitly nor implicitly, that File.Exists() modifies access time. There is nothing there in that comment nor it's parent. You have said a continuos string of incorrect things and employed invalid logic this whole time, and this yet again fits. ahoka 5 hours agorootparentprevBut then the only way to make sure that you can open a file is to actually open it. reply Brian_K_White 4 hours agorootparentYou don't use exists and then open a file. If you actually want to open a file, you open it or fail. You don't check if it's ok and then do it, you do it and then check if it failed. exists followed by open is a pointless exists because anything can happen in between. Conversely, if you are neither the producer nor consumer of the file at this time, you don't want to actually open it just as a way to stat it, because actually opening it updates it's access time and interferes with the actual consumer(s). Even read-only non-exclusive. reply personalityson 5 hours agorootparentprevPublic Function Fso() As Object Static s_oFso As Object If s_oFso Is Nothing Then Set s_oFso = CreateObject(\"Scripting.FileSystemObject\") End If Set Fso = s_oFso End Function Fso.FileExists(\"path\") reply jasode 4 hours agorootparent>CreateObject(\"Scripting.FileSystemObject\") That's not included by default in Windows 95.

Yes, I know there were also different versions for different runtimes, but overall it was a couple of DLLs and fine. Since .net you really need to install the distributable by MS, and every new .net upgrade it's the same. Just 2 days ago I apparently needed the .net 8 runtime and even after installing it the app in question didn't work (without a reboot maybe, I will find out later today). Overall, strictly as a consumer, C# and .net apps have been mostly great, except the practice (is it a best practice?) that some of them end up somewhere in my home dir's Local dir and not in c:\\program files. reply Brian_K_White 3 hours agorootparentprevThe sub thread this created of people not recognizing this as a problem is pretty interesting. It's probably one of many ingredients that went into how so many of these apps are so half baked and buggy. Not just the obvious that the language was aimed at and used by junior programmers and so of course much of the code is not robust in general. But here is an example of the toolbox missing a tool. You can't really fault people for doing whatever seems natural using the tools they are given. Not being experienced developers otherwise, they didn't know that something necessessary was missing, and made things that only mostly worked without it. To be clear they would have often mis-used the tool if it existed too. In this thread people have thought the way you would use exists is to check before doing some actual operation. The inexperienced coder aspect is also true, seperately. But the combination of a missing tool combined with a language explicitly aimed at users who don't come with their own experience and don't know anything but what the language provides, seems a little extra nasty. reply AshamedCaptain 2 hours agorootparentAre you literally calling every commenter of this subthread an inexperienced developer? Seriously? First, the subthread starts by claiming you cannot check for the existence of a file, which is simply false. You can try to open it, you can try to read metadata from it, you can glob it, etc. all of it using language builtins. But then you claim that you need to check for a file's existence without actually opening it. If anything, as we people are constantly pointing to you, any code which does it is a code smell at the very least, and very likely wrong. There's a reason TOCTOU is a thing, and why these exist/access APIs usually have huge disclaimers right in the documentation. But let's entertain the idea. Maybe you really have a crappy IPC handshaking mechanism implemented with temporary files (sorry!). Maybe you want to avoid side-effects of trying to open file (virus scan overhead? network traffic?) . It cannot be that you want to preserve the atime, because that would also be a code smell, seing how undefined the atime is on win32. On win9x, for example, reading metadata updates atime - likely the AV scan, but nonetheless; also, the granularity is only 1 day (welcome to FAT). The WA offered by GP actually very likely opens the file anyway, so clearly he didn't have this requirement. But anyway, this scenario is no longer a \"simple\" feature whatsoever, and therefore the original complain loses all weight. And to top it all, you _still_ can check the existence of a file w/o opening it by just trying to read the metadata, using any of the myriad functions at your disposal, in around two lines of code; no need to interop with Win32 at all. In fact, (trying to) get the file's metadata is exactly how .NET's File.Exist does it. If you find yourself in a situation where everyone thinks you are trying to do a senseless thing, it is more likely you are, rather than everyone else being junior and inexperienced. reply Brian_K_White 2 hours agorootparentI am calling inexperienced developers inexperienced. Are you literally suggesting that there are no inexperienced developers? I am also saying that this thread is interesting and that inexperienced developers don't see the problem. \"very likely opens the file anyway\" is not an argument. \"code smell\" and \"very likely wrong\" are not arguments. The reasons you need to stat a file without opening it, or do any other low level operation, are open ended and infinite. It's backwards to try to think up some specific invalid contrived example use case, and then say how you didn't need to do that specific thing that specific way, and so therefor you never needed that facility. These are all quite bad reasoning and \"inexperienced developer smell\". If you are experienced and still reasoning like this, that's unfortunate. reply nurettin 4 hours agorootparentprevThis is the worst example you could give.

I think it's better in 2024, but as someone who lived through the browser war years as a frontend developer.. We may shit on Windows a lot, but learning the windows bits you need to write software in VB were ridiculously less complex than writing a backend AND a frontend for a webapp circa 1999-2005. Just because of all the tiny undocumented differences to make stuff look ok-ish or even quite the same. VB's layouting stuff was very good in my memory. reply scarface_74 6 hours agoparentprevBecause for the most part, you don’t need desktop applications in 2024. They are harder to maintain when used across multiple computers and you can’t access them from anywhere like web apps. And most companies that need to build the things you mentioned can use a SaaS. Also, those “simple apps” end up being an unmaintainable mess after a couple of years. In 2024, to a first approximation, no company should be writing software that is not core to their business. Most problems are not special snowflakes. Someone has already solved their problem and created a customizable SaaS around it. Yes I’m old enough to have used VB6 professionally from 2001-2008 (when it was way past its prime). But my first programming was on an Apple //e in BASIC and assembly and programming professionally in C and C++ from 1996-2008 reply woodylondon 6 hours agorootparentIn some context, I think desktop apps are far better than the web, and it's now super simple to roll out desktop apps using tools like Intune. However, I'm talking about general business apps here. The likes of Zoho, Salesforce, and, to some extent, Dynamics are covering some of this space—but again, they're expensive. The main point of my post was that if I were 18 today and starting my first job, it'd be much harder to acquire the skills needed to grow. With VB or Delphi and a book, you could become pretty productive within a year or so, and the cost of entry was very low. The skills you learned opened the door to a whole new world for little cost. Especially, as others have mentioned, finding \"DVDs lying around\" :) which, of course, doesn't work for web tools in 2024! I was lucky my company provided, but i know friends who learned from the other approach. These web based NoCode companies should provide people starting out with free, fully functional accounts—but then restrict live users to about 5. Atlassian/JIRA was always good at this with their $10 entry point. While it's not a programming tool, this approach is why it's found everywhere. It allowed someone wanting to experiment and learn to pay just $10 for access to the complete platform. You might say there is plenty of open source out there, and this is correct, but again, in companies, this is not always used. They want the known companies. What the generation do have today which we never did is access to high quality training beyond books - and now AI! Wish I was 18 again! reply scarface_74 5 hours agorootparentHow do I roll out that Windows software on Macs? On mobile? And all computer management software especially on Windows ends up being corporate installed malware. Besides, if you think that installing desktop software is ever easy - especially if something goes wrong - take a look at what happened with CrowdStrike. As far as learning how to code, everyone has a web browser and can download VSCode or even Visual Studio for free. All languages are free and you can download free versions of every popular database for hobby level work. Heck these days you can stay in the free tier of AWS forever if you stay serverless. And software developers aren’t expensive as is maintaining software? I was hired as a lead developer back in 2016 by a then new director. He had four mid level developers working there. After he interviewed me, he asked two of the developers to interview me while he was in the room. They said they wanted to do address validation and they were trying to think through all of the corner cases - this was a real world issue not a coding challenge. They asked me did I have any suggestions. I said sure, there are third party CASS solutions that are USPS approved and they shouldn’t be building that in house. I was initially hired to modernize their homegrown Electronic Medical Records system built on PowerBuilder in 1999 using Sql server 2001 (this was 2016). It had been maintained by two other “developers” who had been at the company for 10 and 20 years respectively. I walked him through my proposed strategy if I were hired. It didn’t take long to realize that this company had no business writing software. They were a low margin company that sent nurses to homes of special needs kids and made most of their money from Medicaid reimbursements. I started leading the effort to do data migrations and being part of negotiations with SaaS companies as the company I worked for started buying up other companies in their vertical. The company ended up laying off the developers who interviewed me and turning the other two into report writers and doing data analytics. A year and half later, I had a frank discussion with the director. I told him we both know you don’t need me. I found another job three weeks later. I literally “put myself out of a job” reply ransom1538 5 hours agoparentprevVisual basic was the best way to build business apps ever. We just got these features in visual studio.

I will let people get back to their js frameworks. reply coliveira 4 hours agorootparentYou're completely right, however the market for business desktop apps is over; not just because of the web, which is still inferior to VB in many respects, but because companies restrictions of what can be installed in a corporate desktop. It is much easier to use a web service than having permission to install a desktop app in a corporate computer. The huge Windows vulnerabilities destroyed the desktop as a viable business software platform. reply carlosjobim 5 hours agoparentprevSmall businesses don't want to pay for simple apps. They want to pay a percentage of their sales to a large middle man who takes care of sales. It's too much for them to pay a few thousand (or hundred) dollars for a bespoke solution, but they have no problem paying tens of thousands per year to a middle man. There's a reason small businesses remain small. reply hobs 5 hours agorootparentAlmost none of those reasons are managing what are generally trivial costs for a growing business. Small businesses remain small because they: cant scale, have a small tam, require direct labor from the founder to get the job done, the market is fairly well established but the founder has some special skills which are difficult to impart, especially in the context of the business. Market conditions, the ability to get capital, and a lot of luck have way more to do than is your SaaS bill a little too high, you can always just use some google sheets and google docs and get 80% of what you'd need in most SMB situations. reply coliveira 4 hours agorootparentPretty much everything boils down to having capital. Tech startups work because they inject capital into an idea that can be developed using technology. If you don't have capital to hire talent and sustain losses during several years, you have little chance to create a growing business in the modern economy. reply carlosjobim 5 hours agorootparentprevWhen you deal with enough small businesses, you'll find out that they usually pay a large percentage of their revenue to middle men in order to save a pittance of money or effort which would be required to get rid of the middle man. People don't act rationally. Those who do act rationally regarding their business, generally find ways to grow it beyond being a small business. Assuming they want to. Many are happy being small. SaaS is not a middle man. They're usually a good solution for a small business. reply dark-star 5 hours agoprevThis is at most something lat \"looks like\" Visual Basic 6.

But calling it \"rebuilt in c#\" is stretching it a bit... reply PaulRobinson 8 hours agoprevSay what you like about Visual Basic (and a lot has been said that is less than complimentary), but for a huge number of people and workplaces this was the tool that moved people from trying to fudge Excel or Access into a workflow and actually trying to write some software. My first language was BASIC on 8-bit machines (actually, it may have technically been Logo on a BBC, but I remember BASIC on a BBC as an 11 year old more clearly), and by the time VB came along I'd moved onto compiled languages like C and interpreted languages like Perl and PHP, and was a bit sniffy about the point and click nature of it all. I had one friend at college who refused to move on from QBASIC - I once saw him write a 3D game engine in that could about 30 frames _an hour_ on a Pentium - and the general atmosphere of being pro-FLOSS/anti-MS, plus a ton of really badly written apps encountered out in the wild when I did some small business IT consultancy made me very averse to VB in general. But you know, it wasn't the fault of the environment or the language. It was powerful, useful and better than the alternatives for a lot of people. Its main contemporary competitor - Delphi - seemed all the rage before it didn't. And I now wish we'd been able to get a little more down the simpler visual programming domain for a while, because the modern equivalents like XCode feel massively confusing to the novice, so the learning curve feels very steep by comparison. reply ladyanita22 8 hours agoprevI see lots of comments about how good VB6 was. I agree it made programming super-easy and practical. However, it is evident to me how the whole thing fell appart by the late 2000's, and now we have much more powerful, yet complex programming environments: - Rust, C, C++: Extremely complex but powerful. - HTML, JS, CSS: You have to learn 3 different technologies and won't be able to leverage the easy, powerful native APIs the OS provides. It's cross-platform though. - .net: Not as easy as VB6 (and C# becomes actually more and more complex, more powerful as well, though). You have to learn XAML as WinForms is still a thing but considered legacy. - Python: Easy (maybe more than VB, but not by much?), but no native, easy GUI toolkit for Windows. There are native bindings for GTK, but Linux is not a big desktop platform, and more so in business, and still GTK is much, much more complex than VB6 + Winforms + COM. So basically, it seems we have traded easy of use and practicality for power/performance and cross-platform compatibility? What do you guys think? reply mft_ 7 hours agoparentI often muse over there not being a VB-alike approach for Python. It would surely be reasonably straightforward to automate the creation of the GUI boilerplate code from a form designer, and then within an accompanying IDE hide most of that code from the user, only making the specific parts visible that correlate with different UI interactions? reply dinkblam 7 hours agorootparent> creation of the GUI boilerplate code from a form designer why? i think the approach of of the form designer generating code instead of generating serialized objects that your code interacts with at runtime is a serious flaw. java got it wrong, cocoa got it right there. reply scrlk 6 hours agorootparentprevPyQt/PySide with QT Creator is the closest equivalent. reply bux93 6 hours agoparentprevThere's a ton of visual programming tools out there, they just don't call it visual programming but low code. reply zabzonk 7 hours agoparentprevVB6 made writing Windows GUI applications very easy (on screen form designer), particularly when interfacing with COM libraries written in languages such as C++.

Microsoft killed it to push .NET (although originally, VB.NET was promoted as the main GUI language). People went to .NET, but also chose the \"adult\" language of C# along the way. Also, WinForms isn’t deprecated (it was in maintenance mode for some time, but now it gets some new features). Language history aside, browser-based UIs are easier to develop and deliver, so they won over desktop applications. reply pjc50 5 hours agorootparent> browser-based UIs are easier to develop and deliver Compared to the ease of a VB6 winforms app, they are way harder to develop.

I remember loving that game (or the Jerrath Online server anyways) and being amazed by it. I knew enough about computers to know it was programmed in VB 6, but not enough to actually code.

    "originBody": "I sent an ethernet packet For as long as I've been making videos on the low byte productions youtube channel, I've wanted to make a series about \"Networking from scratch\", by which I mean building a full TCP/IP stack from the ground up on a microcontroller. It's been nearly 6 years now, and the past few days felt like as good a time as any to start. This blog entry is fairly limited in scope; On the surface, it's about how I successfully sent my first ethernet packet, but really it's a story about bugs and debugging, and some thoughts about overcoming challenges in projects. Microcontroller The microcontroller I'm using is an STM32F401 on a nucleo devboard. This is the same setup I used in the Blinky to bootloader series, the 3D renderer on an oscilloscope video, and a bunch of others. It's an ARM Cortex-M4 that can run up to 84MHz, with 96KiB of RAM. That's enough to hold onto decent handful of packets. Ethernet Ethernet is a word that covers a surprising number of things. You might associate it with the port you plug into for wired internet, or know about the idea of ethernet frames. Ethernet is actually a whole family of technologies and standards (many of which are now obsolete) that encompasses the hardware involved at the physical level, various signalling formats that encode and transmit bits, the strategies for dealing with bus collisions, and the layout of frames, which contain and protect the data being sent from one place to another. Due to the complexity of the signalling involved with ethernet, a dedicated ASIC is generally used, which takes in data at the frame level, and takes care of wiggling the electrical lines in the right way over a cable (though there are of course exceptions). For this project, I'm using the W5100 chip from Wiznet, in the form of the original Arduino Ethernet shield. Well, it's a cheap knockoff that ended up needing some rework to actually function properly, but we'll get to that. The W5100 chip itself is pretty cool. It's essentially an ethernet ASIC with a hardware TCP/IP stack built-in. It has 4 \"sockets\", which can be set up to work at the TCP, UDP, IP, or \"MAC Raw\" levels. Since the whole point of this project is build a TCP/IP stack from scratch, I'm only making use of one socket in the MAC Raw mode, where I hand it ethernet frames, and it sends them out. The caveat is that an actual ethernet frame contains more than just the data; It also includes: A preamble, start of frame marker, and a 32-bit CRC. The preamble and start of frame marker are really only relevant at the electrical level, which the chip fully takes care, and the CRC is also helpfully computed by the W5100. Problem No. 1: Shouting into the void I coded up a driver to communicate with the W5100 chip. Data exchange takes place using SPI - the serial peripheral interface - which is a 4-wire signalling protocol for full duplex communication. One of the wires is for the main chip's (the microcontroller's) output, one is for the subordinate chip's (the W5100's) output, one is for the clock to which data is referenced, and the last is a \"chip select\" signal, which tells the subordinate chip that communication is happening. There are more details to SPI, which dictate things like if your data is referenced to the rising or falling edge of the clock, whether the clock signal idles high or low, whether bits are transferred MSB or LSB first, and how many bits occur per transfer (typically 8, or one byte). That gives you a low-level way to exchange bytes, but basically nothing else. The W5100 datasheet lays out a higher-level protocol on top of SPI to actually control the chip. In this protocol, you send commands made up of 4 bytes on the MOSI (main out, subordinate in) line: +--------+-----------+----------+--------+byte 0byte 1byte 2byte 3+--------+-----------+----------+--------+opaddr highaddr lowvalue+--------+-----------+----------+--------+ The first byte specifies the operation, which is either a write (0xf0) or a read (0x0f) - anything else is invalid and should be ignored. The second and third bytes specify a 16-bit address (big-endian), and the last byte is, in the case of a write, a value to be written at that address. The W5100 transfers data out on MISO (main in, subordinate out) line at the same time, which follows this pattern: +--------+--------+--------+--------+byte 0byte 1byte 2byte 3+--------+--------+--------+--------+0x000x010x020x03+--------+--------+--------+--------+ In the case of a read operation, byte 3 actually returns the value read at the specified address. What are these addresses? Well, internally, the W5100 has its own address space, which has transfer and receive buffers, as well as a bunch of registers for setting up and controlling the flow of packets. For reference, it's laid out like: +-----------------+------------------+Address RangeFunction+-----------------+------------------+0x0000 - 0x002fCommon registers| 0x0030 - 0x03ffReserved| 0x0400 - 0x07ffSocket registers| 0x0800 - 0x3fffReserved| 0x4000 - 0x5fffTX Memory| 0x6000 - 0x7fffRX Memory| 0x8000 - 0xffffReserved+-----------------+------------------+ My first clue that something wasn't right was that I was sending out commands on MOSI, and seeing garbage on MISO. One thing I really like about this chip is that it specifically sends back a known value every time you clock out a byte, and so it's really easy to see that something is off in the communication. I puzzled over this for a while, and realised I'd fallen into the trap that you should always avoid when doing anything embedded - I unconditionally trusted the hardware. As I mentioned earlier, The W5100 is sitting on an arduino shield - which is an addon board meant to clip directly on top of the standard but absolutely awful arduino headers. Because Arduino is so ubiquitous, this shield format has found its way onto myriad other devboards that have nothing to do with arduino, simply because it gives you an instant tie-in to readily available peripheral modules. The nucleo devboards from ST also have headers to accommodate arduino shields, but alas, this particular shield had an annoying little trick up it's sleave. You see, the arduino also has another little 6-pin header on board called the ICSP - the in-circuit serial programmer. This header can be used to reprogram Atmel chips (which the tractional arduinos use) over SPI. The designers of this shield decided to make use of that 6-pin header, and the fact that it shares the same SPI signals with those on the standard header, and routed the SPI lines to the ICSP header instead of the standard pins on the arduino header. On a proper arduino, this would be no problem, because the arduino board itself internally connects those signals. But a nucleo board doesn't have an ICSP header, so the SPI signals I was sending out were going nowhere. I realised this after probing around with a multimeter, measuring resistances between the power rails and the SPI signals. If you measure infinite resistance, you know there is a problem! A quick trip to the soldering station, and a few enamelled copper wires later, I had bodged my board to properly connect everything to the nucleo. Problem No. 2: The essence of comedy With the SPI signals actually going where they should be, I was actually communicating with the device! I had enough code written to set up the W5100 to do raw ethernet transmissions, set up the MAC address, configured the TX and RX memory segments, and finally write a simple test ethernet frame into TX memory and trigger a transmission. I connected the nucleo+shield to my laptop with a CAT5 cable, fired up wireshark, and! Nothing. If you're regularly doing stuff down at the low-level, this kind of problem can be really daunting. There are no helpful (or even cryptic) error messages to investigate. No stack trace to follow. It's simply: You wiggled some electrons up and down across the wires, and it didn't do the thing you thought it would. One very useful tool to have in your belt for this kind of thing is a logic analyser, which is like an oscilloscope, but specifically made for analysing digital signals, i.e. ones that go between a logical high and low level. These devices have a number of channels - usually between 8 and 32 - and a USB connection. In the middle is some speedy magical silicon which buffers, conditions, and samples those channels at a high rate, compresses the bitstreams, and pushes them through the USB, ready to be analysed by software. The cool thing here is that you can investigate individual signals, or more usefully, groups of signals (like an entire SPI bus). In that case, the software will actually interpret the signals, and give you a display of the bytes sent in a transaction, as well as export tools for processing those same bytes as a CSV or other structured format. I have a Saleae Logic 8, which is a fairly fancy device, but you can get cheap and cheerful analysers for ~€10, which can also integrate with Saleae's Logic2 software (they're pretty iffy about working correctly and consistently, but there's always a tradeoff, right). As soon as I captured the SPI traffic flying across, I could see something was off. The first command I sent looked good, and so did the response over the MISO line. It's a software reset, and appears something like this: +--------+--------+--------+--------+byte 0byte 1byte 2byte 3+------+--------+--------+--------+--------+MOSI0xf00x000x000x80+------+--------+--------+--------+--------+MISO0x000x010x020x03+------+--------+--------+--------+--------+ Decoded, it's a write to address 0x0000, the \"Mode Register\", with the most significant bit set, which triggers a software reset. You can also see that the device dutifully responded with the bytes 0x00 to 0x03. The next command is a read from the same address, which is supposed to check if that same most significant bit has been cleared to 0, which indicates that the reset is complete. It looked like this: +--------+--------+--------+--------+byte 0byte 1byte 2byte 3+------+--------+--------+--------+--------+MOSI0x0f0x000x000x00+------+--------+--------+--------+--------+MISO0x030xff0xff0xff+------+--------+--------+--------+--------+ Huh. The response on the MISO line is not the counting up behaviour, but instead it starts at 0x03 and then just responds forevermore with 0xff. Not good. I pondered this one for a little while, and thankfully the little knowledge I have of digital logic, and actually building hardware on FPGAs came in clutch. The fact that the first value returned by the W5100 was 0x03, which is the also the last value it returned, is a pretty big clue. Digital hardware, internally, is made up of circuits that implement useful primitives like \"registers\" and \"flip-flops\". These circuits are synchronous to a clock, and are able to capture/store/reset values presented to their inputs. You take these primitives, mix them together with others like multiplexers (the circuit equivalent of an if-statement), decoders, and of course logic gates, and you can build up to more complex constructions like state machines. The really important thing about all of this is that there are some pretty important timing-related constraints that need to be upheld. It takes a signal time to come out of a register, pass through a handful of logic gates/multiplexers/whatever, and then enter a new register. If, for example, the clock were to switch too fast, before the signal had made its way to the next register, the abstraction falls apart and it simply ain't gonna work. My thinking was that something like this was happening here; The W5100 didn't have enough time to do its thing, and that's why I was seeing the previous state of MISO (0x03) when the second command transaction was taking place. It probably wasn't going to be the SPI clock though, since the datasheet implies the maximum clock rate for the SPI bus is ~14MHz, and I was running way below that. Instead, I suspected that the chip select line was probably going high (i.e. being disabled) too soon, causing the chip to get into a bad state. I added a small loop to introduce a few microseconds of extra time before changing the state of the chip select line, and it worked! All of a sudden, the responses on the MISO line looked right. And further more, it seemed like the rest of the setup was also working, and I was getting sensible and sane values back from the chip when reading back configuration values I had written to it. I still haven't completely gotten to the bottom of the matter. Diligent readers will note that the datasheet does in fact contain a SPI timing diagram on page 66, but the only constraint mentioned there with regard to the chip select line was certainly being met. I should go back and try to figure out the exact bounds where things break down, but there are only a certain number of hours in the day, and right now I'd rather just progress with the project. Problem No. 3: There's life in this packet, but not as we know it Of course, the first thing I did was to fire up wireshark again, and see if that packet would appear. And it did! Sort of. Well, not really. A packet did appear, but not the one that I'd sent. Instead, at the moment the transmission command went out of the microcontroller, a raw ethernet packet, filled with garbage, and far larger than the one I had placed came out across the screen. I'd been trying to avoid reading other peoples code related to this chip, because a lot of the fun of this kind of project, for me, comes in the exploration and discovery of trying to get the thing working from specs and datasheets alone. But at this stage, I was willing to sanity check my understanding against something known to be working properly. A little tip that a lot of very seasoned embedded developers could learn from is that, at times like this, arduino actually comes in really useful. Grab an arduino, install some library, write ~5 lines of code (because all the complex stuff happens under the hood), and if you get the result, you now have a gold standard working thing to compare to. It actually took me quite a lot longer to find a library that would let me transmit a raw ethernet packet, however. As it turns out, most Arduino users, who want to be able to add network connectivity to a project, do not want to do it all from scratch. The official libraries actually removed support for sending raw packets from the public API. However I managed to find a project on github that was the minimum necessary steps to send and receive packets. I read the source, and compared against my own, and there were no immediately obvious offenders. Some of the register writes and reads occurred in a different order, some were ommitted in mine or theirs, but none of that seemed to be the problem. Normally sequence-dependent stuff like that is called out explicitly in the datasheet. Still, I changed my reads and writes to mimic theirs exactly, and for whatever reason I was still getting the garbage packet in wireshark. I decided at this point to try a different tactic. I believe in writing little tools to help guide development and debugging. This will be things like taking some low-level output, parsing it, and re-presenting it in a higher-level form. I typically write these little tools in python, and take the time to do argument parsing to properly document what comes in and what goes out. In this instance, I wanted to take the SPI capture CSV export coming the Saleae's Logic2 software, parse the bytes, and present a list of register writes and reads, with proper names, formatting, etc. The full tool is just over 200 lines of code, most of which is just a copy-paste of register names/addresses directly from the data sheet. The whole thing took me maybe one hour to put together. I took a capture of the gold-standard Arduino, as well as my garbage-producing implementation, and then passed the CSV data export of both through my tool. Running a simple diff, the problem jumped out immediately. I'll tell you now that this wasn't a glamourous bug, but then most aren't. My W5100 driver code contained a convienience function called w5100_write16(u16 address, u16 value), which did two 8-bit write commands to two sequential registers. Many of the registers in the W5100 are actually 16-bit values, but the command format only allows for writing 8 bits at a time, so these values are split into high and low part. Long story short: My w5100_write16() function wrote to the same address twice, instead of the writing to address + 1 for the second byte. In the processed logs from my tool, this was easy to see. The arduino looked like: ... 5.3645086 : [w] S0_TX_WR0 [0x0424] 0x00 5.36453178: [w] S0_TX_WR1 [0x0425] 0x3c ... And mine: 8.45262964: [w] S0_TX_WR0 [0x0424] 0x00 8.45286726: [w] S0_TX_WR0 [0x0424] 0x3c The details aren't important here, but this was a write to the Socket 0 transmit write pointer register. Remember earlier when I was talking about digital logic and state machines and abstractions breaking down etc? Well, this is actually another example of that, in a way. The W5100 expects you to read this 16 bit register (in order!), write bytes into TX memory, and then write back to this register with the new write pointer, and finally issue a socket command to send. By not writing the transmit write pointer in the correct order (in fact, not writing the second byte at all), and then issuing the send, I had put the chip into yet another weird and undefined state where it just did some random stuff. And of course, no errors, no stack traces - just weird effects. I fixed the function, and my test packet showed up in full glory in wireshark. To say I was happy to see it would be an understatement. The moral of the story? So I sent an ethernet packet. Not exactly the worlds biggest achievement when you realise how many of those are whizzing around in cables, passing through your body in the form of 2.4GHz radio waves right now, but certainly one that I was happy to call a win. Sometimes it's just fun to take the time to recount the numerous and often stupid bugs you encounter while working on a pet project - I know I love reading that from others, at least. But if I had any kind of point, it would probably be that spending the time to do things like write tools and explore the debugging space is pretty much always worth it. Strangely, I've found that there is a not-insignificant number of people are against this - especially in a professional environment. I think this has something to do with the JIRA-fication of development process, where all work is divided and sub-divided, and anything that does not directly check a box and produce a deliverable is wasted effort. It's disheartening that there is a whole group of people - developers and managers alike - who do not understand or see the value in exploration as part of the process. Writing a tool is often just as important and impactful as writing a test - more so even, if you don't fully understand the system you're working with yet. Debugging is, at its core, a manifestation of the scientific method; You gather data, make predictions, and test those predictions with experiments. Experiments yield new data, and you update your predictions, and hopefully come out the other side with a proper understanding. Tools like the one I wrote here are kind of akin to making plots of raw data. One good plot can tell you everything you need to know about your data. The project is making more significant progress now, and the new problems and new bugs are coming in at a higher abstraction level, which are more to do with (mis)understanding RFCs, and writing multitasking code than anything else. I might write more on the project at some point, but that'll be for another day.",

There's a cog in the wheel developer and ... they have their place, and in many orgs they're the only thing that works. But if you're not that person (and I like to think I'm not) and you are curious and stop to think about second order effects, future features that are a little obvious, and so on ... it's really painful working with those developers who do not. I worked with one recently, not a bad person at all, but now I'm cleaning up his project that 100% did exactly what the tickets told him to do. And the project that he worked on that was designed to replace a piece of software that had issues ... has every single issue the old one had for all the same reasons (someone coded it in the easiest possible way + only what the ticket told them to). So frustrating. I will say this though, I find the use of the term \"10x developer\" a sort of buzzword smell for the kind of reckless developer with no oversight who \"gets the job done\" at great cost ... because they can do what they want and then everything is siloed and potentially a disaster when anyone has to touch it or they bolt when it becomes clear their tower of cards is ready to come down. Not to say I disagree with your statement generally, just that term tends to make me worry. reply MrMcCall 4 hours agorootparentI'd say that there are two kinds of 10x devs, as per who is doing the determination of '10x': 1. From the perspective of the money folks (managers & up): they get their jobs done very quickly, thus spending minimal time, meaning minimal money. 2. From the perspective of excellent systems design folks: they design an excellent system that addresses subtle problems and foresees and addresses system problems that will occur down the road. Type #2 folks tend to not add to the org's technical debt; Type #1 folks don't GAF about such considerations -- they meet their quotas, get their perf reviews, and are on their way to their next promotion/position/project. I'd say there is excellence for excellence's sake, and then there's money-making excellence. Sure, orgs need to make money (or at least break even) to survive, but there's a lot of overlap where being too much one way or the other will be an impediment to long-term viability. reply dapperdrake 2 hours agorootparentAnd then at Boeing with #1 the doors fall off… reply inetknght 1 hour agorootparentprev> if you're not that person and you are curious and stop to think about second order effects, future features that are a little obvious, and so on ... it's really painful working with those developers who do not.

Whether that's because they won't be told what to do, are the manager themselves, or have no manager at all is not known to me. That said, writing your own tools if applicable is useful, however I'd argue that a productive developer writes the least code and instead uses what's off the shelf. To use this article as an example, nobody should be writing their own TCP stack, there are perfectly fine existing implementations.

Part of the trick is to modify the common PHY + MagJack breakout boards to let the RP2040 generate the clock signal so that the signals are in sync and you don't have to oversample the RMII. Just 10Mb/s can be done even dirtier.

It served me well, but I didn't realize going in that Prefect/Airflow/Argo etc are really orchestration engines and you still need to write the client software around it to serve your own (or the team) productivity.

Packets are an IP concept :) reply mhandley 9 hours agoparentRFC 791 which defines IP talks about both packets and datagrams. IP sends datagrams. Each IP datagram is fragmented into one or more packets depending on the underlying L2 network. But RFC 791 dates from when the underlying L2 network was most likely ARPAnet, which had 128 byte packets. Today the distinction is (or should be) moot - if you're relying on IP fragmentation to send your large IP datagram over multiple L2 packets, you're doing something wrong. IPv6 doesn't even support in-network fragmentation. In practice, the distinction has largely disappeared over time. Everyone I know talks about packets and very rarely bothers to distinguish between frames, datagrams and packets, because in practice one Ethernet frame generally carries one IP datagram, and everyone calls it a packet. reply xnorswap 8 hours agoparentprevOnly on HN could someone implement networking from scratch, only to be dismissed by someone in the comments implying they've no idea what they're doing. reply Angostura 8 hours agorootparentI think the comment was implying that they got word wrong, not that they had \"no idea what they were doing\".

SOCK_RAW packets are passed to and from the device driver without any changes in the packet data. When receiving a packet, the address is still parsed and passed in a standard sockaddr_ll address structure. When transmitting a packet, the user-supplied buffer should contain the physical-layer header. That packet is then queued unmodified to the network driver of the interface defined by the destination address. https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/packet.7.html reply immibis 2 hours agoparentAnd to do it from the other direction, you can open a tun (virtual IP) or tap (virtual Ethernet) interface just as easily.

When it comes to tcp connections linux seems more robust. reply vbezhenar 10 hours agoprevAs a hobbyist I wish that electronic gods would invent a way to bit-bang real world protocols. It is possible with simple protocols, but when we move to MHz range, it moves to impossible. Some kind of co-processor which would work at, say, 100 GHz speed with very limited instruction set. So I could implement some simple protocol parsing and buffering for more complex processing at lower speeds. Probably not possible, but who knows... reply MathMonkeyMan 10 hours agoparentThe rp2040 and its newer sibling can be clocked north of 100 MHz and have special hardware called PIO (programmable input/output) that runs at one instruction per cycle and can do multiple IO operations per instruction. That's a microcontroller. I wonder if more powerful chips can do more. reply crote 9 hours agorootparentThe main issue with that is that the PIO does not have decent support for external clock inputs, let alone any kind of clock recovery. It can easily send a 100MHz signal, but it can't reliably receive one. The PIO allows for single-cycle or dual-cycle data output, which essentially just pulls bits from a FIFO and puts them on some pins. The \"side-set pin\" makes it really easy to generate a clock signal as well. If the target devices samples on rising edge, it becomes essentially \"output data, clock low; nop, clock high; implicit repeat\" or even \"output data; implicit repeat\" if the target can do its own clock recovery or uses DDR. This is great, because you can output a lot of data at quite high speeds. But the opposite is a lot harder. The PIO has no native clock support, so you're left simulating it yourself with a multi-instruction operation. If you need even as little as two instructions to receive a bit, that 133MHz MCU clock already limits you to a 66MHz signal! In theory you could use an external clock input - but those pins are limited to 50MHz. You could also feed the external clock into the main oscillator input - but that breaks a bunch of other functionality, especially if the external clock isn't reliable. Oversampling isn't an option either: you'd have to read the pins at 4x the signal frequency (limiting you to 33MHz) and dedicate a lot of computing resources to that. In other words, high-speed input is only really an option if you don't care about synchronization, such as a free-running logic analyzer. But bitbanging 100BASE-T Ethernet? Don't count on it. Even the 2-bit-wide 50MHz RMII interface has proven to be quite challenging. reply MathMonkeyMan 1 hour agorootparentThanks for the insights. I've only written one PIO program, and it's for a DHT22 sensor. I divided the clock down to 1 MHz so I could count microseconds. Really, CPU bit-banging would have worked fine at those speeds. Now that I think about it more, you're right. Best case scenario for reading a bit would be to wait for the pin to go high/low, then push the corresponding bit into the input shift register, and have that automatically flush to DMA every 32 bits, say. Can't do better than some fraction of the clock speed because of the multiple instructions needed. reply danhor 10 hours agoparentprevYou're basically talking about FPGAs.

The shutdown of the 3G Mobile Network. Originally announced by Telstra in late 2019, the shutdown is supposed to usher in a new age of modern high speed communications to power the modern 4G & 5G data dependent world we find ourselves in, and are increasingly reliant on. SMH — The end is nigh for Telstra’s 3G network; termination set for 2024 - October 2019 https://www.smh.com.au/technology/the-end-is-nigh-for-telstra-s-3g-network-termination-set-for-2024-20191009-p52z0n.html As they did with the shutdown of 2G in 2018, the telcos & industry have framed this as a necessary step forward in advancing their 4G and 5G coverage. However, the handling of the shutdown has been met with disruption & delays, mismanagement, industry self interest and an overall lack of preparedness by Government, Regulators and the sector at large. Whilst shutting down 3G sounds like a perfectly reasonable proposition, the realities with achieving that in the modern landscape of fractured technological standards and cost cutting means this process has been fraught with problems. All of which have been entirely foreseeable. Background The Shutdown of Telstra’s 3G Network was due to originally occur on 30 June 2024, with Optus to follow from September 2024. Vodafone (TPG Telecom) was the first out of the gate with a planned switch-off from 15 December 2023. TPG would later realise they got out scot-free, largely free from the controversies to come. Though everyone has a had part to play in this, including TPG/Vodafone. On Sunday 17 March 2024 the Communications Minister stated she became aware that approximately 740,000 4G phones (that support VoLTE/4G Calling) would not be able to call 000/Emergency Services after the 3G switch off. Following on from that March announcement, on 6 May Telstra announced that they would delay their shutdown to 31 August. Then subject to a Senate Inquiry in July, Telstra and Optus eventually jointly delayed their shutdown until 28 October 2024. Telstra, Optus to delay 3G network closure amid public safety concerns — 2024–08–14 https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-08-14/telstra-optus-delay-3g-shutdown/104222598 You can learn more below. Australia’s 3G Switch-off - Failures of Government & Industry to Prepare A Cautionary Tale of Mismanagement & Consumer Harms medium.com The entire time the industry and telcos have touted the shutdown as a critically necessary step in ensuring we can interact with the modern digital world. Meanwhile telcos like Telstra continue to post massive profits whilst simultaneously increasing the cost of mobile services for customers, with ever diminishing value in return. SMH — ‘Telstra profits pass $2b on mobile growth’ — August 2023 https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/telstra-profits-pass-2b-on-mobile-growth-20230816-p5dx29.html The Problem A key factor that the industry has been keen to not draw too much attention to for over a year is the number of 4G & 5G devices that would no longer work, or would only work on some networks, including for Emergency Calling. The idea that a 4G or 5G phone could somehow be affected by the shutting down of older technologies like 2G & 3G is a completely foreign concept to people, and rightfully so. The last 20-30 years of 2G & 3G has enabled seamless global connectivity and greatly enhanced competition & innovation in the mobile sector. Surely 4G & 5G would be an extension of the same, because of course it would! How could it not be?….. right..? Well this is where it all starts to fall apart. Unlike with 2G & 3G, 4G & 5G are Data only standards and have no built-in calling functionality, let alone one as well standardised as the traditional Circuited Switched calling from 2G & 3G (GSM/UMTS). This becomes a problem as to enable calling over 4G & 5G, devices need to have explicit software/firmware support, especially so for Emergency Calling. Calling on 4G Networks is enabled through the use of VoLTE (Voice over LTE aka ‘4G Calling’), which is a software/firmware VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) calling solution for mobile phones. The world has used VoIP Calling for decades but introducing VoIP data based calling into the mobile sector has proven very difficult. Voice Over LTE (4G Calling) devices have been around since as early as 2013, however over years the industry has failed to ensure interoperability. ‘Should we stop the shutdown of 2G/3G to save lives??’Rudolf van der Berg - StratixEENA 2022 https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WC16k8C1gpeFRJif23yDIuLSRg1OJOnZ/view The global interoperability with devices that people expect and have become accustomed to for the last 20+ years has entirely disappeared and the vast majority have no knowledge that it’s even happened.

What many customers were not aware of is later that same day they would be entirely disconnected and blocked from all mobile services on their 4G or 5G Device, even on brand new devices! Parents that dropped kids off at school or day care early in the morning later found themselves without any mobile service, unable to call or text anyone. Whether unable to contact employers or family members, many Australians were caught off guard, surprisingly still the numbers to be affected. Scale of the issue One would assume that the Shutdown of the 3G network would only impact those with phones from last decade, or those unwilling to upgrade. However the Government and ACMA was fully aware that people with newer 4G devices would be impacted and in sizeable numbers. The ACMA and Government had been monitoring the shutdown, and based on numbers from industry expected approximately 258,000 4G mobile phones would be impacted once the shutdown began. Emergency Call Service Amendment Determination 2024 Explanatory statementF2024L01353ES Pg9 https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2024L01353/asmade/text/explanatory-statement However that 258,000 Number is actually an estimate based on an earlier October figure. On 1 October 2024 the total number of ‘affected phones’ was noted as 516,875 including 3G, 4G & 5G. More troubling is those numbers include thousands of 4G & 5G Devices that actually work perfectly on 4G, including for Emergency Calling. Lumped in with ‘incompatible’ devices because the telcos have next to no visibility of what individual devices can make emergency calls over 4G. Last Minute Messaging to Telstra Customers For months in advance of the switch-off the messaging from the providers indicated that older and incompatible devices may lose access to calling as the network was shutdown, but at minimum Data & SMS would remain on 4G & 5G devices. Telstra SMS 3498 System Message This was true with Telstra up until the 25th of October. However from Midday Friday the 25th of October, Telstra customers were instead told via SMS their 4G/5G device would be blocked from all services, including Data & SMS. Text Message Sent to Telstra Customers Midday (AEST) Friday 25 October 2024 Telstra customers were given half a business day’s notice that their 4G or 5G device would be entirely blocked from all services from Monday! Optus Messaging From late August Optus had been telling customers that their 4G or 5G device “would stop working” or “would not work”. However they consistently neglected to use the word “Block”. Sometimes hiding it within the fine print of emails. Amaysim is an MVNO Owned by Optus Someone with a new 4G or 5G device would rightfully assume those messages are wrong and Optus was being overcautious, especially if they recently just upgraded. People were even told to disregard the message if they’d recently upgraded. Little did they know their device would be blocked starting from Monday.

(The Consultation opened 4 Days after contacting the Minister through the office of a 3G Committee Senator) ACMA — Proposal to amend the ECS Determination 2024 https://www.acma.gov.au/consultations/2024-09/proposal-amend-ecs-determination However this consultation was only due to run for 2 weeks until the 8th of October 2024. Most Consultations by the ACMA run from anywhere from 4–5 weeks depending on the topic and stakeholders involved. In total there were 40 submissions to the ACMA, including 11 directly from Industry. (Including Industry Groups, MNOs, MVNOs etc) You would have thought, given the seriousness of totally blocking hundreds of thousands of phones in a matter of weeks, that the ACMA would have ensured a sufficiently long public consultation period. Or at minimum the Minister would have actually intervened and delayed the shutdown. Even more questionable is why it was only opened on the 24th of September, when the ACMA had the direction from the Minister weeks earlier in late August/early September. I, along with other members of the public made submissions to the ACMA with very serious concerns regarding the Minister’s Direction and the Draft put forward by the ACMA. Submission to the ACMA - RE Proposed changes to the ECS Determination 2024 - James Parker2024–10–08 Even the Telcos raised some serious concerns about the technical feasibility of blocking devices. On Thursday 24 October, the finalised Amendment to the Emergency Call Service Determination was published on the Legilsation.gov.au website. Emergency Call Service Amendment Determination 2024 https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2024L01353/asmade/text From that point it became official, the Government (much to some resistance from the Telcos) were going to force the telcos to block over a quarter of a million people and their devices in the span of mere days and weeks. The concerns of consumers and industry were entirely disregarded. The somewhat more reasonable suggestion by Telstra to just disable call service and leave Data & SMS was rejected by the ACMA. If the telco believes a device to be ‘incompatible’ it would be blocked, from all services. No exemptions, no dispute processes, no proof required, simply denied all services! I own devices that work perfectly but the Telcos don’t recognise they work, this includes devices that have placed multiple calls to 000 over 4G. Normal 4G Emergency Calling Behaviour (With Active Sim & VoLTE) Description: In the above example the device successfully places an Emergency Call over 4G with an active ‘VoLTE’ service. This is the intended Calling behaviour for a device that supports 4G Emergency Calls. The device (Android 9 — Xperia XZ1C — SD 835) was running a GSMA (‘Open Market’) IR.92 + IR.51 VoLTE Modem Configuration. However, as Vodafone did not sell this model of device and it was not sold in Australia they do not recognise that it supports both VoLTE Calling and Emergency Calling! Incompatible Devices Contrast the above with what happens with a device that actually is unable to make emergency calls over 4G. What people also don’t understand is that these compatibility issues with VoLTE Calling and Emergency Calling are Software Problems, not hardware issues. Two identical phones running different software can have different VoLTE Calling and Emergency Calling functionality on various networks. This Industry has tried to pretend that 4G devices that rely on 3G for 000 are ‘hardwired’ this way and the only solution is to buy new devices, when that could not be further from the truth. Sony Xperia XZ1 — Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 Chipset — Tested Q2 2024 — Extract from Testing You can learn more below: The Little Known Problems with VoLTE Emergency Calling How to Test for 4G Emergency Calling on Android medium.com The 8 November Optus Outage The failure by Optus last year during the 8 November Outage is the key factor behind this change and the new Determination Direction & Rules. Blocking handsets is to entirely sweep the compatibility problem under the rug. By making this change, the industry and regulators are entirely absolved of any responsibility or accountability for failing to properly address the issues with Calling and Emergency Calling over 4G. We need policy that actually requires the industry to actually fix the problem! Optus reveals 10 times more people affected by triple-0 failures than previously known https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-01-23/optus-network-outage-triple-0-emergency-calls-wider-than-thought/103380928 ABC News — Optus Outage Inquiry Report — Sep 2024: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-27/optus-outage-senate-inquiry-report/104406028 In 2019 Optus even said to the ACCC that “VOLTE cannot be the sole technology relied upon to provide voice services. […]” due to “..incompatible handsets.” An extract is below. Optus — ‘Optus submission to the MTAS FAD discussion paper’ ACCC — September 2019 — PG5 https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/Optus%20submission%20to%20the%20MTAS%20FAD%20discussion%20paper.pdf Optus Outage Review & Findings In the Government’s subsequent review into the 8 November Optus Outage it was noted that there is minimal if any testing between devices across networks. An extract from the Report is below. “Regardless of the technical reasons for the outage, it is clear that more testing of network interoperability is needed to ensure problems are identified and anticipated. The complexity of the carriers’ mobile networks and the necessity of interoperability to deliver Triple Zero calls demands a more thorough approach to testing than is currently in place. The carriers do not test with and/or across each other’s networks. While testing the camp on function on their own networks, even if covering all scenarios, the testing does not guarantee (as far as practicable) that calls will be picked up when a competitor’s network is unavailable. Current testing regimes do not cover all devices sold by all carriers, and there is no system for addressing the capabilities of the devices of customers who bring their own. The countless variations in handsets, handset and SIM settings, and the alternative configurations between nodes within each of the networks, present a significant risk to the certain operation of the camp on functionality in all (or as many as might reasonably be anticipated) circumstances. This needs to be addressed. The establishment of cross-carrier end-to-end network and device testing including under the wide range of known scenarios would provide information and insight into potential issues before major outages occur. Such testing may have gone someway to anticipating the failure of some calls to connect to Triple Zero on the day of the outage.” Department of Infrastructure — ‘Review into the Optus outage of 8 November 2023 — Final Report’ — March 2024 — Pg22 The report goes on further to say: “Australian Standard AS/CA S042.1: Requirements for connection to an air interface of Telecommunications Network. This standard, [..] specifies the requirements for customer equipment (handsets), […]. It includes technical guidance for testing these handsets for various scenarios including accessing the emergency call service. Carriers use this guidance in conducting the testing that they do. There is currently no requirement for universal or cross-industry testing.” As 2G and 3G calling are well understood and standardised, it hasn’t been necessary to carry out extensive device & network testing. As the standardisation of 4G VoLTE calling is extremely fragmented, testing for devices is necessary to confirm even basic compatibility, this is due to the industry failing to properly standardise VoLTE calling. The ACMA, Department and Industry have decided not to properly address the BYOD device issue and will instead now require people to only use ‘supported’ handsets purchased directly from their telcos or associated handset partners. With this policy change you can now no longer use any device you want from any provider in the world, even if it may work perfectly! The telcos get to be judge, jury and execution, solely deciding what phones you are allowed to use and where you must have purchased them from. Optus Blocking Officially Supported Devices Due to the failures by Optus during the 8 November 2023 outage, in early September began instigating a very regressive device ‘Whitelist’ blocking policy. Optus — An Important Update on Mobile Handset Safety — 3 September 2024 In essence if they (or their partners) didn’t sell a phone or test it, it’s blocked, even if it’s a supported hardware model! Optus is even blocking Officially Supported phones that are on their device support list! I own an 4G Sony Xperia XZ Premium (2018) which is officially supported by Optus & Telstra. Optus VoLTE Support List ⁣https://www.optus.com.au/support/answer?id=20032 Telstra VoLTE Support List https://www.telstra.com.au/support/mobiles-devices/enable-volte-mobile-phone#compatible-device I have a Network Unlocked version originally sold through Telstra that is running the Australian Retail Software. The phone works (worked) perfectly for VoLTE Calling on Telstra and Optus. VoLTE IMS Registration Status - Voice over LTE Available However as my device was sold by Telstra, Optus has now blocked it from their network! Phone not allowed for voice Device Blocking Message —Sony Xperia XZ Premium It’s exactly the same hardware model, but because it was sold by their competitor and they don’t think it works, it’s entirely blocked! Even if loaded with the Optus specific software the device would still be blocked as the phone is being denied all service based on the TAC ‘Type Allocation Code’ section of the device IMEI. Not the actual functionality. (The IMEI is essentially the Serial Number, similar to the VIN of a vehicle) My Telstra Version of the XZ Premium has a TAC of 35923708 Where as an AU Retail versions may have a TAC of 35783808 Both are identical ‘G8141’ Model Devices with the exact same hardware. IMEI TAC Identifier Example The conduct by Optus and the Telcos is extraordinarily anti-competitive and doesn’t seem even remotely legal. Optus Blocking New Phones Purchased Retail Even some brand new phones recently purchased in retail stores here have been blocked by Optus and the telcos, those customers are currently without any 4G service! Notice on 3G Shutdown and Network Connection for Xiaomi Devices — 31 October 2024 https://xiaomitech.com.au/blogs/news/notice-on-3g-shutdown-and-network-connection-for-xiaomi-devices Impacts on Consumers A key element that has been neglected by Government, Regulators and Industry from the beginning is the impact on consumers. They may like to proudly display and talk about how there are processes and systems in place to deal with the ‘vulnerable & elderly’, patting themselves on the back whilst simultaneously failing to actually ensure that consumers are correctly informed and protected during this process. On the 14th of May Amaysim sent out a marketing email saying “IT’LL BE MAYHEM” when the switch-off occurs. This sort of marketing material was extremely unnecessary and only served to drive people to panic buy new phones. Media Coverage Over the past year the bulk of the reporting that has been in the media (primarily that of the commercial TV networks) has been (and continues to be) very poor, for months there has been essentially little to no mention as to the possible impacts to 4G and 5G devices. On 21 August 2023 both 7 News and 9 News aired stories about the 3G switch-off with their 6PM Bulletins. Both TV Networks included interviews from the providers however the fact that 4G and 5G devices could be affected wasn’t mentioned once! YouTube - Australians warned of upcoming 3G switch-off from Telstra, Optus & Vodafone - 7 News2023-08-21 https://web.archive.org/web/20240124101628/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJZotwC3hjg YouTube - 3G network to shutdown in a number of months - 9 News Australia2023-08-21 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiRdec-E8ps On 22 August 2023 I once again contacted the office of my Local Member Anika Wells regarding the TV news coverage. I asked for any updates from the Minister’s Office regarding the concerns I raised on 6 June 2023. I said “Last night (21/08) the Brisbane 6PM nightly news bulletins on Channel 7 and Channel 9 covered the switch-off, but both failed to mention the VoLTE support issue and the impact the switch off will have on 4G Devices that lack VoLTE support on Australian networks. It seems like the telco’s aren’t being entirely upfront about this issue to the media and its critical people are properly informed about this.” On 24 August 2023 I received a response that said: “We are yet to receive an update, we are liaising with Minister Rowland’s office on the status of the update” It would take another month to receive a response on 25 September 2023. I also raised these concerns with the aforementioned TV networks via email on 22 August. One of the networks did respond to my email, and I had an hour long on-camera interview with them in early September 2023, however the network never aired the story. No explanation was provided. After a number of follow-ups on 15 November they finally advised “At this stage we aren’t running the story sorry.” Blindly listening to industry and their Government relation lobbyists has resulted in the outcome we find ourselves in today. By stark contrast France will have 3G until approx 2028/2029 and the UK will be keeping their 2G network around until approx 2030/2033. Both countries have more than 2.5x our population. Kore Wireless — ‘Global 2G & 3G Network Closures’ https://www.korewireless.com/2g-3g-network-sunset-dates Mobile UK — ‘2G/3G Switch Off’ https://www.mobileuk.org/2g-3g-switch-off Costs to Consumers Within the ACMA ‘ECS Explanatory Statement’ they set out a number of regulatory options in regards to the shutdown, including the blocking of working devices in Option 2. Within the paper they set out the expected costs to consumers. ACMA Assumes all ‘affected phones’ are Low End Phones, equivalent to $250 Samsung! It assumes that the average replacement cost for a consumer is only $250, and multiply over the total number of affected devices in use that consumers should be expected to bear in excess of $83 Million in costs. ACMA Explanatory Statement registered 24/10/2024 to F2024L01353Page 37 https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2024L01353/asmade/downloads The overall proportion of costs for this approach will see 55% of the financial burden borne by consumers! ACMA Explanatory Statement registered 24/10/2024 to F2024L01353Page 27 https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2024L01353/asmade/downloads In my submissions to both the Optus Network Outage and the 3G Network Shutdown Senate Inquiries I warned that: Requiring Optus, Telstra or Vodafone VoLTE firmware on mobile devices provided by those companies will reduce choice for consumers in addition to allowing the major telcos to exert more control over the smartphone and telecommunications space. Australian consumers should be free to purchase devices from any retailer, online store or international brand and have it work here in Australia, just as they have been able to do for decades with 2G & 3G. The consistent standardisation of 2G & 3G has enabled seamless global connectivity and greatly enhanced competition in the mobile sector. Currently providers are able to use this Telco Specific VoLTE firmware requirement as a stealth way of network locking their devices and preventing customers from switching to competitors or from using ‘BYO’ devices. All of that has now occurred! Impacts on Tourists & Roamers What people may not also been aware of is that the devices used by many International Tourists and Roamers were also entirely kicked off the networks of Telstra & Optus on Monday Morning (28 Oct). Even though the Direction from the Minister and Legislation by the ACMA states that Travellers should be exempt for up to 90 days. ACMA (Emergency Call Service Determination) Direction 2024 — Explanatory StatementPage 2 ⁣https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2024L01103/asmade/text/explanatory-statement The telcos in their Submission to the ACMA’s Open Consultation did warn they would struggle to exempt Roamers from the device blocking rules. Telstra — ECS Determination Public Submission — 9 October 2024 — Page 10 https://www.acma.gov.au/consultations/2024-09/proposal-amend-ecs-determination However the ACMA and the Minister both seem to think that the rule of law can somehow overcome technological complexities and limitations. A story we’ve heard before from many different Governments. Telstra3G network closure — Frequently asked questions - November 2024 https://www.telstra.com.au/support/mobiles-devices/3g-closure The failure to fully contextualise and understand the implications of this issue highlights the very clear lack of oversight there has been with this entire shutdown process. For some context, in April 2019 the ACMA said there was ‘no clear indication of migration paths towards the use of VoLTE handsets’. Yet Telstra announced a 3G switch-off date later that same year for mid 2024. ACMA — ‘Reconfiguring the 900 MHz band — Options paper’ — April 2019 “One of the key issues for licensees is the uncertain timeline for the proliferation of Voice Over LTE (VoLTE)-enabled devices among consumers. The ACMA sought information from incumbent licensees on the expected timing and speed of consumer migration towards the use of VOLTE handsets, but still has no clear indication of intended migration paths. In the absence of receiving any further information to support a more detailed assessment, the ACMA considers that the proposed timeline outlined in this option (i.e. a mid-2024 clearance date for existing apparatus licences) provides enough opportunity for carriers to mitigate risks to the continuity of consumer services.” Based on the above information it appears that little (if any) consideration was ever given to ensure handsets were compatible before allowing the providers to restructure any of the 3G Bands, let alone a complete switch-off of 3G. When the ACMA made that assessment Android and iOS didn’t even have VoLTE Roaming Support. (Android 12–2021, iOS 15–2021) It’s clear the switch-off dates have been chosen not on specific compatibility or standardisation criteria, but rather based on commercial interests.

Australia’s 3G Switch-off - Failures of Government & Industry to Prepare A Cautionary Tale of Mismanagement & Consumer Harms medium.com Now Tourists with blocked 4G & 5G phones find themselves only able to connect to the Vodafone network. (Though some devices used by Roamers were blocked on Vodafone as well.) Roaming Customers unable to Connect to Optus or Vodafone from Monday 28 October 2024 Issues with VoLTE & Roaming Worse still many lost the ability to make or receive calls via their Roaming Sim Card as VoLTE Roaming was only available on Optus and Telstra’s Networks. Seems there were some complaints after that happened, so now VoLTE Roaming is working on Vodafone AU. Furthermore to have a device with VoLTE Roaming Calling support, Optus advises you need a Samsung/Android Phone with Android 12 or above. ‘Optus Device Compatibility & VoLTE Roaming Activation’ — May 2024 https://www.optus.com.au/mobile/plans/international-roaming/volte Android 13 distribution April 2023 — Source: Android Authority & 9to5Google https://www.androidauthority.com/android-13-distribution-2023-3312803 https://9to5google.com/2023/04/13/android-13-market-share-stats/2803 However Android 12 was only released in late 2021 so people who have Android phones older than 2020/2021 are likely to encounter issues with either switching providers, when travelling overseas or when making calls over 4G. Devices from Android version 4 to 11 (2020) make up 69% of the Global Android Device Market as of April 2023. 4G/5G Devices without VoLTE calling support currently rely on the 2G/3G Networks to make and receive calls, this is via a technology called Circuit Switched Fallback (CSFB). Even without the blocking, once 3G the shutdown is complete many 4G & 5G phones used by Tourists will no longer be able to make calls or emergency calls in Australia either via Roaming or with a local sim card installed. Telstra & the Telcos were asked at the 3G Senate Inquiry on 24 July: “How many roaming devices are reliant on the 3G network to make or receive roaming calls or Emergency Calls?” They didn’t know that Answer and had to take it on Notice. In the answers to Telstra’s Questions on Notice from the 3G Inquiry they said that in July there were 2.3 million international roaming devices connected to their network and that Telstra ‘cannot confirm the 4G Voice calling capability of the devices’! Telstra — Answers to questions taken on notice at a public hearing on 24 July 2024 (received 1 Aug 2024) https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Rural_and_Regional_Affairs_and_Transport/3GNetworkShutdown/Additional_Documents Industry Awareness of the Problem At the April 2022 European Emergency Number Association (EENA) Conference, Dutch Telecoms Consultant Rudolf van der Berg made a presentation to the conference outlining serious issues with the current 4G calling standards and protocols. One of the major issues he raised is that many 4G Phones (both European & International) are completely unable to call (911/112) Emergency services without the presence of 2G/3G (Circuit Switched Calling) Networks. These issues were noticed following on from the 3G network shutdowns that occurred in the US around that time and he warned this will become a widespread issue as 2G/3G networks are gradually shut down across the globe. The link to his presentation on the EENA YouTube page can be found below. Mr van der Berg is from the Dutch Telecommunications Consultancy firm Stratix, he was also an Economist/Policy Analyst at the OECD and has worked for many years in the Telecom Industry. YouTube -‘EENA 2022: Access to emergency services is being impacted by the lack of VoLTE interoperability’ These issues aren’t well known to the general public however in his EENA presentation he says these issues are “Common Knowledge” in the industry and that “..there is nobody who feels responsible to fix this”. (16:45) On a slide in his presentation it says ‘telecom sector will deny [there’s a problem], be angry over 5G investment and bargain for half baked measures..’ ‘Should we stop the shutdown of 2G/3G to save lives??’ - Slide 14Rudolf van der Berg — StratixEENA 2022 https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WC16k8C1gpeFRJif23yDIuLSRg1OJOnZ/view Response from Industry Groups In response to his EENA 2022 presentation, the GSMA (one of the world's largest industry groups for the Telecom Sector) established a task force to try and address these issues. The GSMA directly referenced the EENA video in a presentation about this problem to industry last year in 2023, a link to the slide deck from that presentation is below. GSMA — ‘Additional Test Cases for IMS Emergency Calling’ — ITU-T Webinar — Wayne Cutler — 2023–06–21 https://www.itu.int/cities/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/3_Wayne-Cuttler.pdf The aim of the taskforce is to improve the standards and advocate for device manufacturers, carriers and GSMA member organisations to align their devices and networks with a unified standard. It’s worth mentioning that Telstra, Optus and TPG/Vodafone are all members of the GSMA, so they cannot pretend they had no awareness of the of these issues prior to last year and the minimal progress made to fix the problem. GSMA — ‘How we’re addressing VoLTE emergency call issues’ — 2023–05–12: https://www.gsma.com/services/blog/how-were-addressing-volte-emergency-call-issues/ This work is still ongoing and it’s still very much NOT solved globally. Major compatibility issues remain with many networks, device chipsets, handset models and different calling systems. Lack of Government Oversight with Vodafone Late January/Early February Vodafone customers started writing to the Minister complaining they lost call service on new VoLTE enabled 4G/5G Phones. FOI 24–354 — Document 25 Initially these people were told their device ‘may be malfunctioning in some way’ and to contact the manufacturer or retailer. FOI 24–354 — Document 26 FOI 24–354Pages 54 of 147 [PDF Page 42] & 66 of 147 [PDF Page 54] Furthermore, in emails released under FOI (in advance of the 3G inquiry), it was revealed that I was the only person in the entire country prior to February this year to warn the Minister and Government about the unintended consequences of switching off 3G and 4G devices being unable to make calls and Emergency Calls. (My original 6 June email to the Minster released under FOI, starts page 4) FOI 24–354Correspondence to, and responses from, the Minister for Communications relating to the shutdown of 3G networks between 27 March 2023 and 27 March 2024. On the 9th of February 2024 the Department of Infrastructure was talking to Optus regarding my 16 November ‘Optus Inquiry Submission’ which is the same day the Optus hearing was set to sit again. (The hearing was cancelled on 8 Feb due to a reported Illness with the Chair) FOI 24–352 Quarterly reports from Telstra and Optus regarding 3G network switch offs from 27 March 2023 to 27 March 2024 Seems the Department wasn’t happy with the answers from Optus and the new complaints from Vodafone customers. Then on 26 February the providers briefed the Government about the issue of 4G VoLTE enabled phones being unable to call 000. FOI 24–353 — Document 6 [FOI 24–353 — Senator Rennick 20240724] — Page 55 of 75 [PDF Page 50] https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Rural_and_Regional_Affairs_and_Transport/3GNetworkShutdown/Additional_Documents A few weeks later in March, the Minister held a press conference and announced 740,000 4G VoLTE capable phones wouldn’t be able to call 000 post shutdown. (Again that didn’t include all of the 4G/5G phones that wouldn’t be able to make any calls) YouTube — ‘3G Switch-Off Could Stop Triple-Zero Calls — 10 News First’ — 17 March 2024 (Quote at 1:45) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iK98wI6d-W0 After that press conference the messaging from the Department would change and included ‘categories’ of affected devices. MC24–001972 TPG/Vodafone’s awareness of the 4G Emergency Calling Issue Sometime between late July and August 2023 Vodafone removed a number devices from the ‘Supported VoLTE Devices’ page on the Vodafone Website. Many of these devices are able to make calls on 4G (with VoLTE) on Vodafone but not to Emergency numbers. I first noticed a number of devices were missing from the website on 31 August 2023 when registering the sim card I purchased for device testing. (The removed devices were still listed on 10 July 2023). I had suspicions a number of those devices likely had compatibility issues given when they were released. Little did I realise at the time that I just witnessed what appeared to be Vodafone hiding the problem from the public. Vodafone was not required to provide any formal quarterly reporting to the Department and Government, so it does bring into question their awareness of the scale of the compatibility issues last year, and the reasons why these devices were removed at the time without any alarms being raised for customers. Additionally a number of the devices they removed from their list are still in some cases on Telstra’s and Optus’s Support List, which means many of these potentially affected devices may still in use and circulation. In some instances the Telstra and Optus Firmware versions of those devices support Emergency Calling over 4G but not necessarily VoLTE Calling on all networks. A summary of the removed devices are below. Archived copies of the Vodafone website can be found on The Internet Archive ‘Wayback Machine’. Devices Removed from Vodafone’s Website between July-August 2023 Further note, some of the above devices will have working calling and emergency calling when used with either Telstra or Optus Network Sim Cards but when a Vodafone Sim Card is inserted the phone may continue to make calls but will lose the ability to make 4G Emergency Calls.

In the UK, carriers are only allowed to provide coverage in any given area to a phone if it is able to make an emergency call (999/112) in that area. i.e. if the phone says you have a signal, you must be able to make an emergency call. So, for a phone to actually show you as being connected to the network: a) There must be 2G/3G coverage available for a CSFB call to take place. or b) The phone must support VoLTE (including for emergency calls). Newer LTE (and 5G) spectrum deployments, like Band 20 LTE (800MHz), are being used to provide coverage in rural areas - even in places where there is no 2G/3G coverage, therefore these newer bands are often only made available to devices that support VoLTE. If you have an old phone, that doesn't support VoLTE (including for emergency calls), then it will only connect to 4G networks in areas where there is still an overlapping 2G/3G layer. This approach means that the carriers have had an incentive to make all devices support VoLTE with emergency calling. It has also been possible for the carriers to promote the 800MHz coverage as only being available on newer phones with VoLTE. Thus much of the problems that Australia is having have been avoided. Also: Data-only devices aren't included in this requirement, as they can't/don't make emergency calls. Roaming devices aren't affected (as far as I know). UK carriers support VoLTE roaming in the USA, given the lack of 2G/3G networks for CSFB. reply kalleboo 15 hours agoparent> If you have an old phone, that doesn't support VoLTE (including for emergency calls), then it will only connect to 4G networks in areas where there is still an overlapping 2G/3G layer. I guess the question is, how do they determine if a phone doesn't support VoLTE for emergency calls? That seems to be the problem in Australia, that there is no reliable way to detect it, so they're just using crude whitelists. reply michaelt 6 hours agorootparentSurely for a phone to receive calls, the provider has to know whether it supports VoLTE? How else would the carrier know how to connect the call? reply daveoc64 5 hours agorootparentThe phone would have to actively make an IMS connection to use VoLTE, so the network would know when the device connects. reply emmelaich 5 hours agorootparentprevThere are instructions on the Optus website to enable VolTE for my phone (Android Pixel). The instructions make no sense; they refer to settings which do not exist. At least as described. reply daveoc64 10 hours agorootparentprevI am not sure how they determine it, but I haven't ever seen the same level of problems reported with device support. I can't say I've ever heard of a device in the UK supporting VoLTE for regular calls, but not supporting it for emergency calls. reply usr1106 3 hours agoparentprevI would never trust VoLTE. It's a complicated beast full of compatibility issues. My phone supports VoLTE but on a recent trip through Europe it fell back to 2G for most calls. Edit: Those were ordinary calls. For emergency calls I have zero experience. The last time I made one I had other things in mind then checking my network monitor app. reply bestham 39 minutes agorootparentDue to the VoLTE end-ro-end encryption from your phone (UE) to the home operator, some countries (at least Sweden) will force downgrade inroaming users to circuit switched voice (2G/3G) in order to do lawful intercept (LI). reply patrakov 1 hour agorootparentprevHere is my experience in the Philippines: In 2022, I imported a Samsung Galaxy A02 phone from Turkey, which I bought there in a retail store. It works, but could use VoLTE with Globe or SMART, and the operators' personnel provide conflicting answers as to why. Finally, they revealed the existence of a whitelist of models. But it worked with DITO, which is a 4G-only operator, but even that is not an argument for Globe and SMART to extend their whitelist. Same for the newer POCO X4 Pro (international version) which I bought online. reply noncoml 17 hours agoparentprevMaybe I’m dumb but didn’t understand how what you said about 112 calls helps incentivize carriers reply daveoc64 17 hours agorootparentBand 20 LTE/800MHz allows the carriers to vastly increase their coverage area for a lot less money. Customers can only access that spectrum if they have a VoLTE compatible (including emergency call) device. The carriers have legally binding landmass and population coverage goals as part of the spectrum licensing terms. The carriers can also market the fact that better rural coverage is available on newer devices. Therefore the carriers have only been selling fully VoLTE compatible devices for many years and pushing as many VoLTE-enabling software updates out as possible. reply dingaling 12 hours agorootparent> Therefore the carriers have only been selling fully VoLTE compatible devices for many years However 35% of UKians bring their own phone under SIM-only contracts. When my UK carrier ( Hutchinson 3 ) was switching off 3G I had weekly scare-emails stating that my phone would no longer work. Of course it did support VoLTE and works fine, but in the background they were using a whitelist. reply thatsit 5 hours agoprevWell, i have to say that is one area where Germany actually shines. We shut off the stupid, power-hungry and slow 3G, but kept 2G as a basic service. That was a very good decision. All data comms can switch to 4G/5G, while voice comm can remain on 2G as backup. Low data rate devices can also use 2G/GPRS/EC-GSM. reply overstay8930 1 hour agoparentThis is how it worked in the US until this year. 2G can actually work pretty well along side 4G and 5G, it never really needs to be shut down since it works in the guard bands of LTE (i.e. nothing else is using the airspace 2G occupies and never will). reply usr1106 3 hours agoparentprevMost countries did it that way. reply BLKNSLVR 18 hours agoprevLast minute change, and leaving it up to the carriers. Bad to the power of bad. I tend to buy grey import handsets because they offer a better value proposition - by a long margin - than locally sold handsets. Allowing the carriers to define the block list only plays into their greedy little hands. I know that \"band 28\" support is something useful to Australians who, like me, buy handsets from overseas. The support of handsets should be based on capabilities of the device, not a seemingly arbitrary list that's under the control of the carriers.

Meanwhile, Sydney deployed an off the shelf system from Cubic at a fraction of the cost and the rollout was about as smooth as it gets. reply jaza 13 hours agorootparentSydney's rollout was definitely not smooth! NSW spent a decade (late 90s - late 00s) trying to launch the \"Tcard\", after which time they had absolutely nothing to show except wasted $$ millions. Unlike Melbourne, Sydney still had ancient paper tickets well into the 2010s, which weren't even consistent across modes of transport (destination specific \"one way / return from x to y\" single use tickets for trains, zoned \"travel ten\" tickets for buses, etc), and which often had to be paid for with exact change in coins (and which often couldn't be purchased in advance). Opal only soft launched in 2012, it wasn't actually available on all modes of transport, for all ticket types, etc, until end of 2014. reply bigger_cheese 17 hours agorootparentprevI don't live in either city, I have family who live in both Melbourne and Sydney so I travel to each city relatively frequently at least a couple of times a year. My experience was Melbourne had their system years before Sydney had Opal cards. I can distinctly remember first time using tap on/off card to get around Melbourne and thinking how much more convenient it was then needing to use Paper ticket machines Sydney had at the time. Wikipedia lists 2008 adoption for Melb vs 2012 for Syd that seems to align with my memory. So might have just been curse of them being an early adopter. reply averageRoyalty 16 hours agorootparentYou're right on timing, but it wasn't that. The entire rollout was a clusterfuck.

Hong Kong launched theirs in 1997. 11 years prior. Melbourne could have easily bought it off the shelf. Melbourne was not early by any measure reply sytringy05 13 hours agorootparentThe issue with myki wasn't the card technology, it was the fact they wanted to have standardised ticketing across the entire state. eg Tap on a bus, tram and train in Melbourne, get off in Wangaratta and tap on to a bus there.

Even if they are not trying to actively save money, they are not trying to actively make a profit so it would still be cheaper. reply jiggawatts 17 hours agorootparentprevIt's hilarious that you think the NSW Opal system is better than Myki, because compared to overseas rollouts it's still a trash fire. There's still no travel card integration with phones, the only mobile device tap that's supported are standard credit cards -- but you can't give one of those to a child because you can't restrict a credit card to only allowing travel! It also doesn't track usage properly, so you can't tell what state you're in (tapped on or off). They actually did develop a digital wallet card and matching phone app, rolled it out... to some country town... and then quietly dropped it. My completely unfounded accusation is that someone in Transport NSW was getting kickbacks from Mastercard and/or Visa and a travel card app would have stopped the pork. The Opal card project cost hundreds of millions of dollars and took way too long to deploy, so calling it a \"success\" is only in relation to even worse projects. reply tim-- 15 hours agorootparent> There's still no travel card integration with phones This is not 100% accurate. There is no card integration, but the Opal app does allow you too see pre-paid balances. It does usually show the tapped on/off status, but it may be delayed by a few hours (so it's not completely useful) especially outside of metro areas. > They actually did develop a digital wallet card Which never worked on iOS, it was Android only iirc. > the only mobile device tap that's supported are standard credit cards You can use Samsung Pay. Make the card inaccessible for normal NFC/touch payments, and only allow Samsung Pay Transit. On iOS I think you can use Express Mode? https://support.apple.com/en-gb/105079 We attempted smart card transport in NSW three times. TCard. There was another one that went bankrupt iirc. Arguably there is much greater success with Opal vs. Myki. reply robocat 12 hours agorootparentprev> because compared to overseas rollouts it's still a trash fire That's unfair because you are implicitly only comparing against successful rollouts. Having used a variety of bus systems in South America and Auckland, I can say there are plenty of shitty systems out there. I tried to use Auckland the other day and couldn't because I didn't have the required bus card. I couldn't use contactless payment from my phone and I had just arrived from overseas so no cash. I was told they don't accept cash anyway. I had to Uber instead. After dealing with crappy overseas it was eye-opening to have multiple similar problems in my own country (not just bus access) e.g. cash machines don't support contactless so I couldn't get cash - I had lost my CC) reply hilbert42 12 hours agorootparentprev\"It also doesn't track usage properly, so you can't tell what state you're in (tapped on or off).\" Right, why can't I use a NFC app (of which I've tried many) to read my Opal card's state - the balance and whether I've tapped on and off? Frankly, it's a damn nuisance. NFC apps read lots of information about the card, type manufacturer number serial number etc. but nothing that's useful like one's remaining balance. Yes, they can encrypt parts of the card to protect security but there's no need to inconvenience users by not telling them their balance. Opal is, in effect, a machine-readable only system that takes power away from users. Thus, clearly its ergonomics are unacceptable. I've also an Opal card with a crack in it which means its internal antenna wire is broken and the card won't respond to the machine. Unfortunately, it has a credit of between $60 and $70 on it and getting that recredited has been such a pain to the extent that I'll have to dissolve the plastic and reconnect the wire. Yes, the card could have been registered but why should I have to tell the government everywhere I go? Similarly, the Opal system discriminates against those with confession cards in that they're tracked by default and their cards have a louder beep on machines that informs everyone nearby that the person is traveling at a cheaper rate. In my opinion, that's unacceptable and discriminatory (if necessary a ticket inspector could determine that with his handheld reader). When I was living in Vienna several decades ago there were multiple ways to buy tickets, singles, weekly, monthly and so on. One was a card strip with multiple segments on it. You'd fold over to a blank segment (a split-second operation) and insert it in a time/route stamping machine on the bus/tram or train and that stamp was valid for an hour on any transport even if you changed mid route. One could see with just one's eyes how much credit one had left and a ticket inspector could glance at the ticket and tell in an instant whether the ticket was valid or not. Also, the route number would tell him if you'd changed your mode of transport or not (that could be useful if one's latter transport was late, which it never was—Vienna's transport system is wonderful). The ergonomics of that old-fashioned mechanical system were excellent and it worked like a dream. Much of this modern IT tech is done just for the sake of it and for the smart to make a financial killing from the gullible. And I say that as an IT professional. It really annoys me that more people don't complain about poorly designed IT infrastructure that's barely fit for purpose. Like frogs in heating water, unfortunately we can be cajoled into accepting anything with minimal effort. reply TheNewAndy 12 hours agorootparentThe opal app will do what you want.

The comments here are not immune but are admirably more interesting and thoughtful. Most online discussions about the shutdown tend to spiral into a government overreach / nanny state narrative. Not everything has to be explained in terms of big government, but claiming the problems associated with the shutdown are a symptom of government overreach is simply wrong. The industry has been allowed to do as they like for decade/s. The governmental failing here is a lack of foresight and a lack of regulation. The government (or ACMA, ideally) should have and exercise powers to hold the telcos to account, force them to pay for / execute notification campaigns over years, prove that emergency calls worked reliably in the first place, etc. reply trinsic2 2 hours agoparentYeah, this is a good point.

One thing bothers me when I go back to visit is the absurd number of speeding cameras. Never seen anything like it elsewhere on my travels. Whilst the government argues its reducing fatalities, investigative reports in the past suggested their impact was negligible. In Victoria and Queensland alone, the government nets over A$1B a year. Always feels the government is riding the public far too much. The government is arrogant and corrupt. Also the recent issue with Qantas Chairman's Lounge. A privilege tier that is invite only, and gets exclusive lounge and upgrades ahead of the most loyal paying customers, reserved for people of influence, including the Prime Minister. Qantas had prevented competition from flying routes to Australia to keep their margins high. I wonder how that anti-competitive practice went without issue? I guess because all politicians and people of material influence are getting free upgrades on the backs off those high margins and actual paying customers. reply mitthrowaway2 15 hours agorootparent> In Victoria and Queensland alone, the government nets over A$1B a year. Always feels the government is riding the public far too much. The government is arrogant and corrupt. If speeding cameras were being used to track and spy on people then that would be a serious problem, but if they're just being very effective at catching speeders, that seems fine? Speeding is a major safety problem, and one of the main problems with speeding is that enforcement is so sparse, drivers are tempted to speed knowing that they usually get away with it. reply kweks 11 hours agorootparentTaking into account the distances in Australia, I've never understood why the speed limit is so low. Australia has an average \"top speed\" of 100km/h (110km/h in certain states) - whereas many other countries, with varying degrees of better or worse infrastructure, have average \"top speed\" of 130km/h - and yet have similar traffic fatalities. Turkey: 130km/h (and fairly poor infrastructure compared to europe): 6.7 fatalities per 100k France: 130km/h (most people drive at ~145 on highways - only 1 point if you hit a radar) - 5 fatalities per 100k Australia: 100km/h - 4.5 fatalities per 100k It can't just be speed, otherwise other 'similar' countries would be orders of magnitude above Australia. reply tiew9Vii 11 hours agorootparent> It can't just be speed, otherwise other 'similar' countries would be orders of magnitude above Australia. It's not just speed. The standards of driving in Australia is terrible. There's an aggressive attitude, tail gating, no lane discipline, if someone is going way under the speed limit, you come to an overtaking lane, go to over take they'll speed up as \"you are not passing me\" etc. If you watch \"Dash Cam Owners Australia\" on YouTube half the incidents are avoidable but because \"It's my right of way\" or \"I'm in the right\" the driver will drive straight in to the incident rather than give way and avoid ignoring being “dead right” is still dead. I've driven/ridden in countries with terrible roads, no real rules, and to the average person looks like chaos but it seems to just work. The difference is non of these countries are aggressive drivers. When I moved to Australia I used to think the low national speed limits were silly.

A lot of the time they can be used to figure that out, and eliminate the need for them.

And yep, they do eventually figure out interesting tricks. This one's dumb, but an observation I noticed lately is lots of intersections will change to all red and then light the pedestrian walk light before they change the car light to green. Why?

If you let the cars light “win” then people will immediately turn right and “cut off” the pedestrian. Dunno, just a guess. My city started doing this pattern a few years ago and I am very curious about the research backing it up. It does make me feel “safer” crossing streets at busy intersections. But I’d be curious what the actual rationale says about it. reply stephen_g 14 hours agorootparentprevThat is specifically something that has happened in certain US cities, not in Australia. reply jaza 13 hours agorootparentprevSpeed cameras have been privatised in NSW, and the rumour is that the private operator is now the one deciding how many of them to install and where to put them. So, forget about all pretence of them being for road safety, they're putting in more of them purely to make money! reply JellyYelly 8 hours agorootparentDo you think speed cameras don't make people speed less, and hence roads safer? I don't really understand your point here about a private operator wanting to maximise profit here. Putting cameras in places where people are likely to speed so you can get more money would be directly correlated with being most impactful at reducing speeding. Another free market win in my mind. reply michaelt 5 hours agorootparentIn some countries, to increase public support for speed cameras, they are only installed in areas with an established history of speed-related accidents. For example, downhill sections in winding country lanes with poor visibility. The cameras are very, very clearly signposted - and project success is measured by issuing fewer tickets, as that means fewer people are speeding. So you might also install clearer signage and other traffic calming measures at the same time. On the other hand, if your aim is to maximise revenue, then project success means issuing as many tickets as possible. Installing clear speed limit signage? More profitable if we don't. Making the cameras clearly visible, so people can slow down in good time? More profitable if we don't. And if there's a wide, safe freeway with great visibility and no history of accidents? Well, that's going to be a profitable place for cameras, as people will feel safe going fast. reply dietr1ch 17 hours agoparentprevI really don't get it.

Why is this? Is it worldwide? As for the problem itself, I can understand government regulators not wanting to micro-manage the situation, but the carriers know what's on their networks, and a divide-and-conquer approach would seem capable of reducing the number of handsets to something manageable. For example, the Asus Rog phones are quite expensive, and official communication with Asus would seem enough to learn what they're capable of and what firmware upgrades may be coming. Done. In general, carriers shouldn't be blacklisting anything. If you're buying a non-carrier-branded phone, caveat emptor. But in Asus' case, at least, I expect they would try to make it right. I actually applaud the Australian government for being involved at all, as there was nary a peep from the US government and lots of people were forced to buy new phones who really didn't need them. The sin here seems to be throwing a \"plan\" together at the last minute. reply timv 13 hours agoparentIt's been more than a decade since I was involved with emergency services, but ~15 years ago there was a requirement (in Australia and elsewhere) that phones must be able to call emergency services from any available network even if the preferred carrier did not have service in that area. I assume that is still the case. That requirement forces phones to have some degree of special handling for emergency calls. It may have required (or been interpreted to require) that a phone make emergency calls over 3G if VoLTE was unavailable. I can imagine someone deciding that means \"lets just use 3G for all emergency calls\" because who ever expected a case where 4G was available and 3G was not. reply Dylan16807 13 hours agorootparent> because who ever expected a case where 4G was available and 3G was not I'd expect that to be everyone that thought about it for more than a few seconds. Both because eventual replacement was obvious and because sometimes you only have partial coverage. reply freshcupoftea 10 hours agorootparentYou may or may not be familiar with some of the use cases here in Australia. 3G coverage was more widespread and reliable for low bandwidth use cases, right up until the end. It was 4G that would have partial coverage, not 3G. 3G was often forced by IoT vendors, or routers using cellular for out of band management, due to its superior ability to penetrate through buildings. Same with ATMs, payment terminals, emergency telephones in lifts or out on the highways. People in regional areas would also force set their phones to 3G, to stop them flapping between a poor signal 4G network and the consistent, but slower, 3G network. Many DAS/Distributed Antenna Systems, essentially networks of antennas placed inisde buildings to extend cellular coverage indoors, are costly and must be approved on a per-operator basis. Some of the DAS solutions requirements I've seen to provide full coverage for Optus, Telstra and Vodafone in 4G only in a 30 story building or medium sized mall, wanted 18 full racks, 100 amp 3 phase power connectivity, 15kw minimum redudancy cooling capacity, 8 hours of battery backup for all racks and cooling, all located in the centre of the facility to minmize cable runs. As a result, high quality DAS systems don't exist in every large building or campus environment. Even in 2024, we see buildings nearing the end of construction before the developer bothers to consider an appropriate DAS system, and at that point they balk at the space and location requirements, and refuse to understand why a DAS can't just be installed in 4RU in a crammed comms room thats the size of a domestic bathroom. reply Dylan16807 8 hours agorootparent> It was 4G that would have partial coverage, not 3G. By the time 4/5G are built out well, I'd expect 3G to win some and lose some, becoming more of the latter every year.

I don't think 3G does better anywhere if you compare the same frequency. And a bunch of the frequencies are exclusive to newer protocols, aren't they? reply DCH3416 1 hour agorootparent> making 4/5G become reliable overnight? Not necessarily, it depends on how the network operators laid out their bands. In theory I suppose it could free up adjacent bands for more network capacity. > a bunch of the frequencies are exclusive to newer protocols Depends on where you are in the world. In the US the FCC has been growing out the number of available cellular bands. Cellular technologies can work on just about any frequency, given the handset supports the appropriate bands. 2G/3G tend to be a little bit more power efficient than more modern technologies as _generally_ they require less processing overhead on the handsets. However, LTE/5G do better with error correction and lower signal strength. You also get higher capacity. Stuff like GSM uses a round robin time sharing mechanism which can quickly get saturated in dense environments. 2G is _mostly_ there for legacy applications. The reason why it breaks down for this case is because a lot of older handsets negotiate 2G first before switching over to LTE, and then 5G. reply daveoc64 10 hours agoparentprev> I live in the US and have never heard of a phone that uses a different technology for emergency calls vs. normal calls. Why is this? Is it worldwide? In the GSM (2G) standard, and all of its successors, emergency calls are treated as a special case. Your phone does not simply place a regular call to 911 or other local emergency number. The pgone instead goes into a special mode where it can connect to any available carrier network to place the emergency call. It seems to be the case that some older phones didn't support placing an emergency call over VoLTE, so they just fell back to using 2G/3G when that was still available. reply the_mitsuhiko 10 hours agoparentprev> Why is this? Is it worldwide? It's part of the different mobile phone standards. Emergency calls get location information with them (AML), can be sent on other networks and without SIM card, they can be dialed on international short codes (eg: you can dial 112 in the US and 999 in the EU and it will connect regardless).

No doubt about it. But from a security perspective (which I suspect is what's driving this), I think 4/5G are better. Like many instances in security, supporting legacy devices is not a desirable outcome for the security of the network as a whole. That said, for telcos/the government to unilaterally decide that people's handsets are no longer working (with little to no notice and no financial compensation) is a bit on the nose. The correct thing would be to let customers come into store with an existing plan and handset, and give them a new phone and bill that back to the government so there's no interruption to services for them. RIP 3G, you were pretty good. reply crote 12 hours agoparentIt isn't about security, it's about spectrum. 3G wasn't designed to be forward-compatible. It expects to have a dedicated frequency band it can operate on. But spectrum is limited, and telcos really don't want to reserve something like 25% of what little spectrum they have to support a handful of legacy devices. 4G/5G support Dynamic Spectrum Sharing. This means a single frequency can be used to carry both technologies, with the ratio between them adjustable as demand varies. With DSS a 5G base station reserving a tiny fraction of transmission time for legacy 4G emergency calls would be absolutely trivial, which makes future hard shutdowns unnecessary from a technical POV. reply moomin 18 hours agoparentprevFeel like you need to read the article.

Also, there's its inept handling of spectrum management—the inappropriate deregulation of spectrum management including the outsourcing of EMR/RF interference standards/enforcement to commercial interests which has resulted in a higher RF noise spectrum background. If that were not enough there's the inept handling of the way the country deregulated the phone/telecommunications services where inept governments of both right and left persuasions sold off the government telecommunications business (Telecom Australia [previously PMG's Dept.]) to become a public corporation, aka Telstra. In the process and to maximize profits they also sold off the cableways/rights of way that effectively nuked any decent competition (Australia being such a large country that duplicating infrastructure that was put in place over the previous 130 years or so would be an enormous undertaking and cost many billions). With Telstra now controlling and monopolizing this wealth of network infrastructure contributed by many generations of Australians the competition, Vodafone and Optus, would have to duplicate the network and that cost untold billions. Governments reaped short-term monies but the poor hapless consumers paid for it many times over and are still doing so. Right, a cableways authority to share the common resource would have made much more sense. As Australian telecommunications infrastructure has a flag-fall attached, competition is in name only. And the Government is likely to repeat the fuckup as it will sell off the NBN. The NBN/National Broadband Network/fibre was (and still is) the next almighty fuckup which books could be written about. The saga is far too long and involved to detail here but resolves around whether copper or fibre should be installed in homes. Needless to say the shortsighted short-term copper approach was adopted. Again, selling off the NBN will once again repeat the cableways problem. Greedy market forces, weak-minded and gullible politicians and a lack of technical people with commonsense and nous means Australia is set to repeat these problems over and over. Now we have this latest 3G/4G fiasco. Only two days ago I found that my standby 4G phone that I use as a backup now does not work even though the Telstra account is valid and paid up well into December this year! Over the last 30 or so years Australian citizens have paid dearly for these fuckups—duplicated cableways infrastructure and such. Heavens knows how many unnecessary billions have gone into the pockets of those who've managed to twist politicians around their little fingers. For well over a century Australia has mismanaged its radio and telecommunications services to the extent that it ought to be held up to the world as an exemplar of what NOT to do. The country's ineptitude is, frankly, beyond belief. China, if you're reading this why don't you just walk straight in and take over? The country's in too much of a shambles and disorganized to resist, and on recent evidence you're much, much better at installing nationwide infrastructure than we could ever dream of. reply cmonreally123 13 hours agoparentDo the Australian citizens not vote their politicians into the role? It hardly seems the fault of the companies to not exploit the politicians weakness. Surely such weakness would allow a more capable candidate to campaign on such a platform. reply hilbert42 12 hours agorootparentI could answer that but the explanation would be long and painfully dull. I'll just refer you to graffiti once painted on a Besser block wall that surrounded a trotting course not far from where I live. To quote: The Australian people are bloody-minded sheep. It remained there for decades and no one—no even the local council—ever attempted to remove it or paint over it. Why? Because all too many know it's true. The graffiti eventually disappeared when the wall was knocked down when the trotting gave way to high-rise apartments. I always meant to take a photo of it and I'm now kicking myself that I didn't. reply sam29681749 7 hours agorootparentI suspect that's not the reason why the graffiti wasn't removed. reply jaimex2 14 hours agoprevIt's funny that if its going to affect anyone's revenue they deal with it swiftly, ie all the smart meters got a prompt upgrade.

They are, it's called VoLTE/VoNR. For whatever reason telcos add whitelist schemes to prevent phones from making voice calls, even if they actually support it. reply chii 6 hours agorootparentOne of the australian telco (Telstra) is shit - they have a custom VoLTE configuration which is often not preloaded into a grey import phone. An example would be the older xiaomi phones. These phones will not be able to make VoLTE calls on the telstra network, if they're using the optus network (which is the other telco). Therefore, it is not compliant with the legislated requirement that all phones must be able to make emergency calls on any network. By blocking it, the telcos cover their ass, at the expense of the consumer having to upgrade - even if said phone was actually possible to make work with a bit of software tweaking/upgrading. Not to mention that there's an alternative way to fix this problem - create an app to make emergency calls over data network, which would work in theory (it's only voip that isnt standardized). This is exactly what india did, with their Jio app. reply daveoc64 9 hours agoparentprevIt is a frustrating situation. I don't know exactly, but I think they prioritised the release of the LTE standard for data networks, and thought that voice could be sorted later. reply eddiewithzato 18 hours agoprev3G is prime infrastructure, it has huge range and like the article states could be used for emergency calls.

This is what the original article is mostly furious about. The way this has been implemented by at least some of the carriers is: 1. Do we sell this device AND we know you can use VoLTE to call emergency services with this: allow 2. computah says no. So the device being capable of VoLTE and/or emergency calls VoLTE is not enough. A functionally equivalent iphone might be from an IMEI prefix that was not sold by that operator and denied even tho everything would work. reply Consider applying for YC's W25 batch!

Yes, I would equally question the logic of a population who thought that was a good idea. > Most constitutional democracies recognise, one way or another, that there are limits to what can be legislated circumscribed by people's fundamental rights. Sure, it is not unusual for a population to instil safeguards to protect themselves should they become too focused on a particular issue without considering the bigger picture. Of course, the very same population can throw it all away at will. But we're still talking about a population who, even if they have forgotten the bigger picture, have enacted and maintain desire to retain laws around sodomy. What is going on there? reply foldr 8 hours agorootparentOk, you can hold to the position that no-one has a fundamental right to enjoyment of their sexual and romantic lives and that governments can pass arbitrary laws restricting sex. I will not argue with you about the validity of that position as it's a tangent. The point here is that the US and most other democracies don't work like that. Any law banning heterosexual sex would surely be struck down as unconstitutional. You, presumably, would be the lone voice in the wilderness insisting that the crazy law ought to be enforced on democratic grounds. But I suspect that you hold this position largely because it enables you to give a cute \"yes\" answer to my rhetorical question :) It's also a bit unclear what you're actually calling for here. Are you really in favor of anti-sodomy laws being enforced unless and until they are repealed? This isn't an academic question. Real people's lives would be destroyed were this to happen. reply randomdata 8 hours agorootparent> Ok, you can hold to the position that no-one has a fundamental right to enjoyment of their sexual and romantic lives I could, but why would I?

Laws are not some magical force, just agreements people have made. > Any law banning heterosexual sex would surely be struck down as unconstitutional. Only if the people are willing to uphold the constitution. It too is not some magical force, just another agreement people have made. > You, presumably, would be the lone voice in the wilderness insisting that the crazy law ought to be enforced on democratic grounds. Under a democracy, the law is to the will of the people. Why do the people of the USA want sodomy laws in the first place? You might be right that that the USA is well on its way to having a dictator who can become the lone voice who controls all, without concern for what the public wants, but that is not the current state of affairs and that individual most certainly won't be me. reply StackRanker3000 8 hours agorootparent> Under a democracy, the law is to the will of the people. Why do the people of the USA want sodomy laws in the first place? They don’t, generally. They did a long time ago, when those laws were enacted. Since then sentiments have changed, the laws have been found unconstitutional and are no longer enforced, but some remain on the books because it takes time, money and effort to remove them. I agree with you that it would be neater if they were all repealed, and it would remove the (relatively minor) threat from more extreme factions who do want to enforce them again, but at some point you also need to be pragmatic. reply randomdata 8 hours agorootparent> but some remain on the books because it takes time, money and effort to remove them. If it takes appreciable amount of time, money, and effort to no longer agree to something everyone already agrees that they no longer want to agree to, the people really need to step back and think about they they are making it so hard on themselves for no reason. Granted, we're talking about people who did agree to outlaw sodomy, so perhaps not the sharpest tools in the shed.

Hmm, I do not understand your position then. To me, if you are saying that anti-sodomy laws should be enforced on democratic grounds (which I think is what you are saying, even though you obviously don't agree with such laws yourself), then you are taking the position that people have no fundamental right to enjoy their sexual and romantic lives and that this area is fair game for arbitrary legislation. Perhaps you could clarify whether you actually do think that the US should start enforcing these laws. >Yes, technically a democracy can pass whatever arbitrary laws it wants And technically the Supreme Court can rule any law unconstitutional... reply randomdata 7 hours agorootparent> Hmm, I do not understand your position then.

If I said the sky is blue, do you think I am taking the position that nighthawks don't deserve to stay up late to see the dark night sky? I don't exactly follow your logic. Perhaps you could explain it for us? Frankly, I'm not sure why I would take a \"position\" in the first place. That seems like a pointless waste of time. reply foldr 7 hours agorootparentYour initial post in this thread naturally raises the question of whether or not anti-sodomy laws in the US should be enforced. I understand that you don't agree with such laws, but your post is open to the interpretation that you think they should nonetheless be enforced. I think it's perfectly fair to ask you whether or not that's your position. reply randomdata 7 hours agorootparent> Your initial post in this thread naturally raises the question of whether or not anti-sodomy laws in the US should be enforced. It did ask why the law wouldn't want to enforced? In other words, why would Americans have laws if they don't actually want them? I'm not of that country, so I am interested to learn about the culture. Amid the diatribe, I do think you eventually gave a reasonable answer to the question, for what it is worth. > I think it's perfectly fair to ask you whether or not that's your position. Again, I am not American, so I'm not sure it would be reasonable for me to even have a position. I don't have the necessary context. I did note that in a democracy the people get to choose what they want for themselves. But that is said simply as the generally accepted definition of democracy, like the sky is generally accepted as being blue. But, even if I were American and for some reason had a position, why would I share? Let's say, for the sake of discussion, I really do believe that people shouldn't be up in the middle of the night to see the dark sky. Why would I tell you that? It would be in bad faith to subject you to it. If relevant, I might share the fact that the sky is blue, and if based on that you also come to the conclusion that people shouldn't see the dark sky, cool, but that's for you to decide based on the known state of the world, not some evangelical nonsense sputtering out of me. There is no logical place for that. reply foldr 7 hours agorootparentIf you really just want to know why some US states have anti-sodomy laws that aren’t enforced (and that most people don’t want to enforce), then it’s a pretty simple story. The laws were made a long time ago when attitudes were different. Then the laws were all ruled unconstitutional in 2003, meaning that there hasn’t been any strong incentive to repeal them in the time since. reply randomdata 6 hours agorootparentSee, now that is a solid, logical, good faith response (if not a duplicate of what you already said earlier, and what I already acknowledged as being reasonable).

It happened/happens in other countries too; people don't care (well, they think they don't) as long as the current 'experts', who they don't believe anymore since covid, are gone. reply rsynnott 1 hour agorootparentThe Brexit \"people have had enough of experts\" stuff was long before covid; the vote, and pretty much the peak of Brexit support, was in 2016. By covid, with Brexit looming large, and some impact echoing back in time from Brexit itself (by 2020, supply problems relating to the Brexit that hadn't happened yet were just starting to appear, as companies had difficulty with long-term contracts due to uncertainty), there was some indication that people were actually falling back in love with experts a bit, but by then it was far too late, of course. I think the extremity of the resentment over covid found in the US is actually a bit of an outlier; views on the response are often more mixed elsewhere. reply Gibbon1 9 hours agorootparentprevI think of my two rules.

The political climate was similar: conservative Washington Outsiders considered to be barbarians in the gate by the political establishment. Watt pushed hard for resource development on public lands, which was an outrageously outré position at the time, with anger about it stoked by the media in a very similar way as today. As a public figure he was not charismatic. His public career ended when he said his advisory panel was diverse because it had \"a black, a woman, two Jews, and a cripple.\" It was intended to be an ironic joke, but Americans don't like that kind of joking around, not by public figures. Despite Reagan having a similar upset victory and clear mandate, he was eventually forced to let Watt go.

Kudos! I'll definitely give it a try! reply draneria 12 hours agoparentThank you! Last year there was a special breakthrough for Krita, because a contributor called Memileo figured out a way to bake light into the brushes using Blender. They made a beautiful Impasto set (https://krita-artists.org/t/rotating-light-brushtips-wip/649...), their work was a huge help for my own brushes :) reply itishappy 4 hours agorootparentMemileo's results and your own are both incredible. Wow. How baked in is the light position? I'd imagine it's possible to rotate the light in editor but not change it's height (without some work in Blender). reply draneria 3 hours agorootparentAh, you would need to ask them for a concrete answer, but my understanding is that it is completely baked in. Long optional explanation: I say that because I think Memileo sculpted the actual brushstroke in Blender (https://krita-artists.org/uploads/default/original/3X/5/7/57...) and rendered lighting at different angles, and exported each as an image. Each rendered image becomes 1 frame of the \"animated brushtip\", with the option that each frame matches \"direction\" rather then being \"incremental\", and thats how you get the faux-light! The cool thing is that you can extract and edit the animated brushtip in Krita e.g. this one \"https://github.com/Draneria/Metallics-by-Draneria_Krita-Brus...\" Which means theoretically, you could use photo editing to change the height I think! reply itishappy 3 hours agorootparentCoolest thing I've seen all day. Thanks! reply Llamamoe 6 hours agoprevSo what does it do? Create a normal map while drawing? reply draneria 4 hours agoparentOn the right track but not quite! Every brush in art software uses an image (raster or auto-generated) to paint with, called a \"brushtip\". Usually, the brushtip only gives information about which bits are opaque, and which arent - the shape! However in Krita, theres another dimension you can define; value, or lightness. So there's nothing being generated or created while drawing, its just that some very smart people have coded Krita for the \"brushtips\" to do more as a baseline. Not every software works exactly the same ofcourse! This is just my beginner level understanding of it all, I hope that helps reply short_sells_poo 4 hours agorootparentPhotoshop and other painting software had \"intelligent\" brushes for a while now.

Every year, a herd of elephants stop by his gate and leave presents - mostly bananas and coconuts.

I wonder though if generalizing to most/all animals really makes sense here. I get the sense that these kinds of stories are mostly limited to highly social and fairly intelligent animals like elephants, dolphins, and dogs. Maybe other primates as well, although IIUC they're more likely to be spiteful to some people than are e.g. dogs and elephants. reply bayindirh 5 minutes agorootparentI'd happily add birds to the list. I had a budgerigar which lived for ~12 years. She had very personal traits. For example she always sat silent until she saw my eyes open, regardless of the hour. She always knew that I was the one I opened the door and sang very happily, again regardless of the time of the day. She liked to troll me and my parents. She ate the corners of my lecture notes, esp. if I didn't pay attention to her (exam periods), flicked a single CD from the stack, grabbed and threw down, studied how it fell, and chirped at me head sideways, trying to tell \"look, I did something\". I could write tons and tons of things where she was very aware of my emotions and responded to it, or communicated with my parents in their own way. So, I don't think it's limited only to \"more complex\" animals like dolphins, dogs, and elephants. Cats and birds (oh, look at cockatoos, crows magpies, etc.) are also in that group as well. Cockatoos raid trash bins and find ways to open even the blocked ones if their strength allows. Lastly, here's a parrot which trolls its owner and laughs about what it did!

And human brains/minds are without doubt even more complex than those of dogs. But it is typical for humans to not be aware of the true reasons of behaving or even feeling in the way they do. When asked about causes of our behavior, we readily make up an explanation, and we believe our own explanations completely whether they are true or false. There is a considerable literature demonstrating in an experimental setting how easily the behavior is controlled by the factors that are not consciously perceived, and how it is rationalized post factum in plausible but arbitrary ways. More informally, many fiction writers show characters, for example falling in love and showing that through their behavior, but refusing to admit that they are in love, even when explicitly confronted with the facts. Of course one can say that an adult human can at least in principle, sometimes, examine what is going on, while a dog is probably much less capable of such complex analysis and is more like a small child.

Once a friend of our dog came visiting, grabbed his favorite stuffy and happily chewed it in the yard. Which our dog clearly resented. So he cleaned up the yard and hid all other toys in the house. Usually that's our job - he never bothers to look after his toys. Then he came out with an old tennis ball, pranced around, played with it, like \"Dude, this is the BEST toy EVER invented. An it's mine.\" His friend dropped the coveted stuffy and came over to investigate... our dog dropped the ball, grabbed the stuffy and hid it in the house. His friend was left with a slimy, boring ball. I really can't think of any other explanation - he knew how to get his stuffy, but also anticipated this trick wouldn't work twice. So the cleanup in advance. reply generuso 8 minutes agorootparentThat is a rare level of cunning! A simpler, somewhat common version is when one dog pretends that there is something interesting outside, so that the other dog would drop the toy and would run to the window hoping to bark at the mailman, while the trickster picks up the left behind toy. Some dogs actually learn to see through this ruse. It can be very amusing to watch them darting instinctively, then suddenly realizing what is about to happen, returning back to pick up the toy and only then going to the window more leisurely. reply leftbit 1 hour agorootparentprevYes, that was clever.

Snail shells mostly spiral to the right (90% IIRC, about the same as right handedness in humans) but in areas where lateralised predators are very common left-handed snails have a much higher presence, up to 30%. reply fragmede 5 hours agorootparentMolecules have a handed-ness. everything from there on up is doomed to have that problem somewhere. reply dahart 3 hours agorootparentWhy, what makes you think there’s any connection? Molecule handedness doesn’t affect animal handedness, they are completely independent things with completely independent mechanisms, and the materials in between animal and molecule (shell, bone, skin, nerves, vasculature, etc.) don’t have any known handedness. We already know that not everything has that problem. reply aziaziazi 5 minutes agorootparentI think they just see asymmetry as a parent of handednes.

The submitted title is also part of the original title anyway. A lot of publications have a less clickbaity version as a subtitle that is meant to work equally well as a title, and it's pretty common on HN submissions to see people submit that other title because it usually represents the content better. That's pretty clearly what happened here. reply ChrisArchitect 3 hours agorootparentLess clickbaity, sure, but it doesn't say elephant. Title was changed after submission. Nobody had any problem with it when it was submitted 3 days ago. reply lolinder 3 hours agorootparentNobody saw it when it was submitted 3 days ago, most likely because the title smelled of pop sci clickbait and didn't get up votes.

It's always fun to watch them play. You can start to think that animals are always optimizing the time they spend being active and are carefully preserving their energy in order to survive, but then you see some birds going sledding (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn0OjCneVUg) and it's clear that they're just in it for the fun. reply Jarmsy 8 hours agorootparentThis summer I spent an hour watching a pair of magpies harass a fox. The fox was trying to sunbathe, but the magpies kept dive-bombing it, pecking its tail, and landing in front of it then flying away just as the fox went for them, all while making a chattering sound that seemed a lot like laughter. I've heard theories that they do this as revenge for stolen eggs, or to chase foxes away from their nests, but this was in an open patch of ground far from where they nest and it really looked to me that they were just teasing it for fun. reply bayindirh 7 hours agorootparentThey may know that particular fox. Crows can identify singular persons, hold grudge against them and disseminate the information around to make sure that particular person has a hard time [0]. Magpies are also very smart birds, aggressively protecting their nests and offspring from cats and other threats. So they may have identified that fox somewhere else.

It looks equally plausible that the crow is trying to break open the object, possibly in search of food. reply HPsquared 10 hours agoparentprevOf course, animals are conscious and enjoy things and feel pain too. Just less intelligent and with less language ability than humans. Chimps and dogs certainly understand humour. I wouldn't be surprised if elephants do too, being social creatures. reply thanksgiving 8 hours agorootparentI think it is also important to note here that apparently not all humans understand humor either or understand it differently or something. reply roenxi 6 hours agorootparentHumour often involves saying something that isn't true (why don't ants catch colds? Because of they have anty bodies - great joke but not true on a number of levels). A surprising number of humans don't have the mental cycles available to consider counterfactuals, hypotheticals or entertain ideas that aren't directly rooted in reality. I suspect that means they can't process humour and they just laugh if the crowd is. It goes beyond humour, you can see it in a lot of scenarios and it ruins politics. There are people who appear literally unable to consider hypothetical scenarios. Not in a nasty way, they're sometimes wonderful people to have on hand. They simply only deal in reality as they see it. You can walk them slowly through a \"and what if ... happens?\" and they can't do it. reply bongodongobob 21 minutes agorootparentI once dated someone who couldn't consider hypotheticals or how they could be used as a reasoning tool. Disagreements were the most frustrating thing ever because I couldn't play devils advocate or steelman. She thought I was agreeing with her intermittently to make her mad. She had no concept of walking in someone else's shoes or arguing a position you don't actually hold. It blew my mind. reply berkes 5 hours agorootparentprev(Human) Humor is a far broader spectrum than you describe here too. It can range from \"ROFTL because someone accidentally stepped in poop\" to deeply layered liguistic jokes like you describe. reply leftbit 51 minutes agorootparentOne aspect of humor depends on cognitive flexibility. Puns work that way. So if you're not able to make the right mental context switch at the right moment, you won't get the joke. reply socksy 5 hours agorootparentprevJust because you don’t understand the Germans’ humour doesn’t mean that it doesn’t exist ;) reply leftbit 1 hour agorootparentprevIt's difficult to reason about intelligence in this context. Human intelligence is defined by behavior we humans value. Intelligence tests are geared to measuring these aspects. Intelligence tests devised by animals would look totally different - and it's quite thinkable humans wouldn't do too well taking them. Wouldn't assume that animals have less language ability than we humans, unless we totally figured out what other species are really talking about.

Animals (and humans) evolved play because it has evolutionary benefits, but the immediate reward for play must be fun. reply RandomThoughts3 7 hours agorootparent> Animals (and humans) evolved play because it has evolutionary benefits I know the turn of phrase is popular even amongst biologists but I still think it’s weird to put it this way. Evolution is a dynamic feedback loop on a multi-generational time scale. Plenty of neutral things can be transmitted for a long time without being culled out by evolutionary pressure and social behaviour can remain for a long time without being genetic at all. reply bbarnett 7 hours agorootparentPlay has a purpose, it hones reflexes, teaches youth about concealment, traps, ambushes, what their bodies can do, whether running away works in a scenario or fighting is better. It also shows who is best to lead a fight. Play much like curiosity, makes you able to navigate your environment. It very much has extreme usefulness. reply smogcutter 4 hours agorootparentSure, maybe, but if you tried you could come up with a similar explanation for literally any behavior or emotion.

We cannot detect it directly. If there were consciousness in the world that was significantly different to our own then we likely would be ignorant of it. reply FeepingCreature 4 hours agorootparentWe do know that human consciousness has something to do with the networks of neurons in our brains. We know this because we can poke specific parts of it and manipulate specific aspects of our consciousness: we can observe a fairly direct correspondence between conscious experience and biological substrate. reply eszed 3 hours agorootparentTo play devil's advocate: have a look at the way plants in a forest communicate with each other - even across different species! That's a complex network, in which individual plants could be analogized to neurons. Do I think forests are conscious in the same way that we are? No. I do think \"consciousness\" is not a binary, and that we have poor tools and insufficiently-developed models for understanding it. reply NoMoreNicksLeft 58 minutes agorootparentprev> We have no evidence that plants have consciousness, but then our only evidence that even other humans have consciousness is that they are somewhat similar to ourselves. I don't have evidence I have consciousness. You assume you have it, but if you didn't what would really change? It's a made up word and the semantic value of the sentence \"I have consciousness\" is something like \"I am special\". Can you define consciousness in an objective way such that, were I to not have consciousness anything would be different for me?

Any emotion you have, they have. It's a Victorian era misconception that humans are somehow a unique species with all these wonderful properties and animals are dumb. reply gwd 9 hours agorootparent> Victorian era misnomer Isn't this exactly the opposite? Read Aristotle or Aquinas and they have all kinds of definitions about why humans are fundamentally different in nature than animals; and Darwin, whose work made it much more palpable to believe that humans were just another kind of animal, did his work smack in the middle of the Victorian era. reply Etheryte 9 hours agorootparentI think that largely depends on how you look at it. As with any topic, Greek philosophers had widely different opinions across schools of thought and generations. Many highlighted rational thinking as the line between humans and animals, while still thinking animals intelligent and emotional. I do agree with your point on Darwin, but why that point works is exactly because his work contrasted with the rest of his peers. His work was also far from being widely accepted at first, and was met with heavy skepticism on many, if not most fronts. It was only later that this became a widely accepted part of science. reply gwd 9 hours agorootparentOK, I think I see what you meant: Not that the \"misnomer\" arose in the Victorian era, but that the Victorian era was the last era in which you would expect to encounter this \"misnomer\". As a counterpoint, I recommend reading Everlasting Man, by G. K. Chesterton. If humans are just animals, they're the most bizarre animal we've ever seen. reply card_zero 9 hours agorootparentprevJeremy Bentham popularized animal rights before the Victorian era. His well-known line was \"The question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?\". This was at the same time part of an argument against (human) slavery. \"The French have already discovered that the blackness of the skin is no reason a human being should be abandoned without redress to the caprice of a tormentor. It may one day come to be recognised that the number of the legs ...\" Quite apart from the suffering being a supposition (essentially based on the \"duck test\"), this leaves unaddressed the question of why the ability to suffer should confer rights. Elsewhere he makes the point that adult animals have more morality than similarly aged humans (toddlers), which is at least in the same ballpark as the idea of rights. But I don't think we even know why we grant creatures rights. reply guappa 8 hours agorootparentAncient romans were already conscious about not killing species off to not make them extinct. reply randomcarbloke 9 hours agorootparentpreva misnomer is a failure in naming ie peanuts, koala bear, etc. I think you mean misconception. reply Etheryte 9 hours agorootparentThanks for denomering my misnomer misconception.

Yes, that Jekyll! Hugo gives you more rope to shoot yourself in the foot with. MkDocs or Docusaurus for documentation. MdBook is not in the running, IMO, unless it’s radically improved since the last time I checked. And here’s my hot take—most generators have a lot of the same design flaws. Routing is generally a mistake—you should instead design a system where every page has a URL that directly corresponds to the source file path, if feasible. Shortcodes are a mistake—you should use custom HTML tags. SSGs should have e.g. S3+Cloudfront as a core part of their design rather than just thinking of S3 as a place you put files when you’re done. reply TechDebtDevin 15 hours agorootparentI think OP is just referring to any SSG + CDN + S3, they probably just use AWS so its how they refer to it. I don't disagree. On another note, I really like the way Cloudfront describes their \"edge\" offerings without having very annoying and obtuse usages of the word \"edge\": \"Reduce latency by delivering data through 600+ globally dispersed Points of Presence (PoPs) with automated network mapping and intelligent routing.\" This might be the first time I've seen anything on an AWS explained concisely and precisely /s (sorta). reply rapnie 10 hours agorootparentprevRegarding MkDocs there's the great Material for MkDocs [0] for documentation.

You should consider the people who deploy to systems like S3+Cloudfront when designing your static site generator. Too many systems are just designed to be served from the filesystem and there are rough edges when you deploy to something like S3. And “design for S3+Cloudfront” does not mean the same thing as “design it so that people without S3+Cloudfront are screwed”. That’s some kind of extrapolation. The main relevant difference between e.g. S3 and a filesystem is that you can (and probably should) deploy pages to paths like /blog/hello/ rather than /blog/hello/index.html. There are other differences—it gets somewhat pervasive, unfortunately. There are hacks and workarounds but it would be nice if the SSGs were designed with cloud storage in mind as one of the core features, rather than an afterthought. (It may seem funny that I keep saying “e.g.” but that’s because I’m not talking about S3 specifically, but speaking about a broader class of storage systems.) reply shepherdjerred 13 hours agoparentprevhttps://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/ reply greggsy 20 hours agoparentprevVitePress and Docusaurus seem decent.

Looking up the 2023 patent filer leads to this: https://www.addmangroup.com/ atrettel 20 hours agoThis comment is not legal advice. This comment is merely for educational purposes. The quote that you have about the 1997 patent, namely \"U.S. Pat. No. 5,659,925 teaches a process for adjusting the deposition rate...\" is from the specification. That is written by either the inventors or more likely the attorneys filing the application. The specification is not legally enforceable or binding. It is supposed to disclose enough information to let somebody reproduce the claimed invention. As a matter of practice, the specification can say almost anything it wants, including non-enforceable things. Only the claims are legally enforceable. I suggest taking a closer look at the claims and seeing if these are problematic for your application or not. You may want to consult an attorney if you have further questions. You can look up the patent examiner's reasoning for allowing the application here: https://patentcenter.uspto.gov/applications/17667081 Click on \"Documents and Transactions\" and look for \"Notice of Allowance and Fees Due\". Also look for the \"Non-Final Rejection\" for additional information from the examiner from an earlier version of the application. I should note that it does not appear that the patent examiner considered the 1997 patent directly relevant because they did not cite it in any of the office actions or specifically the PTO-892 forms (search the documents page for 892 to see what I'm talking about). However, they likely did at least look at it since it is listed in the specification. Again, if you have further questions, you really should consult an attorney. This is not a good forum for this kind of discussion, in my opinion. reply schiffern 16 hours agoparent> The quote that you have about the 1997 patent, namely \"U.S. Pat.

First of all, I'm not a lawyer. I'm a mechanical engineer. And to answer your question, yes, many attorneys are in fact worried about giving legal advice online [1], especially the fact that it may imply some sort of legal representation being extended. This is why I added the disclaimer at the top and why I emphasized that this is not the right forum for this and that the original poster should in fact get an attorney (which strongly implies that I am not their attorney). This is also why I did not discuss the specifics of the claims being made in the different patents, because that could imply that I am giving specific legal advice. I am not giving any legal advice. Instead, I just discussed broadly how the patent system works in this particular context, especially in regards to what parts of a patent are legally enforceable and how examiners examine patents (and how you can look up what they did).

But you're not, so why the disclaimer? Is there some legal jeopardy a non-lawyer places themselves in by talking about the law? If so that sounds positively dystopian. More generally I am entirely supportive of not giving unsolicited advice of any sort. Not for legal reasons, but because it's presumptuous, rude, and often even pompous. reply wyan 7 hours agorootparentIt is usually illegal to give legal advice or represent someone without being a lawyer, so this disclaimer is meant to protect yourself against claims that you're doing so. I think. reply pessimizer 5 hours agorootparent> It is usually illegal to give legal advice or represent someone without being a lawyer This is not true. It is usually illegal to give someone the impression that you are a lawyer when you are giving legal advice (it is fraud.) So careful people lead by making sure that no one has the impression that they are a lawyer when they are giving legal advice, and lawyers who are just talking off the top of their head and not being paid warn you that they are not giving you advice as a lawyer (i.e. they are not working at this moment as a lawyer.) People who are not lawyers give each other legal advice all the time. It's a good thing if the advice is good, and a bad thing if the advice is bad, but not a crime. reply MKRhere 11 hours agorootparentprevI believe atrettel wanted to be transparent about the nature of their reply more than protecting themselves from jeopardy.

I did some experiments with bricklaying using a macro in S3D and in all honesty it’s not worth it. It doesn’t work all the time causes a lot of slicing edge cases on complex models and the cost in print time outweighs any strength gains. For properly dried filament and a heated chamber the adhesion gains are within the margin of error. I can also quite confidently say stratasys also currently does not implements it in GrabCAD* which is their slicers/CAM software and I’m not aware of any of their partner slicers/CAMs that do it either. *There is a chance that they do it as a post processing step in their printers especially the super high end ones either globally or for select locations within the model but I’ve handled quite a few FDM prints on Stratasys machines and I’ve never actually seen it in a production model. reply manuel_w 21 hours agoprevThis post seems very well researched. It's great that OP has brought this up. If we could push further the state of the art in 3D printing, by simply no longer adhering to an (now proven to be invalid) patent, it's a no-brainer to do so. reply tostr 8 hours agoprevSince you wrote > [...] is a significant limiting factor for the structural integrity of 3d printed parts I went and checked. There is a youtube called MyTechFun[0] who does proper material testing, and being a patreon I have access to the entire table of his results. The comparison I made is tensile strength vs layer adhesion, which is the same test (basically pull until it breaks), but the sample is printed lying down or standing up. I expressed layer adhesion as a percentage of tensile strength, and sorted by this. The best three I will show here (tensile and adhesion are in kg): Name, Tensile, Adhesion, Percentage YXPolyer Nylon[1], 63.1, 66.4, 105 PolyMaker PLA Pro[2], 56.55, 50.6, 89 PolyMaker CoPA[3], 66.3, 56.6, 85 While the tensile strength is higher for all (except one), it does not seem to be quite as limiting a factor as your claim makes it out to be. We can find percentages of >70% for all major filament types. But to be fair, most of them seem to cluster around 40-50%. While this is not great, given the choice of materials I think it can be worked around quite easily.

If the slicer can be modded to include this feature then there's nothing stopping people from using it. I'm not sure if just adding the feature in slicers would violate the patent, or using the feature commercially. Also, if you're printing commercially, I would just go ahead and violate the patent. They are not going to find out, and if they do then just stop using the feature or negotiate a license for the patent. reply ChrisArchitect 21 hours agoprevSome related discussion in here: Why did consumer 3D printing take so long to be invented? https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42079086 reply LordHeini 11 hours agoprevApart from the patent issues. There has been some tinkering with this technique in the community. From what I could gather this sort of bricklayer interlocking does basically nothing to help part strength. And you can not do it on the outside walls because they would not be smooth. Which means you would need to transition half way in the wall from stacked to interlocked which is possible but needs a very well tuned printer laying lines a fraction of the nozzle diameter. All in all does not look like it's worth the effort. reply Andrew_Russell 18 hours agoprevI'm an attorney who litigates patents. I also write about IP litigation at https://ipde.com. A patent can be invalidated by a court during litigation or through procedures at the U.S. Patent Office, such as inter partes review or an ex partes reexamination. When asking whether an earlier patent renders a later patent invalid, the fact finder will generally look at anticipation and obviousness. Anticipation means that every element of the claims is literally present (explicitly or inherently) in the earlier patent, under 35 U.S.C. § 102. Obviousness means that the claimed invention as a whole would have been obvious to a person of skill in the art, under 35 U.S.C. § 103. How do you figure that out? You have to look at each claim individually. If the fact finder determines that the earlier patent discloses or renders obvious every element of the claim, then the claim is invalid. This comparison is easier said than done, because it is going to depend on claim construction, meaning how the claims are interpreted. In theory, they are interpreted according to how a person of skill in the art would read them, but in practice there is an art to claim construction, and it can be difficult for anyone to predict how a Court or the U.S. Patent Office will construe claims (especially since it is often judge- or examiner-dependent). I won't get further into burdens of proof and legal standards, but both anticipation and obviousness tend to be a high bar. From a very quick review of the two patents you posted, it looks like claim 1 the second patent claims, for example, \"lowering the vertical axis of the bead height of a bead disposed between a bead on either side thereof.\" From a quick look at the specification, this may refer to staggering the vertical size of the beads themselves in each row. It looks like the earlier patent discloses staggering the alignment of the columns of beads, but I don't see (from a quick glance) whether or not it discloses staggering the size of the beads. If it doesn't disclose that element of claim 1 (however the court or PTO interprets it), then it can't anticipate that claim of the second patent. Of course, it could still render it obvious if, for example, there is another prior art patent that discloses varying the beads in the claimed way, and if a person of skill in the art would have been motivated to combine them (assuming the combination also meets all of the other elements). Each claim in the second patent will need to be looked at individually. Even if claim 1 were invalid, for example, other independent claims may not be. Keep in mind that everything in this post is hypothetical and I am not your attorney. If you want to try to invalidate the patent, you'll need to get your own attorney involved or otherwise get one to take up the cause, including to take a real look at the patents and prior art and to figure out how best to proceed. It is not a small task. reply fragmede 18 hours agoparentNor would I assume, cheap. If the community wanted to fundraise to get the patent invalidated, what sort of money are we talking about? How much if they decide to contest the invalidation? $10,000,? $100,000? $1,000,000? I'm sure it depends on a lot of factors, but getting an idea of how many zeros we're talking about would be useful. reply Andrew_Russell 18 hours agorootparentAgain speaking generally, attempting to invalidate a patent is going to cost more than $10k, but $100k should be enough to do an ex partes review petition. If you want to do inter partes review, which is much more involved but may also have a higher chance of success, it's more expensive. The total cost will depend on what attorneys you use and how they go about it (which also impacts the likelihood of success). reply robomartin 3 hours agoparentprev> 35 U.S.C. § 102. Obviousness means that the claimed invention as a whole would have been obvious to a person of skill in the art, under 35 U.S.C. § 103. This is the part that always gets me. Having read through over a couple thousand patents, it is my opinion that the vast majority of them are obvious to anyone skilled in the art. Some of them are so ridiculous that a university student about to finish a relevant degree would consider the claims obvious. This bothers me deeply because patents that should not have been granted force us to play a patent arms race. If the other side has an axe, you have to have an equal or better axe...and it gets nastier from there. In some industry sectors you'd be crazy to put out a product without ensuring you have enough legal weapons of IP war to protect yourself from other IP as well as slow down or eliminate copy cats and competitors who will gladly take advantage your your \"R\" (Research) at zero cost. In \"R&D\" the \"R\" is usually the most expensive phase. Once you know what you are building the \"D\" tends to be simpler, shorter and costs significantly less. It stands to reason that getting a patent should become more and more difficult over time. As more is invented the \"art\" and those skilled in it become more sophisticated. Which means the rate of true invention should (not fake invention) should come down to an asymptotic level. We should see less true patents per year, not more fluff patents per year. reply realityloop 21 hours agoprevI’m not sure but this may be of interest to the Electronic Frontier Foundation https://www.eff.org/pages/legal-cases reply robomartin 3 hours agoprevThe only thing that matters are the claims. You have to read and analyze them in order to understand where the legal IP fence is being built. If you are not used to reading and dissecting patents the claims can be difficult to understand. reply giantg2 21 hours agoprevCan't you request a separate patent if you're making substantial improvements to it? No idea if that's what happened here, but I'm just saying it's not surprising that a new patent would reference old patents. I assume that for most things the current tech is durable enough. If it needs to be more durable, going with cast, forged, or even mim metal instead of geometry changes would be better. If you really want geometry stuff, just design one yourself. Use three nozzles - a primary vertical down, two trailing secondaries opposing each other on slightly doward angles and slightly above the primary. Put all the nozzles on the same head but with steppers driving eccentrics to adjust height for each nozzle for areas where only a combination or single nozzle can be used. You'll effectively build a three layered wall with offset layers. Simultaneous printing allows better adhesion by row, and the staggered design provides increased interconnectivity between each strand. reply arghwhat 18 hours agoparentThe purpose of mentioning the older patents is to argue that they are not relevant as prior art. Whether that is true is another story. reply giantg2 21 hours agoprevCan't you request a separate patent if you're making substantial improvements to it? No idea if that's what happened here, but I'm just saying it's not surprising that a new patent would reference old patents. Edit: sorry, seems to be a dupe. reply realityloop 21 hours agoparentI think the issue is that there doesn’t appear to be anything substantially different in the newer patent this YouTube video covers it pretty well https://youtu.be/9IdNA_hWiyE reply K0balt 18 hours agoprev [–] disclaimer, I am not an expert in patent litigation but have been involved in and hold several patents) also, hold my beer and watch this. Having read the claims on both patents (US2023/11813789B2, US1997/5653925A) , it still seems pretty sus to me on both sides of the fence. The basic concept of of the geometric layer pattern is identical in the claims and illustrations in both patents, but the expired patent mentions this in the context of \"density\" and \"porosity\", while the newer patent describes the identical process for for the effect of interlayer adhesion. This -might- be enough to make a meaningful distinction. The new patent fills in a little bit more detail on the process, and is much more narrow in scope. But...the expired patent claims -do- specifically mention strength in terms of density in claim 6: \"the pressurizing Supply source is adjusted to provide a porosity in the article of between 1% and 9%, so as to form an article of a strength sufficient to maintain the integrity of the article.\" Claim 6 refers to claim 3 which refers back to the primary claim of modifying density through the feed pressure and geometric distribution (specifically brick-like, as depicted in figure 2 - preferred embodiment) deposition of the filament. In all, it is surprising to me that the patent was granted as is. I have had filings rejected for much weaker similarities to existing art when basing a patent on new applications of existing processes... and this is arguably not even a new application. The described process (hexagonal or brick-like bead geometry) is identical to the process shown in figure 2 of the expired patent and described in the preferred embodiment. What is missing from the expired patent is a specific claim on the geometry of the preferred embodiment given in figure 2. This could be construed in a sense to say that the preferred embodiment itself was not the subject of the patent, i guess? In any rate, the 2023 patent clearly does not describe any actual innovation, but rather an attempt to lock down a competitive advantage by locking everyone else out of an invention that has been clearly documented since 1997 and released into the public domain for 6 years prior to this patent. Although the patent holder appears to be using the patent in a proprietary, in house process, this still smacks a bit of troll dung. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that there was exactly zero innovation here, and the patent applicant was clearly aware of the prior art, perhaps even being inspired by ambitious nonspecificity of the expired patent. His figures 1 and 2 (the primary basis of the new patent) could just have well been lifted directly from the Stratasys patent. This might be one for the courts. What we need is someanon to fork slic3r with this feature added and dump it on torrent. reply AnimalMuppet 17 hours agoparent [–] So there's two uses for patents. One is to keep others from doing what you're doing. The second is to keep anyone else from getting a patent on it, and then using it to keep you from doing what you're doing. This could be (currently) used in the second way. (\"Defensive\" patent, as it is sometimes called.) The problem is that patents can change hands, and in the hands of a troll, this patent could be a problem. reply K0balt 14 hours agorootparent [–] That would certainly be a less clown-world explanation.

One example: on Windows, vscode changed the behavior of scroll bars -- something that has been a standard since the mid-80s. They changed the paging behavior and removed the end buttons. Unbelievable. reply simonask 8 hours agorootparentEnd buttons on scroll bars are a remnant from when scrolling was new. macOS has done away with them entirely. It's been decades since I interacted with one, so no, I don't miss them at all. So, I'm not denying that the situation on Windows is inconsistent when you factor in UIs that Microsoft is trying desperately to update, but the design language around scrolling in modern UIs just doesn't seem to be a real problem (outside of accessibility, obviously, which needs special attention regardless). reply ryandrake 3 hours agorootparent> design language around scrolling in modern UIs just doesn't seem to be a real problem (outside of accessibility, obviously, which needs special attention regardless) This is another difference between the mentality today vs. the mentality back then. Accessibility should not need \"special\" attention. It should be baked into the product. Enough users lack the ability to comfortably drag while clicking, that you don't want to first release a product that doesn't work for them, and then later fix it as a bug. You need to consider Accessibility from day one, during the early design. Just like you need to consider security vulnerabilities and user privacy from day one. They're not things that get tacked on at the end. But this example isn't even about considering Accessibility holistically. The devs just flat out -removed- the scroll end caps from the product! This wasn't an oversight or some UX over-eager designer accidentally going overboard. They deliberately went out of their way to remove a standard control. reply phendrenad2 4 hours agorootparentprevI use Edge as my browser, but I think Chrome is the same: The scrollbar is hidden while I'm not scrolling.

When it's just a solid gray there's very little to distinguish it from the content, and it doesn't help readability if the bar is meant to show what proportion of the whole document you're viewing. As much as some people hated it, going back further to winxp where they had color in the UI made contrast better again (and you could customize the theme in the win3.x/9x windows), or third party themes if you were prepared to lightly mess with OS files. reply saw-lau 4 hours agorootparentprevAnd on top of all that is the terrible (IMHO) UX design pattern of getting rid of Apply/Cancel buttons, particularly in settings panes. reply simonask 8 hours agorootparentprevIt's kind of hard to tell how real your problems are without knowing which environment you are talking about, but it would be helpful to know where you have encountered these problems.

Modern OS UIs might be visually rich and feature-packed, but this definitely came at the cost of clarity and efficiency.

WalterAFD Welcome to the Antarctic Fire Department The Antarctic Fire Department is proudly supporting the advancement of world science through fire/rescue support services on the highest, driest, windiest, coldest, and ultimately harshest continent on the planet - Antarctica. Based on Ross Island, the AFD provides the United States Antarctic Program with professional emergency services at McMurdo Station, Amundsen-Scott Station, and the United States Air Force airfields. Antarctic Fire operations are performed where the most extreme environmental conditions on earth exist - south of 60° lattitude. With the extreme temperatures and working conditions, it takes a special person to work in the Antarctic environment as a firefighter. As such, the AFD prides itself on having the most diverse, dedicated, and resilient personnel of any fire department in the world. Photo by: Isaiah WalterAFD The department offers the unique opportunity to go where few people have gone before, or ever will go. Antarctica is one of the few places on earth that remain unscathed from permanent human population/presence and wields a serene beauty that is beyond words. Working in Antarctica is challenging, but ultimately rewarding as well. While deployed, firefighters learn vital skills that educate and protect them from the Antarctic environment and also help them understand and preserve the pristine eco-system they work around. Employment opportunities include short and long-term positions ranging from Firefighter/EMT to Firefighter/Medic, line Lieutenant, Shift Captain, and Emergency Dispatcher. We welcome and invite you to look around and learn more about Antarctica, the department, life on \"the ice,\" and the opportunity of a lifetime that awaits you. homeabout usoperationsantarctic lifejob opportunitiescontact us Website designed by White Wonder StudiosPowered by Sun City Networks This website is not an official NSF, USAP, or Lockheed Martin ASC site.

Since there is a reasonable chance that a house fire is caused by a cat arsonist, it only makes sense to take the cat-sized oxygen mask. They don't want the culprits deceased if they are to interrogate them. There are two grains of truth in the above tall tale, the fire service do carry oxygen masks for cats and cats do start fires from walking on hob buttons.

    "originBody": "Your Standing Desk Might Actually Be as Bad as Sitting All Day HEALTH 03 November 2024 ByJESS COCKERILL (martin-dm/Getty Images) In recent years, standing has been touted as a remedy to a sedentary lifestyle, especially for desk workers who spend long hours seated at their screens. But a new study from researchers in Australia and the Netherlands has found standing for long periods of time might not be much better than sitting after all – and actually comes with its own life-threatening risks. Just under seven years of data from 83,013 adults were collected as part of the UK Biobank, using wrist-worn devices to track their activity, sleep, and sedentary time. The amount of time individuals spent standing and sitting was matched with incidences of cardiovascular diseases – coronary heart disease, heart failure and stroke – as well as circulatory diseases – low blood pressure on standing, varicose veins, chronic venous insufficiency, and venous ulcers. The researchers found no association between time spent standing and the risk of cardiovascular disease, suggesting standing desks and similar work postures might not be enough to stave off the health problems associated with sitting around. University of Sydney population health scientist Matthew Ahmadi suggests this might be because many studies in support of standing were based on 'soft endpoints' like improved blood pressure, insulin sensitivity, and triglyceride levels. His team's investigation, on the other hand, focused on 'hard clinical endpoints' – hospitalizations or death from these diseases – and found that whether people were seated or standing for the long periods of time they spent stationary didn't really make a difference to cardiovascular outcomes. \"More time spent sitting didn't necessarily lower a person's risk of cardiovascular disease, nor did it increase the risk,\" Ahmadi says. \"It was a null finding. But what it did do was actually increase their risk of circulatory diseases.\" Standing for more than two hours a day increased that risk by 11 percent for every extra half hour, which is bad news for retail workers and the standing desk industry. Not that sitting is much better either: beyond 10 hours of daily sitting time, every extra hour spent on your butt increased circulatory disease risk by 26 percent. This suggests that a lack of walking or other movement while either sitting or standing could be driving the risk of orthostatic circulatory disease, the authors write. Though the study's sample size is unrivaled, it's worth noting that as an observational study the research can't prove that standing or sitting cause any of these diseases. It does, however, add to the avalanche of research on the importance of moving your body. Ahmadi says the real take-home from this research is that standing, by itself, should not be considered a cure-all for the ailments of sedentary, seat-bound lifestyles. \"Standing needs to be mixed in with other forms of activity that gets the body moving,\" he says. \"We're not seeing the risk of orthostatic diseases… when someone's walking around. We're seeing it mainly when they're standing stationary, standing still, because you get that blood pooling in the lower extremities.\" This research was published in the International Journal of Epidemiology.",

    "commentBody": "Standing desk might be as bad as sitting all day (sciencealert.com)147 points by zdw 17 hours agohidepastfavorite206 comments tzs 16 hours agoHere's an article [1] from a few years ago from Cornell ergonomics researchers that is still relevant the discusses the pluses and minuses of both sitting and standing desks. Here is their recommendation: > Sit to do computer work. Sit using a height-adjustable, downward titling keyboard tray for the best work posture, then every 20 minutes stand for 8 minutes AND MOVE for 2 minutes. The absolute time isn’t critical but about every 20-30 minutes take a posture break and stand and move for a couple of minutes. Simply standing is insufficient. Movement is important to get blood circulation through the muscles. And movement is FREE! Research shows that you don’t need to do vigorous exercise (e.g. jumping jacks) to get the benefits, just walking around is sufficient. So build in a pattern of creating greater movement variety in the workplace (e.g. walk to a printer, water fountain, stand for a meeting, take the stairs, walk around the floor, park a bit further away from the building each day). [1] https://ergo.human.cornell.edu/CUESitStand.html reply taberiand 13 hours agoparentThat essentially reads to me as \"you can't both be focused on computer work and be active enough to be healthy\" Break my concentration EVERY 20-30 minutes to move around for at least 2 minutes? That's at least halving my productivity. It's a total non-starter. It's the sort of advice that everyone pays lip service to, but almost no one is actually able to follow. reply atoav 10 hours agorootparentThat is the optimum frequency — if you just wanna reap in the health benefits it could look like: 0 min: start working 10 min: refactored a few things, get a glas of water, look out of the window 40 min: started working on a particular though problem, somewhat stuck, get up and stretch a little while thinking 60 min: found a good solution to though problem, keep it in your head, goto kitchen get another glas of water 120 min: after an hour of uninterrupted flow the though problem is solved, stand up, get a cup of tea, think about whether it is really adequately solved etc. Every twenty minutes makes it sound as if you are a slave to the clock and interrupt the flow just whenever — but if you want to make this work you just have to find the spots where standing up feels natural and do it. Those don't have to be exactly 20 minutes apart. Even just standing up once is already better than staying put for hours. I program myself and found a change of perspective and bodily motion in the right spots can help concentration, not break it, especially in the long run. Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. If you have a variable height desk, you can also alternate between sitting and standing, which can also help as you now have at least two different resting poses with slightly different kinds of strain. reply greentxt 3 hours agorootparentIf you work from home you can spread monitors out, so you switch positions while working on a problem without losing focus the same way you switch back and forth on a dual monitor setup. E.g. Have documentation on monitor one at a standup station in one corner of the room, the other monitor with code a few feet away at a desk, email on a laptop in a separate room, etc... And drinking more coffee helps a lot. You have to get up to make the coffee, then to pee it out. The caffiene in sufficuent quantity makes it hard to sit still.

I can sometimes take my problem with me and sometimes that's even the best thing to do, but not always and certainly not every 20 minutes.

It will be a break just because it needs a conscious effort. But presumably if you build a routine, a habit, it will work by itself. You will be able to continue thinking your deep thoughts, while your body will transpose itself to a treadmill, do some movements there and then transpose itself back. The tricky part is how to build an automatic routine and how to trigger it every 20 minutes without breaking the concentration. reply amelius 8 hours agorootparentMaybe an automatic height adjustable table could work? reply ctm92 7 hours agorootparentMany desks have bluetooth these days and someone already built something like that: https://apps.apple.com/de/app/desk-remote-control/id15090377... reply amelius 6 hours agorootparentOk, two questions: 1) can it be programmed to regularly change the height without user intervention? 2) what are the user experiences of using it this way? reply tbrownaw 12 hours agorootparentprev> Break my concentration EVERY 20-30 minutes to move around for at least 2 minutes? That's at least halving my productivity. I approximately never need to focus to the level that standing up and pacing a bit would evict state, let alone need to focus like that for for over a half hour at a time.

The thing is that those are unscripted. The point that I think the OP was making was that enforced breaks on a schedule will immediately kill any form of concentration or workflow reply taberiand 12 hours agorootparentAbsolutely, it's the regimented and very frequent schedule that is the problem. Breaks are necessary, and very useful - but if that frequency is what I have to do to stay healthy with a desk job, then I guess I'll be unhealthy Basically - movement isn't free reply Propelloni 9 hours agorootparentWhat works for me is that I only have a small glass of water or a coffee at my table. If I want to drink more, I have to get up and walk over to the kitchen. Early in the day this can be about about every 20-30 minutes, later it goes down to maybe 45-60 minutes. Then there are, of course, rest room breaks. So I'd say I get up and move 10-12 times a day in an unforced, natural way -- not always 8 minutes, mind, but it's about progress, not perfection. reply wtfpohqeq 12 hours agorootparentprevYour concentration breaks if you stand up? Try not to involve your legs in any thought process. With enough training you should be able to take your concentration into the kitchen, the bathroom, the shower, etc. reply TomK32 11 hours agorootparentprevI have yet to buy one, but a walking pad under my height-adjustable table should allow me to do all those thing at the same spot while I keep working. reply abenga 10 hours agorootparentprev20-30 minutes is a bit much, but I think getting up every 45 minutes (get a glass of water/cup of tea, go to the bathroom, look out of the window) is reasonable. reply adrian_b 7 hours agorootparentprevThere is no need to break your concentration. Whenever I do not type at the keyboard, but I think about what I should do, I stand up and walk around. I actually think much better about the problem that I have to solve while walking than when sitting. reply throwaway2037 12 hours agorootparentprev> That's at least halving my productivity. That is bold claim, and I struggle to believe it. Are you writing from the perspective of \"flow\"? In my experience, the people who talk the most about \"flow\", are the ones who are trying to avoid communicating with teammates / managers. reply zeta0134 12 hours agorootparentWe're trying to avoid communication with teammates and managers because it breaks flow. All the engineers on my team understand this, generally send me chat messages to kick off a convo, and do not expect instant replies. I offer them the same courtesy. Re-establishing context after an interruption takes a tremendous amount of energy. Now, admittedly, standing up for a stretch does not break my flow. Neither does walking around my house or doing the dishes. Generally it's talking to another human that'll do it every time. Light exercise should be more than possible to work into your day once it becomes familiar and routine. reply exe34 10 hours agorootparentit's because when you get up for a walk, or wash the dishes, you use different parts of your brain. it's the same as knitting (i.e for an experienced knitter, not a beginner) while watching TV. talking to another person, especially about work related issues, pushes the previous stuff onto a very short stack, and the stack overflows immediately. often times it's not about trying to get the stuff back in mind as it was before, but having to go through the entire series of steps again to get there. reply exe34 11 hours agorootparentprevin my experience, the people complaining about others not communicating enough are insecure extroverts that just can't stand the sound of their own thoughts and just need constant approval from others in the form of attention. schedule a meeting once a week and we'll catch up. if you're stuck, send me an email and I'll get back to you when it won't interrupt my own work. reply yuserx 10 hours agorootparentprevSome 30 years ago we integrated that by simply putting the laser printer in the opposite corner of the room.

We don't talk about radical disruptive ideas enough these days. What if we don't have to interact with computers from a stationary position at all? VR headsets are one direction that might help with this, but in my view there is another way. Decouple peripherals and computing units fully. You'd carry around with you a battery unit that will charge display and input units, and it wouldn't be carrying but maybe put on a strap on your arm, shoulder, back,etc.. (very lightweight). I wish I could draw this out and show you, but you would be able to sit, move around, even run. You can hold a display unit, but you can also have cheap display units on walls all over the office, house,etc.. and you'd attach sensors to the back of your arm that would sense finger movements for typing and controlling the mouse and view port. Essentially, \"monitors\" would not be tied to one device, but whatever device is nearest to them, wirelessly. and 10-12\" mobile monitors (like tablets but just the display,battery and wireless receiver board) that work in the same way would also be a thing. the actual computers would be in a static location. Imagine just sitting at a desk, or walking up to a wall, running on a treadmill, or taking a walk outside and you can still do the same exact task, just as if you were sitting down in front of a laptop. If it were that simple, someone would have done it, I get that. But we need to talk about ideas like this (I'm sure there are better ones). reply Terr_ 17 hours agoparentI see the big issues as: 1. Input accuracy, speed, and fatigue. Stick your keyboard to a wall and try standing next to it typing for an hour. Even if somehow gestures/sign-language are viable, your arms will get tired, and only a few people will power through the pain with the excuse that it's a form of exercise. 2. Motion sickness and physical safety. We make dedicated workspaces because we need to control external factors and have definite positions for things. A floating \"window\" isn't that different from an LCD on a pivoting arm, especially if you prefer to change the hat's on it rather than frequently relocate it. 3. We don't multitask nearly as well as we think we do. reply notepad0x90 16 hours agorootparent1) You'll move your fingers just as if you were typing on a keyboard, and the sensors will give you feedback when you \"type\", your arm can be in any position, so long as you move your fingers like you were typing on a keyboard it would work. There won't be actual keyboards. accuracy and speed would ideally be similar to a bluetooth keyboard. 2) Dedicated workspaces are fine, you're just not tied to one concept of a workspace. A park bench can be a dedicated work space, so can standing in front of walls, or a seat at a coffee shop. the ergonomics can be adapted accordingly. 3) Multi-tasking is irrelevant here, if I'm just watching a video for example, I can sit on a sofa, get up and walk around after a bit, go to the kitchen and make some food, go to my office and sit on an office chair,etc.. all the while I would be watching the movie. My posture and location is not tied down to the compute device, that would be the ideal goal. We wouldn't need \"smart\" devices all that much with this approach either, \"things\" would interface with my I/O peripherals instead of having their own that requires my interaction. E.g.: imagine getting groceries and you'd navigate the isles and get information about products without a single thing in the store changing, you just have your peripherals interact with the environment better. reply fragmede 16 hours agorootparentprevI've made basically a keytar - just a flat board hanging down like a guitar, with a guitar strap for it, and then I mounted a (wireless) keyboard and trackpad to it (flat), so I can stand and type/mouse with my arms and hands hanging down. There's still fatigue, but there's not the same need for gorilla arms. So I don't see 1 as insurmountable. reply kryptiskt 10 hours agoparentprevStephen Wolfram has a walking desk so he can use his laptop while out walking: https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/02/seeking-the-prod... reply tbrownaw 12 hours agoparentprevSo ... a cellphone plus random screens available to cast to plus a Bluetooth keyboard small enough to wear on your arm. reply dmead 17 hours agoparentprevLol did you just invent a terminal from the 1970s, but a cell phone? reply grues-dinner 16 hours agorootparentSounds like the hand terminals from The Expanse which you can flick onto any nearby display.

The security boundary is that all devices need to be logged into the same wifi, maybe also iCloud. reply grues-dinner 14 hours agorootparentRight but that's the point, isn't it? If you have a single manufacturer with complete control of the devices and software on both ends and you own the devices and have a single trusted network or authentication service it can work (but still not exactly easy to implement). But that's not the hypothetical in question - for that to be a reality, you have to have it work pretty much anywhere, on any network (or a way to negotiate an adhoc private network) and on virtually any third party IO hardware. And that's before you get to the possibility of the gym treadmill screen or coffee shop keyboard or whatever being a hostile device. Which they would easily be if people were going to use the system for something of high value as opposed to casting YouTube to the treadmill screen. Which may be a little bit of a data leak opportunity as it stands, but it's not quite a screencast of your banking account, complete with key log. reply fragmede 14 hours agorootparentMy point is that the underlying technology is there, in a way that's accessible to users, so it's just a matter of use case and implementation and the market for such technology. If all you think about is the reasons it won't work, then you'll never try. Some great companies have come from people that didn't know they shouldn't try. As far as technology though, Airplay is what macOS uses to project the video, and there are open source implementations out there that you could run on a raspberry pi. As far as wanting it to work everywhere, if Apple supported Chromecast it would probably work more places, since Google licenses that technology so it's already on a lot of TVs and projectors. I'm not imagining using this in very many places other than my home and any office locations where I have wifi, but there are standards like wifi-direct where you wouldn't even need that. I'm only transmitting video, the keyboard/mouse is connected to my device via Bluetooth, so the worst a malicious device could do is record video that I'm transmitting, which, if I don't want people to see the video I'm transmitting, I should not transmit it in the first place. reply grues-dinner 14 hours agorootparent> I don't want people to see the video I'm transmitting, I should not transmit it in the first place.

I have a bad back and I find it to be better than any chair I've used so far, though I've only tried a few. You still get a slight bit of elevated heart rate and caloric expenditure to keep your body firm and in good posture so I'd say it's better than sitting and more relaxing than standing. You also don't have to remind yourself to get up and move every once in a while because if you're practicing good posture, you won't be too comfortable. reply bityard 16 hours agoparentprevI have a belief that a lot of (but certainly not all) back pain is caused by weak back muscles. Back muscles support the spine and hold it straight against the weight of the abdomen. Like all muscles, they atrophy if you don't exercise them. The very best way to exercise them is to spend most of your day standing, walking, and a good part of it running. Which is what evolution designed our bodies to do. I had a standing desk at work and while I only used it for a couple hours a day, it helped GREATLY in erasing my chronic back pain.

They're not responsible for making you exercise. The most efficient way to incorporate exercise into your day is to make it part of your commute. Walking, biking, taking the train etc. - different modes are viable for different locations. If you choose a job where this is not possible, you're just going to have to make it up some other way - two hours per week in a gym goes farther than most people think if you spend that time well. In many cases at least one of these options is available to people but instead of taking it they whine that the job itself is too sedentary. I don't have a lot of sympathy, there are far worse jobs for the body than sitting in a chair (or standing stationary, your choice!) all day.

Taking walks during the day. I have figured out a lot of tricky design and even debugging questions by taking a walk. And even if I don't think about programming directly, it still clears my head. Splitting my day up with an hour (or longer) walk leaves me more effective than spending the same time in front of my computer. I usually work remotely, so often this involves walking to a cafe, doing some work there and walking back. 2. Taking walking meetings. I've found this works well for 1:1s, and it works reasonably well for large calls where I don't need to participate much. There are lots of meetings where it's too awkward or doesn't work at all, but converting even a small fraction of my meetings to walking meetings is a real improvement. Of course, both of these assume a flexible culture where this does not make me look like a slacker and where I can take meetings in different ways.

And my favorite new tool: A skipping rope that I use whenever I feel too tired/ like my concentration is breaking / I do not want to do, what I currently have to do. (Mind you, there is a storage room big enough next to my office room that is right above the underground garage, so I will not disturb my colleagues.). Before that, I used to climb the stairs to the top of my office building (five floors) and down to \"unfog\" my mind and get some energy back. reply skirmish 14 hours agorootparentI once got a bright idea to climb up the stairs to the 13th floor where our office was located. Once I got there, I found that doors can only be opened from the inside, so I climbed 13 floors down and took an elevator up again like a good little sheep. reply dagmx 14 hours agorootparentprevI change positions throughout the day (Apple Watch is good for reminding to move) But also for me , if I’m at home, I take my dog for walks during the day and just make up the time later if needed. It breaks things up. Or if I’m in the office I go for thinking walks to plan out what I’m doing reply 0xEF 9 hours agorootparentprevI was not in the same industry, but I once had a remote job that kept me tethered to my desk because I was constantly responding to phone calls. After about two months of that, I ended up purchasing a cheap walking pad (think slow treadmill with no side rails that only goes at walking pace) from Amazon for about $120USD. This was not a perfect solution, any stretch, it provided movement instead of just standing in place. What I mean by \"rethink the way we work\" is that jobs like yours (and you may not agree with this) need to be broken up into smaller chunks through the day. So, you work for 2 hours, do something else for 2 hours, work a little more for 2 hours, and so on. I work beside a lot of programmers and CAD designers in my industry and, in fact, am trying to move over to their side of the team (currently I am the guy who builds, tests and repairs the machines they create). One thing I feel is universally true is that, while you may be sitting at your desk for 8 hours, you are really only doing any actual work for about half the time, possibly less. Here me out; sitting in front of a computer is tough on both the brain and body. When you are tethered to the desk and 90% of your job is cerebral, to an outsider that looks like a pretty easy day, but we know it's not. Those stress hormones build up fast and because you can't get up to work them off or give them some physical purpose, you sit tensed, bouncing a leg, shoulders up to the ears, etc etc. Your body suffers and really, the output for the day could have probably been done with only 4 hours of actual computer time, instead of 8. So, open up the opportunity for our programmers to move around by doing some other stuff. If no work tasks can be assigned, the programmer should just get those 2 on/2 off times to do what they think is best, because, as far as the employer is concerned, if the output each day remains the same, who cares? Nothing changes for them and you get to stop being a pressure cooker of cortisol. Understandably, my idea needs some massaging, so don't take any of this as 'this is the way it must be to work.' Consider it a work in progress and your suggestions are welcome. reply jltsiren 16 hours agorootparentprevI think it's less about deliberate tricks and more about developing habits that ensure some low intensity activity throughout the day. Most things you do on a computer don't actually require being in front of the computer all the time.

I also don't think anyone believed standing would suddenly make working for 8+ hours a day in front of a computer screen healthy. However, with a standing desk and split keyboard (apple trackpad in the middle), I personally feel I can work with some semblance of decent posture. When I work sitting down, especially for long periods of time, my posture degrades (tech neck, etc.) When standing up with a split keyboard, at least my posture is linear and my shoulders are back. From the study, apparently the improved posture benefits do not carry over to cardiovascular health benefits, but I would guess it is still beneficial. Very rarely in the office do I see people sitting with good posture (It is possible, but takes more conscience effort), but I will often see people standing with good \"upright\" posture. tldr: Article mentions nothing about posture improvements. That is what I always thought improved the most moving from sitting to standing desks. reply cassianoleal 9 hours agoprevI move when I'm standing. I stretch my calves, my feet, my back...

I decided to get an under-desk treadmill a few years ago, and after a bit of adjustment, it’s definitely manageable. Walking for 4 hours during the workday means 4 hours less spent sitting or standing still. The book Death by Sitting by Eric Soehngen also points out that simply standing doesn’t solve the issue, as it’s still a static posture. reply loloquwowndueo 17 hours agoprev“ standing for long periods of time might not be much better than sitting after all” Well duh, if you trade one sedentary all-day posture for another sedentary all-day posture it’s not likely to be of much benefit. The point of standing desks is to vary posture during the day and being able to choose to stand or sit while continuing to work gives you one more way to achieve this. Mix with breaks and walks and it’s starting to look better than sitting on your ass all day anyway. I try to stand for calls/remote meetings, I have a couple every day and it adds up to about 1h of standing / shifting my weight around and helps me stay focused. But not overdoing it is key - on days where I have more than a couple of meetings I’ll totally be sitting for some of them. reply kyriakos 14 hours agoparentNot requiring camera on during calls proved very good for my health.

Paid for their same day delivery service which they use Uber for and it says delivered but it wasn't. Driver stole them or he delivered to the wrong person that stole them. If he actually delivered to the wrong address, I live in a high rise that does have cameras but only in the lobby which means once the Uber driver got on the elevator who's to say he didn't get the wrong unit and it's his word against mine. I contacted Apple and they said they would reach out to Uber and get back to me. 12 hours later I got an email from Apple saying: \"We have completed our review with the carrier regarding your shipment and have determined that we are unable to provide a replacement or process a refund.\" I couldn't believe my eyes. Picked up the phone and called them and what they didnt tell me in the email was that I should file a police report (which ive done). They said do the police report and the police will reach out to Apple. Problem is I talked to the police and they said they dont reach out to anyone, Apple reaches out to them once I give Apple the police report number. Apple also said they came to that decision because Uber says the item shows as delivered. So basically I'm stressing. By reading online it looks like this has happened to others and they didn't get their money back. I'm just wondering if anyone here has been in a situation like this or can give me any advice? Thanks. ------- UPDATES ------- EDIT 1: Small update: Lots of people online told me to contact Tim Cook by email. Obviously not expecting him to reply but apparently he has a team that responds to these emails for situations like this. Got a call today from a nice lady that asked a couple questions and for the police report number and to forward the original email i got from Apple telling me they wouldnt help me with a refund or replacement. She said she took over the case and is looking into it and to expect a call in a day or two. She seems pretty high up the food chain.. One thing I explained to her and to the police that came to visit me, was when someone visits/delivers anything to my building they must buzz in first. This comes through as an incoming call on my phone. I told her and the police that I will supply my login info for my phone carrier to see I had no incoming calls within hours of the supposed delivery. I'm confident that if this is truly looked into by a real person who wants to put in the time to find the truth than it will end in my favour. I appreciate all the advice i got here and will give an update once I hear from her. EDIT 2: Spoke with Apple Retail Executive Relations. They're not changing their decision. I get nothing back.

Apparently I signed that delivery (the UPS guy probably signed it himself...) reply danpalmer 10 hours agoparentDelivery drivers in the UK regularly do this. They get to 11am, realise they won’t meet the delivery slots for the afternoon deliveries, so bulk mark everything as delivered and sign themselves, then take their time and deliver after the slot later that day.

I got like 3 Hello Fresh deliveries in a row when I complained of their repeated forgeries before I cancelled. reply switch007 9 hours agorootparentI'm curious how the signature is represented though.

One famously will take a photo of your parcel in a bush in a garden 3 streets over (Hermes) Though at the more scrupulous companies they take photos slightly more seriously. Just slightly reply m000 10 hours agoparentprevAnd UPS is probalby to blame for that. AFAIK most delivery companies nowadays work their shifts with delivery quotas. I.e. the courier needs to deliver everything on the truck (which is typically more than you could deliver in a time-based shift) before calling it a day. Essentially, courier companies have found out that rather than scaling their workforce to the deliveries workload, it is more profitable to squeeze out a fixed number of employees to save wages, and occasionally apologize for the mixups caused by this situation. reply flumpcakes 9 hours agorootparent> which is typically more than you could deliver in a time-based shift I think this compounds the issue: if people are committing fraud/lying (taking a picture of a random house as proof of 'sorry you were not in' or forging signatures themselves) because their slots are too full to deliver all packages they're supposed to then whomever is working in logistics won't see it. They will think all packages were at least attempted within that slot and as such not too onerous. reply m000 3 hours agorootparentI believe the results of this policy should have a measurable effect on the number of complaints/customer support cases and they are definitely taking notice of that. But it's not that anyone will take action. This is exactly the expected outcome: Pay less for courier wages in USA/Europe, and keep the much cheaper (and probably outsourced) customer support hotline busy. On the contrary, it would be more likely to take action if the complaints are not high enough. This means that they could squeeze the schedule of their couriers a bit more. reply actionfromafar 9 hours agorootparentprevWonder if they are fooling themselves in the end though. It might look good on the KPI, but if it's based on fake data, the leaders are navigating blind. reply ChrisMarshallNY 9 hours agoparentprevJust got a new Mini, a couple of days ago. Hereabouts, Apple uses UPS for deliveries. They always require signature, and disallow “pre-signature.” I get a $30 cable; signature required. I get a $50 iPhone case; signature required.

Maybe I just got lucky. I did feel bad though for the people doing the deliveries, independent of what company they worked for. You can tell it's an awful job and they're working their butts off, sometimes delivering a package way after hours, like say after 9pm or so. I'm afraid it's like that pretty much in any country, though. reply socksy 5 hours agorootparentI think it’s highly dependent on both what kind of place you live and who the delivery driver is. At my place, I live in the Hinterhaus (which, annoyingly is where my buzzer is) up several flights of stairs with no elevator. Additionally, until recently the delivery driver for my street seemed to have some kind of agreement with someone about 10 houses away on the ground floor that would accept all the parcels for the entire street. They even had the gall to ask for donations for their “service” (all of the parcels I picked up from them reeked of smoke).

One year ago, I had to contact Apple support because the FindMy feature wouldn't work on my Airpods Pro, which still were under warranty. It looked like they were already associated with another account, which wasn't mine. That made no sense as I bought them myself at the Apple store and only have a single iCloud account. I went to the store and they acknowledged the issue, and immediately got a replacement which turned out to have the exact same issue. I then had to spend hours on the phone with their customer support. After trying everything without success, the person on the phone told me I'd get a call back in one week to either issue a refund or find a different solution. That phone call never came. All my following messages to that person were ignored. I finally gave up, but found out I was far from being the only one they had ghosted like that.

Based on that you mention being able to see they're associated with someone else's account, you mean that you got a unit that was not factory reset before being given to you right? (And you can't do it yourself because they're Apple-locked for theft reasons.) Not that it got stolen and now you can't find it? Then you say you went to the store, were given a replacement, and it turned out the same. You didn't try out in the store whether these ones are functional? Which makes sense because why wouldn't they be, but could have saved the trouble. You haven't tried going back to that store, perhaps even at the same time and day of week so that you are likely to get the employee who remembers that they provided support in this situation (by handing out a replacement unit, in this case)? Then you could immediately try out, before taking it out of the store, whether this unit is functional Either way, they have an obligation to meet the claims put out in marketing statements, including features like FindMy since they say on the website it can do that. If you've exhausted the easy options, you can always take it to something like small claims and get at least a refund that way. Often, a letter saying you intend to suffices reply ndsipa_pomu 9 hours agoparentprev> I can't understand how Apple can possibly get away with this. Is there any chance for them to win if the case were brought to court? My naive understanding would be that you entered into a contract with them to supply a MacBook in exchange for a sum of money. The money was paid, but the MacBook was not delivered to the customer, so Apple are in breach of contract. I would imagine that a credit card company charge back would be the easiest solution if it was paid for by one. reply switch007 9 hours agoprevIn the UK the law is clear (IANAL). The seller is responsible for delivering the goods to you (or otherwise as per your instructions). I stress, to /you/. If they don't, they have failed in their contract. You can take them to the small claims court. I believe it's the same in most of the EU. Make them call you a liar in court. Remedy is not dependent on the good graces of the credit card companies but of course if that's open to you can start there. A lot have people have been brainwashed in to believing the customer is required to deal with the delivery company or that the seller has no responsibility once the item has been collected by the courier. Also, I find it wild that Apple use Uber. Apple exclusively use UPS in the UK I believe (including service collections and deliveries), who I've never had a problem with, and if they stopped that I would only ever purchase from a store reply tgma 9 hours agoprevWe recently had a similar problem with BestBuy. We had a launch day order of a Google Pixel 9 XL but we got the base non-Pro model inside the box. Tracking showed it as delivered, obviously. Chat told me to go to store. I went to store and they told me they would be able to take it back but not exchange it, which would make me lose the trade-in promotional value and suggested us to call and have BestBuy online store folks ship a replacement. Some agent was good and did it, but it tripped some fraud detection thing (apparently because the original IMEI showed as activated, which probably did because they switched ours with someone else who is happily and quietly enjoying a better phone than they ordered). That saga took a couple months to get resolved and only after the threat of legal action and sending them scary letters (thanks ChatGPT). reply lrem 10 hours agoprevI’m about to buy a Mac and it will be in the physical store, but for a different reason. In Switzerland if you buy online, you cannot make a return in store. Got a DoA Mac last November. Four people spent a total double digit number of hours on the phone with Apple, who were incompetent to the point it looked like malice. E.g. after taking about half an hour of my time, the lady decided my claim is legit, but she cannot process it because she’s in the wrong country(I called the Swiss number, they never told me they’re transferring the call abroad). But she’ll transfer me to someone who can just press a button now… After a couple minutes of music the same lady picks up, tells me she cannot find Switzerland in the list of countries, so I need to hang up and start from the scratch. In the end got my money back, but it was processed only in the February cycle. reply avidiax 10 hours agoprevApple owes him his two laptops.

UPS \"lost\" my package and it went back and forth between several locations. It was never marked as delivered, just forever in transit. I even got a call from someone claiming to be UPS to see if my package was delivered. I contacted Apple and the same thing happened, they couldn't do anything. Talk to UPS. UPS said talk to Apple. Both parties kept blaming the other party. UPS said internal investigation yielded nothing. I was telling them it clearly still said in transit and it's bounced around for several weeks. They said maybe it'll get there eventually. I contacted Tim Cook's email and someone from the team responded and worked with me through the situation. Fortunately, we had a lucky outcome, and we got our payment refunded, but the entire ordeal took around a month and lots of calls to the CS/live chat support. reply frizlab 3 hours agoparentSame in France for a company. We did not contact Tim Cook; support was enough. reply baoluofu 9 hours agoprevI had a similar situation earlier this year with an iPad delivery. The delivery company missed the target date, then the following day I got a notification that it had been delivered - it hand't been - despite actively following the tracking of the driver in their app and seeing him not come to my house and drive away after delivering to various properties near me, as well as actively watching out for the driver when he was close enough. The delivery company themselves were extremely unhelpful. Apple on the other hand was very understanding and helpful. It took a few days for them to go through the necessary process with the delivery company, but once done they sent out a replacement, critically with a different delivery company. Apple was proactive in keeping me updated throughout, and always seemed to side with me over the delivery company. The only snag after that was the pre-purchased Apple care was tied to the undelivered iPad, so it took about a week for one of their specialist teams to transfer it over to the replacement. reply killingtime74 10 hours agoprev\"I'd make a trip to the Apple Store and pick up, next time.\" Um next time I don't think this person is buying a Mac.

Either they all turned to tech pros because of their Linux usage or they don't have the maintaining issues that were common 10 years ago anymore. reply freefaler 4 hours agorootparentI am a programmer that in 1996 installed my first Linux - a Debian 2.0. It's true that the current state is way better than before. However I don't want to remember the 3 days I lost trying to fix an issue with printer drivers and by going to the source the \"driver\" worked by parsing the web interface of the network printer. (don't let me start on laptops & battery usage) It's a good idea, but not for consumer grade computing and even me sitting for 14 hours/day in front of one - still don't want to spend the time to fight my laptop to work properly. I won't allow anything other than linux on my servers, but desktop computer or phones are better left without it. reply Aachen 1 hour agorootparentSpecifically for printers, since you mention it, my experience since about 2017 or so has been that my Debian just finds them and can immediately print out of the box (both network and USB), whereas on Windows e.g. my dad has to re-add it in the configuration panel every couple days and drives him mad, but also in a normal case you're expected to configure it on first use I have come across one unsupported printer where you were advised to pick a driver for a similar model number, and even that didn't work for me, but I'll trade that outlier for all the other times where it was so much easier than Windows ever was. One can check the model before purchasing if it's about your own printer (I don't own one anymore, cartridges aren't worth it at the 5 pages per year that I need for outdated transport companies nowadays; copyshops exist) I'm not into printers and their drivers so I've got no idea what changed or who made this happen, but whoever did this for printers on Linux is a real hero \"Sadly\", I recently helped my dad get set up on a new Windows 11 and that seems to have this behaviour now, too, so Windows does seem to be catching up in usability > (don't let me start on laptops & battery usage) That one is a real trade-off indeed. It's not all sunshine and roses Another one is GPU drivers and WiFi chips, but it's a one-time hardware check and setup thing, so for those issues you could ask someone else to install your system to a functional state and anyone can use it from there with the same learning curve as when they'd use macOS for the first time (Cinnamon looks a whole lot like XP, if that's what they're coming from like I was) reply amatecha 14 minutes agorootparentI recently set up a new Debian install. Just went into the Printer Settings, and my printer is there. I did nothing, it just worked on its own. Printer issues are almost always the fault of the manufacturer -- if you're using Linux/BSD, check support before making hardware purchases and you'll be golden :) philistine 6 hours agorootparentprevYou’re burying the lede here: you installed Linux. That’s what people always work real hard to pretend isn’t a problem on here about Linux: that you have to install it. But the reality is that most everyone, including very experienced users, have never and never will install an OS. It’s not a question of difficulty, they just cannot wrap their heads around it. reply xethos 4 hours agorootparentBut now you've also changed the requirements - it's no longer \"All the maintenance a Linux box needs\" (which you claimed was the biggest impediment up-thread), now it's the initial hump of getting it installed reply philistine 1 hour agorootparentSorry, I'm strictly focusing on my bugaboo about the Linux crowd on here: that they refuse to acknowledge that installing Linux is sine qua non. I do not know one way or the other how easy it is to daily drive Linux. reply Aachen 56 minutes agorootparentSubtitling for those of us not speaking Latin over here: it seems to mean prerequisite As for the \"but the installation is so difficult\" point, perhaps, but would you trust them to install Windows or macOS onto an otherwise empty SSD? I've had more trouble getting Windows onto systems without needing a CD-RW and corresponding CD drive than I ever did installing Ubuntu, Debian, Mint, Crunchbang, and perhaps more I forgot. Only Arch was more difficult, but then it's meant/advertised to be that way so no surprise there. I've also tried installing macOS and succeeded eventually, but the system was quite dysfunctional. I'd not be surprised if you do a study with 60 random people and it turns out most of them actually get it done for Linux distributions with lower success rates for the OSes that expect to be pre-installed by commercial deals with the hardware vendor And all this only applies if you didn't buy a laptop that comes with a FOSS distribution out of the box. I see it as an advantage that you can pick nearly any hardware and run on it what you want, but if you want to limit it to pre-installed systems then there's that option, too reply philistine 47 minutes agorootparent> but would you trust them to install Windows or macOS onto an otherwise empty SSD? It's not a question of trust. It's a question of commerce. People buy computers, and they use the OS on it. If the Linux community really wants to drive adoption by normies, the focus shouldn't be on ease of use, or ease of installation. They should fight to break Microsoft's monopoly and demand to be an optional selection during every purchase. reply herbst 7 hours agorootparentprevThe smiley is for all the fun Software can be, if you want to. reply sgjohnson 9 hours agorootparentprevIf you’re not already running Linux desktop, then Linux desktop is a viable option only if you value your time at exactly zero. reply herbst 7 hours agorootparentThat's so subjective. I've wasted hours in Apple forums, writing bug reports just to get ignored, and had so much pain using Mac for over a year as developing machine ... Things I would have solved with Linux with a single IRC visit or by examining the relevant code. Ex. I've lost a complete day because I didn't know you need to open xcode to confirm the policy of an update I did in the console. I never used xcode before that day. reply viraptor 8 hours agorootparentprevCompared to Mac? It's a better development platform, better digital audio system, better game platform, and probably a few others I haven't experienced.

If you're talking about purely the system, then it's all moot without having some software for audio professionals to run on it. > better game platform Now I know you're trolling. edit: sorry I forgot the \"Compared to Mac?\" part at the beginning, this is probably true, but I have zero experience gaming on Mac or Linux. reply viraptor 7 hours agorootparent> dependant on what you're trying to develop. Basic system tools have been broken on macs for a few major releases now. And I'm familiar with fixing up lots of Darwin-specific issues in software packaging by now. There's seriously a number of downsides here unless you have to use Xcode. I wrote digital audio system for a reason. Pipewire is currently the best implementation out of the 3 major systems. Whether you want to use it with a DAW or in a different way that requires a Mac-only application is orthogonal here. For a lot of DAW work, you don't even need a fancy sound system to begin with. But also there are DAWs which do work on Linux and there are people preferring them. > The vast majority of plugins Yabridge is there for embedding windows VSTs. It's not that bad. reply herbst 7 hours agorootparentI actually was surprised that most DAWs I see recommended for newbies actually work natively on Linux like Reaper or Bitwig. (I am newbie in this topic, I just found that argument funny, times change) reply sgjohnson 8 hours agorootparentprev> there's lots of people happily using Linux without wasting time. No doubt. But it no doubt required a SIGNIFICANT time investment to get to the point where they can just use their machines “without wasting time”. reply herbst 7 hours agorootparentI don't think that's true anymore.
