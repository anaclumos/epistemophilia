    "originBody": "Nyxt: the hacker's browser. Never leave the keyboard. Quickly analyze, navigate, and extract information from the Internet. Download FAQ Articles Never leave the keyboard with powerful link hinting. Speed up the process as you follow links with your keyboard. In this example we follow a link to view a page about Aerodynamic Forces, without resorting to the mouse pointer. Quickly navigate documents with Jump Headings. Immediately skip to important chapters with Jump Headings by fuzzily searching through header tags. In this example we jump to the section: Intelligence and Learning. Instantly switch between your tabs. Easily find relevant tabs with a fuzzy search. In this example we have 11 open tabs, and we narrow this group with each keystroke. Find the right info the first time with multi-tab search. Search multiple tabs simultaneously. In this example we look for the diet of penguins across several pages at once. Avoid tedious repetition by selecting groups of tabs. Run commands against multiple tabs to avoid repeating yourself. In the example below we finish our online research of elephants by selecting and closing all webpages that match the string \"ele\". Execute commands easily. Fuzzy search relevant commands to instantly run them. No more digging through menus. Built-in programmability. Use the built-in REPL to program Nyxt. Run short scripts, and try out new workflows. Everything in Nyxt is fully extensible and modifiable. Smart bookmark search. Use the prompt buffer to intelligently search your tagged bookmarks. Customizable autofills. Use autofills to fill in forms. Autofills can be functions or plain strings. In the case of functions, you can make them intelligent. For example, you may want an autofill to fill in the current date. Clipboard history. Anything you copy is remembered so that you can re-paste it at any time. No more looking for the 'last thing' you pasted! Lossless tree history. A tree based history ensures that you never lose track of where you've been. All pages you've visited are stored in a tree that you can traverse and search. No more losing items in your history.",

    "commentBody": "Nyxt: The Hacker's Browser (atlas.engineer)380 points by OuterVale 16 hours agohidepastfavorite189 comments ethagnawl 3 hours agoI was intrigued until I saw this in the FAQ: > What is Nyxt? > Nyxt is a browser with deeply integrated AI and semantic document tools that work as a second brain to help you process and understand more, more quickly. No mention of what sort of \"AI\", where it's run, etc. If nothing else, this sounds like a recipe for a warm laptop and unreliable results. reply scrps 13 minutes agoparentJust clustering, which makes sense, as far as I can see peeking at the code. Whole codebase is lisp which I don't have a ton of experience with so caveat emptor. https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/tree/master/libraries... reply dartos 3 hours agoparentprevNyxt has been around long before the whole ai hype. I guess they’re just trying ti ride the marketing wave. reply sourcepluck 1 hour agoparentprevI agree that's is a bad look, and I wonder who does Nyxt's writing. And I wonder what they mean, I didn't think there was any sort of LLM integration, and definintely not built in... has something changed there? Do they just mean it's built with Lisp? What are these semantic document tools? reply ksp-atlas 54 minutes agorootparentWhen I first tried nyxt I never saw anything about AI (I never ended up using it because it would frequently crash and it was annoying to customize) reply sigmonsays 3 hours agoparentprevThe AI plug is obligatory. They have to ride the hype train too. This browser was around before AI was popular and when I used it, it was great. The only downside is the lack of ability to run extensions, like bitwarden. reply goku12 3 hours agorootparentNyxt is supposed to be as extensible as Emacs and way more extensible than mainstream browsers that use WebExtensions. The lack of extensions is likely due to its miniscule market share. reply slightwinder 17 minutes agorootparent> The lack of extensions is likely due to its miniscule market share. It's because they are not implementing support for WebExtensions. Which is of course not that simple, but it's not because of lacking market share. And it seems they are kinda have it on the list[1], by switching to chromium[2].

Specially since that on my hacker circle of Demoscene, during the 16 bit days, we were mostly on Atari and Amiga systems, then we had plenty of mouse time, and no one ever stop to wonder we weren't hackers because we had mices. reply poincaredisk 9 hours agoparent>I don't get the hype of keyboard == hacker mentality. This is not about a hype or \"looking cool\". Mouse and GUIs are faster and more ergonomic for exploratory activities (\"how do I do X\" for a new task, skimming a document or folder, etc), while keyboard (keyboard shortcuts, command line) is faster for routine, repeatable tasks. Web browsing is full of the latter. I personally strongly prefer the keyboard and find it exhausting to reach for the mouse all the time, but it's a matter of personal preference. I don't think less of someone when I see they heavily use the mouse when programming, though in my opinion they are missing out. reply pasc1878 9 hours agorootparentBrowsing is mainly of exploration (e.g. reading) then data entry (which does require a keyboard but all on one page no scrolling) and much less repeatable tasks. My hand is usually already on the mouse. Switching apps, scrolling text etc. I started on PC-DOS and mainframes so was originally all keyboard, but having mouse made things much easier for me. Now don't get me started on gestures - I can never remember any. - Which might be some of the reason to use mice I can't remember a lot of keyboard shortcuts let me have discoverable menus etc. Pit Smalltalk did not become mainstream. reply hyperhopper 2 hours agorootparent> My hand is usually already on the mouse. Switching apps, scrolling text etc. When using Linux my hand is almost never on the mouse and I groan when I have to do it. My terminal, browser experience, mp3 player, IRC client, etc, are all usable with only a key board. Even rearranging windows is just a keyboard action. Even on windows, I can't remember the last time I switched windows with a mouse instead of alt tab. Scrolling text is just pressing j in vimium or even in vanilla chrome just pressing spacebar. If your hand is on the mouse that much you're probably not being optimal reply pjmlp 1 hour agorootparentWhat a wonderful DG/UX like user experience.... reply Borg3 8 hours agorootparentprevThats interesting. Im using GUI Windows OS, but im very heavy keyboard user, utilizing shortcuts and alt+tab for windows switching. I barely even use start or desktop to start most common apps I use. I wrote myself QuickRun tool that is activated by Win+Q, and I type what I want to run. Usually its just 2-3 first letters of alias name, like bash and autocompletion kicks in. Mouse is used mostly to position windows sometimes. Keyboard is just much faster.. reply zeagle 2 hours agorootparentI'm curious what extras you can do with your tool. I use spotlight style search with Microsoft powertoys with good effect. Admitidly stuff like unit conversion doesn't come up often but very helpful for finding files and apps compared to Windows search. reply pbhjpbhj 8 hours agorootparentprevDo you use multiple desktops? Windows seems terrible at positioning windows, I can't work out how to tell a window to move to the next desktop, say, or just start on a particular desktop (nevermind start at a particular position). Instead it takes a lot of mouse work just to setup after a boot/reboot. Do you have a solution? I'm stuck with native solutions, otherwise I gather this can be fixed with AHK. I'm interested in what you use either way. reply card_zero 2 hours agorootparentI've never seen the point of multiple desktops, but I went and found out the answer to the first question anyway. You hold down win+tab, a nice layout appears showing all your windows and all your desktops, and you drag a window to a desktop. I notice you can also reorder the desktops: right click (while holding win+tab), select \"move left\". Maybe it will then boot into whichever one's leftmost. reply cropcirclbureau 7 hours agorootparentprevI'm currently using this[0] AutoHotkey script library for such purposes. [0]: https://github.com/FuPeiJiang/VD.ahk reply Borg3 4 hours agorootparentprevYeah I am, but im on very old Windows.. Also, I never bother that much about windows positioning. Because most stuff is usually maximized already, hence I often use alt+tab to switch. As for multiple desktops, I use Desktops 2.0 with is great little utility to create 4 virtual desktops. You can switch between them using Win+[1-4] so again, keyboard shortcuts. You cannot move windows between desktops but its not issue for me. I like this feature actually. I treat those desktops like some contexts. Basic, Work, VM.. So, apps cannot escape given desktop.. And apps are nicely segregated this way. Switch is instant. reply hakfoo 2 hours agorootparentprevI was surprised that Trackpoint-style devices still remain a niche product since it explicitly solves the \"I need to move the cursor but don't want to reach for the mouse\" problem. I'm aware of about four models of standalone keyboard with it available, but that's trivial even compared to the bazillion keyboards with touchpads for couch typing. reply sourcepluck 1 hour agoparentprev> I don't get the hype of keyboard == hacker mentality There's no (or extremely little...) hype, it's just the sort of thing which starts to appear prominent in a world where conversations are driven more and more by the titles on videos and articles, rather than the other way around. I claim that the following are all pretty factual, all at once: 1. meese can be faster and more convenient, in certain cases 2. keyboards can be faster and more convenient, in certain cases 3. what people (even the computer-savvy) are used to matters much more than what is \"objectively\" best or fastest or whatever 4. \"hacker\" is a polysemic term - playful creative norm-bending, technical mastery of some domain, making Ataris and Amigas do funny stuff it seems they shouldn't have been able to, getting access to a gaming console you weren't supposed to, solving a problem in a surprising manner, reverse engineering some game, etc 5. emacs is an empowering, wonderful text editor 6. so is (hyper/super/ultra/n/eo/) vi(m) 7. nyxt is about much more than keyboard shortcuts (Lisp, freedom, etc) reply lll-o-lll 9 hours agoparentprevEven outside of the “hacker” community, keyboard has always been associated with higher expertise. Average “MS Word” user - Navigate through various menus to find what they want to do. Power Users - Memorized all the “shortcuts”. I think that’s mostly what it is. A keyboard (and a bunch of memorizing), gives mastery over the applications UI. reply pdntspa 2 minutes agorootparentMaybe it just strokes the egos of those desperate for some validation reply anonzzzies 6 hours agorootparentprevI still miss Wordperfect for that reason: messing around with Word wysiwyg, even with people who have decades of experience, is just painful to watch or do. reply gcanyon 5 hours agorootparentWordStar!!! :-) I wrote two novels in that thing. reply anthk 1 hour agorootparentCheck WordTsar reply pjmlp 6 hours agorootparentprevSome shortcuts are helpful, until one needs to do anything that affects visual position or drawing. Very few people master shortcuts that require three key chords or more. reply corank 8 hours agoparentprevFor text editors or IDEs, basically contexts where we expect a lot of typing, I get why sticking to the keyboard is desirable. I don't get how it's better to browse the web without using the mouse. Most of the time on the web I just read, not type. reply christophilus 5 hours agorootparentFor me, I’m often using the web as a reference while programming. It’s nice to be able to flip over to it (using the keyboard) and use the same familiar key bindings I’m using while in my workflow. reply corank 3 hours agorootparentThat's indeed a nice use case. In general keeping to the keyboard can be helpful in the context of typing, but if I'm just reading news or blog posts or watching videos I'd go with a mouse. reply opan 4 hours agorootparentprev>Most of the time on the web I just read, not type. This is kind of why it works. In vim you spend most of your time in normal mode, reading, moving around, making quick edits. It takes good advantage of the whole keyboard even when you're not writing new text. I use qutebrowser, which has default vim-style bindings for everything and an emphasis on the keyboard. It works very well. reply corank 3 hours agorootparentI think an important difference between how I use vim and how I use a web browser is that in vim I need to type frequently. Though I may spend most time in normal mode in vim, I still need to switch to insert mode to make edits very frequently. With my normal web browsing it's not the case, so I'm more comfortable with a mouse for that. But I realise that this depends largely on the specific use case for web browsing. Reading blog posts is quite different from reading some documentation where one needs to search and backtrack frequently, for example, although both are done on a web browser. The latter involves the keyboard more frequently so would benefit from a keyboard-centric interface more. reply paulryanrogers 2 hours agorootparentprevI wonder how much of that is how and when one comes up in the industry. I learned a little vi at uni only by necessity after years of DOS and Windows 3/9x. It felt so awkward. Decades later I only use vi on servers, but slowly its macro ('normal') mode has grown on me. reply wkat4242 8 hours agoparentprev> I don't get the hype of keyboard == hacker mentality. It's all about investing a little time to learn something that dramatically speeds up your workflow. A mainstream user has no interest in this even if they work with the computer all day. Hackers as computer enthusiasts do. When you worked on those early computers you either had to be an enthusiast or be forced by an employer to use them :) GUIs are great for infrequent tasks. TUIs for efficiency at frequent ones. reply pjmlp 6 hours agorootparentI don't consider being computer enthusiasts a synonymous with keyboard only use. As mentioned, I started into computing when TUIs were the only affordable computing model. There is no magic to me about whatever greatness of TUI and CLI. reply ucosty 7 hours agorootparentprevWe're talking about a web browser, right? What workflow? reply kstenerud 6 hours agorootparentIt's an elitism thing. Notice the terminology \"investing time to dramatically speed up workflow\". This is the mantra that the keyboard-only adherents have latched onto, and extend to EVERYTHING, including things that are perfectly serviced via mouse control, or don't even need speeding up. Arguing with them is like arguing with audiophiles. reply anonzzzies 6 hours agorootparentNot sure why arguing is needed? You like a mouse, I think it sucks. If we meet up, we can trivially measure what is faster. What is there to argue? reply codingdave 5 hours agorootparentOr we can not measure which is faster and just respect that everyone has their own preferences. reply goku12 3 hours agorootparentThe irony is that the side accusing keyboard users of elitism is asking them to respect everyone's preferences! Sure, but the keyboard users didn't start this discussion either. reply anonzzzies 5 hours agorootparentprevAlso fine :)) Just no need to argue about it. reply card_zero 2 hours agorootparentprevHow to make interfaces for popular software. Or even unpopular software. reply qwertox 2 hours agorootparentprevWhat strikes me as odd is that this browser is not in a terminal, but in a window. So no usage through SSH, no terminal benefits, which are the origin of the keyboard-oriented workflow. When I press F12, does an inspector open? Where does it open? When I select some words, how do I send them to a new tab in YouTube, Amazon, Google or Stack Overflow? How do I open all the links which are within a selected rectangle in new background tabs? Or use uBlock Origin's element picker? I'm pretty sure this browser is super fast and all is super optimized and a top tier workflow, but mostly in certain limited scenarios. reply ramenbytes 1 hour agorootparent> When I press F12, does an inspector open?

How do I open all the links which are within a selected rectangle in new background tabs? Or use uBlock Origin's element picker? What did you think of the demos? The sorts of things you mentioned seem like things doable in NYXT based on the demos, possibly even the exact sort of stuff they are trying to make possible. It looks like it's basically Common Lisp with a web browser attached, which suggests it should be fairly moldable too. I have not seriously used it myself though, so I can't say for sure what the limits are. reply raydev 1 hour agorootparentprevFinding relevant text quickly. On the web. The web is where you go to find more information. reply anonzzzies 6 hours agorootparentprevYou use the browser only to browse? We have all kinds of, usually quite shitty, web apps all types of LoB, ERP, etc. There is a lot of workflow to improve on. Not necessarily with Nyxt or keyboard of course. reply skydhash 2 hours agorootparentEven with a pdf browser, keyboard shortcuts come in handy. Especially with a big enough screen so that you can display the whole page at once. reply antasvara 1 hour agoparentprevAs a younger person, I've never really been alive for a computer that had no mouse. So for people of my generation, it's really only the tech savvy ones that would use key commands for anything but the most rudimentary stuff (think copy, paste, save, and print). Thats not to say that keyboard == hacker mentality, but that a keyboard-first tool like this wouldn't really target the average consumer at this point. reply shiomiru 6 hours agoparentprevFor best ergonomics, both should be well supported. If I'm programming and want to look up something in the docs, then it's annoying to switch to the mouse and then back, but I pretty much have to with traditional browser UI. (Or tab through a million links to find the right button to click, use cursor keys to scroll, etc.) Similarly, if I'm just scrolling around with the mouse, then I should be able to do everything that I can with the keyboard (apart from text input). The context menu is good for discoverability, but being context-dependent makes it impossible to rely on muscle memory. reply tsukurimashou 7 hours agoparentprevits a productivity thing, would you rather type text with a physical keyboard or would you rather use a virtual keyboard and mouse? you can miss more easily with a mouse and have to adjust the position of the cursor to line up on two axis before any action reply JTyQZSnP3cQGa8B 4 hours agorootparentI guess it depends on the kind of application. I use the keyboard a lot, but I'd kill myself if I had to use the git command-line interface. Once I bought Sublime Merge, I stopped learning what was (and still is) a waste of time to me. I'm faster with a global visual description and a mouse for some tools. reply skydhash 1 hour agorootparentWhile Sublime Merge is a nice piece of software, Magit is the very best example of a power user tool. Fast, versatile, and intuitive. reply kstenerud 7 hours agorootparentprevThat's a false dichotomy. I'd rather have a physical keyboard and a physical mouse (or touchpad). The \"line up the two axis\" thing is immaterial, and has no practical impact on actual productivity. reply dartos 5 hours agorootparentMinimal impact and no impact different. “Line up the two axes” was kind of a silly way to put it, but the position you aim your cursor varies quite often, but where you type on a keyboard doesn’t. You can develop muscle memory for the latter. It’s why hotkeys are so widely used. reply codingdave 5 hours agorootparentprevThat is a really biased way to spin things. Of course virtual keyboards are the worst of both worlds. And lining up a mouse on multiple axes is just an odd way to look at it -- on a keyboard you need to line up your fingertip on three axes for every keystroke, if you are wanting to go to that level of detail. reply dartos 5 hours agorootparentI don’t think it’s very biased. When using a mouse you need to completely move your hand to another device, and aim that device at an arbitrary position. With a keyboard the positions you move your fingers are fixed and because of that, you can develop muscle memory and type very quickly without thinking about where to move your fingers. It’s called “touch typing.” There’s no such thing for using a mouse since the target position of the mouse movement can vary wildly from website to website and can vary based on the position of a given window. reply codingdave 5 hours agorootparentUsing a mouse is completely natural if you do it often. So is using a pen on a tablet. Whatever you use, you get so used to it that is it an extension of your own hands or whatever you use to control input. Your own bias is showing in the assumption that you can develop muscle memory for keys but not other input devices, or that because links are in different places, the mouse becomes cumbersome. reply dartos 5 hours agorootparentYou can’t develop muscle memory when your target movement isn’t the same. Using a mouse is natural as in intuitive. You don’t need to really tech someone to use a mouse. It’s easy in that way. But that’s not the same as muscle memory. Using my hands is very natural, but when learning guitar, I still need to be conscious of what position my hand is going to be in. After a while, since my hand is constantly going to the exact same position, I develop muscle memory and no longer need to be conscious of where my hand is going. I feel like I shouldn’t need to explain muscle memory with analogy. reply jorvi 5 hours agorootparentprevTouchpads exist. A mouse (or rather, a floating cursor) is often a much more efficient way to get your cursor in position than slamming your arrow or hjkl keys multiple dozens of times. reply dartos 5 hours agorootparentTouchpads don’t solve for muscle memory for the same reasons mouses don’t. And yeah, of course. Most people who use keyboard based workflows dont just use hjkl to move a cursor around. In vim, for example, there are many more text-centric ways of moving around a document. Using a keyboard is generally much faster. Try using your daily code editor without any hot keys at all. No F5, no Ctrl-s, none of that. reply jorvi 4 hours agorootparent> Touchpads don’t solve for muscle memory for the same reasons mouses don’t. Uh, what? I have my touchpad tuned so that one swipe from top left to bottom right is exactly equal to going from the top left to bottom right of my display. And aside from that, how do you think people play FPS games, that they think about every mouse movement and then do it? > Most people who use keyboard based workflows dont just use hjkl to move a cursor around. > Try using your daily code editor One of the few usecases where you can do that, and in general is extremely heavily biased towards keyboard use. Having a touchpad or mouse is great because it is adaptable and versatile. It doesn’t require the application developer to have accommodated every step a keyboard user wants to optimize for. Not to mention there is no “quickly” using your keyboard with one hand if you constantly need to hold modifier keys :) > Using a keyboard is generally much faster. That was my point, it is until it isn’t. On any application without Vim or EMacs bindings I’ll happily be leaping over hundreds of lines of text with one or two swipes whilst you are sitting there, going taptaptaptaptaptaptaptaptaptaptaptaptaptaptaptaptaptap with horrid inefficiency. reply skydhash 1 hour agorootparent> I’ll happily be leaping over hundreds of lines of text with one or two swipes whilst you are sitting there I’d be doing search and land exactly where I need to be. For each important operation, there’s always a more efficient operations as shortcuts are composable in a way pointing is not. reply dartos 3 hours agorootparentprev> Uh, what? I have my touchpad tuned so that one swipe from top left to bottom right is exactly equal to going from the top left to bottom right of my display. And aside from that, how do you think people play FPS games, that they think about every mouse movement and then do it? I think that FPS players are conscious of where they are aiming. They don’t just automatically move their mouse in the exact same way to hit every enemy on screen. There may be some specific movements, like swiping or turning 180 degrees which have a specific motion (or gesture) related to it, but that isn’t the same as aiming, which you can’t memorize as where you aim is different every time depending on your targets position and movement. > Not to mention there is no “quickly” using your keyboard with one hand if you constantly need to hold modifier keys :) Yes there is :) > On any application without Vim or EMacs bindings I’ll happily be leaping over hundreds of lines of text with one or two swipes whilst you are sitting there. I’m sorry, but this is a bad argument. Obviously is software isn’t made to support keyboard centric use, it will not be great to use it only with a keyboard. Imagine if you were writing a book, but your software wasn’t made with keyboard support. You’d need to use the mouse to click every letter. Or one where each clickable button is buried in >3 layers of dropdown menus. That would be equally terrible. If you have an application optimized for keyboard interaction, it will be faster (tho less intuitive) to interact with it than one which is optimized for mouse movements. There is a good compromise between speed of use and intuitive usability which is mouse-centric with hot keys. But to interact as quickly as possible, you’d want to stick with one consistent input device, and motion based input devices don’t cut it. I mean use what you want though. If you like using a mouse, use it. reply pjmlp 6 hours agorootparentprevWhy bringing virtual keyboard into the picture, we aren't talking about tablets and phones. reply vunderba 2 hours agoparentprevI think you're projecting a bit. I'm sure there are a few weird KEYBOARD VS MOUSE people that occupy the same bizarre neurotic domain space as TABS VS SPACES, but most people just have their own personal preference and leave it at that. Personally, it's not about what's faster - it's about switching. If my hands are already resting lightly on the keyboard, then the keyboard is faster - and vice versa. To decrease the amount of switching I have to do, I use an extension called Vimium that quickly highlights all links with key bindings. For example \"g i\" automatically puts the firstlevel field into focus. https://github.com/philc/vimium reply goodpoint 7 hours agoparentprevKeyboard is not only faster, but requires less attention. reply pjmlp 6 hours agorootparentDepends on the typing skills between chair and monitor. reply sourcepluck 1 hour agoprevWhen are we getting a web engine written in SBCL? :) or how hard would it be, I wonder... One thing about Nyxt that's great is this idea of trying to push towards being renderer-agnostic. I'm not sure how achievable that is in reality, but when you hear the idea you think oh yeah, surely that would make sense if we want to have good things in the world. To all the people saying \"I like my mouse! Why are these keyboard people so elitist!\", the Nyxt people are not on a crusade against your lovely mouse. This isn't ratpoison (a window manager I adored using for a while, but that's a different story). I have never seen anything on the Nyxt blog or elsewhere claiming mouse-users aren't humans, with full rights, deserving of fine browsing experiences like the rest of us.

I'll give it another try. reply BoingBoomTschak 8 hours agoparentprevAs someone who used Qute for a long time: * Python is much slower than SBCL (yes, even if rendering is done by Blink); including the lack of threading * Bookmarks are pure crap, they don't have tags nor directories to sort them better * Less hackable (e.g. something that should be possible in Nyxt: https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/3933) * Massive gaps: https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/2328 https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/2492 https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/5731 (!!!) * Per domain/URL settings never progressed further than the initial batch of properties: https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/3636 * Adblocking is better than hostfile but still missing a lot compared to uBlock (https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/6480). No script blocking matrix like uBlock \"advanced mode\" at all. My impression is that it has been stuck in bug fixing/dependency churn for a long time now. Switched to Firefox while waiting for Nyxt to be usable (apparently, Nyxt 4 will be it). reply rnhmjoj 3 hours agorootparent> My impression is that it has been stuck in bug fixing/dependency churn for a long time now I don't think it's just your impression: it's exactly what happened. Depending on Qt for the rendering engine means the browser has been tied to the painfully long release cycle of the whole of Qt. Quickly fixing bugs or implementing new features is hard, they have to hack around limited APIs, beg for more and continually fix new bugs introduced by upstream (both Qt and google). reply wkat4242 8 hours agorootparentprevNyxt does have ublock origin?

Expecting to use emacs control characters from evil mode it a bit like using Kanji to write English. reply emptysongglass 10 hours agorootparentEvil (VIM emulation mode in Emacs) does not in any way behave like a second-class citizen. I use evil every single day and it's fantastic. Emacs is a text editor, yes, among other things. If anyone is reading this who hasn't tried Emacs, don't let takes like this spoil you giving Emacs a try. Doom Emacs is a fantastic experience to get started but there are more minimal starter kits that give you just evil-mode to start. reply llm_trw 7 hours agorootparentI literally said you can use evil mode to edit text. But trying to use vim inspired motion and editing in other modes is a terrible idea. Just learn how Emacs does it and stop thinking of everything as text. There is usually deeper semantic meaning behind the syntax that an Emacs mode will let you edit directly. reply Y_Y 9 hours agorootparentprevIf you want to write English using kanji I recommend starting here: https://www.zompist.com/yingzi/yingzi.htm reply jolmg 10 hours agorootparentprevIt was my experience too that it's better to commit to using Emacs like Emacs. `C-x SPC` is the Emacs way to select a rectangle of characters. reply devjab 9 hours agorootparentprevDoomemacs was everything I wanted Neovim to be for me personally.

However, I use old hardware, and it's a bit slow and laggy. Chromium behaves the same way, so I imagine this is due to WebKit and Blink being significantly heavier than Gecko. Firefox is really snappy on old hardware, at least when running Linux, and uses a modest amount of memory. reply wkat4242 7 hours agorootparentHmm for me on BSD it's the opposite.

PyCharm IDE on a moderately big project. We've recently focused on moving towards fully type hinted code base, using pyright as the checker/LSP. Which means I use a good-enough-but-not-great plugin which makes pycharm use pyright instead of the buggy heuristic based built in type \"engine\". And this is noticeable slower, which is part of my motivation for upgrading. Other part is to be able to play a few games. I could probably just upgrade my GPU, but I'm not sure if it's even possible (outdated PCI port on my MB I think) without getting something second hand. Third part is that I want to play more with the new NLP technology which is rapidly reaching a point where it should be possible to do a lot of cool stuff.

I'm not saying there should be tabs, but this is different. I tend to see a page and open interesting links in new tabs, so the tabs to the right of the current tab are related to this tab. So, there's a tree-like organization to the tabs, even though they're presented linearly. In this browser, that kind of information seems lost, at least in its stock configuration. Windows are also about particular topics, but here all windows have all buffers available. The fuzzy search doesn't really do anything for me. I'm not really interested in seeing e.g. all Amazon tabs together. I'd prefer to see some Amazon tabs that are about particular selections of books next to other tabs of various URLs and titles that are also about those particular selections of books, and in the tree/linear-like order they were opened in. Also, the tree-like order isn't always from following a link. I may, for example, check out a book on an Amazon product page, and a reviewer makes mention of other similar books, so I may open tabs next to this one that search those titles somewhere (DDG/Amazon/etc). If I were to make this usable for me, it's probably by automatically keeping record of what buffer I was on when I opened a new one, then making a buffer that presents this information in a modifiable tree. The fuzzy search can be replaced by a search in this buffer. It would simply scroll to the spot, so I'd have access to ancestors and descendants from the match. A benefit of generalizing to buffers rather than webpages is that presumably I could make simple placeholder buffers that act as parents representing topics where I would have used windows in the past. Also, I'd need keybindings to walk the tree like Ctrl-Tab and Ctrl-Shift-Tab. Maybe also a way to set the root node for a window, to limit the navigation of Ctrl-Tab in it. Another thing is that it also facilitates closing tabs when one's done with a topic. Firefox has \"close all tabs to the right\" for that, though one can also middle click a tab repeatedly until enough tabs have been closed to close a (sub)topic. The buffer tree would simply need to have some \"close this and descendants\" type of option. reply forgotpwd16 7 hours agorootparent>If I were to make this usable for me, it's probably by automatically keeping record of what buffer I was on when I opened a new one, then making a buffer that presents this information in a modifiable tree.

That's understandable for Iran which may want to avoid to overextend itself following the recent events, but it's hard to comprehend why Russia was unable to do anything at all. In any case, it seems like there are several very important events happening recently that may reshape the world for the years to come. reply sydd 11 hours agoparentRussia is putting everything it has to the Ukrainian front since 2.5 years and signs of exhaustion are clearly visible. They have lived up their Soviet tank reserves, are offering astronomical amounts of money for soldiers, are using north Korean ammunition, huge inflation etc reply TheAlchemist 11 hours agorootparentThat's what I'm thinking too. But if that's true, it means Ukraine has a real fighting chance to put them on their knees. In any case, this seems like a major loss for Russia. reply postingawayonhn 11 hours agorootparent> it means Ukraine has a real fighting chance to put them on their knees. Yes, and this point has been obvious to many for the last two years. The problem has been the west drip feeding aid into the largest war since WW2. We actually have to define the objective as reclaiming all Ukranian territory (at least to the pre-2022 borders) and supply them appropriately. It might be expensive in the short-term but we can afford it, can seize the $300B of Russian assets, and will be able to reduce our defensive forces in the future use to the reduced Russian threat. The problem now is that we may have run out of time with Ukraine experiencing significant manpower issues. They could mobilise a lot more people, but that will mean women and younger men (currently only 25+) from a generation that is already very thin. We can ask Ukraine to do this, but we they will need an ironclad commitment that we will supply them with everything they ask for. reply fooker 11 hours agorootparentThe purpose of the drip feeding is, unfortunately, to get Russia closer to a total collapse rather than a quick loss for them to retreat and build up their strength again for the next 20ish years to repeat it. It’s not ideal for Ukraine right now. reply Etherlord87 1 hour agorootparentI agree with this. russia is being lured into continued commitment by giving it a chance. I'm unusually impressed with how American intelligence played russia in this conflict. Of course there's another reason: russia is a nuclear power, and even though everyone seems used to its threats and makes nothing of it, a nuclear war is an absolutely terrible threat, possibly wiping entire humanity if it fails to endure nuclear winter. As a result, America/NATO is doing a dance, where it waits for russia to do something morally wrong, then respond to it with escalation, ready to criticize and sanction on moral grounds all russia's allies if they decide to respond with (political) support to russia. We're quite successful in my opinion, the escalation of the west is validated throughout the world, and the response to it on the russia's side wouldn't be, and would result in stronger sanctions. Had all the escalations of the recent 2 years be condensed to the first month of war, BRICS (and not only, e.g. the pope was quite supportive of russia, not sure if he still is) could unite and coordinate a response, and the west could possibly lose the war in the political sense, kind of like Israel lost it. I'm not putting an equal sign between Israel and Ukraine, but who would predict a few years ago common harsh criticisms against Israel in mainstream TV? reply Gud 3 hours agorootparentprevThis is giving too much credit to the competence of the same political leadership that has spent the last 30 years dismantling the European war machine(that was pretty solid up until the mid 90s) while Russia and China has been arming themselves to the teeth. reply jakjak123 1 hour agorootparentI concur, the slow drip feeding is adequately explained by coming from a place of war ineptitude and domestic priorities rather than a conscious strategy. reply postingawayonhn 11 hours agorootparentprevI have heard this argument before, but I'm not particularly convinced. Either way pretty much all their pre-war modern equipment has already been destroyed. Now they're fighting with really old stuff like T-55s pulled from storage, newly manufactured equipment, or whatever North Korea thinks it can spare. reply brabel 10 hours agorootparentYour impression of Russia's war capabilities is vastly mistaken. \"According to Joseph Fitsanakis, professor of intelligence and security studies at Coastal Carolina University, “Russian military production is currently outpacing that of the US and all of NATO member states combined. This may be hard to believe, but Russia is obligated to do it if it is going to outpace the support given to Ukraine.\" Source: https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/2/russia-races-ahead-... reply fardo 10 hours agorootparentIt shouldn’t be surprising that a country with a war economy has a higher first derivative at producing material, the question of import is 1. What is the difference between absolute quantities comparing against all relevant players, 2. How long would it take to bridge the gap at current production rates, and 3. Can that rate of production be sustained long enough for it to alter any fundamentals? The point to rebut isn’t that Russia is making more, it’s whether they can continue to do so ongoingly before Ukrainian advances, regime falter or economic collapse, US/China step-in, or internal unrest will dramatically weaken or make the current Russian negotiating position untenable. reply Etherlord87 55 minutes agorootparentLove the \"first derivative\" view! One can take a snapshot of a good day, but if russia really was producing more weapons than USA + NATO for a prolonged time, having also more people, Ukraine would fall a long time ago. It didn't. As we say in Poland \"paper will accept everything\". And russia is known for shameless propaganda. reply xg15 0 minutes agorootparentSo far, Russia is still making gains on the battlefield though, not Ukraine. Also, I don't think it's an \"until\" about China stepping in, they seem to be squarely on Russia's side, just presenting themselves slightly more moderate in public to appear suitable as a mediator. (Maybe sort of like the US does with Israel) wiseowise 10 hours agorootparentprevAll of this is irrelevant if Ukraine crumbles first. reply TheAlchemist 9 hours agorootparentSame goes for Russia, and is all seems pretty relevant. The article seem to indicate that it's much more sustainable for the West than for Russia. reply wiseowise 9 hours agorootparentIt’s not sustainable for Ukraine. reply aguaviva 1 hour agorootparentIt's not sustainable for -either- side. Both sides are aching (very badly) for this thing to be over, or at least taken off the stove. One can quibble further as to the details -- which are a matter of metrics, wildcards, politics. And (as recent events have shown) there are still many cards to be played. But that's the fundamental equation we need to keep in mind. reply fooker 8 hours agorootparentprevNATO is ensuring it’s just about sustainable. reply lukan 7 hours agorootparentYes, by pushing to reduce the drafting age, which the Ukrainian don't want to, because someone needs to raise families and Ukraine has a way lower population, while Putin brings in north koreans already. And can also escalate by general mobilisation at some point if cornered. So I don't see the outcome as clear. reply sabbaticaldev 8 hours agorootparentprevthe article is not the reality tho reply sincerecook 5 hours agorootparentprevOngoingly is not a word. reply KptMarchewa 1 hour agorootparentprevTheir \"production\" includes restoring stuff from the soviet equipment bases. When they make stuff from scratch, they are as much drip-feeding as west is, or even less - for example they make 6-8 Su-34s a year, while Lockmart is making 156 F-35s a year. reply postingawayonhn 9 hours agorootparentprevI partly agree, in that by drip feeding Ukraine supplies we have given Russia time to build up their production rates. And my earlier comment was disputing the idea that drip feeing the supplies was some kind of intentional strategy. With regards to the broader claim that Russian production is outpacing that of the west. Yes, with artillery shells that's probably true, though we are continuing to ramp production. There aren't really any other areas though where a combination of western production + stock drawdowns couldn't supply Ukraine with greater quantities of material. reply fooker 8 hours agorootparentThey have destroyed the rest of their industrial capacity and economy in the process, an outcome very much desired by US and friends. reply cutemonster 5 hours agorootparentRussia isn't that interesting any longer, economy wise. China is the competitor to the US nowadays. All Russia has is nukes and troll farms, and corruption. reply mensetmanusman 4 hours agorootparentRussia has all the minerals to support any size of Chinese war machine ramping. It’s not their economy that matters. reply cutemonster 1 hour agorootparentThat doesn't make sense. The minerals don't disappear just because Putin fails invading Ukraine. The minerals will be waiting in the ground no matter what. reply aguaviva 1 hour agorootparentprevIt seems that something like \"they've trashed their economy\" would have been a better choice of words. But -- \"destroyed\"? What's that supposed to mean? What purpose is served by the use of such hyperbolic language? reply fooker 8 hours agorootparentprevYes. Given their fall in Syria one might assume they are getting close to a breaking point. But it’s difficult to know for sure as they lie at every step of the process, even to themselves. reply hollerith 8 hours agorootparentAssad's fall doesn't signify much because we should expect Moscow to prioritize its own backyard. reply philistine 4 hours agorootparentSyria is Russia's backyard! It is not culturally close like Ukraine, but Syria has been an ally of the Soviet Union and Russia for decades through the Assad family. Nevertheless, Russia clearly chose to stop their support; the Assad regime was cooked. reply mahirsaid 1 hour agorootparentThings are not based on history anymore. It atleast as much as we might think. Russia just took a trip to Afghanistan to try build relations and encoporate a way to utilize Afghanistan. Historically this would make no sense since they have a bad history between each other out of all the countries in the region Afghanistan was the own Russia couldn't possess or influence in the past. That being said Russian lost many battles against Afghanistan against the very same government today \"taliban\". reply refulgentis 10 hours agorootparentprev> The purpose of the drip feeding is, unfortunately, Absolutely not, it's not intentional. - Suddenly, the world defense base needed to get on up to a level to match the world's 5th largest army, with all its stockpiles -- regardless of if its just lil ol Ukraine, Russia is putting its full effort in. - Politics in US delayed it several months, I can't recall the exact number, but it was at least 6. reply fooker 8 hours agorootparentThe war has been going on for a bit more than a thousand days now. Your points would have been valid maybe one year into the war. Unless you’re suggesting the US military industrial complex takes three years to respond. reply walterlw 5 hours agorootparentQuick reminder that Russia first invaded Ukraine in 2014, before that they invaded Georgia and before that they took Chechnia. And yet even now the popular belief in the West is that the war in Ukraine will be the end of it and that some sort of a peace deal can hold. reply lolinder 5 hours agorootparentThank you. It has been incredibly frustrating to watch the modern appeasement movement repeat the mistakes of the 1930s. You cannot appease an expansionist power that's intent on restoring the glory of an empire from days gone by (real or imagined). reply mensetmanusman 4 hours agorootparentFew believe Russia would risk expansion into nato territory. reply tacon 1 hour agorootparentOne report from early in the first Trump administration (possibly apocryphal) was when Trump was being briefed about NATO commitments to defend all member countries. Trump supposedly was surprised that the US was committed to going to war with Russia if they invaded Latvia. The Baltic countries are very exposed and could be reached by land only through a narrow gap with Poland. reply thunky 2 hours agorootparentprev> We can ask Ukraine to do this, but we they will need an ironclad commitment that we will supply them with everything they ask for Sounds like a good way to escalate the war. reply philwelch 5 hours agorootparentprevIs Ukraine actually the largest war since WW2? Is it bigger than the Second Congo War? reply stogot 5 hours agorootparentIn terms of manpower, weapon types, domains of warfare, quantity of equipment, global impact, and national security implications-Ukraine is the largest. In total violent deaths, 2nd Congo is worse. Let’s hope the war ends before that happens again reply theGnuMe 4 hours agorootparentprevUkraine is out of time because Trump was re-elected. Only Europe can save them now and that will put Europe at odds with Putin/Trump. reply mahirsaid 1 hour agorootparentprevThis is the result of allies helping Ukraine I don’t think they have any interest in Ukraine, but the alternative is Russia seizing Ukraine. This would have been possible 6 months after the war started. Remember that more than half of Ukrainians are not technically supporting zelensky. This conflict like many others is over complicated yet it's simplified in the west. reply mongol 1 hour agorootparentWhat do you mean with not technically supporting Zelensky? Do they not want to resist Russia like he does? Or do they prefer someone else to do it instead? reply scott_w 1 hour agorootparentprev> Remember that more than half of Ukrainians are not technically supporting zelensky. This is normal in any political system, even during times of war. The UK during WWII still had many Labour MPs, meaning a significant portion of the British electorate did NOT support Churchill by definition. However, most people were united in their opposition to the Nazis. That didn’t stop them voting out Churchill the first chance they got once the war was over. I don’t think anyone is seriously naive enough to think the entirety of Ukraine loves Zelenskyy without reservation, however its clear that the Ukrainian people have no desire to let the Russians expand their campaign of torture, rape and murder throughout the country. reply throw0101d 6 hours agorootparentprev> That's what I'm thinking too.

Given the speed and totality of the Syrian army's collapse they didn't really have anything to do that wouldn't be hideously draining on resources that they don't really have. The collapse of the Syrians may be related to the Russian military being distracted by the Ukraine war in an indirect or direct way.

More recent examples include the both sides of the Iran-Iraq war and Armenia in its war with Azerbaijan. GDP has implications for the productivity of an economy and the budget of the government. 41% of Russia’s government spending at the minute is on the war which means they have to either cut spending on other things weakening the state or drive massive debt and inflation. There’s a reason you can only run a war economy for so long - eventually you win the war or bleed your economy dry.

Russia, being too entrenched in Ukraine, wanted some global focus shifted away from Ukraine, and managed to get Hamas (probably via Iran) to attack Israel last October.

There's been a lot of writing that the support for the Ukraine war will only last as long as there's mainstream focus on it, and that no new wars pop up. 2. The Gaza plan failed. Israel attacks Hezbollah and Iran, which means neither of those can help Syria. The retaliation from Israel was too strong. 3. Vital support from Russia, Iran, Hezbollah is now severely limited. And that's pretty much that. The rebels in Syria saw their opportunity, and seized it. What's more, is that Syria has long been an important supply route for Iran and Hezbollah.

Also, it is a huge win for all the depots's propaganda efforts that today in many western countries people have been convinced \"democracy doesn't work\" because there are issues in their countries. If \"it doesn't work\" it's not that much different from a dictator, right? And if that is true, why are we helping in foreign wars that prevent the spread of the autocracy (Ukraine now, possibly Taiwan tomorrow). If democracy is a lie, there is no point to risk our wellbeing for Ukraine. Wrong. There is no more important cause in the world than stopping depots. Yes, democracy is not ideal, but it is as if comparing being angry you got a different topping on your pizza order vs starving to death. That is literally the difference. So my blood boils when I hear people online talk about \"stability\" (and by extension) \"why are we spending money on Ukraine when the infrastructure is falling apart here\". Because Ukraine is about the survival of our way of life, it is order of magnitude more important than local issues. Take an example from history.

    "originBody": "Reverse engineering the Sega Channel game image file format Introduction Sega Channel was a games-on-demand service that gave cable subscribers access to a library of around 50 Sega Genesis games per month in exchange for a monthly fee (typically $10-$15/month depending on the cable provider). It operated between June 1994 (with a nationwide rollout in December 1994) and June 1998. Cable subscribers would be given an adapter cartridge that would connect their Genesis to a cable TV line. On boot, the cartridge would search for the Sega Channel signal, then download the game menu. This process typically took around 20 seconds. The user would then pick a game and wait about a minute for it to be downloaded to the adapter's RAM. At this point, the game would function exactly the same as a retail cartridge. Turning the system off or pressing the menu button on the adapter would erase the downloaded game, but game save data was retained unless the user downloaded a different game. Besides retail games, Sega Channel offered a \"Test Drives\" section where users could play time or content restricted versions of games before they got a retail release. There were also a number of games that were only available via Sega Channel, although it seems that most of them were titles where either Sega or the publisher weren't confident enough in their quality to give them a physical cartridge release. Sega Channel was a modest success, peaking at around 250,000 subscribers. Sega Channel data was delivered to cable customers through a somewhat long-winded process. First, Sega Channel employees would select the game line-up and other content (game hints, manuals, news, digitized fan-art, etc.) for a given month. They would then send everything to a company called Foley Hi-Tech, who would create the game menu graphics/animations and insert all the monthly content. They ended up with a ~60MB file called a \"game image\", which was burnt to a CD and sent to a satellite uplink facility in Denver, Colorado. The CD would then be installed in the uplink game server computer, which would continuously transmit the game data in a loop over satellite. Cable headends all over the US would receive the satellite transmission and send it to cable subscribers. The data being sent in a continuous loop is how the service's \"interactivity\" was achieved at a time when cable TV providers could only transmit data to all subscribers and couldn't receive data (i.e. what game a given subscriber wants to download). When a user chose a game from the menu, their adapter was instructed to look through the Sega Channel data stream and pick out the data for the game they selected. The ~60MB game image file was transmitted at a rate of about 12Mbps using two 6Mbps carriers. Assuming that there were no signal problems, the user always got to play whatever game they picked in less than a minute (one loop of the data). The menu downloaded faster than this because additional redundant copies of it were added to the data stream to speed up downloads. Game Image In November 2024, the user RisingFromRuins on the Sonic Retro forum announced that he had found a Sega Channel game image CD for September 1996 while he was going through a lot of PC equipment he had bought years earlier. He posted pictures of the CD and uploaded a copy of the game image file on the disc. I thought it would be a fun project to see if I could extract the data from the game image file to see if there were any exclusive or prototype games on there. It's always neat to see games that nobody's been able to play for over 25 years. Process My first idea was to check out the image file's contents in a hex editor. Genesis games all have a standardized ASCII header, and I figured the game hints/downloadable manuals would be readable as well. Unfortunately, when I scrolled through the image file, there wasn't anything readable. My best guess was that the image file was either scrambled or encrypted. At this point, I hit a lucky break. In 2017, someone with the username tdijital had uploaded a backup CD from Foley Hi-Tech (company I mentioned earlier that made the Sega Channel menus) containing Sega Channel development materials. People had previously gone over some of the CD's contents and found some interesting stuff, including contest versions of Primal Rage, a couple quiz games from the Japanese version of Sega Channel, and standalone menu demo ROMs for December 1994 - January 1996 that could be run in an emulator and acted as time capsules for what was on the service that month. However, as far as I was aware, nobody had looked at any of the development tooling on the disc. My point of view was that if I wanted to extract the data from the game image file, it would be easier to reverse engineer the tooling that created the game image than to reverse engineer the Genesis-side downloading code and hope that the image file remained mostly intact during the data transmission process. After a bit of trial and error, I figured out how the image files were created. First, developers would add all the games, descriptions, news text, art, music, etc. using a program called MENUMAKR. They'd end up with a menu binary file and a script file (misleadingly named MENUSPIN.BAT despite not being a batch file) containing the ROM file paths, data offsets, how many copies of the ROM to include, and other metadata for each game. Next, they'd run a program written by Scientific Atlanta (a cable equipment company that Sega partnered with to create the Sega Channel broadcast equipment and cartridge adapter) called PKSPREAD. This would validate the contents of the MENUSPIN.BAT file and output a binary file called PMAP.DAT, which contained instructions on how to split up and process the menu and game data for transmission. Finally, they'd run another program written by Scientific Atlanta called NSF, which would use the PMAP.DAT file to encode all the input files and create the game image file. I decided that if I wanted to decode the image file, this was the program I should focus on. At this point, I hit another lucky break. I found that NSF.EXE had been compiled in debug mode, with optimizations turned off and with symbols embedded into the EXE. This meant that it would be easy to reverse engineer. Unfortunately, IDA Pro didn't automatically pick up the debug symbols from the executable, so I had to open NSF in Turbo Debugger (it was compiled with Borland C++ 4.1) and manually copy them over. Fortunately, the program was pretty small so this didn't take too long. I could have gone straight to writing a decoder program here, but I thought it would be a better idea to first write an equivalent program to NSF.EXE. That way, if I was able to make a byte-for-byte identical image file to one created by the DOS NSF.EXE utility, I knew I had the algorithm figured out correctly. I created a test game image file (what the above screenshots of PKSPREAD and NSF show) and set about trying to match it. It took me a day of work and another couple evenings of debugging, but I wrote an equivalent C program to NSF.EXE and got the output to match. My basic process was I had IDA open on one monitor and Visual Studio open on the other, and I tried to match the assembly as closely as possible. This led to a couple interesting insights. Whoever wrote NSF was likely a novice C programmer. They also spent considerable effort on making everything 1-indexed rather than 0-indexed (maybe they were a Pascal fan?). Note that I made no effort to try to get the compiled binary to match the original. In fact, it likely won't even compile as a C file under Borland C++ 4, as I used C99 declarations and stdint.h types everywhere. Simplified overview of what NSF does (click to expand) Once I figured out how NSF works, it was fairly easy to write a decoder program that would undo all these steps in reverse and spit out a bunch of individual data files. However, the data my decoder program output still wasn't valid Genesis ROM data: Thankfully, this was just because the game data was compressed before transmission. The tool used to compress ROMS was in the Foley Hi-Tech CD (GAMEEDIT.EXE) but I didn't have to reverse engineer it because a GitHub user named Octocontrabass had already done so. I used his/her \"unsa\" tool to decompress all the .SA files into standard ROM files. Findings The most notable games from the image file are the two exclusive games that were broadcast in September 1996, Chessmaster and Klondike. Chessmaster is a chess game that was available on many platforms in the 90s (but not Genesis) and Klondike is a solitaire game commissioned by Sega for Sega Channel and programmed by David Crane of Pitfall fame. Here's a categorized full list of all the games from the image file (list by ICEknight): Sega Channel September 1996 game list (click to expand) After I posted my findings, Black Squirrel on Sonic Retro found that it was possible to get the September 1996 menu running in an emulator by copying bytes 0-0x1003FF from one of the Sega Channel demo cartridge ROMs and appending the menu data from the game image to the end. Obviously the download functionality doesn't work, but it's still fun to look around in the menu. The final bit of content from the image file was the game instructions ROM. It looked like a normal Genesis ROM file, but when I tried to run it in an emulator I just got a black screen. The problem here turned out to be that the ROM was linked with a base address of 0x100000 rather than 0 like a normal cartridge. It seems like it was meant to be run directly out of the Sega Channel adapter's memory without it getting mapped to the normal cartridge address space. My best guess is this had something to do with the functionality for jumping into the manual for a specific game from the game menu. I got it working in an emulator by adding zeroes after the header until the code lined up correctly with the vectors in the header. When it's started like this, at boot you see a menu intended for developers with all the internal names for each game. At this point, all of the content from the game image file was now able to be run in an emulator. Conclusion I have to thank Tdijital for releasing the Sega Channel development backup CD, Octocontrabass for reverse engineeering the .SA compression format, and whoever at Scientific Atlanta compiled NSF.EXE in debug mode. This project would have been much harder without all of their assistance. Most of all, I have to thank RisingFromRuins for releasing the game image file. I hope if anyone else has a Sega Channel game image disc, they follow his example.

Really cool! reply abirkill 12 hours agoprevThis is not a dissimilar system to Teletext[1], which transmitted data in the blanking interval of a broadcast TV signal, and could be interpreted by a TV or other hardware with appropriate support. Teletext was pretty widespread throughout Europe in the 1980s and 1990s. It was typically used to transmit pages of information (news, weather, etc.) that could be viewed directly on the TV, but the BBC's Ceefax[2] Teletext service was also used to distribute software to the BBC Micro, when equipped with the appropriate Teletext Adapter[3]. In a similar fashion to the Sega Channel system, the Teletext system would broadcast looped data, with popular pages (such as news and weather) being repeated frequently so they would load quickly, and less popular pages taking longer to load (or more accurately, to wait for the next time they appeared in the looped data). I was interested to see that the Sega system used a bitrate of 8Mbps, which sounded pretty high for the mid-90s, but I see that Teletext had a bitrate of almost 7Mbps for PAL broadcasts, despite being roughly 15 years older!

It turns out that the 8Mbps number I eyeballed from looking at newspaper coverage of the service was incorrect. When the cable provider received the Sega Channel data stream, they'd split it into two 6Mbps carriers. This allowed them to transmit Sega Channel data without having to dedicate a channel to data, as they could put the carriers between cable channels or in the portion of the spectrum used for cable FM radio. I updated the webpage with the corrected figures. reply nanoxide 12 hours agoparentprevTeletext is still very much alive in Germany, pretty much every channel offers it.

In 6th grade, my friend had it. I didn't grow up with BBSes and had only learned about the Internet the year before (from the same friend), so the idea of downloading games was pretty wild. The service was way ahead of its time. IIRC, it was $15/mo. There was a monthly or weekly rotation of games, including some pre-releases. I think at one point we played Vectorman when it was still new in stores or possibly just prior to its official launch. reply sandoze 13 hours agoprevHad this back in the 90s for a month or two. It was amazing. A bit finicky. Our neighbors split out cable outside and it stopped working. Apparently needed a dedicated line. reply kotaKat 5 hours agoparentA lot of cable plant maintenance got its hand 'forced' with the introduction of Sega Channel and other interactive services. Who woulda thunk that a little blue hedgehog paved the way for cable Internet? ;) reply pram 15 hours agoprevApparently the hardware had 4MB of RAM in case anyone else was curious. reply ndepoel 8 hours agoparent4 MB is the maximum size of the console's ROM address space, so this would've allowed for any Genesis game to be published through this service, with the exception of the few games that used bank switching to go beyond 4 MB (really only Super Street Fighter II). 4 MB was a lot of RAM to be putting into a relatively cheap consumer electronics device in 1994, so I imagine some of the cost of that was subsidized by Sega and had to be covered by the subscription fees. reply MBCook 14 hours agoparentprevOh that’s pretty big. Obviously full sized games couldn’t fit in the built in 64k of normal RAM, so they had to be put somewhere. I only got to use Sega Channel once. I knew about it from reading magazines, but when we went to a family Thanksgiving gathering it turned out my cousins had it! I don’t know if they were a test market or not, I don’t remember what year it was so I don’t know if it had been deployed nationally yet. I don’t know if I realized how it worked. I think cable modems may have started to exist by that point so at the time I probably assumed it was actually two way communication. I would’ve killed to have it at home. Sega Channel is the first place I ever played Sonic 3-D Blast, the two have always been linked in my memory because of that. reply swozey 14 hours agoprevI don't know how I convinced my parents to get me this in elementary but not a single other person I ever met had heard of it. I had no idea it had interesting tech, definitely didn't know it used satellites. It was a really unreliable service, at least for me in Virginia. We had to call support all the time the short time I had it (1-3 months). ``` They would then send everything to a company called Foley Hi-Tech, who would create the game menu graphics/animations and insert all the monthly content. They ended up with a ~60MB file called a \"game image\", which was burnt to a CD and sent to a satellite uplink facility in Denver, Colorado. The CD would then be installed in the uplink game server computer, which would continuously transmit the game data in a loop over satellite. Cable headends all over the US would receive the satellite transmission and send it to cable subscribers. The data being sent in a continuous loop is how the service's \"interactivity\" was achieved at a time when cable TV providers could only transmit data to all subscribers and couldn't receive data (i.e. what game a given subscriber wants to download) ``` reply SllX 14 hours agoparent> I don't know how I convinced my parents to get me this in elementary but not a single other person I ever met had heard of it. It was an interesting almost niche thing. My cousins had a unit and the service which I played all the time, but trying to describe it to other children at school years after the fact was difficult because nobody had ever heard of it. Honestly it was a toss-up if they even knew what a Genesis was at that point in life. I didn’t even know what a Sega Channel was called until I had finally found a solid description online with an accompanying picture at some point in high school. reply jbmny 12 hours agorootparentI vividly remember playing Genesis in my living room as a kid when my parents were having friends over from out of town. My dad and his friend came in after a couple beers and my dad explained what I was playing. His friend knew all about Genesis already: \"We've got the Sega Channel. I play 50 games a year!\" I remember being very fascinated until he started laughing, which to me signaled that he was pulling my leg. I spent the next 30 or so years thinking the \"Sega Channel\" was a dumb joke from an inebriated friend of my dad's. Until today. Looking back, maybe my dad nudged him to change the subject so that I wouldn't spend the next month begging for a subscription. reply nerdix 13 hours agoparentprevI knew of no one that had Sega Channel and I only knew of its existence because I had a subscription to Sega Power around the time of its launch which was covered in the magazine. The article claims 250,000 subscribers at its peak but it might as well have been zero on my little world. It's interesting how a service could have a quarter million subscribers and you could have basically no proof that anyone used it at all. That would be unheard of today. If Sega Channel launched today. Those 250k subscribers would be posting on social media, creating dedicated subreddits, uploading review videos to YouTube and live streaming on twitch. Anyone with even a passing interest in it would encounter the content of its users. The internet has really made the world smaller. reply ndiddy 12 hours agoparentprevUsing satellites to transmit the game data wasn't TOO exotic, I imagine they did it because all the cable headends were already set up to receive national channels carried over satellite. Having centralized control of the game server also let them switch out the game images for timed events such as competitions. For regions outside the US, Sega went the simpler route of putting game servers at each headend and mailing out CDs each month. It makes sense that it was unreliable in certain areas, cable TV was analog back then so cable providers didn't really have to worry about signal noise being a serious problem until Sega Channel came along. reply omoikane 14 hours agoprevI didn't even know this service existed. Broadcasting games in a loop seems pretty clever, but I suppose ZX Spectrum already had games delivered over radio years before then. reply MBCook 14 hours agoparentIt’s interesting as a technical hack more as the way they figured out to get it over cable before DOCIS and 2-way communication.

Teletext also worked like this, and this service does not need interactivity, so it doesn't need 2-way communication. reply Cthulhu_ 9 hours agorootparentAt one point Teletext on some channels had a two way system of sorts - a chat service where people could send messages over SMS to a paid for service, which would then be broadcast over teletext. reply epcoa 8 hours agorootparentprev> figured out ... DOCSIS and 2-way communication. It's not even so much 2 way communication in the local cable system as the fact that cable TV companies were not originally ISPs.

This means that we get a mediaeval cathedral looking like it did when it was conceived and built (with an extra spire and a few other things). The colours are amazing. Elderly churches, mosques and temples (int al) have a habit of losing their original colours and \"feel\" across the centuries. They change - age. Stone walls age and thanks to modern pollution darken. Pigments age, disperse and peel off. Notre Dame has been restored.

The beauty of a building is more than just its physical materials but also those things for which it was built and those people who built it reply tsimionescu 11 hours agorootparent> The entire thing can be rebuilt and it will still be the real Notre Dame de Paris. It'd have to stop being used for the original function. This is demonstrably wrong, as we have many examples of old buildings and we know what people actually feel about them. Consider two very famous examples of buildings that completely changed their purpose, but are still the same building: the Pantheon and the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul. The Pantheon was a Roman temple to all of the Gods when it was built in 126, and became a Christian church ~400 years later, but everyone recognizes it as the same building. The Hagia Sophia was a Christian church built in 537, and 1100 years later became an Islamic mosque, but it is still the same building to everyone. Then for the opposite example: St Peter's Basillica at the Vatican. This was built in 1506 on the site of a much older church, also called St Peter's Basillica (commissioned by emperor Constantine), which also served as a Christian church, was also used the parish of the Pope, was also the location of papal coronation and so on. And still, no one would say \"St Peter's Basilica was built by Saint Constantine\", because the current basilica is universally recognized as a new building, despite serving the same function. A building is recognized for the beauty and specifics of its structural and painterly elements, not for its role. If it is destroyed and rebuilt in almost the same size and shape, then it is recognized as the same building; regardless of entirely changing its purpose. Conversely, if a building is rebuilt into a completely different shape, even a universally admired as beautiful one, it is considered a different building, even if keeps serving the same purpose. reply anon291 4 hours agorootparentThe Pantheon no longer exists. It is now the church of St Mary and the Martyrs. And this is the difference I'm getting at. The Pantheon is a temple dedicated to all the ancient Roman gods. It cannot be both that and the Church of St Mary and the Martyrs. When the Church took it over, it ceased to be the Pantheon. There's no doubt the building is the same, and we can argue about how 'true to form' it is. But that's the point. When it stopped being what it originally was, its 'form' is now a goal to never deviate from. Whereas, the various depictions of the martyrs present within the Church of St Mary and the Martyrs, for example, has no such ideal yet. The Church can (and does) shift that around. However, if it were to stop being the church of st Mary and the Martyrs, then it would have an ideal form that any restorer may want to restore it towards. reply tsimionescu 1 hour agorootparentYou could try doing a search for the Pantheon vs the Church of St Mary and the Martyrs to see which is alive in the general consciousness and which isn't. Ultimately, the Pantheon is not a temple to the Roman gods, it's a particular building in Rome. It used to be a temple, now it's a church, maybe 100 years from now it will be an exhibition space. It will still be the same building. And the building is far more culturally important then the current parish inhabiting it. reply matt-attack 11 minutes agorootparentFor what’s its worth, this conversation has been a treat to read.

I was very surprised to learn this is indeed true. \"As the flames engulfed the cathedral, a whopping 400 tonnes of lead from the roof and spire went up in smoke, according to French authorities.\" \"The decision to rebuild the spire and roof of Notre-Dame exactly as they had been in the 19th century by covering them in lead deepened the anger already felt by the members of Notre-Dame Lead and raised the eyebrows of politicians, non-profits and local residents. To justify the decision, the institution in charge of restoring the cathedral, Rebuilding Notre-Dame de Paris, ruled out any danger of direct exposure to the substance. “Covering the roof structures of the nave, the choir and two arms of the transept with lead does not expose any member of the public to lead, as they are located some forty metres from the ground and are inaccessible,” the institution told French daily newspaper La Croix in a December 2023 article, assuring it was taking the matter “very seriously”.\" reply canucker2016 14 hours agorootparentLater in that article: “But Notre-Dame was not the only location to be affected,” Toullier pointed out. “Lead levels were very high all around the cathedral, on metro platforms, in bookshops on the Place Saint-Michel and even in surrounding schools.” At the end of summer 2019, Notre-Dame Lead reported levels of up to 123,000 μg/m², which represented 25 times the \"standard\" threshold of 5,000 µg/m² set by the regional health authority ARS, at the Place Saint-Michel, a 10-minute walk from the cathedral. “Yet no significant clean-up operation was carried out. It was as if the problem didn’t exist,” Toullier lamented. “But what about run-off water from the roof, which will be laden with lead?” asked Thébaud-Mony. In a notice published in January 2021, the French High Council for Public Health estimated that “the roof of Notre-Dame alone … would emit around 21kg of lead per year (about two tonnes per century) in run-off water”. “Lead could have been replaced by another substance like zinc or copper,” said Thébaud-Mony. “When alternatives exist, why choose lead and risk human health?” This was the case for the Chartres cathedral, destroyed by a fire in 1836. The original structure had lead roofing, which was replaced by copper when it was rebuilt.

In more detail, Notre Dame's new fire protection system rests on five pillars. The first is surveillance. “In addition to thermal cameras, an air suction and analysis system will be in constant operation,” explains the public institution in charge of restoring Notre Dame of Paris. “Any outbreak of fire detected by at least two pipes will automatically trigger the misting system.” The system will release a mist consisting of fine droplets of water diffused into the wooden framework, which, if necessary, will considerably reduce the temperature in the space and smother the incipient fire. The third pillar is the thickening of the batten: the thin planks of wood that separate the trusses from the lead roofing. “One millimeter thick has a fire resistance of one minute: We added 15mm [0.6”, editor’s note], giving the fire a quarter of an hour less chance of spreading to the roof,” explains the company. Fire-stop trusses have been installed to separate the spire from the choir on one side and the nave on the other. They divide the space in three, preventing or delaying the spread of fire from one to the other. Finally, the entire network of dry columns has been redesigned to facilitate firefighting operations. The flow of water that can be mobilized has been multiplied by three to reach up to 600m3 (264 gallons) of water per hour. reply aeronaut80 12 hours agorootparent600m3 is 132,000 imperial gallons.

While lead has it's disadvantages, it was probably the best choice of them. Lead - the traditional material using for cathedral roofing is easy to work with, easily soldered to prevent leaks, but is heavy and is toxic when burned. Copper - Also a traditional material that is easy to work with, also easily soldered to prevent leaks, is lightweight and non-toxic. But the roof would be green afterwards (once it oxidizes) not dull gray. Steel - Lightweight, can be cut & bent to fit around crenelations. But can't be soldered - any waterproofing would have to be done with caulking & crimping other steel over joints. Available colors to match the original lead. Won't last as long as some other choices (it eventually rusts). Composite asphalt shingles - just no. Wooden shingles - Moderately difficult to work with. Easily burns. Will get moldy unless treated with chemicals. Slate tile - Very difficult to work with, but inflammable. Heavier than lead and is brittle. But it would have a similar color to the lead its replacing. Concrete tile - similar pros + cons as slate, but cheaper and doesn't last quite as long. reply henearkr 3 hours agorootparentCopper is the best choice from your list. Color is ok. Anyway the original color of the outside of the cathedral was nothing comparable with the monochrome stone white of today (that's right, churches and cathedrals were artistically painted, in the Middle Ages).

It was very cool, but the new one looks like an obsessional desire to remain true to the old form. At one point there was talk of Gehry redesigning it: that would've been interesting! Because when the Notre Dame was rebuilt last, it reflected the architectural limits of its time, the height of the medieval ability and imagination. It is strange to simply replicate that today, when we could do so much more, when the Sagrada Familia, for instance, represents with more force the modern condition. reply aubanel 11 hours agoparentWhy would you want Notre Dame to represent modern condition ? I'm very happy it was not the way you suggest, because that would have been a high risk of getting a ugly/huge/provocative addition by a modern fame-craving architect, à la Le Corbusier or Jean Nouvel. This is a 1000 years old church that has hosted France's history, not a company office in Manhattan. reply DiscourseFan 8 hours agorootparentThere are many catacombs in Paris. Nobody knows how deep the system goes. They were there before Haussmann, before the Normans, before the Goths, before the Romans, perhaps even before the Gauls. Your idea of what is French, however, is not what is buried underneath in the collective unconsciousness of the city, what supports it, but instead the reproduction of what people want to believe represents the city. But the Notre Dame no longer exists, it was a symbol of the power of a Medieval state. Paris today is a city of malls, broad avenues and apartments. We kid ourselves to believe that putting it back will \"continue\" its history: the history is buried under the immediately visible surface, its waiting for you to get lost in it. If we could build something that might unearth that history, perhaps it might be possible to begin to remake the city of Paris once again. reply profsummergig 8 hours agorootparentI read somewhere that the catacombs were the result of needing cemetery land for building on.

Just like the political state of the church. Major conservative donors blocked any attempt of modernization of Notre Dame. They insisted on reusing lead for the roofing. Highly inflammable wood for the hidden frame. reply atombender 6 hours agoparentprev [–] I'm a big fan of modern architecture, and I understand where you're coming from. That said, I think the main argument for sticking to the traditional design that architectural consistency trumps modernism. There are countless examples of old buildings being retrofitted with a modern one, and it rarely works well. You usually end up with this kind of cyberpunk Borg look of old tech merging with new tech, with some futuristic augmentation sticking out like a sore thumb rather than blending in organically. Of course, maybe someone could have come up with something that would have worked, if given time. The one design submission I quite liked was Vincent Callebaut's faceted glass roof and spire, but the other submissions were not great. The Sagrada Familia is church built completely from scratch, so it's not really a fair comparison. It's also not a modern design; Gaudi was pretty unique even in his time, but design was ultimately a product of a particular age. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

Computers are particularly easy for that age group to learn about, all you really need is internet access to read articles or possibly (pirated) ebooks, and your own computer to experiment on. A lot of kids have both. Other industries aren't like that, some require expensive and uncommon equipment (biology, chemistry, now AI), some are a lot more dangerous (electronics, DIY), some require interactions with other people to practice (law, medicine, foreign languages), and nobody treats kids seriously enough to interact with them in that way, some have legal restrictions (medicine, driving cars) etc. It also helps that, to a clueless parent, a kid learning to code is indistinguishable from a kid using their computer to play games, and plenty of kids do that. Society doesn't let kids get a real programming job, even if they're perfectly capable of doing so, so hacking is often the next best thing. The fact that it's \"cool\" and that you can do it to impress your peers doesn't help either. Incidentally, this is also why kids are such good drug dealers. reply buran77 5 hours agorootparentIt's not just a matter of skill.

U.S. Department of Justice suspends controversial airport search program after ANF investigation. By Brendan Keefe Published: Dec. 3, 2024 at 2:42 PM UTC|Updated: Dec. 3, 2024 at 5:19 PM UTC ATLANTA, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - With a single sentence, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has ended a nationwide program that had seized untold millions in cash from airline passengers without arrests. “I am directing that the DEA suspend conducting consensual encounters,” wrote Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco in a Nov. 12, 2024, directive to the Drug Enforcement Administration. The directive was an immediate response to a report from the Justice Department Inspector General that was set in motion by Atlanta News First Investigates. The award-winning investigation, In Plane Sight, has been viewed millions of times on YouTube. One of those viewers took action because of it, setting off a chain of events that led the Justice Department to shut the program down. Earlier this year, David (who wanted his identity concealed because his employer does business with the government) said no to a “consensual search” at the boarding gate for a flight from the Cincinnati Northern Kentucky Airport to New York City. David had seen the Atlanta News First Investigates report that suggested asking agents, “Am I free to go?,” or “Am I being detained?,” when confronted at airport boarding gates. David said he refused to give consent because of what he saw in the Atlanta News First Investigates YouTube video. A DEA task force officer said David was free to go, but agents would detain his bag. David asked multiple times if he was being detained, and then walked on the plane with his backpack. DEA Task Force Officer Nicholas Nimeskern followed David onto the plane and removed his bag without a warrant or probable cause. “So I pulled out my phone and started recording him,” David said. On the video, the officer can be heard saying, “I don’t care about your consent stuff,” when David repeatedly denied the agent’s requests to search his bag. Nothing was found inside, but David missed his flight. Inspector General report The Justice Department Inspector General reopened a decades-long investigation of the Operation Jetway program after seeing David’s video, which was first published by the non-profit Institute for Justice. “Without the subject, the individual, thinking to immediately use their cell phone to record the event,” said Inspector General Michael Horowitz, “in fact, we clearly wouldn’t have known about it because absent that video, there was no record of the incident.” When the Office of The Inspector General requested records of David’s search, the DEA responded no records existed. “The DEA wasn’t keeping records of its encounters unless it found cash or drugs,” Horowitz said. “When we began our investigation and asked for the paperwork, that’s when, months later, they started creating paperwork trying to lay out why they did what they did,” Horowitz added. The secret airline informant As part of its investigation in 2023, Atlanta News First Investigates discovered Transportation Security Administration agents and airline employees received informant fees for tipping off the DEA to passengers likely carrying large amounts of cash. Traveling domestically with any amount of currency is legal in the U.S.; only international travelers are required to declare carrying $10,000 or more in currency. David was not carrying a large amount of cash with him on the flight. The DOJ Inspector General found out David was stopped because an airline employee paid by the DEA had reported him for buying a last-minute ticket. ‘It turned out that the individual was getting a percentage of the amount seized on multiple occasions over a longer period of time,” Horowitz said. The IG report showed one airline employee “has received tens of thousands of dollars from the DEA over the past several years for seizures resulting from information [they] provided of travelers with tickets purchased within 48 hours of their flight.” The Inspector General told Atlanta News First Investigates there was no other evidence of drug trafficking in David’s case, other than his purchase of a last-minute ticket to New York City, where he lives. “Approaching individuals based solely on that basis, without any lead, any other information to suggest they might be a drug courier or money launderer was concerning,” Horowitz said. Sen. Ossoff inquiry A draft of the Inspector General’s report landed on the Attorney General’s desk days before a inquiry from Georgia U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff, who demanded answers after seeing the Atlanta News First Investigates report featuring David’s video. “It is a scathing description of serious deficiencies in this program that impact the constitutional rights of my constituents in Georgia,” Ossoff said. “And I don’t know whether without reporting from Atlanta News First that would have come to light.” Ossoff said he particularly concerned with the informant fees paid to airline employees who were alerting the DEA to passengers without any evidence of criminal activity. “If informants are being paid with confiscated property from searches that the informants triggered with no real evidence, it’s obvious why that’s a potential abuse and a potential violation of civil rights,” Ossoff said. Plainclothes agents nowhere to be seen at airport The Nov. 12 directive ordered the immediate suspension of the entire DEA cold consent encounter program nationwide. That directive was revealed publicly only when the Office of Inspector General released its report Nov. 21, 2024. Atlanta News First Investigates went to dozens of airport gates in Georgia, Washington, D.C., and Louisiana since the directive was issued, and saw no sign of the plainclothes drug agents previously recorded searching passengers at boarding doors. The DOJ directive does allow the DEA to search suspects of drug trafficking “as part of a pre-planned activity in an ongoing, predicated investigation involving one or more identified targets or criminal networks.” In Plane Sight: How police are allowed to steal your money at the airport The directive explicitly bans searches predicated only on tips received from airline employees about last minute ticket purchases, like the one that put David on the DEA search list. “The receipt of travel information from a confidential source, standing alone, does not constitute the type of predicated, ongoing investigation which will support a consensual encounter,” the Deputy Attorney General wrote. DEA responds The DEA had not responded to Atlanta News First Investigates questions or requests for interviews for over a year, after the agency had declined an initial interview request. After the airport search program was suspended, Atlanta News First Investigates reached out to the agency again by email. “DEA is relentlessly committed to its core mission: saving American lives,” the agency said. “We regularly review our enforcement efforts and programs to ensure that we are using resources in the best way to fulfill that mission. For the last several months, DEA has been conducting an internal review of its Transportation Interdiction Program, which has been suspended. That review is ongoing. The DEA is committed to executing our mission with integrity and professionalism at every turn.” Atlanta News First Investigates also reached out to Nimeskern through his primary employer, the Montgomery (Ohio) Police Department. Police Chief John Crowell responded, “I will check with him, but I doubt he wishes to speak to you.” If there’s something you would like Atlanta News First Chief Investigator Brendan Keefe to look into, email him directly at brendan.keefe@wanf.com.

    "commentBody": "Airline informant received thousands from passenger cash seizures (atlantanewsfirst.com)196 points by soraminazuki 16 hours agohidepastfavorite65 comments josephscott 13 hours agoI ran into this exact issue trying to board a flight from the USA to Tokyo, a number of years ago. About 2 steps from getting on the plane a plain clothes cop pulled me aside and searched my luggage. The only thing he asked about, repeatedly, was if I was carrying cash. Fortunately for me, I was not. After he made sure to go through everything I had he let me get on the plane. When the only thing he was concerned about is if I had any cash on me, it sure felt like an attempted robbery. He never asked about drugs or anything else illegal I might have had. This needs to come to an unqualified stop. reply Mountain_Skies 13 hours agoparentThough you probably will never know why, there must be some reason why you were identified as someone who is likely carrying large amounts of cash.

The point is, this whole \"cold consensual search\" policy was based on nothing other than the officer's personal opinion for who should be approached and searched; because it was theoretically \"consensual\", they didn't need any kind of basis for making the determination. reply Terr_ 12 hours agorootparentprevFeels like a general police stop abuse in a new context: You're free to go as long as you don't actually try to go, because exercising your rights makes you \"suspicious.\" reply whaaaaat 12 hours agorootparent\"You can decline to consent, but you'll miss your flight because we'll detain you for an hour\".

I privately term it a \"legal bat signal\". It would not be a phone nor an app - instead, it would be a very distinctive object that would be difficult and expensive to mock up and it would function as a one-way alert: if triggered, an actual lawyer races to your physical location. The trigger would be un-cancelable. Instead of tying it to your own, specific lawyer, there would be broad agreements that any lawyer could enter into placing them \"on-call\" for a legal-bat-signal and then the closest (and fastest) one gets the call. This is quite dystopic, however: basically, very rich people would have a (figurative) hand-grenade that they could pull out and dare LEOs to make them press it. Further: persons with resources represent one of the best sources of pressure to change these systemic problems. If persons with resources exempt themselves from this kind of overreach then we lose that pressure. reply pbnjeh 12 hours agoprevYears ago, someone well-known quipped that the biggest gang in Chicago was the police.

There are even consulting companies that will teach police what to look for to maximum asset forfeiture gains like types of cars, best with out of state plates (so its harder for them to come back to the local courts to appeal), etc etc. None of it was about preventing crimes, all of it was about maximizing profits - much of which they can keep and spend as they like without any oversight. reply ThePowerOfFuet 4 hours agoparentprev> People argue that it's only a few bad cops who make the rest look bad.

Due to missing my train, and needing to rebook on short notice, I was flagged by an Amtrak insider and searched repeatedly on the way from Chicago to San Francisco. First search I consented to, as it's a condition of Amtrak passage. By the time cops were approaching me again for more inspection on a train platform in Reno, I was really burnt out and furious at the loss of the fourth amendment in this country.

The absolute disdain that that cop has for constitutional rights is appalling. And what's more appalling is that this kind of thing happens so much; that there's nothing stopping it. Cops seize property with no justification all the time, and there's so little recourse. Sure, occasionally a program like this might be stopped, but there's nothing stopping them from starting it back up again in a slightly different form. They spend years seizing money from thousands of people and paying kickbacks for it; maybe some of the folks were doing it for illicit purpose, maybe some weren't, it's hard to know because there's no due process of law, civil forfeiture just lets cops take money from people on the flimsiest of suspicion. The 4th amendment is meaningless as long as civil asset forfeiture exists. reply whaaaaat 12 hours agoprevACAB. These cops, like literal generations of cops before them, work in a system that financially and socially rewards and reinforces this behavior. We need to stop thinking about cops as the good guys by default, and really start examining the systems that we've built to give them power. Especially unchecked power like this where they can train a dog to mark on a bag, use that training to get probable cause, and then steal whatever they want within the bag. It's not just a few bad apples, it's a systemic issue that needs systemic fixes. Because if you put most humans in a position where they can get tens of thousands of dollars a year, without consequence, and be told they are heroes for doing so... it's going to be difficult to resist. We need to sharply cut back on police power, sharply cut back on police presence (do we really need DEA agents \"cold checking\" airline passengers because they bought a ticket late?) reply zarzavat 9 hours agoprevIn many countries the police will ask for bribes but they will not take all the money you have on you, there is still a distinction between the police and thieves. reply calmbonsai 12 hours agoprevI know I'm gonna' sound like a broken record, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41563553 but civil forfeiture should be unlawful and is most assuredly unconstitutional.

Do you have knowledge of these DEA consensual searches happening at airports or other mass transit hubs after November 12? Or are you referring to broader law enforcement attempts to do consensual searches or civil asset forfeiture seizures, which are absolutely still a problem? I guess my point is, there are still massive problems with the way policing happens in this country. But the Biden administration has ordered this particular problematic behavior to end, specifically in response to the incident brought up in this article. So, are you just making vague generalizations, or do you have actual knowledge that this program has not ended? reply yyuugg 1 hour agorootparentCivil asset forfeiture, including by the DEA, is still very much a thing. Having a President end it in airports affects some tiny fraction of the broader problem. And it only ends it until a future admin un-ends it. I could see both democrats and republicans deciding that they will allow this practice again. I think it's much more correct to call the practice \"paused\" until we legislate it away. \"Ending\" implies a finality we cannot possibly be comfortable with. reply lambda 58 minutes agorootparentYeah, I agree with you that there are larger problems that still need to be addressed; and that this stop isn't necessarily permanent, but something temporary that might come back once there are more controls in place. But situations like this are nuanced and complex, and we are in a better position than we were a month ago, due to actions by the Biden administration. It is easy, especially in cases of such long running problems like civil asset forfeiture, to get cynical and fall into the mentality that there's nothing that can be done. That's not the case. It is possible to improve things, through political and legal processes. Not always as easy as you would like. Frequently slower, and with regressions. But progress is possible, and it's worth keeping track of who makes that progress to inform future voting patterns.

    "originBody": "Researchers have developed a web plug-in to help those looking to protect their mental health make more informed decisions. Jarret BencksDepartment of Brain and Cognitive Sciences Publication Date: December 5, 2024 Press Inquiries Caption: New research analyzed the web browsing habits of more than 1,000 participants by using natural language processing to calculate a negative score and a positive score for each web page visited. Credits: Image: Unsplash People struggling with their mental health are more likely to browse negative content online, and in turn, that negative content makes their symptoms worse, according to a series of studies by researchers at MIT. The group behind the research has developed a web plug-in tool to help those looking to protect their mental health make more informed decisions about the content they view. The findings were outlined in an open-access paper by Tali Sharot, an adjunct professor of cognitive neurosciences at MIT and professor at University College London, and Christopher A. Kelly, a former visiting PhD student who was a member of Sharot’s Affective Brain Lab when the studies were conducted, who is now a postdoc at Stanford University’s Institute for Human Centered AI. The findings were published Nov. 21 in the journal Nature Human Behavior. “Our study shows a causal, bidirectional relationship between health and what you do online. We found that people who already have mental health symptoms are more likely to go online and more likely to browse for information that ends up being negative or fearful,” Sharot says. “After browsing this content, their symptoms become worse. It is a feedback loop.” The studies analyzed the web browsing habits of more than 1,000 participants by using natural language processing to calculate a negative score and a positive score for each web page visited, as well as scores for anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust. Participants also completed questionnaires to assess their mental health and indicated their mood directly before and after web-browsing sessions. The researchers found that participants expressed better moods after browsing less-negative web pages, and participants with worse pre-browsing moods tended to browse more-negative web pages. In a subsequent study, participants were asked to read information from two web pages randomly selected from either six negative webpages or six neutral pages. They then indicated their mood levels both before and after viewing the pages. An analysis found that participants exposed to negative web pages reported to be in a worse mood than those who viewed neutral pages, and then subsequently visited more-negative pages when asked to browse the internet for 10 minutes. “The results contribute to the ongoing debate regarding the relationship between mental health and online behavior,” the authors wrote. “Most research addressing this relationship has focused on the quantity of use, such as screen time or frequency of social media use, which has led to mixed conclusions. Here, instead, we focus on the type of content browsed and find that its affective properties are causally and bidirectionally related to mental health and mood.” To test whether intervention could alter web-browsing choices and improve mood, the researchers provided participants with search engine results pages with three search results for each of several queries. Some participants were provided labels for each search result on a scale of “feel better” to “feel worse.” Other participants were not provided with any labels. Those who were provided with labels were less likely to choose negative content and more likely to choose positive content. A followup study found that those who viewed more positive content reported a significantly better mood. Based on these findings, Sharot and Kelly created a downloadable plug-in tool called “Digital Diet” that offers scores for Google search results in three categories: emotion (whether people find the content positive or negative, on average), knowledge (to what extent information on a webpage helps people understand a topic, on average), and actionability (to what extent information on a webpage is useful on average). MIT electrical engineering and computer science graduate student Jonatan Fontanez '24, a former undergraduate researcher from MIT in Sharot’s lab, also contributed to the development of the tool. The tool was introduced publicly this week, along with the publication of the paper in Nature Human Behavior. “People with worse mental health tend to seek out more-negative and fear-inducing content, which in turn exacerbates their symptoms, creating a vicious feedback loop,” Kelly says. “It is our hope that this tool can help them gain greater autonomy over what enters their minds and break negative cycles.” Share this news article on: X Facebook LinkedIn Reddit Print Paper Paper: “Web-browsing patterns reflect and shape mood and mental health\" Related Links Digital Diet plugin tool Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences School of Science Related Topics Research Mental health Brain and cognitive sciences Internet Social media Artificial intelligence Natural language processing School of Science Related Articles In online news, do mouse clicks speak louder than words?

Things that I have no control over. Don’t get me wrong it’s good to be informed about these things but constant influx of such information is not helping anyone.

The problem is thinking that you have no control, an awful meme that is depressing - almost the definition of depressing - and self-fulfillingly self-defeating. The most powerful force in the world is public opinion in Western countries, especially in the US - that's why so many powerful parties invest so much to manipulate it. There are many entire news organizations, endless opinion writers/etc., influence campaigns run by everyone from corporations to political organizations to state intelligence agencies, etc. What are they all working so hard at, investing so much in, if it doesn't matter? Public opinion is formed by you acquiring information (including mis-info or dis-info), analyzing it, and communicating socially with others about it. Because many others don't do that, and most who do just repeat from received narratives, if you do it - if you form narratives - you have even more power. No single person ever accomplished anything - everything worthwhile has been done by humans in groups. We are social creatures, not lone wolves - that's how we operate; if you act like a lone wolf then yes, you will be mostly powerless. But if you act within a group, and especially if you act intentionally and intelligently, you have significant power. reply jumping_frog 6 hours agorootparentTo support you, I will provide an example.

His activism and relentlessness is what forced Canada to adopt it. \"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.\" — Margaret Mead reply buran77 6 hours agorootparentMost people don't find a small measure of indirect control equally reassuring as a large measure of direct control. For example I can directly control my water usage but have very little indirect control over the world's water usage. So psychologically things out of direct control tend to be felt like outside of control. As for the exceptional people who managed to wrestle that small indirect control into direct control and an actual result, there's also the likelihood to consider. Most people aren't exceptional and they realize it, it's right there in the word. Trying and failing to be the exception can lead to at least as much but probably more psychological pressure and suffering as just feeling out of control. I'm happy that those people exist but for almost everyone else, direct control is the only thing that gives them mental relief. If you follow negative content it just amplifies the initially almost inconsequential realization that you have close to no control into a very consequential bad state of mind. The short of it is: don't go chasing the things that push your buttons the wrong way, and don't make unrealistic expectations especially about fixing the aforementioned things. reply 1shooner 17 hours agoparentprevI've come to a similar conclusion.

It's not that I want to be completely ignorant of e.g. US politics, but maybe I try a 30 minutes summary of concrete facts per week, rather than what I used to get when I would drop onto national news sites as a distraction or focus break. If I could just figure out a browser extension that intercepts search result links to reddit and gives me a quick LLM summary of the post and discussion instead, I will have cut out most of these sources of distraction. reply throwup238 15 hours agorootparentIn that vein I mostly consume the Wikipedia current events portal [1] for my global and national news. It’s relatively neutral and the pinned topics at the top give a good overview of the important stuff with the option to dive into more specific articles or primary sources. It still suffers from selection bias (i.e. Notre Dame reopening is at the top while the Syrian regime falling is a footnote at the moment) but it feels like the right signal to noise ratio.

It's not totally objective, or without its own issues, but going by the prior that the lives lost are of equal \"importance\" it's illuminating to see how well it lines up with mainstream news coverage. Until the start of the current hot wars in Ukraine and Palestine there was a large gulf between what was ending human lives and what was generating column inches, even allowing for geopolitics and local languages.

Especially the second one: what a profoundly sad existence that someone would define their learning interests by what their boss recommends, with the sole goal of advancing one’s career. It isn’t even guaranteed the advice would be useful—bosses can be incompetent and petty too. And pray tell, if your boss follows that same advice, where does it stop? When does anyone have one original thought to pursue? Food in the grocery store is stocked by corporations who have no concern for your health and want to fill you up with addictive fat and sugar.

It isn’t the case that most people blindly follow their boss’ advice. Most people don’t decide their careers based on short-term local availability. And almost no investor who’s financially literate enough to consider an index fund would consider volatility as a metric of attractiveness of the fund.

You are seeing the world through a different lens driven by constant churn in the tech industry. In many industries if you are just a drone that does their job reasonably well, will work overtime every now and then when it's available and have shown willingness and ability to improve, management will make sure you stay at that company. Your only actual fear would be that the company fails but then very likely you are on the shortlist for that same management at their new company. Assume incompetence not malice, people aren't out to get you and trying to get the worst for you, they want to best for themselves and if you make it so that making you comfortable also makes them comfortable then you aren't at risk. Regarding food... Buy what's on the shelf, nobody needs their special kale only diet or whatever is the trend. What the parent was saying is follow general food guidelines, avoid excessive meat, keep portion sizes reasonable, half you plate should be vegetables etc... Same with the index fund thing, if you start investing with a reputable investor when your are in your 20s even if it doesn't beat the market you will retire comfortably. You don't need to minmax life. You can hit autopilot and just go where life takes you while just make small course corrections every now and then and you will be fine. You wont have a great life or a bad one. You will fall close to the middle of the bell curve and that's actually good enough. Focus on the things that are important, spend time with your loved ones etc. Trust me I understand your point of view as well, that's me I can't be vanilla with these things, my mental health doesn't allow it.

The comparison point for me would be 1920s Europe - in hindsight it seems likely they'd have had a lot of telegraphing in advance that things were about to go really badly wrong - disasters of the magnitude that engulfed them aren't easily missed. The average person wouldn't have been aware of it because the lack of an internet would have resulted in an insanely biased view of the data being presented that probably obscured just how bad things were getting. Today we have a much better level of information access available. The answer in the 1920s if you can see the 1930s and 1940s coming wasn't go local, it was some combination of fortify, fearmonger and/or flee. People needed to be alerted that the situation was really bad and immediate action was required at all levels to avert disaster - but action wasn't taken and we saw an economic crisis unfold, followed by a military one. reply tpmoney 12 hours agorootparentThe point appears to be that even if most people in 1920's Europe could have seen all the telegraphing, how many of them could have done anything to make a difference for their given situation? How many people do we think were realistically in a position to make a change to the economic conditions and still uninformed? How many were in a place to make a change to the military conditions and similarly uninformed? Hind sight is 20/20, and its easy knowing a massive war was coming to say people should have been getting the hell out of Dodge. But moving your entire family to a new country let alone a new continent is a massive undertaking. How many people even if they had the warnings would have pulled the trigger on that move rather than wait and see? What sort of huge, global war scale negative things are being telegraphed today and what major life altering decisions on the magnitude of leaving your entire community and extended family behind and seeking asylum in a foreign country do you foresee yourself undertaking to address them in response to your unprecedented levels of modern awareness? Or does your unprecedented access to that information simply make you feel helpless and hopeless? Are you actually better equipped to attend to the impending doom or do you just know that it's there. One wonders if we had the ability to know the exact month and year we were going to die, would we think our lives were made better by knowing that, or would we find that having that knowledge does little to change the quality of the life we live in any positive way, and largely adds stress or other negative experiences. There's a balance to be struck with any amount of being informed, but like everything else in life, I suspect moderation is the key. reply roenxi 10 hours agorootparent> how many of them could have done anything to make a difference for their given situation? Lots of them. Pretty much all the major players were democracies and it isn't that unreasonable to think that democracies can be persuaded to do sensible things. It is hard to evaluate counterfactuals but it is certainly plausible that if they'd actually understood how dire the situation was from better information the course of events was changeable. There are a lot of 1/10,000 people out there. It really is just a game of convincing a few of them to behave sensibly and they move mountains politically. I'd suggest that from your perspective it isn't the information making you feel hopeless, your starting point is that of helplessness and hopelessness and the information is just making that more apparent. The world is hardly hopeless and the people in it are not helpless.

Political platforms as summaries tend to be too broad in my opinion, e.g. reduce this or that or improve this or that, but without saying on account of what. In politics, everything is a trade off and if you want to increase spend on something then that money has to come from somewhere else, whether that's increased taxes, reduced spending on some other topic, or etc. Saying they want to increase the spend on something without saying how they're gonna get there is not useful. reply MrGinkgo 14 hours agoparentprevFunny enough, Hacker News is the only place I've been going to get my news for about a year now, and ever since I started experiencing anxiety bad enough to where I needed to start limiting my exposure to it.

In a nutshell, there's this weird tension between being kind of dismissive of it due to failed personal expectations, but also a desire to be as objective about it as possible, a \"fear of missing out\" if you will. As such I consume news about AI and engage with the \"community\" online about it, but I struggle constantly between separating noise from signal, \"truth\" and bullshit. It's not so much that bad news gets me down so much as the fact that sensationalist hype and bullshit makes me irrationally upset. The whole OpenAI strawberry thing is kind of a great example. There was vague hype and speculation about it months before it was actually released, and in the end we got a model that is objectively impressive when it comes to benchmarks and is objectively better at certain tasks, but otherwise in my mind fell way short of the expectations being set by more \"enthusiastic\" commentators. Now, normally if someone is prone to hype and sensationalism on the internet one would typically learn to ignore them and preserve your mental health, problem is that sometimes OpenAI employees (and other employees of frontier labs) can't resist making sensationalist claims themselves, i.e. claiming that we're a couple of years away from AGI or whatever.

When you read a negative word, even passingly, imagine all sorts of complex interactions that happen with the neurons inside your brain. Ban the words. Block everything. Keep your mouth shut. Create a chamber insulated from negativity. Negativity is spam. Nobody asks for it and nobody wants it, yet people can't stop themselves from sharing it, forcing negative thoughts onto others' sight. This has to stop. I don't go to the Internet to hear about the world's problems. The world doesn't have a right to waste my bandwidth to force me to see its propaganda. All I want is cat pictures. If it isn't a cat picture, I don't want to see it. I don't care how many countries are at war right now. I'll learn about it at my pace, when I want to. Who gave war the right to invade the privacy of my feed? To appear there, unsolicited? To demand my attention, constantly, as if it were entitled to it?

I actively ignore looking at anything from those sites unless I’m looking for a product review or something on Reddit. Reddit constantly had me feeling like life was hopeless, and that I was never gonna be enough, and I could never get excited about anything because I was conditioned to see things through a cynical lens.

Turns out I'm not the only one looking and there are novels and short stories that cater to this desire but it's all lip service. The stories were all about a particular ideology fighting against the (strawman) system and eventually winning to become the system itself. That's it.

It’s a fun short read. If you want harder sci-fi I’d recommend the Revelation Space series. It’s far future, somewhat negative in that there is war and conflict, but I wouldn’t at all describe it as dystopian. reply slowhadoken 15 hours agorootparentI find the best uplifting sci-fi deals with high context observations and stories that illustrate how to think not what to think. ST:NG and Futurama are good examples on TV. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a good example in print. reply tpmoney 15 hours agorootparentprevSome recommendations if you're still looking: The Liaden Universe series by Sharon Lee and Steve Miller, the best description for this I've heard is \"regency fiction in space\", which is a reasonable descriptor but the series covers a pretty wide range. The Honor Harrington series by David Webber. \"Horatio Hornblower in Space\". Can be a little trite in the latter books as he has to keep Honor alive and advancing while still in a the stories, but eventually picks up enough threads with other interesting characters. Monster Hunter International by Larry Correia. A very \"B-Movie\" series of books, with horror monsters being real, and a secret society fighting them. They're not deep literature by any stretch of the imagination, but they're fun, even if the main character can be a bit too \"perfect in every way\". reply em-bee 14 hours agorootparent\"Horatio Hornblower in Space\" i am reading the seafort saga by david feintuch, which is also hornblower in space. i am on book 3 now and i find it rather depressing. their unrealistic depiction of the role of christianity and how they enforce discipline. the latter as far as i can remember is modeled on the original hornblower which i have read as a teen. i am curious how david webers take is. btw, the solar clipper series by nathan lowell is also inspired by hornblower, but while the seafort saga seems to very closely follow the original, the only similarity in the solar clipper series is the career of the captain. all in all, the solar clipper series is rather positive though. reply slowhadoken 16 hours agorootparentprevYeah utopian sci-fi always reminds me of the Dr. Manhattan quote “they claim their labours are to build a heaven yet their heaven is populated with horrors.” reply trallnag 8 hours agoprevMaybe watching extremely negative content like gory cartel videos from South America could help with desensitization? reply hollerith 8 hours agoparent>Maybe watching extremely negative content like gory cartel videos from South America could help with desensitization? Wow, is that a bad idea! Watching even one \"gore\" (people or animals getting killed or hurt severely) clip can change you forever. Specifically, it can traumatize you, and psychological trauma disorder can be hard to treat, so that even if you can afford to pay $300 an hour for psychotherapy, you might try 6 different psychotherapists and none of them are able to help you, so you are stuck with the trauma disorder for years. Also, the clip might unlock what is essentially a fetish for gore with the result that you cannot stop yourself from continuing to search for it and watch it. Then maybe just watching it is no longer enough: you develop a compulsion to act it out. reply jimjimjim 10 hours agoprevBest thing I ever did was to quit twitter, even before all the changes.

We have a subscription to a package that has a lot of US content. HBO, Fox aka Star Channels. 80s & 90s movies were better, happier. The mood is mostly dark and dire nowadays.

I had a time where I completely ignored them, that was after 9/11 and my mental health was superb. But nowadays the planet is on fire and everyone in power is just starting more fires. But \"the news\" are also pushing a certain mindset, at least in Germany, although there isn't much difference between the outlets. They all just more or less copy paste the same sources.

You can choose to not go to news sites and not turn on news channels but news feeds are everywhere and tv are in public places blasting out the fear or outrage of the moment. It's difficult to not end up passively consuming it against your will.

I mean like, duh? I would be surprised if they claimed negative news DIDNT affect mental health struggles. Instead the far more interesting questions seems to be: in a world where negative news is becoming more common and prevalent, how do we face the reality of the world without destroying our own mental health in the process. The naive takeaway from this article would be \"just stay away from negative news\" which is even reinforced by this little plugin they made. But this simply accelerates the fragmentation we have seen in society, for how can you ever have empathy with others if you refuse to appreciate the suffering of anybody but yourself and what immediately affects you? Maybe instead of sticking our heads in the sand, we should be taking this as a wakeup call that us trying to solve these problems will help not just our planet, but our own mental health and will be necessary to have a healthy populace going into the future. reply lolinder 16 hours agoparent> how can you ever have empathy with others if you refuse to appreciate the suffering of anybody but yourself and what immediately affects you? Anecdotally, I have not observed an increase in empathy from people who immerse themselves in negative news about faraway places. There's sometimes an increase in the performance of empathy—you'll see them bemoan the various crises, you'll see them wonder aloud how anyone can go about their lives while ${STUFF} is happening—but I haven't observed an increase in their ability to actually be empathetic to the perspectives and needs of people closer to home. If anything it's the opposite: the more immersed someone is in tragedies and crises on the other side of the planet, the more aggressive and thoughtless they are in response to hot topics locally. Instead of slowing down and developing empathy for those who disagree with them, they lash out. It's like being immersed in extreme crises they can't control causes them to perceive their local crises as more severe than they actually are and triggers fight or flight, which actually stands in the way of empathy. reply Dalewyn 16 hours agorootparentDunbar's Number[1] could potentially be playing a role.
