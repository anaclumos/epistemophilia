Marian Pekár1 hour ago(+2) This is so cool! I showed the game to some friends, and they all played it. It seems they like it too. In case you're open to more fun ideas, here's one: when the player drinks all the wine on the map, spawn a Jackson Pollock piece on the ground :-) Reply JazzCorp13 hours ago(+7) The lone painting “ME” is by far the most visually articulate piece in the whole collection. *Sip*. Wile called “me” as if to stipulate a state of self absorption, in fact mocks this notion by portraying the individual as small and vulnerable, almost hiding in the corner of the painting. *Sip*. The vast body of water clearly shallow to suggest the lack of depth of the modern world, wile the water its self, the mass of the human experience, is clear, pure incapable of false hood. *Sip*. The individual is shown in a state of ambiguity, are they being born from this contradiction or are they submitting to death, returning to the watery womb of the human condition. *Sip*. The question the piece ask is… is there truly a difference….. **SIP**. Reply ZOGOK14 hours ago(+1) Man of culture Reply Kimera Royal18 hours ago (1 edit) (+3) *sips wine* Great game, very remniscient of ArsDoom, though it approaches the pastiche from the opposite angle. I find it simple, yet, *swishes glass in hand* it identifies how to hit its intent perfectly. *sips wine* In that sense one might say it is very elegant within its design aims. Excellent! *sips wine but swallows it wrong and starts coughing violently* Reply papercookies14 hours ago(+2) I concur, this game really evokes the duality of man!

Reply eevee1 day ago(+3)(-12) i can't tell what this even thinks it's trying to say, nor why a reimplementation of the doom engine was used as the medium Reply arctorkogi22 hours ago(+1) good thing they didn't include any rothkos, wouldn't want it to be doubly hard Reply Kimera Royal18 hours ago (1 edit) (+3) I think if you're going to engage with a game where the central gameplay mechanic is contemplating art pieces it would probably be in theme for you to try to contemplate it rather than just bailing out. A simple start that works for me is to think \"what would cause me to make this decision\" and work backwards from there. Reply DazMaZ1 day ago(+3) Truly a place of culture and elegance.

Reply Jeju1 day ago(+4) Very genuinely, I really love the concept of this short game, as someone who had to go to gallery openings/museums for my art major.

Come on... I know you have a GitHub for this thing, but, I suppose, it was made in Construct 3, and that soft doesn't allow you to export the project in a free version. Otherwise I'd done it myself. Either way, I've been quite hoping for something like a Node.js version...

Further, colleges receive public money but are not free to attend for most students. And I am not talking about \"free\" from the students perspective, I mean most would not be permitted to enroll if significant tuition dollars were not deposited (unlike public schools, for instance).

Lookalike websites, social media compromises, malicious links, etc. They allege to work with registrars, contribute to blocklists and take down scam content. True brand impersonation of this ilk almost always includes copyright infringement. Sure it's possible that the company is a truly malicious actor that has a fake website and does not actually submit any valid claims, while working alongside the top brands in the industry to tear down that same industry. Personally though, I think it's more likely the company is a startup rushing to grab profits, has bad algorithms that come up with a lot of false positives, and is generally a bull in a china shop. Not that that's excusable, but being sloppy and taking shortcuts that hurt people is a bit different from being a \"copyright hit company\" where hurting people is the company's entire raison d'etre. The former calls for better regulation; the latter calls for being stamped out. I don't know if you've tried to consume any crypto-related content on YouTube recently, but YouTube has a major problem with fake \"live streams\" from \"Elon Musk\" and other prominent crypto figures who promise they'll \"double your crypto for a limited time\" if you just send it to them within the next ten minutes. Someone's gotta fight that, on behalf of both the scam victims and the impersonated brands, because YouTube themselves don't give a shit. reply tialaramex 1 hour agoprevI think a good baseline might be that you need to deposit say $1M and then when oops, you accidentally made a bogus claim it's OK that $1M is split between the victim of your oopsy and Youtube for their trouble - you just pay $1M to get back into the game. Outfits like this could explain to their investors that while their technology does sometimes have little goofs that cost a few billion dollars per year, once they invent perfect AI they can scale infinitely and make that back easily, so if you invest $10Bn of your fiat currency today, in 18 months they can 100% guarantee nothing in particular, wow. This works for actual creators, who are occasionally slightly inconvenienced but handsomely rewarded when that occurs, for Youtube, who get paid each time these \"rare\" mistakes happen, and for the companies \"innovating\" by making up nonsense and taking people's money. Just as well the \"investment\" goes to a Youtuber as to some random office park or an ad firm. reply JumpCrisscross 1 hour agoparent> a good baseline might be that you need to deposit say $1M This is a license to rip off the copyrights of anyone without a million dollars in cash. reply mullingitover 1 hour agorootparentI don't think so, since YouTube is operating their extrajudicial \"go the extra mile for copyright holders\" copyright claim system. It isn't required by law and this is what's being abused, not plain DMCA claims. For regular claimants, the regular (and free) DMCA system would still be in effect. The bonus is that filing fraudulent DMCA claims has real legal repercussions under the law. I don't know if there's any real consequence for lying about copyright ownership to Google under their made-up claim system. reply TZubiri 8 minutes agorootparentI smell IANAL reply vkou 43 minutes agorootparentprevIt isn't required by law, it's required by people who would sue the pants off it if it didn't kowtow to them.

Insurers live on the margins, so even though it would cost a lot of money if you crash that boring mid-range car into somebody's house, the insurer doesn't charge you a lot of money to insure you against that risk, they're betting that on average you're not going to do that.

The consequences of bad policy are also quite low for them: most channels that will get hit unjustly have too small an audience to be heard; fixing problems for the larger creators is one-off enough that it's simply cost efficient to squash those when they happen; any bad publicity doesn't seem to be sufficient enough to cause a siginficant drop in either viewers or content creators willing to stick with the platform.... in fact I expect most content creators so unjustly hit this way would simply swallow the indignity and loss and continue p YouTube.

Music right holders managed forced YouTube to implement a copyright claim system that explicitly didn't involve DMCA takedown requests. As a result any protection that DMCA provides to recipients of takedown requests don't apply to YouTube copyright claims. In effect, the YouTube copyright system is a purely \"voluntary\" system for taking down copyright content, that goes way beyond the DMCA. It's basically designed to ensure theres no possible repercussions for issuers of copyright claims, even claims clearly made in bad faith. reply monocasa 1 hour agorootparentprevYouTube's system goes well beyond what is required by the DMCA. Notice no mention of \"copyright strike\" in the DMCA. reply Cthulhu_ 1 hour agoparentprevThe system is broken; if youtube (etc) do not respond to DMCA takedown requests on time, their service may be taken down - and back when YT was new and people were uploading movies and whatnot left right and center, they were very close to that.

But the YouTube process goes well beyond that. DMCA also allows for the content creator to issue a counter-notice and, as I understand it, that starts a clock and the party filling the takedown has 14 days to file a suit or the original takedown is reversed. Naturally, that's not the process YouTube follows including, again as I understand it, the assignment of revenues, etc. with only their internal dispute process mattering. reply creole_wither 1 hour agoparentprevI wonder if that is currently legal under DMCA Safeharbor.

    "originBody": "Hitting OKRs vs Doing Your Job January 5, 2025January 5, 2025 by jessitron In Engineering, quarterly OKRs (Objectives & Key Results) can feel like a duplication of product planning. Basically, they say “Ship the Roadmap.” What new information are they communicating in that case? And if the OKRs say anything else, they’re in conflict the roadmap! An example (that I made up): In Marketing, quarterly OKRs express our intentions clearly. They work really well to describe the focus for this time period. Marketing doesn’t complain about having to make OKRs. A marketing example (that I made up): Why are OKRs easier in Marketing? Partly: Marketing is closer to project work, while Engineering (at places like Honeycomb) is product work. Projects like Marketing campaigns fit within a quarter or two, while product work is an ongoing rhythm of updates. There’s an ongoing rhythm of work in Marketing, too! There are ads to run, webinars to run, emails to send, events to staff. OKRs express which ads and webinars and events — who we’re targeting and with what message. Does this duplicate the campaign briefs? … yes. Therefore, OKRs often mention only new campaigns, new audiences or channels. They say what we’re spending money and time on this quarter, that we don’t do every quarter. Regular ongoing work doesn’t show up in OKRs, usually. That’s what KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) are for. Marketing has KPIs for their core job: bringing in leads, which become sales opportunities. We count those. We monitor website traffic, ad performance, SEO ranking, webinar attendance, contacts made at events. These KPI numbers only show up in OKRs when we’re trying to improve them or get them differently, like in a new audience or with a new message. OKRs express shifts in focus, changes in process, or conversations we need to have. Engineering has KPIs for our core job: running software and shipping updates. Service-Level Objectives (SLOs) and Accelerate metrics like Deployment Frequency tell us we’re working smoothly. Shipping features from the roadmap is a chunk of our core job. It shouldn’t usually be in our OKRs. OKRs say what is different this quarter, what we’re changing, and what we’re trying to figure out. Wait a minute! One of these examples is “Smooth launch of Frontend Observability.” Doesn’t that say ‘ship the roadmap’? Shipping the features is part of a smooth launch, but it doesn’t end there. Of all the features we’re shipping this quarter, that one is the most critical to the business. Its presence in the OKRs tells people that we’ll push other work, we’ll respond immediately to bug reports, we’ll support this release with enthusiasm. When a team’s OKRs duplicate the roadmap, I read that as “We aren’t trying to improve. This is a quarter for trudging along.” Not a good sign. OKRs are for “What is special about this quarter? What is new? How do we want to be different? What do we want to figure out?” Let OKRs highlight a special focus. Don’t try to cram everything you do into them.

    "commentBody": "Hitting OKRs vs. Doing Your Job (jessitron.com)283 points by zdw 14 hours agohidepastfavorite172 comments padolsey 10 hours agoNow having worked in a few smaller teams since my time at FB, I realize how marvellous it is to not have to worry about OKRs, performance reviews and all that malarkey. It was so draining to run yourself as a mini PR/brand within one's team (/one's department) and market oneself (one's team) to your manager (/your company). So much mental bandwidth was spent. I also, from a systems-thinking POV, just fundamentally reject the value in OKRs as a meaningful proxy for the value you (/your team) are producing unless you are an entirely mechanistic function. By mechanistic I mean you have a clear discrete InputOutput expectation. Every single time an element of human activity is reduced to a metric, you lose something, and if you do it enough times, you've effectively produced a metric that is completely distinct from the thing you intended on measuring in the first place. For example: let's say you're in the suicide prevention team at FB, and your OKR is 'number of suicides averted'. Well, that sounds good, but unbeknownst to you, perverse incentives have kicked in and invisibly imbued your metric-chasing experiments a dark undertone. A new risk model might start flagging more content as potentially suicidal to boost numbers, leading to over-intervention that could traumatize users or waste resources. Or perhaps the surface we use to measure success, a UX or user activity metric, might actually be uncorrelated with crisis aversion or... and this is where it hits: the thing that's instrumental in crises is social media itself. The metric becomes a game, and it games _you_. Your team thinks you're doing X, but you're really doing Y. Because you're disattached from the real problem and comforted by incredibly lossy proxies. reply michaelt 9 hours agoparentThe times I've seen OKRs and metrics used effectively, they met two criteria. (1) it was always a metric closely aligned with what customers want and which drives revenue for the company; and (2) it didn't just impose a requirement to do work, it also provided political cover for not doing other, competing work. For example, if you're designing GPUs and/or GPU drivers? If your next-generation product has the aim of providing 25% more frames per second in \"Baldur's Gate 3\" and \"Call of Duty 6\" while maintaining the same quality - that would be a good objective for the team, as it's closely aligned with what your customers want. And if someone should come to you and tell you there's a lot of people streaming these days, and they think you should optimise gaming FPS and h264 compression at the same time? It's a sensible request but it's also a distraction; proper goal setting will let you say \"great idea, but not this quarter\". But there are a lot of fields of endeavour where it's not possible to meet these criteria - like the suicide prevention team from your example. reply liontwist 7 hours agorootparentAnd then customers complain that the driver is frequently crashing and the team is well aware but won’t fix the ticket because it doesn’t help them meet OKRs. What you really want is: - every team working to improve the customer experience - guided by leadership priorities and initiatives reply InsideOutSanta 6 hours agorootparent\"every team working to improve the customer experience - guided by leadership priorities and initiatives\" The fundamental issue is that in almost all larger companies, upper management does not trust that their employees are either intrinsically motivated to do a good job, or are smart enough to determine what \"a good job\" is. So rather than having a chain of trust from upper management to middle management to individual contributors, they seek to create a measurable control system. This inevitably replaces people's intrinsic motivation to do a good job with an extrinsic motivation, which only poorly represents the company's actual goals. At this point, most people are no longer trying to do a good job, they're instead trying to make their numbers look good. Upper management has effectively replaced real, meaningful work with a game where everybody tries to score points, and the people who don't participate in that game are eventually stackranked out of the company. reply rybosworld 3 hours agorootparentFor some reason, this is a controversial idea but: it's hard to argue that multiple layers of management can become anything other than bureaucracy. Corporations reward an individuals tenure and experience with increased decision making (often, this means manager title). That increase in decision making means that less senior IC's become less autonomous, even when they inevitably exceed their superior's experience on the topic. The level of autonomy is at odds with the number of managers. Some people argue this is a good thing. I argue that those people are just managers justifying their jobs. reply yellow_postit 3 hours agorootparentprevA less cynical take is that communicating consistently the priorities and tradeoffs the company wants to make as they get larger is a hopeful use of OKRs. In small teams/companies “the right thing” can be obvious and the team can operate in a shared headspace with low cycle time to discuss and decide tradeoffs when they arise. This gets really problematic at scale. Now back to the cynicism — it’s also tricky when you want to hide the ball and make teams feel ok about doing bad things: make time spent go up is the goal, who cares if there’s addiction along the way. reply InsideOutSanta 2 hours agorootparentI just fundamentally don't believe that most people in most companies have an understanding of the company's priorities that is worse than what an OKR encodes. In fact, my experience is that most people in larger companies believe, and are correct in believing, that they are forced to intentionally make worse decisions because better decisions have negative impacts on their measured performance. I've been part of an extremely effective 200 people company that got acquired by a 4000 people company. We all understood why we were acquired, we built a platform that solved a fundamental problem the larger company had. After the acquisition, this larger company's OKR and measurement system was implemented for our teams. We initially all ignored the system and went on as usual, starting to implement our platform. Initially, things went well, we made steady progress and started migrating legacy projects to out platform. Then, the annual stack ranking firings happened. Some of our best engineers were fired. Seeing this, many other top performers started looking for jobs immediately. The ones that got hired elsewhere started poaching even more top performers. The ones left started playing the numbers game to avoid being fired. Within a year, most people went from trying to solve the larger company's problem to optimizing their numbers.

Upper management has a deep distrust of their employees and acts accordingly. They will hire consultants or external people before they will listen to their employees.

This could be rebated to consumers (everybody gets a $6500 check a year) to make it revenue neutral. Two problems: (1) A legitimacy gap. People think taxation is on ratchet and wouldn't trust it to be revenue neutral and not a money grab. (2) It's a global problem. If there is a carbon tax in the US and no carbon tax in China that's unfair for our manufacturers.

This has the side effect of encouraging other countries to adopt similar carbon taxes. The EU is implementing something like that, and we’re seeing an uptick in appetite in the US to implement a border adjustment here, partly as a result, there were a few bills put forward in the last Congress, though nothing has gotten very far yet. reply marcosdumay 57 minutes agorootparentprevBesides the tariff on imported products the sibling talks about, you can also rebate the tax paid on exported products. It's not simple to manage those adjustments, but governments deal with much more complex taxes everywhere. It's not a big deal. And yeah, the UBI cancellation of the tax, the tariffs on imported products and the rebate on exported products deal with every single problem I've seen people post about a carbon tax, except for \"expensive gasoline will destroy our economy!\", that is almost always pushed by people that live in a place with some of the cheapest gasoline prices of the world. There is an add-on that some people push where you don't cancel all of the tax in an UBI, but use a part of it to finance carbon capture projects.

In any large organization it's not possible to have everyone doing interesting, meaningful work. reply PaulHoule 3 hours agorootparentprevSomething I appreciate about small workplaces is that, often, people have a shared sense of the purpose of the organization and strong teamwork. It manifests in little things. We were waiting outside the conference room last week for our manager to get the keys to unlock it. Nobody told me to, I wasn't responsible for snacks, but I picked up the trays of pastries and brought them in and put them in the right place and joked \"It's my New Years resolution to squat anything I can get my arms around.\" I got thanked. In startups you often have to get things done quicker than you can hire new people to do it. A lot of people have the attitude that they have a certain circle of responsibility, which is necessary and appropriate in a large organization, but in a small organization I like it that people have internalized the goals of the organization and are willing and able to pinch hit. I think people often get this attitude working in small businesses, like a little shop that sells knick-nacks at the beach or the summer that I got re-hired at a supermarket that owed me a favor despite not really hiring at the time. I worked about 50% at the front end and the other 50% doing odd jobs directly under the store manager which meant they'd have me paint a metal line that ran around the outer wall of the store or sub for people in the deli (learn to work the meat slicer) or bakery, etc. In a big organization you need some rigidity, but big organizations can also be seen as a collection of small organization (e.g. \"employees don't leave companies, employees leave managers\") It's a pet peeve of mine when people in a startup don't have a flexible attitude. reply macspoofing 4 hours agorootparentprev>And then customers complain that the driver is frequently crashing and the team is well aware but won’t fix the ticket because it doesn’t help them meet OKRs.

Achieving OKRs should not be seen as a \"be-all and end-all\" ... Failing an OKR should be seen as a opportunity for improvement.

What I find odd, is often the biggest proponents of the free market - with it's decentralised decision making process ( and redundancy of effort ), decide that total centralized, top down control is the best way to run their own company - as they think top down decisions and minimising waste through duplication is the way to go. As with all things - it's a balance of course. reply zeroonetwothree 3 hours agorootparentYou might want to read \"The Nature of the Firm\", which discusses this. reply DrScientist 1 hour agorootparentThat's a slightly different angle - if I understand correctly it's about why firms exist at all - and if I were to summarise it's because lack of trust costs - a firms boundaries are created to balance transactional costs ( within the firm it's low, between firms or individuals it can dominate ) versus the costs of perhaps not being market efficient. My argument above is about not what shapes a firm's boundary but how it operates internally - too much top down control potentially risks exacerbating the risks associated with being a company and also potentially increases internal transactional costs as well - worse of both worlds! - all that ceremony around decision making, time spent justifying existences, inability to just act. Obviously as I said above - it's a balance - just as it is with country/international systems. reply liontwist 2 hours agorootparentprevThat’s an easy one to answer. Corporations don’t have police or taxation power and so have more limited impact on your individual freedom. In a “free market” you can choose what firms you work for and with, except the government.

One of the ideas behind why distributed markets work is the information about what is needed is communicated by the mechanisms of the market itself.

The easy metric doesn't necessarily correlate to user desire.

There are no targets and stuff like that, they are just there if you want to know. Managers track it and try to optimize for it, but nobody bonuses or employment is on the line over them. Maybe some sales people have commission, but most of the customer acquisition is organic anyway. Funnily enough we have a weird situation right now, where we want to optimize the _cheaper_ plan of our product, meaning moving people from the more expensive plans to the cheaper one. It is a weird dynamic, but due to licensing our cheaper plan is actually far more profitable than the more expensive plans. Most clients wouldn't really miss anything from the more expensive plan.

I can get selection of particular gaming titles, but how do you come up with 25% goal? How is this closely aligned? Your users tell you they want ~30% gains?

In organisations that do this kind of work, the 'marketing' department isn't just about placing adverts and writing blog posts. They also have people whose job is to keep track of what's going on in the market, and to estimate what your product needs in order to be competitive when it comes out. To take a simple example, the marketing team might have visited https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-... and found on 4K ultra settings that the \"RX 7900 XTX\" shows up as 90.3 fps average and the \"RTX 4090\" shows up as 112.6 fps average. And 112.6÷90.3 = 1.246 so if AMD want their next-gen flagship to outperform nvidia's current-gen flagship, they need 24.6% more FPS. Of course it's a lot more complicated than that in practice. They'd also consider value-for-money, non-flagship cards, whether users' monitors even support >120fps, guessing at what nvidia's next flagship will offer, interviewing big buyers like Dell, and so on.

What I object to the most, is the competition between engineers created from the goal setting and performance reviews. At startups, I had a domain that I could own. Now, at largco, everyone tries to take over my area in an effort to build their resumes. I used to view fellow engineers as teammates, now I see them as my competition. reply 98codes 19 minutes agorootparentThe key to largeco success is to understand that when you own a certain area, especially if it's an area that will generate opinions or a visibility boost, you will need to manage your full stack, not just the code you write. Code access, PR acceptability requirements, roadmap, triaged backlog, and communication upwards, downwards, and sideways. If you're not doing that work, either someone else is going to do it or it'll cause issues down the road. Look at it this way: you can either be grateful that so many folks are wanting to help you in your effort and coordinate that effort, or you can stick to the code and complain that someone else is trying to steal your credit. All of this hinges entirely on your direct manager (and to an extent their manager) being an actually good manager, and not a microcontroller, pass-the-buck-er, or an empty chair. reply PaulHoule 2 hours agorootparentprevFunny in a startup I value people being pinch hitters. Sure you should have your domain but if there is some exceptional event I want somebody to be able to cover for you or for you to do some job that wasn't even on the roster yesterday. reply eweise 2 hours agorootparentTrue. I guess what I mean is that other engineers try to take over the architecture and design.

The problem you are describing is nothing else but Goodhart's law in action: A measure stops being a good measure, i.e. be a proxy for something, once there are objectives attached to it. In other words, attaching goals to a metric invalidates previous causal relationship. That's neither bad, not good. It's a property of goal setting. The problematic part is still treating the measure as if it had causal relationship to something when that relationship has already been invalidated. In your example, number of suicides ceases to be comparable between pre and post OKR timeframes, however if you look closely, this particular goal is based on a metric the underlying OKR targets invalidate. Yes, sometimes you get these weird tautologies where you have to change the whole framework/process to make something both targetable and measurable simultaneously, potentially losing comparability to past data. reply qznc 9 hours agoparentprevAs a team within a larger company, your purpose is to contribute to the larger goals. How do you know if you are doing that? As this \"suicide prevention team\", how do you know if you are doing a good job? I agree with you that proxy metrics easily distract you into doing Y instead of X. My opinion is that you need to iterate on your metrics then. Not having metrics means it all depends on the gut feeling of executives. It surely is draining to be clear about your goals. I fear we cannot really be politically correct and sufficiently honest even. What is the real goal of having a suicide prevention team? It might be token effort after some incident, then the actual goal would be to as cheap as possible while still maintaining the illusion. It might be to prevent future PR disasters, then collection helpful evidence for lawyers should be part of the job. This touches hard ethical questions and these should become evident when discussing the purpose of a team. reply devjab 2 hours agorootparent> Not having metrics means it all depends on the gut feeling of executives. Having spent a couple of decades in enterprise I can say that in my anecdotal experience it does so anyway. I've rarely seen any form of metrics put to good long term use. That's not to say that it doesn't happen, but benefit relaization seems to be something very few managers and teams actually work with beyond hitting some metric. It's usually the most obvious with changes in management. I've seen hordes of measurements thrown in the bin when a new manager took over a team and had different goals and values. On the flip side there are a lot of negative side effects of metrics over time. If you measure employees by the hour you create a culture of people who won't help each-other because how do they registrer that? I mainly view productivity measurements as a HR tool for managers who don't actually know what their team members are doing. Which can happen for a lot of reasons, sometimes it can be because the manager is simply bad at people management, often it's because they are too busy. What is especially bad about them, however, is that people aren't consistently productive and what you really want to work with is how to keep them motivated. A motivated great employee can be unproductive in a period where they have small children, a loved one is sick and so on and an unmotivated employee can be very productive while simentaniously looking to leave your comapny. I get why these tools exist though. Most managers are weak decision makers and HR supply them with tools that help them over come this. reply paganel 9 hours agorootparentprev> How do you know if you are doing that?

And that's why you need good executives, executives who have good guts.

I also think that the companies that matter getting bigger and bigger, with no actual failure on the horizon (such as bankruptcy) in case of strategically wrong decisions doesn't help things one bit, because in those cases management failure is in many cases rewarded as there's no immediate and adverse affect on the life of the company itself.

Edwards Deming the \"father of the quality movement and was hugely influential in post-WWII Japan\". It talked about some company moving oil around in barges, the setup was unprofitable and a new manager was brought up to fix it. He created metrics of the business, but didn't put any goals or goalposts for the barge crews and other managers in the company. All he did was simply print the metrics and glue them on every barge of the fleet weekly. Soon the whole project was massively profitable. Apparently the captains of the barges would compete with each other to see who could save more money, without any penalties for the low performing nor any rewards for the high performing barges. One thing that was very surprising is that the barges were given freedom to choose where to source materials and, more importantly, the fuel. Before the metrics the captains would pick whatever was closest no matter the prices, after the metrics the captains would, on their own, try to source fuel from the cheapest place that they could. No amount of central planning could have been as optimal as the prices fluctuated a lot from day to day, so whenever a captain saw a good deal he would re-fuel. It turns out that empowered people want to do a good job and want to save money. reply vegetablepotpie 2 hours agoparentThe barge company in question is Koch Industries (yes, that Koch Industries). Starting in 1982 they leveraged Deming’s ideas, realized 30% profits, and pushed it far enough to enter the dark side. > Koch’s dedication to Deming’s ideas eventually led the company into several sticky situations, not the least being targeted in a Senate Select Committee investigation for oil theft in 1988, a direct result of immense internal pressure on employees as part of its continuous improvement program.

In the game, you rule a kingdom, but unlike, say, Civilization, you don't directly manage things. You set goals and create quests, like \"slay this monster and get some reward.\" And the quests would inspire heroes to join your kingdom, and things would grow from there. Iirc, you create incentives around your economy as well. Imagine if there were product goals (\"implement feature X\") with some reward [1] attached and you could leave it up to teams or individuals to claim that goal if they desired. You could choose the goals you wanted to claim, recruit coworkers to help you, (eg, self form teams). PMs/Management would basically be in charge of allocating rewards for the goals. I imagine it'd be a terrible system in practice for a number of reasons, but I enjoy thinking about ways you could attempt to make it workable. For example, [1] rewards -- I don't think you could tie rewards directly to people's paychecks. Do that too much and I think you'd create perverse incentives. But perhaps things like swag, gifts, time off, or just bragging rights, honor, and glory might work. [2] coordination -- a danger would people redundantly working on the same goal. You'd need a way to prevent that. [3] other perverse incentives -- you might get an overabundance of folks choosing the \"fun\" goals, for example. (After all, engineers may be more motivated by that than other things.) Here I imagine the rewards for unsexy things would need to rise over time if nobody opted for them. Or, you make first dibs on some other \"fun\" goal the prize for achieving a less fun goal. reply everybodyknows 3 hours agoparentprev> who could save more money Sounds good, but how did the \"metrics\" expose which individual decision-makers were responsible for any improvement or deterioration? reply 2OEH8eoCRo0 4 hours agoparentprevI worked at place that did this.

Some internal discussions and skewed perceptions of our team are now causing our team are currently causing our team to make our work and our infrastructure more tractable and more quantifiable. For example, we've started to track time spent for internal customers and different topics team-internally and aggregate those on the team-level. Or we've started to generate information about resource consumption of different products. And this has led to interesting results. At a workers level, our director and the board is very clear that they want to continue this data to be collected without interference or skew. If you work in an area, you track it in that area - don't try to protect anyone. Track time as you spend it. Track resources as spent. On a leadership level, this has however resulted in a fairly interesting tone. Suddenly you have a CEO saying \"Alright, so my very expensive team is spending that much time on this area you claim to be somewhat simple? Make that number go down significantly this year. Hire if and as necessary\". Or \"I dislike this amount of outages, but if you say we need better data there, make it so\" It's also a very much data driven management style. But you don't have magical bespoke numbers fall from the sky one day and you need to make sense of them and integrate them into your normal work.

I work on an internal tools team, so my users are other engineers at the company. Product teams have Product Managers and seem to put in a lot of effort into their OKRs, but for the internal tools team, we're in some limbo: still forced to write OKRs, but no parts of the process that are actually useful. We might have an OKR to upgrade Jenkins before an EOL date, but no introspection about whether the company at large would be better served by GitLab CI (as an example). Management only cares that we have defined KPIs like \"Days remaining until Jenkins EOL date\" and that they are improving. I still try to have the difficult conversations, but it's a constant battle with management as improving developer happiness by allowing them to use a better system isn't easily demonstrated on a dashboard. Also, like you said, teams write their OKRs in a vacuum without coordinating with other teams. So, one engineering team might have an OKR to fix some memory issue affecting their Jenkins pipelines, but they didn't communicate that with the internal tools team that operates Jenkins. It then became a struggle between the two managers, one saying \"We need to fix this Jenkins issue or we'll fail our OKRs commitment\" and the other saying \"We already committed to different OKRs this quarter, we can't take on new work.\" The engineers are stuck between this battle trying to help each other in secret without management hearing about it. reply steveBK123 16 minutes agorootparentA lot of the lack of coordination devolves into cost center arbitrage as well.

It shouldn’t usually be in our OKRs. First of all, your roadmap shouldn’t be static. You should give teams flexibility to change it. When/why? When they see a better way of achieving the teams objective. Ideally you can set up your KRs to also be flexible WRT implementation. People loose sight of this, but it’s one of the two big value adds from OKRs. The second big one is legibility outside your team/org. OKRs are about making your goals and work easily understandable, because the alternatives don’t scale as well. So vis. the article, you should start with the question of what you want to make visible to the org, and make sure you craft your OKRs to highlight that part of the roadmap. Concrete example, I plan with two buckets: new features, and bug fixes/ops/quality. The customer for new features is users, and the org cares about this. You need OKRs to make your impact legible to your CEO, who (let’s be real) is not going to log into Jira and read the full backlog. Bug fixes and ops need to happen, and they should be groomed and prioritized ideally, but in the ideal world nobody outside of the owning team should see them. Internal tooling should be on the roadmap but not OKRs, unless you are in the red and your CEO wants to know that you are improving after, say, a business-impacting outage. So the roadmap is going to have a bunch of detail on the current delivery plans, sequencing, etc, but it’s downstream of your objectives.

The issue is, for intrinsically motivated people who are incredibly specialised in a largely reactive role they are a distraction at best, and when used for quarterly and yearly performance tracking, a detriment to the core role at worst. reply PaulHoule 2 hours agorootparentI worked at a startup where the main problems I saw were: (1) It was impossible for anyone to enforce anything. Our genius business development guy couldn't get our head data scientist to share data files with customers (say Big 5 accounting firms) in a way they felt were safe. I couldn't get the data scientists to use standardized versions of Python. (Docker just accelerated their ability to find defective Pythons, such as one with Hungarian as the standard charset) The engineering manager would tell me \"we use monads for error handling in Scala\" and \"we do code reviews\" but I don't believe the latter because the first certainly wasn't true. (2) We were developing core technology and developing solutions for various customers. There was a lot of zigging and zagging and spoiled work in progress. I felt like the customer contact was helping us understand the requirements for the core so I'm not complaining about that. Our management practices should have been focused 100% on squaring that circle. The VCs believed in our vision and our BD genius (I did!) but they knew we were badly managed and brought in a stream of consultants some of whom were helpful and some who weren't. The worst was the consultant who came in and forced us all to write OKRs which took two weeks against the core and solution and development work that did matter for the business. My feeling was that my job was to pull for the team wherever it needed it and it wasn't my business to set goals that weren't fundamentally grounded in the needs of the team. I had enough work to do that I didn't need to add a single task that wasn't on that critical path. Particularly customer requirements could change faster than the OKR cycle, we needed practices that worked at the speed of our business. I was anxious that when review time came along I'd find that, out of 20 OKRs, I would nail 5 of them, totally fail at 5 of them and the other 10 would be in between. At review time whether this is success failure would depend on politics and ability to navigate politics. That genius BD would deservedly get a good review, a really good coder or data sci may or may not. People with high and unmitigated narcissism are privileged by systems like stack ranking and OKR because they are focused on presentation of self in ways that average people aren't. reply osmsucks 10 hours agoparentprevThe most insulting case is that of the retroactively-adjusted OKR wording so that you can always meet 0.7+ scores. reply rednafi 8 hours agoprevIf I could give one piece of advice to my early-career self, it’d be this: do more \"visible\" work rather than \"good\" work.

You have an infinite amount of “could do” and a limited amount of “must do”, and “must” is very rarely clear a year or more out in any measureable sense So eventually we come to “support the overriding mission”, and record everything we do, and we can retroactively look to see who contributed most.

OKRs should capture everything you plan to do, otherwise what's the point? Obviously I don't want the whole roadmap, just the part we commited to. You probably also don't want only the roadmap, for obvious reasons. There's never enough time to do everything that's planned or necessary and OKRs should be the tool that lets you resolve the conflicts. Ship feature X or fix the infrastructure? \"X is in OKRs, let's work on X\". \"X is not in OKRs and we have KR to get Y% success on autodeployments, let's fix infra\".

The only things that should not be in the OKRs are ones where prioritization is trivial (like \"fix critical outages\"). reply dent9876543 6 hours agoprevThe problem is that OKRs are divorced from the “go do this piece of work” instruction, and so, just like code comments, they quickly become out of date or are outright ignored. Because of that, the prescription about SMART and focus on delivery is simply wasted effort. At best a duplication. The good part about OKRs is (/should be) that it forces an alignment conversation between teams and amongst managers. And the performance discussion with manager is often useful and sometimes revealing. More often both focus on metrics, losing the last opportunity to extract value from the concept. reply jongjong 3 hours agoprevOKRs and KPIs are scams. Human language and psychology are both vague and malleable. The kinds of people who are good at meeting OKRs aren't the kinds of people who can produce quality work. OKRs are mostly about lowering expectations prior to implementing and exaggerating results after implementing... It's mostly psychological work, a magic trick, not real productivity. The goal of this game is to sacrifice long term gains for short term gains; build a house of cards fast to boost your OKR scores and get promoted fast... Then let the next person who is assigned to the project take the blame for the collapse. People don't care about foundations... Only thing that matters is whose watch the tower falls on.

We are actually spending soo much time deriving, thinking, formulating & refining OKRs from roadmap items that we could just declare as simple \"Goals\".

In this regard, time-series anomaly detection has been an important activity, entailing various applications in fields such as cyber security, financial markets, law enforcement, and health care. While traditional literature on anomaly detection is centered on statistical measures, the increasing number of machine learning algorithms in recent years call for a structured, general characterization of the research methods for time-series anomaly detection. This survey groups and summarizes anomaly detection existing solutions under a process-centric taxonomy in the time series context. In addition to giving an original categorization of anomaly detection methods, we also perform a meta-analysis of the literature and outline general trends in time-series anomaly detection research.

We have a use in our systems that is very \"seasonal\" as in weekly cycles so I make an average of some metric (offset 1 week, 2 week, 3 week , 4 week/4) and I compare it to the current value of that metric. That way the alarms can be set day or night, weekday or weekend, and the thresholds are dynamic. It compares against an average of the day of the week, or time of the day.

An entire subclass of anomaly detection can basically be reduced to: forecast the next data point and then measure the forecast error when the data point arrives. reply fnordpiglet 43 minutes agorootparentWell it doesn’t really require a forecast - variance based anomaly detection doesn’t make an assertion of the next point but that its maximum change is within some band. Such models usually can’t be used to make a forecast other than the banding bounds. reply mikehollinger 4 hours agoprevThis doesn’t capture work that’s happened in the last year or so. For example some former colleagues timeseries foundation model (Granite TS) which was doing pretty well when we were experimenting with it.

Also, thanks for the work on this. I would absolutely love to contribute, but my maths are not good enough for this :) The biggest thing I've run into in my testing is that an anomaly of reasonably short timeframe seems to throw the upper and lower bands off for quite some time. That being said, perhaps changing some of the variables would help with that, and I just don't have enough skill to be able to understand the exact way to adjust that. reply pnathan 3 hours agorootparentprevThe number of manual tweaks required to the approach suggest that it is essentially an ad hoc experimental fitting, rather than a stable theoretical model that can adapt to your time series. reply nyrikki 3 hours agorootparentprevNot really related to the above post, but one thing I am not seeing on an initial pass is the advancement of understanding of problems like riddled or wada basins. Especially with time delays this and 3+ attractors this can be problematic. A simple example: https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1088857/v1 There are tools to try and detect these features that were found over the past few decades, and I know I wasted a few years on a project that superficially looked like a FP issue, but ended up being a mix of the wada property and/or porous sets. The complications will describing these worse than traditional chaos indeterminate situations may make it inappropriate for you. But it would be nice if visibility was increased.

Can't wait to go deep through this paper and find out what the latest thinking is. Thanks, OP. reply eth0up 5 hours agoprevI had not known of Time Series (or most other) anomaly detection methods until recently, when I used several LLMs to assist with an analysis of the Florida Lottery Pick4 history. For years, I'd been casually observing the daily numbers (2 draws daily for each since around ?/?/2004?, and 1 prior), which are Pick2, 3, 4, and 5, but mostly Pick4, which is 4 digits, thus has 1:10,000 odds, vs 1:100, 1:1000 and 1:100,000 for the others. With truly random numbers, it is pretty difficult to identify anything but glaring anomalies. Among some of the tests performed were: (clusters\\daily\\weekly; (isolated forest; (popular permutations\\by date\\special holidays\\etc; (individual digits\\deviations; (temporal frequency; (dbscan; (zscore; (patterns; (correlation; (external factors; (auto correlation by cluster; (predictive modeling; (chi squared; (Time Series ... and a few more I've forgotten. For those wondering why I'd do this, around 2023-23, the FL Lottery drastically modified their website. Previously, one could enter a number for the game of their choice and receive all historical permutations of that number over all years, going back to the 1990s. With the new modification, the permutations have been eliminated and the history only shows for 2 years. The only option for the complete history is to download the provided PDF -- however, it is full of extraneous characters and cannot be readily searched via Ctrl-F, etc. Processing this PDF involves extensive character removal to render it parsable or modestly readable. So to restore the previously functional search ability, manual work is required. The seemingly deliberate obfuscation, or obstruction, was my motivation. The perceived anomalies over the years were secondary, as I am capable of little more than speculation without proper testing. But those two factors intrigued me. Having no background in math and only feeble abilities in programming, this was a task that I could not have performed without LLMs and python code used for the tests. The test is still incomplete, having increased in complexity as I progressed and left me too tired to persist. The result were ultimately within acceptable ranges of randomness, but some patterns were present. I had made files of (all numbers that ever occurred; (all numbers that have never occurred; (popularity of single, isolated digits -- I was actually correct in my intuition here, which proved certain single were occurring with lesser or greater frequencies as would be expected; (a script to apply Optical Character Recognition on the website and append the latest results to a living text and PDF file to offer anyone interested an opportunity to freely search, parse and analyze the numbers.

Something like: ghostpdf to convert PDF into images, then gpt-4o or ollama+Llama3 to transcribe each image into output JSON. reply eth0up 2 hours agorootparentFirst, let me admit I'm slow to understand, and I also may have explained the above poorly. The PDF is thousands of newlines, with multiple entries on each, convoluted with lots of garbage formatting. The only data to be preserved is winning num, date, evening/midday draw, fireball number (introduced in 2020-ish?) and factored along with the change from one to two daily draws (2001-ish) as acceptable anomalies in the data set, which has been done, I believe. The difficult part of this, actually, was cleaning the squalid pdf. In the end, after the work was all done, script using OCR would successfully append a number to the cleaned text/pdf, but usually not the correct num. The only reason I used OCR was that I couldn't find the right frames in the webpage that contained the latest winning numbers, and getting html extraction to to work in a script failed because of it. I must admit, although I have used JSON files, I don't know much about them. Additionally, I'm ignorant enough that it's probably best not to attempt to advise me too much here for sake of thread sanitation - it could get bloated and off topic :) I think with renewed inspiration, I could figure out a successful method to keep the public file updated, but I primarily need surefire methods of analysis upon the nums for my anomaly detection, which is a challenge for a caveman who never went to middle/high school and didn't resume school beyond 4th grade until community college much later. Of course, the fact that such an animal can twiddle with statistics and data analysis is a big testament to the positive attributes of LLMs, which without, the pursuit would be a vague thought at most. Although I welcome and appreciate any feedback, I'm pretty sure it isn't too welcome here.

    "originBody": "They squandered the holy grail Published on 01/06/2025, 5396 words, 20 minutes to read Why Apple Intelligence failed even though everything it's built upon is nearly perfect A crumbling ruin of a once-mighty building on a hill in Afganistan - Photo by Suliman Sallehi, found on Pexels A while ago, I got really frustrated at my Samsung S7. It was failing to hold a battery charge, or having issues with the Wi-Fi, or DNS over LTE or something and I reached a breaking point where I bussed over to Bellevue Square and bought an iPhone 7. It was my first Apple product that I'd ever bought with my own money and my first non-Android phone since I used Windows Mobile 6 on a T-Mobile Dash in high school. Needless to say, I loved it at first sight and all my phones since have been iPhones. The camera is good enough that I have to go out of my way to make my actual cameras different from what you can get on an iPhone. Hell, the iPhone is a fully capable cinema camera these days. It's easily been one of the best technology moves I've ever done for my creative career. The device enables me to do things and create memories of them to share with others. Bicycles for the mind Way back in 1981, Steve Jobs (one of the co-founders of Apple) described the vision of Apple computers like this: I read a study that measured the efficiency of locomotion for various species on the planet. The condor used the least energy to move a kilometer. And, humans came in with a rather unimpressive showing, about a third of the way down the list. [...] But, then somebody at Scientific American had the insight to test the efficiency of locomotion for a man on a bicycle. And [...] a human on a bicycle, blew the condor away. [A computer is] the most remarkable tool that we’ve ever come up with, and it’s the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds. -Steve Jobs Apple computers aim to make it easier for people to be creative while spending less energy to do it. One of the big things that Apple made the Macintosh for was typography. With that, they made MacWrite, one of the two programs that shipped with every Macintosh computer for free. If you were used to having to write documents out by hand or using a typewriter to make them, the leap to something like a word processor is so amazingly vast that it's difficult for anyone younger than me to comprehend it. We've had them all our lives. A screenshot of an emulated Macintosh running MacWrite with the first paragraph of The Bee Movie script in it. Imagine not being able to reliably use the backspace key when you're writing something. Imagine a world where all you could do was just write more text. Sure, there were ways to \"cover up\" a mis-typed letter, but they were vastly more inconvenient than just ignoring it or re-typing the word and crossing the wrong one out by hand. Word processors let you use the backspace key to delete text and then look at the screen to get a reasonable approximation of what the printed document would look like. Before you print it. To say that this enables a vastly different kind of creative process is like saying that water makes things damp. Word processors like MacWrite absolutely transformed the ways that everyone used computers. They were bicycles for the mind and without them our world would be starkly different. I shudder to imagine that NaNoWriMo would be a thing without word processors. Many companies want to make computers that you can use to do computer things. Apple makes tools that you use as an extension of your body in order to do creative things. They don't just sell computers, they sell something that helps enable you to create things that just so happen to be computers. This is the big vision difference that puts Apple in its own class. They sell bicycles for the mind. Intelligence as a faucet In June 2024, Apple announced Apple Intelligence: a set of features aimed at making your smartphone smart. The biggest thing that stood out to me was this example of what Apple Intelligence was going to enable in Siri: An Apple Keynote slide saying 'Play that podcast my wife sent the other day'. If they could really just correlate relationships, categorize links, and make all of that context visible to Siri, that would be fundamentally transformative in ways that the word processor would be to people that didn't have it before. Everything else done with it would be added bonuses or party tricks on the side. The real benefit would be being able to search through all of your digital life across every app with simple queries and then have your phone do things for you. Sure Craig's example was playing a podcast, but the basic idea holds for other types of media too. \"Share those pics from San Francisco to Instagram.\" All this context that everything is building up would finally be useful to the users instead of just useful to the companies making all of the apps we use. They wanted to make all Apple devices be able to tap into intelligence as a faucet in the same way that Spotify lets you tap into music as a faucet and that the AWS API lets you tap into compute as a faucet. This is massive and if it was pulled off right would be the new standard that companies like Samsung and Google would clone the same way they cloned the hardware and software design of the iPhone. In that keynote, they spilled out the vision that computers should work with you in order for you to do what you want to do. They should enable you to be creative. They should be bicycles for the mind. The fact that they are computers should only be a footnote in an appendex titled \"implementation details\". Then they casually dropped the holy grail of trusted compute, but in order to understand why it's so big we need to take a little detour into the modern Internet user's view of the Internet. Apps as thin as reception One of the biggest problems with modern applications is that they are thin shells around web services. When you open the Instagram or Bluesky apps, your phone makes a request to their servers and then shows you posts when it gets a response. You don't know or care how those responses are getting made, you just know that when you open the app, you get content and that makes you happy. However, when you don't have signal, you don't have the app. Go on an airplane and once you run out of reception the app is worthless. You can't queue posts to be made when you get back into signal. You can't view posts that were available before you lost connection. You can't even view things that you just posted in some cases. The app breaks and you are slowly alienated from your data one photo at a time. This is the way nearly every single app on my phone works with only two exceptions: Signal and everything Apple makes. If you want to read more about how the modern user's experience with the Internet is like, check out Ed Zitron's Never Forgive Them. As every single platform we use is desperate to juice growth from every user, everything we interact with is hyper-monetized through plugins, advertising, microtransactions and other things that constantly gnaw at the user experience. We load websites expecting them to be broken, especially on mobile, because every single website has to have 15+ different ad trackers, video ads that cover large chunks of the screen, all while demanding our email or for us to let them send us notifications. -Ed Zitron Not to mention, you don't know how the services that power your apps work. The market at large does not want to pay for chat programs or social media. Running chat programs and social media apps is mind-bogglingly expensive. Venture capital only lasts so long and the companies involved have to make money somehow. The big pile of user data starts to look like a really good thing to mine in order to make a profit. The holy grail of trusted compute This stands in stark contrast to the goal of something like Apple Intelligence. When possible, Apple Intelligence will run on your device. Apple went out of their way to make it possible and easy to run large language models and other AI models on your device without having to make too many compromises in the process. If something is done on your device (or at least on hardware that you can look at, like a Mac mini in your office), then the computation is infinitely more private than anything involving making a request to the outside world. In Apple's WWDC keynote they claimed that they had a system called Private Cloud Compute that would enable users to have the same privacy guarantees (or more) when making requests out over the network as they did for computations running on their local devices. This seemed impossible to me. From what I know about how the web service sausage is made, it seems impossible to have all of these guarantees at the same time: User data is only used to fulfill requests and then erased. The load balancing infrastructure doesn't know who is making a request and what server it is going to. Researchers are able to inspect and verify the Private Cloud Compute system and simulate it on their laptops. Apple site reliability staff does not have privileged access to Private Cloud Compute nodes and logging is minimized at the compiler level. An attacker cannot reliably figure out which node is being used to make any request from any user. If you have any modicum of site reliability experience, this seems like an unsatisfiable set of constraints. It seems literally impossible, yet here they are claiming that they have done it. The technical details of how they pulled this off is well worth reading, if only because it is the first time I have ever seen any company's AI product team put together a cogent security model and release that security model to the public. TL;DR: They X-ray the hardware at every step of the assembly process and compare that to reference images in order to combat threats from factory workers adding unapproved hardware to the boards of the servers. You can set up your own local copy of a Private Cloud Compute node and punish it with all the hellfire you want to see if you can break it and get root. Apple will pay you a lot of money if you can. The hardware certification process involves a lot of unrelated people in unrelated departments of Apple. Every Private Cloud Compute node is rigged to not only decertify itself when power is removed, they also rigged the main power for the board to the chassis intrusion switch. Open the server? Power gets cut and the node is de-certified. Every time your devices make a request to Private Cloud Compute, they record the node ID that was used to fulfill it and you can go in and verify that all of the nodes your device used are still certified. The production OS images are free for the public to download and not encrypted in any way. Every package that makes up the important parts of the OS are split into two types: code and data. You cannot mix code into a data package or vice-versa. This is literal madness in comparison to how most other AI products are run. Most of the time, an AI product is run on some GPUs you got somewhere that run some firmware that you probably haven't tested or verified (even though everyone with access to the GPU can reflash the firmware from software), with bog-standard nginx or something choosing to route your requests to a service running somewhere without any real guarantees that the service is not logging and storing literally everything you put into it. From a user privacy standpoint, it's basically the same as using Instagram. You assume that everything is being logged and used to make money somehow. Apple is standing in stark opposition to this and saying \"no, we ain't doing that\" and then backing it all up with code as well as detailed documentation for how they pulled it all off. They also released the source code for the security-critical parts of Private Cloud Compute openly on GitHub. This is the holy grail for remotely attested trusted compute. This OS is the kind of thing that Richard Stallman was warning about in The Right to Read. You don't get root there. You don't get a compiler. You don't get a debugger. You don't get anything but the ability to run software that was shipped with the OS image. If this OS were shipped to consumers, you would have a nearly unhackable system that would make it basically impossible to tinker with. There are many reasons why you would want such a thing in the era of phone scamming the elderly, but it would make it difficult for people like me to be developed with it. However, for something like Private Cloud Compute, it's a perfect match. All the computer can do is known in advance and nothing else is allowed to happen. This makes it a lot easier to ensure that privacy guarantees are that: guarantees. It's really frustrating that this foundation of trusted compute is being squandered. I wish I had an OS like Private Cloud Compute's as an option for building production systems. What we got We got the first batch of Apple Intelligence features at the end of October 2024. They've been advertised as if they are all out. With that we got Writing Tools to help you summarize and rewrite text; summaries for notifications, webpages, and emails; Clean Up in case you want to remove things from photos; the ability to search for photos based on their contents; Siri being able to search through the documentation for your device; and Math Notes to let you solve equations in the Notes app. Later we got Image Playground and email categorization. That mythical personal context is omnipresent in the advertising yet somehow, it's not launched yet. I'm gonna break down my feelings about each of these features in their own little sections after having used them somewhat extensively. Math Notes I just want to start out by saying that out of all of these features the one that I love the most is Math Notes. Holy crap, Math Notes is incredible. It lets you type out things like this: Rent = 2300 FamilySize = 2 Rent / FamilySize = And then the Notes app will just insert 1150 after that last equals sign. It's fantastic. I end up using this to do basic calculations with variables including terrible estimates for how much money I'm making vs spending. It's probably one of the best features ever made for any Apple device ever. I have zero complaints about Math Notes. Writing Tools I'm not the target audience for Writing Tools. I've written a bunch of articles on my blog and frankly, I don't really need help from an AI model in order to write; I have a bigger problem not writing than I do writing. With that in mind, Writing Tools is basically useless for me. It's just a way to get a slightly worse version of what I already have the ability to make myself better. Using Writing Tools makes me feel the worst side effects of existing AI tools and how they replace the creative process instead of adding to it. When I put text through Writing Tools I get an opaque answer. I don't get layers into the answer or steerability beyond \"make this professional\" or \"turn this into a table\", I just get a blob of text that can be painful to read. For example, I asked Writing Tools to summarize that last paragraph and here's what I got: a modal dialog over the previous paragraph in Apple Notes titled 'Writing Tools Unavailable: Certain capabilities are unavailable at this time. Try again later.' You can't make this up. I asked it to make it friendlier and I got this: Using Writing Tools has some serious drawbacks. It feels like it’s taking away the creative process instead of enhancing it. When I input text into Writing Tools, I get a generic response that lacks depth and customization options. It’s like getting a one-size-fits-all answer that’s hard to follow and doesn’t allow for much creativity. It can be useful for taking a bunch of ranting I do on stream and turning that into an outline that I can use for a starting point in writing, but it does a terrible job of doing the writing for me. I imagine that for other people that don't have extensive English experience it'd be a lot more useful, but I don't know how useful it is for me. Notification, Message, and Email summaries This is the biggest feature that sounds like a good idea until you actually implement it. The core idea is that when you get a bunch of notifications from your apps, you have a stack of things that can be tedious to go through. A summary is easier to digest and gets the point across much easier. This works great until it doesn't. Here's the summary of a scam text message I got as I was writing this post: A message summary: 'Package delivery delayed due to incomplete address information...' This phrases a literal scam message in ways that make me think immediate action is required. You can see how this doesn't scale, right? It's gotten to the point where the news has reported on how notification summaries made people think a suspect in custody killed themselves. Even more, if you have Apple Intelligence enabled for some of the other features but disable notification summaries because you find them worthless, you can get your notifications delayed up to five seconds. It's kind of depressing that telling your computer to do less work makes the result take longer than doing more work. Additionally, none of the summarization features work on my iPhone and I can't be bothered to figure out why and fix it. I personally don't find them useful. I just leave them enabled on my MacBook so that notification delivery is not impacted.Even though it has decent \"Apple polish\", it just feels half-baked somehow. It's almost like it's not done yet but they were made to just ship whatever they had in order to meet some arbitrary deadline made up by someone that doesn't understand the details. This feels like it's happening across the industry though, especially as companies try to milk the money generator for more money. Clean Up I don't like Clean Up from a philosophical standpoint. I'm a photographer. When I frame a shot and take it, I want the data coming off of the sensor to be the data that makes up the image. I want to avoid as much processing as possible and I want the photo to be a reflection of reality as it is, not reality as it should have been. Sure, sometimes I'll do some color correction or cropping in post, but that doesn't change the content of the image, only its presentation. Clean Up is best explained by this famous photo editing example: A picture of Joseph Stalin, former Prime Minister of the Soviet Union next to Nikolai Yezhov before and after being removed from Soviet history after being purged. This tool allows you to capture a moment in time as you wish it happened, not as it actually happened. I don't like this from a philosophical standpoint. I'd much rather capture things as they were. As such, I haven't used Clean Up and can't talk about it much more. Image Playground I have a lot of thoughts about Image Playground. I've used a lot of image generation models and I'm currently working on experiments with conveyance (images that convey feelings or moods that would take many words to explain) in generative AI. Here's one of my successful examples: A picture of a brown-haired anime woman smiling in a field of blooming pink flowers, heavy depth of field so only the woman and a couple of flowers are in focus. Made with Stable Diffusion 1.5 and ComfyUI. I made this using a stack of about 11 to 12 models in a complex diffusion flow using a Stable Diffusion 1.5 finetune from late 2022. Let's call this the upper bound of how good you can get outputs from techniques of the era. There's some glaring flaws (mostly involving the continuity of the fence, but that could be explained with fence construction methods). In comparison, here's one of my Image Playground generations of the East Berlin TV tower at sunset: An AI-generated illustration of the East Berlin TV tower at sunset. This is also pretty good, there's problems with how the sky is half mid-day and half sunset and the windows/decks have a lot of issues with many straight lines, but it'd be mostly passable at a casual glance. Especially on a phone screen. I'm able to see a lot more of the flaws due to my extensive experience with AI tools, but in a pinch you probably wouldn't blink too hard at this. I hate to admit that this is heavily cherry-picked. Most of the time, you will get horrors beyond mortal comprehension like this: An AI-generated illustration of a taco smoking beer at a party. The taco has hooves for feet and hands. It uses a placid corporate artstyle and communicates nothing. This is horrifying. I don't even know where to begin in talking about all of the things that are off or wrong with this image. I also don't think you would need special training or experience to understand what is wrong with this image. Mind you, this both of those images were generated with plain text prompts. You can add people to these images. Using a photo of yourself is a great way to experience what dysmorphia feels like. Here's one of Corey Quinn doing his typical gremlin smile: An AI-generated illustration of a man smiling. The proportions are disturbing. The soulless eyes peer into you and make you contemplate where the effort into AI image generation has gone and what good for humanity could have been done with that money and effort. His pupils are square like his teeth. I cannot believe that this is a shipped product from Apple. I genuinely am stunned. What the hell is going on over there? This is from the company that refused to ship so many things that we'll never hear about. This is from the company that defined the idea of having a vision-based product. Of having a product vision so strong that they were willing to accuse people of holding a device wrongly rather than admit they messed up.I feel like Image Playground (and Genmoji, which isn't talked about here due to the fact that it's difficult to extract emoji from chat messages without losing quality) creates results that are just as soulless and empty as it is. This is the complete opposite of the level of care and quality that I've come to expect from Apple over the years. It's like they've been forced to just ship something due to either investor pressure or not wanting to be behind on the curve; and nobody at the product team was able to stop it from hitting the market. And now every company out there is going to copy this with open-weights models and make things that don't look like horrifying monsters. While you get the oompa-loompas of doom staring into your soul on iPhones, the rest of the industry is going to be able to make things like this: A cartoon illustration of the Berlin TV tower at sunset. The sky has many shades of gold and red as it fades to twilight. It's frustrating. It'd be better if there was an IntelligenceKit for developers to be creative with the models or something, but there isn't. It all just feels half-baked like they were forced to release it out of obligation to shareholders, not out of choice for meeting the product vision. Generative AI is not a product Back in September, I had a strange dream. If you know me well enough, you know that when I have a \"strange dream\", that usually means that something wild happened. In this dream, I had a conversation with Steve Jobs about product design, the philsophy of Apple enabling people to be creative, but the most salient point we discussed was this: The real way that technology can change lives is by acting as a bicycle for the mind, a way to take humans' latent creativity and allow them to focus it and employ it into something that makes their lives better. Imagine picking up a guitar and creating a song by purely feeling out the notes and working it into a melody just from what feels \"right\". Based on what you've described, most generative AI is useless for that because it removes all the creative control when going from A to B. If anything, the human cost seems like that it would outweigh any process gains from being able to draw a cat on the moon faster. Generative AI is completely useless as a product unto itself, but could be part of a larger product in some way. It should never be the selling point. -\"Steve Jobs\" in a dream, September 2024 Breaking this apart, what does being able to make a terrible illustration of the Berlin TV Tower in a second or two really net us in terms of enabling creativity? You get a single final output. You don't get the layers to edit things like the color grading of the sky. Sure it'd be useful for low-effort social media posts, but this is not a product. This is a tech demo, and not even a good one. It'd be amazing if this was released 3 years ago, but it is 2025, not 2022. If generative AI is not a product, then what is it really useful for? I know how to use it in creative flows because I already have the training needed to be an artist. I know how to use it in research environments due to having years of experience throwing science at the wall to see what sticks. I understand these tools and what they are good and bad at (this is why all of my AI illustrations that I put effort into end up with an anime-inspired artstyle because recreating humans photorealistically gets you inhuman monsters 7 times out of 10). I think that it's better to view generative AI as an implementation detail, not the critical identity of the product. One of the best ways to understand a product is to start taking things away. If you take color out of a word processor, you still have a word processor. If you take bold or italic formatting out of a word processor, you still have a word processor. If you take font selection out of a word processor, you still have a word processor. If you take away the display output from a word processor, you have a typewriter instead of a word processor. Thus, the core of a word processor is being able to see on the screen what you would see on the page before you hit print. The core of why ChatGPT works as a product isn't the AI. It's the experience of each word being typed one at a time by the AI and saving your conversations with the AI for later. Where should we use generative AI? In terms of where I think generative AI is actually useful, it's in places that are not as flashy or exciting. Think data analysis, qualitative data coding, data entry, reading data out of images, and things along that nature. I've been working with a fellow redditor on a study involving people's experiences of meditation and the difficult to describe sensations that come up. We want to use generative AI to try and categorize those sensations and see if we can get an effective result without as much drudgery involved as you'd get doing it by hand. I'll have more news about this by June. It'll involve publishing a paper or two in actual journals. Conclusion I think that Apple Intelligence is a failure of a product from an implementation standpoint. This is frustrating because the foundation they are building on top of is nearly invincible. All data is processed on device as much as possible. Everything that can't be processed on your device is put into frontier-grade security practices to make sure it's as private and encrypted as possible. The thing that sucks about it is that they made the holy grail of remotely attested trusted compute and then made the end result so much worse to use than manually making your own integrations with Ollama on the same device. Using Ollama lets you pick models that are so much better than what you get with Apple Intelligence. And it'd be just as private.I just can't help but imagine what it could have been. I know that the Apple we have would never do that, but I just can't help but wonder. Apple spends untold amounts of money trying to create things and they get beaten by a bunch of people in caves with boxes of scraps and consumer GPUs.You know, maybe that's why the open-source community will always win here. Apple has no real limits. The open-source community has to milk everything they can get out of the hardware they have. Their withered hardware requires them to use lateral thinking to get what they want. And they'll pretty much always win because then they can deploy their creations into production. With zero modifications. Needless to say, they did not give us bicycles of the mind. They gave us marginal improvements that feel like tech demos. The potential was so infinite and it just all feels wasted. Except for Math Notes. Holy crap. I love Math Notes so much. I wish other note-taking apps had it. It's easily the best feature they've ever come up with. I have a lot of complicated and nuanced thoughts about all this, and probably still have another 5-10k words left in me. Wish me luck.

MacWrite was released 5 years after WordPerfect, which itself is predated by WordStar. I don't get why Apple fans have this obsession with pretending Apple invents these things. Apple refines what others have attempted before, that's what they're good at. Part of the reason people are disappointed with Apple these days is because of this fantasy image of Apple as an inventor. reply Clamchop 4 hours agoparentAuthor does say word processors \"like\" MacWrite, so falls short of saying it was the first at anything (and it wasn't), but WordPerfect and WordStar are interesting choices for comparison. Of the three, only MacWrite is a GUI-based WYSIWYG word processor that would be immediately familiar to modern audiences. (WordPerfect wouldn't get GUI until 1991.) reply DidYaWipe 17 minutes agorootparentBut the example functionality is backspacing, which of course in no way requires a GUI. You could just as easily cite AtariWriter or Bank Street Writer, which came out before WordPerfect. reply WillAdams 3 hours agorootparentprevIt's interesting to note that when WordPerfect got a GUI, it had to be worked up separately for each platform --- the NeXTstep version was quite nice, took full advantage of Display PostScript, and was coded up by a couple of programmers in six weeks or so. reply wat10000 2 hours agorootparentThat’s how cross-platform apps were. Middleware libraries that you could use to put the same GUI code on different OSes didn’t exist, and there wasn’t room for them anyway. Even sharing the core could be a tough proposition. I know that at least MS Word for Mac vs Windows was two completely separate programs that happened to share a name and a feature set. That continued until Mac MS Word 6.0 in 1994. That was a port of the Windows version, and very much disliked among the Mac userbase for being poor performance and not really behaving like a Mac app should. I don’t think cross-platform UI code really took off on the Mac until maybe 20 years later. Plenty of Mac apps were built that way before that point, but they tended to be ones in the “you’re stuck using this, so it doesn’t have to be very nice” category, like Word ended up being. It doesn’t really seem to have tipped until Electron came along, and somehow web apps that use half a gigabyte of RAM to show some text became totally accepted as good enough. Incidentally, the Cocoa UI framework that macOS uses was originally a cross platform framework that could deploy to Windows and various other OSes, back when it was made by NeXT. Apple. Apple killed that off and it became Mac-exclusive. I wonder what the world would look like if they kept support for other OSes. Maybe we’d have a good selection of cross platform apps that actually look nice and perform well. reply WillAdams 2 minutes agorootparentTo see that, look at the apps which almost were: - Pages.app by Pages --- amazing DTP tool which was bought by Anderson Financial Services, but then killed off when Rhapsody went away - Macromedia Freehand --- unfortunately, they continued with their in-house toolkit to make the Mac/Windows versions, since it would have been too much work to revive the old Altsys Virtuoso code - Quantrix Financial Modeller --- at least this still survived, but be sure to take a seat before looking up the cost per seat - FrameMaker --- the NeXT version was the nicest one I ever used, and with Display PostScript, was far nicer to work with - WordPerfect --- the NeXT version was far nicer than the Windows, would have been nice to see that come back - Stone Create (and the other Stone apps) --- nice assortment of various tools which would have been quite nice to have Lots of other way cool NeXT apps which should have done better in the market. mjevans 1 hour agorootparentprevReal damage of Microsoft's Monopoly power. They have a severe case of Not Invented Here syndrome and even for free Open Source Software refuse to ship any of it naively unless they can fork it and pretend they wrote it (early TCP code based off BSD IIRC). It's horrendously tough to target for a cross-platform application when you have to bring the entire GUI toolkit along and adapt it individually to every target, even the 95% of the market gorilla that is whatever versions of Desktop Windows are the most recent 3. reply pjmlp 47 minutes agorootparentReal damage is called Electron. reply efitz 1 hour agorootparentprevWordPerfect's GUI releases were yuck. Late to the scene and lost the essence of WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS. I'm not surprised that Word won that battle. reply WillAdams 7 minutes agorootparentThe NeXTstep version was _very_ nice --- looked and felt like a native app, but still had \"Reveal Codes\" --- nicest version of WordPerfect I every used. reply ghaff 40 minutes agorootparentprevWordPerfect and WordStar were always pretty yuck IMO once newer generation products came along. I was pretty much a fan of Microsoft word even in the DOS days. (Even Multimate which was basically a DOS clone of a Wang product.) reply efitz 22 minutes agorootparentI loved WP5.1 for DOS because of one feature: \"show codes\" - it made it trivial to understand why the formatting looked the way it did, and to fix formatting problems. Other than that it was not outstanding software :-) I never used Word in the DOS days so I can't compare, but it was obvious that Word for Windows was written natively for Windows and it \"felt\" much more natural in the Windows of that time. reply ghaff 17 minutes agorootparentNeither WordPerfect nor WordStar even connected for me. No disrespect for anyone for whom they did. Never really loved Word for Windows to be honest, though I used it a lot over the years. reply leptons 3 hours agorootparentprevAnd before Macwrite, or Macintosh computers existed, there was Xerox PARC and their GUI-based WYSIWYG editor called \"Bravo\", which Steve Jobs no doubt would have seen when he visited PARC. reply RichardCA 56 minutes agorootparentThat historic moment has been dramatized at least once. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2u70CgBr-OI reply AnimalMuppet 3 hours agorootparentprevYeah, this. I mean, look, WordStar was a huge step up from a typewriter. It (and programs like it) made it possible for people like me to write. WordStar let you get the words right. WordPerfect let you do \"you asked for it, you got it\" layout, which was a step up. But MacWrite and programs like it let you do WYSIWYG layout, which was huge. It was like going from typewriter to WordStar, but for layout and appearance. (The words are still more important, but the presentation also matters.) reply Kon-Peki 3 hours agorootparentI always wonder how many people actually used typewriters before talking about them in comparison to word processors. By the late 1970s or early 1980s, typewriters had electronic memory. They had error correction \"tape\" so you could erase mistakes. You could set them to center or right justify text. You could create tables of justified text. Early word processing software was amazing because it gave you more memory to work with, and didn't force you to keep so much of what you previously wrote in your head. But it was only a large step forward compared to typewriters of the time. WYSIWYG blew all of that out of the water. reply adamc 2 hours agorootparentI wrote papers in graduate school using a typewriter before switching to a Mac Plus. It was a Smith-Corona and used a cartridge \"ribbon\" and a special \"correction ribbon\" that lifted off the text (instead of using white-out). It wasn't a Selectric, though, so mostly you just used it as a typewriter. Selectrics were expensive and mostly used in business rather than by individuals. Even the IBM Selectrics were nothing like as good as having a word processor, which is why the transition was so fast. A friend of mine was in commercial real-estate in that period (mid-1980s) and discovered that with a computer, he could type his own offer letters and not have to bother with a secretary. My brother's law firm went through something similar. In a handful of years, there was huge adoption. reply ghaff 35 minutes agorootparentA student organization I was an officer in had a Selectric with a correcting ribbon and I ended up using it for a lot of papers latterly. The newspaper had Royal typewriters and I used those. We did a bunch of literal copy/pasting and then stuff was typed into a huge typesetting system. Grad school (starting 1979), there was a mainframe with DecWriter terminals and that was a big improvement but still nothing like terminal GUIs. reply michaelt 2 hours agorootparentprev> By the late 1970s or early 1980s, typewriters had electronic memory. They had error correction \"tape\" so you could erase mistakes. Sure, there were electronic typewriters where you could type an entire line or two into memory before printing it. And, as you say, typewriters with whiteout reels that allowed you to backspace. But if you've started a new paragraph, and you realise you want to go back and edit the previous one, and everything else needs to move down a line to accommodate? Good chance you're throwing the page away and starting from scratch. Or you're cutting and pasting in the literal sense, using scissors and glue. Typewriters were difficult enough that \"typist\" was a professional job - and many workers wouldn't do their own typing, instead recording messages onto tiny tape cassettes for a typist to type up later on. There were even foot-pedal-controlled cassette players, so typists could type with their hands and control the dictaphone tape with their feet! reply Kon-Peki 2 hours agorootparentEarly word-processing software changed very little of that. I maintain that this kind of software was like typewriters on steroids, with a screen. WYSIWYG software was an entirely new paradigm, and changed everything. reply adamc 2 hours agorootparentEven Word Perfect was much, much better at this than a typewriter. What made it hard to use was that you had to memorize a bunch of special function keybindings, as I recall. Yes, GUI word processors were much better than this, but even Word Perfect looked compelling compared to using a typewriter. I wrote a bunch of papers using a typewriter. Standard operating procedure was to plan out the complete paper, basically as a tree of bullet points (I used index cards), and then turn those into sentences at the typewriter. All the writing/reorganization had to happen before you sat down to type. reply tiahura 1 hour agorootparentyou had to memorize a bunch of special function keybindings Keyboard templates were pretty ubiquitous. reply efitz 20 minutes agorootparentprevI learned typing on an IBM Selectric, my parents made me take a typing course before they would buy a computer. White-out or correction tape was how we fixed typos (or just didn't make them). If you were smart you wrote your words out longhand before typing them; you didn't \"think\" while typing. The early computerized typewriters kinda sucked - you could do line level edits but the print quality was dot matrix or worse. reply phil21 3 hours agorootparentprevIt's also technology was much less ubiquitous back then and less evenly distributed, at least in my experience. I went from a mechanical typewriter which had the whiteout tape as it's only \"advanced\" feature, directly to a WYSIWYG editor. It was absolutely night and day. I only saw an \"advanced\" electronic typewriter later in life at my grandparents house, which was used rarely and only for her accounting business as it was so expensive when they first bought it. As far as I know my experience was pretty much normal for my peer group - as my school had a similar setup. As a kid in school, it was amazing going from having to totally re-type a rough draft to being able to make some casual edits and hit print. Hours saved for each paper, especially with the typing skills I had back then! reply wjnc 1 hour agorootparentMost 70s-80s advanced typewriter were just not regular household material. Even among white collar jobs. My parents (and mini me) worked on very mediocre type writers, until my dad got a PC from work with WordPerfect. Interesting from an economical perspective is that the 'top' typewriters were a lot more affordable than early pc's. People just didn't buy them. What they had was good enough, regardless of features. My dad ended up so enthusiastic for PC's to later spend more than a monthly wage on a PC for the family (actually: me). Every two years. Incredible, especially compared to the afforability of digital devices nowadays. Word processing software was to writing as smartphones were to photography, or as the book press was to writing. Perhaps not transformational on a per feature basis, but transformational on grounds of the possibilities and market it unlocked. reply pjmlp 45 minutes agorootparentprevAs someone alive back then, they were also quite expensive, and only a few had them. I bought my typewriter around 1990, a plain classical one, where I threw lots of paper away, learn to use corrector tape and ink to save them. reply matwood 3 hours agorootparentprevI learned to type on an electric typewriter :) It wasn't a fancy word processing one with memory, but just that the hammers struck the paper using a motor making it easier to type. It also made a very satisfying 'thunk' which I would randomly trigger while the teacher was talking that in turn caused me to get thrown out of class a number of times. reply xena 2 hours agorootparentprevHi, author of the article here. I do most of my drafting of these longer articles on a Freewrite Alpha, which is effectively an electronic typewriter. When I use it I have one rule: the backspace key is banned. This makes me restate my thoughts if I make a typo or just bulldoze through it. I find that this makes me make better drafts in the process. reply quesera 2 hours agorootparentYikes. You might be blessed with a brain for written communication.

I have another article about AI coming out about how we could use generative AI to make art that we've never seen before, but it's mostly used for AI slop. I'm in the middle of ranting it out into the typewriter. It's bad currently, but I make it bad first so I can remake it better later. Here's an excerpt of the intro that I'm going to be rewriting. This is the \"raw clay\" that I mold in editing. > I like creating things. There's a lot of joy in being able to sit there, think about a thing, and then make that thing come into existence. This is something I really enjoy doing and I'm blessed to be able to do that as my job in DevRel. > One of the core conflicts that i end up having with the stuff I create is that I am a bit more artistically minded than people would expect out of the gate. I mean, I get it. Tech isn't really known for *art*, it's a lot more known for being the barrier between you and artists you want to follow. > Howeever I've ended up seeing kind of a disturbing pattern with AI tools that are meant or at least intended to aid people in the creation of art: they're almost always used to create infinite slop machines without a lick of art in the process. Today I'm going to talk about this fundamental conflict between two categories: art and content. Art is that which conveys, inspires and tells stories. Content is what goes between the ads so that media moguls can see their profit lines go up. I want to argue that a lot of what AI tools are actually being used for is content that is gussied up as if it is art. If you want to see what the entire writing process looks like after it festers for a while in my head, I wrote out the holy grail article on Twitch: https://youtu.be/N_KNpVujAL8 [1]: https://xeiaso.net/blog/2024/soylent-green-people/ reply analog31 2 hours agorootparentprevI did. I used my mom's typewriter, which she typed her thesis on in the 1950s, and switched to word processing on a college owned TRS-80 before getting an MS-DOS machine of my own. The big breakthrough was editing. WYSIWIG didn't solve a problem in that space. College papers didn't need different fonts, and it was sufficient to let the computer take care of formatting, like using Markdown.

WordPerfect for Windows was released in 1991. Prior versions were MS-DOS and not graphical. WordStar for Windows was released in about 1991. Prior versions were MS-DOS and not graphical. What made MacWrite special, is that it was graphical, highly WYSIWYG (especially when paired with an Apple printer), had a lot of great fonts, and the software was intuitive. Of course Apple didn't invent any of it, but they made one of the best word processing products at the time. reply jpadkins 2 hours agorootparentHow do you measure best? Based on usage, sales, or fraction of published text created - Wordperfect or Wordstar were way ahead of MacWrite. MacWrite was the best in a niche market of personal newsletters that wanted graphical elements. More professional desktop publishers used Aldus PageMaker. And big publishing houses didn't use PCs or software, they used offset lithography presses. reply philistine 2 hours agorootparentIt's like you decided to completely disregard that the successor of MacWrite ended up completely eating all the use cases for making documents outside of the large-scale professional uses. MacWrite begat Microsoft Word 3.01, which is when Word overtook MacWrite on Mac and became truly competitive with WordPerfect on DOS. reply jpadkins 42 minutes agorootparentSo your basis for saying \"one of the best word processing products at the time.\" is that a different company made a different product inspired by it (and WordPerfect)? I don't think that is a persuasive argument. If you said MacWrite was an innovative word processor, I would not have replied. Most innovative is not always the best product at the time. reply runjake 26 minutes agorootparentYou're replying to a commenter here, not the OP. I am the actual OP. If you're concerned by my use of the word \"best\", please replace that word with \"innovative for consumers\". If you have an issue with this new wording, then we'll have to agree to disagree. While MacWrite may or may not have been \"niche\" as you said, it most definitely heavily influenced another \"niche\" word processor available today: Microsoft Word. Word for Mac (1985) was the first graphical version of Word and it was heavily inspired by MacWrite. reply deng 1 hour agorootparentprev> MacWrite was released in 1984. 7 years before comparable graphical, WYSIWYG competitors. You realize there were other systems besides PC and Mac? Signum for the Atari ST came out in 1986. It was a fully fledged WYSIWYG text processor with special printer drivers for regular dot matrix printers. Even with a 9-pin you could create great looking output, if you had the patience (a single page took minutes to print). Signum was way ahead of MacWrite and was very popular with people needing special fonts in science/math and the humanities (you could quite easily design your own fonts). Also, it allowed for Right-to-left text, and of course the Atari ST was way cheaper than the Mac. reply runjake 17 minutes agorootparent*> You realize there were other systems besides PC and Mac?* Yep, I do. I was an Atari ST, then Amiga user until long past when those platforms were considered alive. :-) But in terms of influence, MacWrite had more (eg. Microsoft Word for Mac). For general consumer use, I found MacWrite much better than Signum. But I can see your point in terms of academics and non-English speakers. BTW, if anyone's curious, I believe the actual first WYSIWYG word processor was probably Bravo[1]. And Bravo somewhat influenced MacWrite. 1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bravo_(editor) reply adamc 2 hours agoparentprevYes, but having used both in that time period... tools on the mac were graphical and easily explored (open a menu and see what was available). People made plastic keyboard templates for WordPerfect and WordStar just to remember the commands. On top of that, you could easily task switch on a Mac. There were some tools for doing that with DOS, but they were awful by comparison. I worked in a lab that used PCs while I owned a Mac Plus. There was no comparison. reply gordon_freeman 50 minutes agoparentprevSiri had so many years to iterate and get refined that by now I'd assume it would have been as omnipresent assistant as in \"Her\" movie (without negative impact of course) but see where we are today: I am still using it for only weather and setting alarms and even in that it sometimes works and sometimes does not. reply philistine 2 hours agoparentprevYou're basically explaining why the Macintosh stayed niche when it came out.

This is entirely tangential and probably a pointless gripe in this thread, but... For some reason, it's always really annoyed me that Apple took MP3 players, called them an 'iPod' and suddenly everyone ate them up like they were the second coming of christ and we'd never had them ever before. reply kmeisthax 1 hour agorootparentAs someone who was There At The Time, the UX of the iPod was really, really good. There were few, if any, other companies that could match it. The vast majority of competing music players were what DankPods calls \"nuggets\" - i.e. barely functional e-waste that were either saddled down with horrible software (e.g. anything Sony made), had horrible controls, were bulky and painful to use, or some combination of those above dealbreakers. A lot of companies treated developing an MP3 player like any other kind of music player, and ignored the fact that these things could hold 100x as much music as anything else on the market, which necessitated a completely new UX. To be clear, there were good non-Apple MP3 players, but they were either marketed poorly, or late arrivals (e.g. the Toshiba player that got rebadged into the Zune). By the time those existed (and tech companies started hiring UI/UX people), Apple was doing a complete reset of another product category: smartphones. I suspect history would have been different had, say, MiniDisc hadn't failed horribly in America[0]. Pre-iPod, portable music in the US was either compact cassettes with all the downsides of tape, or CD players that could just barely fit in your pocket. The iPod was such a step up from either that it all but became a genericized trademark. Had we had a competing technology from not the 1980s, we probably wouldn't have thought the iPod was so great. Or at least, people I knew who had MiniDisc looked at the iPod like I look at all the e-waste that was trying to compete with the iPod. [0] Yes, I know that Sony was basically trying to avoid a repeat of DAT getting banned reply finnthehuman 6 minutes agorootparentThe ipod was a very welcome step in the portable music player tech evolution at the time, but it also coincided with a bunch of people that were suddenly Very Into Music for a few years. I don't fault anyone for thinking the previous portables were just not good enough to every day carry, but they also never seemed to notice that the OG white earbuds were more painful and sounded much worse than a decent brand of $15 black earbuds. Maybe never finding good earbuds explains why they gave up on their Passion for portable music within a few years. reply MisterTea 1 hour agorootparentprev> the UX of the iPod was really, really good.

No fiddling and taking eyes off road. reply entropicdrifter 1 hour agorootparentprevIn addition to the already very thorough and well-considered comment replying to this, I just wanted to say that the iPod was one of the first MP3 players that was widely available with a full-blown hard-drive. The vast majority of MP3 players at the time had like 32-64MB of flash memory, if that (and still cost hundreds of dollars). The iPod had 5GB and 10GB models. Suddenly you could bring your entire CD collection with you anywhere.

I had one with a tiny LCD screen that would only fit half the song title (no space for the artist). To go to then next song, you had to press the \"next\" button (which makes sense). Except that action would take at least 0.5s. You press next, you wait, you see the display refresh with the next song's partial song name. Not the song I want, press next again. Very quickly, to skip 10 songs takes 10 seconds of effort. It was a painful device to use. The iPod cam with a large screen and a click wheel. I could find songs on it. That was a revolution for me. MP3 was the enabling technology (if you can't fit many songs on a small device, then this is moot). reply SeanLuke 1 hour agoparentprev> MacWrite was released 5 years after WordPerfect, which itself is predated by WordStar. I don't get why Apple fans have this obsession with pretending Apple invents these things. Um, hello, Wang OIS? WordStar and WordPerfect didn't invent anything. They were copies of terminal-based word processors. But MacWrite was different in two important ways. First, like Bravo and Gypsy before it, it was WYSIWYG, a million times better than WordStar/WordPerfect. And it worked with the LaserWriter. But more importantly: it was free.

Calling what they do as mere refinement may be equally understating it in some cases. They get it right. For the masses. They create beginners. Anyone can start with an Apple, because it’s what it’s designed to do. I have my own biases that extreme usability started earlier with other movements like WebOS and Palm contributing to it as well. Still, if we look for watershed moments where huge numbers of people in the mainstream adopt technology, whether it’s the iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, watch, laptops, they don’t need to be the first, just the best for the most number of people. Being able to integrate hardware and software closely creates a different and reliable result for the many, as much as I might not like having complete agency.

The industry has 100% coalesced on the model invented by Apple. Nothing like this existed as a full package before the iPhone and now are almost universal: - No physical keyboard + touch keyboard - Modern OS kernel (not embedded specific kernel) - Desktop browser engine - Capacitive touchscreen + finger instead of stylus - one or two phones had capTouch before, but they were far from standard, and they still had physical keyboards for typing - Vertical by default orientation - Short 1 day battery life in favour of more power/features (weird to list, but was a bold move everyone mocked then followed) They totally took out the existing market (Blackberry, Windows Mobile, Symbian, a variety of OEM OSs). Android succeeded but came after, still had keyboards on its flagships the years after iPhone came out (G1, Droid), and took these design cues from iPhone. The Mac GUI with mouse+keyboard+windows was also huge. Admittedly not first to invent it (Xerox PARC), but first to ship it as a package is still hugely impressive.

Now it seems like Apple is cloning Google/Samsung more. reply tmzt 2 hours agorootparentThe first versions of Android that the public saw were very similar to the OS on a BlackBerry or Danger HipTop. The G1 even used the same mechanism to deploy the keyboard. As far as the rounded corners, I remember seeing a reduced Google Reader view of Engadget later that year that had every device looking the same from the top third up. I really wish I had a screenshot. There is now a lot of cross inspriation and features that are copied in both directions, as well as both implementing the same thing at around the same time (Intelligence and Gemini).

At the end of the day, there are some disparate competing utilities in this class on the Samsung and Google phones, but no one is shipping something that is obviously game-changing and in first place; they all kinda suck, they're all tech demos, and it'll inevitably take many years to get this technology honed in to something that is truly useful to consumers. reply PaulHoule 3 hours agoparentThere is a lot in the Apple universe that is shoddy. iTunes, for instance. iOS has a refinement that Android lacks but I am unimpressed with MacOS. Windows is stuffed full of terrible crapplets and Windows users largely recognize that these are terrible crapplets and don't use them. Apple users have a fixed belief that everything Apple does is brilliant and fashionable so they do use them which has a deadly effect on the market for third-party software.

For one thing, the iTunes name doesn't technically exist anymore except on Windows. And anyone complaining about it being bad on Windows...I mean, that's like complaining that Microsoft Remote Desktop (Now called the Windows app for some reason) sucks on Mac, right? Like, can we just put the Windows version aside please? Even then, I'm not really sure what specific thing iTunes for Windows sucks at besides not looking like a Windows app. People just say that because they were saying it in 2005. On Mac, the Music app (not to be confused with the streaming service) is fantastic and has supported Apple's \"classic\" digital music workflow longer than anyone else has been willing to support their users. The Apple TV app (again, not to be confused with TV+ subsciption service) is now the home for the music/TV show store/rental place and the home of your TV/movie library, which is a big improvement from shoving that functionality in iTunes. in that sense, Apple has cleanly separated use cases and functionality in a way that iTunes didn't previously, which is one reason why a lot of people said \"iTunes sucks.\" I have a family member who recently switched to Android because of frustration with Apple as a whole. They are a big digital music collector, they don't believe in streaming or \"renting\" their content. I tried to help them with their music collection on Android. Theoretically it should be easier right? No weird restrictions on sync direction, basically dump your stuff on an SD card/transfer over USB-C and you're off to the races. But still, they switched back to Apple secondarily because it's the only place left that actually makes that \"purchased digital music\" experience user-friendly, or possible at all. (Primarily they switched back to iPhone because the modem in their Google Pixel sucks and/or is poorly tested with their major US carrier and would drop international calls every 15 minutes exactly for no reason) Google Play's music store doesn't exist anymore. Every jukebox app on Android depends on 100% manual file management. None of them have the polish of the Music app (the app not the service). Almost none of them have decent jukebox companion apps available on desktop computers. A whole bunch of other digital music stores have closed entirely. Apple's system for synchronizing content is actually pretty amazing for continuing to support an offline cloudless workflow. You still just hit one button/plug in your device to sync your music, movies, audiobooks, ebooks, and photos content. It also supports WiFi syncing, and it furthermore supports every iPod that ever existed so long as you have the right cable/adapter. You can back up your iPhone's full image to your computer if you don't want to use iCloud backups just like it was an iPod. You can synchronize your Photos library and avoid iCloud storage fees, deleting synchronized photos from your phone to free up space to take new photos and videos. It works just like you were using a digital camera in 2005. Yep, you can still rip and burn CDs! Furthermore, the way Apple moved device synchronization functions to Finder and split out Music from Podcasts and Audiobooks is helpful for organizing the whole process. It used to be that iTunes was the home for all this synchronizing of non-music-related content, but now it more sensibly exists in Finder. I think a lot of people don't realize that Apple basically still allows you to send over personally owned non-DRMed or even pirated content to Apple's own modern apps very easily this way, you just have to be willing to synchronize using \"the old way\" like your iPhone is an iPod. They've even kept ancient hosted services like iTunes Match going just in case you still need that sort of thing (it essentially allows you to sync music to your iPhone that is either pirated or not part of a known label music catalog via a cloud service rather than having to do a local sync via cable or WiFi). And this workflow is very simple for non-technical users who don't really know how to traverse complicated file management structures. Yes, I would really like if apps like Photos was more flexible on file management, but on the other hand if you follow the prescribed workflow the results are quite user friendly for someone who really doesn't want the cloud but also can't handle setting up a home NAS. In this use case you have a reasonable photo storage system by syncing your device and then backing up your computer in a relatively hands-off manner using Time Machine. One final point here is that Apple Music the subscription service can be hidden entirely from the app. Apple will just give you a 100% owned music jukebox app. Google doesn't do that, and with Microsoft you're probably using a legacy app like Windows Media Player that looks like it belongs on Windows Vista. reply PaulHoule 2 hours agorootparentMicrosoft Remote Desktop is 100% great on iOS (if not MacOS) in my opinion.

But that debate completely sidesteps the elephant in the room - most artists nowadays don't make a living making art, just making art-adjacent content, where the artistic value is not really super appreciated by the buyer - photographers creating stock photos, graphic designers making app icons, background music for ads and the like.

On the other hand, I totally agree that it's pretty useless as it stands right now.

His favorite AI feature is essentially writing valid js for calculations (his example is literally valid js if you just drop the equals on the last line - you can paste it right into the console on his site and see the answer). The whole article feels like it suffers from a similar lack of coherence. Ex - I am hardly an apple fanboy (I strongly dislike the company) but the complaints here are basically The service sometimes has outages The image gen is not as customizable as he'd like He's morally opposed to cleanup in photos Notifications summaries are bad (and how dare I get my texts 5 seconds slower). --- None of that is really related in any way to the security footprint of the tooling he discusses up front, and it's also hardly distinct from most other current AI offerings, and it's not really a consistent complaint about the tech. My opinion of Apple is that they do a crappy job with the vast majority of their apps... They build good hardware, and they abuse their small hardware footprint to make decent device experiences and a decent (but getting worse) OS - but their actual applications are generally mediocre at best (mediocre copies of a previously successful, usually better, app that they will put out of business through shady store practices if I'm being blunt). --- If anything, the failure here is that Apple marketed a thing that AI can't really do (yet, maybe at all), and most of the things AI can do without being incredibly invasive aren't actually all that useful to most folks. Very useful to a handful of power users in specific circumstances, but otherwise essentially novelty apps. So... it's not an implementation failure. It's a marketing failure. And this is hardly unique to Apple right now. The only difference is that usually Apple doesn't play their hand until this inflection point with new tech is over, so it's more obvious this time around just how bad the product fit is for general use. reply adamc 2 hours agoprevI was an early user of Macs; the first computer I owned was a Mac Plus.

Also, it's almost exactly what Solver has done for years. reply cratermoon 3 hours agoprevI could pick on quite of few nits here but I'm going to focus on one in particular that I'm very familiar with as a photographer and mass media studies student. > I want the data coming off of the sensor to be the data that makes up the image. I want to avoid as much processing as possible and I want the photo to be a reflection of reality as it is, not reality as it should have been. Sure, sometimes I'll do some color correction or cropping in post, but that doesn't change the content of the image, only its presentation. First nit: the iPhone camera, and all digital cameras, are deeply influenced by computational photography techniques. What this means is that you essentially never get the raw pixel values, although there are exceptions. The image you get is already significantly manipulated. Second nit: color correction, color in general, dynamic range, focus, depth of field, and more are all manipulations made by default, even long before digital cameras when film was king. There is no \"correct\" image version of what our eyes see, there is only pleasing to the photographer and the audience. An example: the negative for Ansel Adams' well known \"Moonrise Over Hernandez , New Mexico\" looks like, at first glance, something a professional would trash for lacking detail. Here's contact print vs the version most of use will probably recognize: https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f5fe5ca8d6a35... Here are four different versions Adams printed over the course of 3 decades: https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f5fe5ca8d6a35... I will mention, but won't even get into a topic that will surely bait HN commentors: Kodak designed and standardized its color film to represent Caucasian skin tones. It wasn't until chocolate and furniture makers complained that everything looked like the same gross mud in their expensively-produced product catalogs that Kodak took a look at rendering dark brown/red/yellow tones more pleasingly. Notice I said \"more pleasingly\", not \"correctly\". reply llm_nerd 3 hours agoprevI'm going to admit that I just skimmed past 90% of this article.

I love food and I love to cook. I love to study the science of cooking. I'm very lucky—I'm not in a position that I have to strongly limit my food expenses, but I have always wanted to see how well I could cook and eat on a limited budget. It would encourage me to think about new ingredients, new techniques, and new dishes. I love cooking competition shows like Iron Chef, and enjoy cooking with limited ingredients, or cooking with a lot of a specific ingredient that someone dumps in my lap. Okay, that's only part of my inspiration. I used to have a huge box of Richie Rich comic books that I bought from my friend for $3. In case you're not familiar with all of the employees of the Rich family, their chef was Chef Pierre, the world's greatest chef. One time, Chef Pierre was kidnapped and held by a bunch of criminals. The criminals told Chef Pierre that he had to cook for them—but they only had potato chips and ketchup!. Not a problem for the world's greatest chef! He created food that was so delicious that the criminals quickly got fat—so fat that they couldn't get through the entrance to their hideout! Chef Pierre then escaped by simply walking out unchallenged! (After which, Mr. Rich's security force swept in and cut all the criminals' heads off.) In any case, I always wanted to be that good, and be that versatile with ingredients: so good that I could make a good meal out of whatever's on hand. I'd love to be on a cooking challenge show, and see how well I could do with constraints and surprises, and with limited ingredients (like whatever's on a great sale, or your neighbor drops on your doorstep.) I consider this my preparation. Why $2.50 a day? It seemed like a fairly challenging target; enough so that I'd have to think harder and perhaps learn more. When I started this challenge for the first time in 2014, a friend of mine noted that in nursing school, they were challenged to eat on $5/day. (And record their nutrition and caloric intake.) I estimated some of my meal costs, and decided that $2.50/day would be challenging, but safe and still fun. Play Along I encourage you to try challenging yourself to make meals for whatever price you care to choose, for whatever duration you choose, whether it's for 45 days, or once a week, or whatever. Please let me know what you do, either by email at eliasen@mindspring.com or on Twitter at @aeliasen. I'll share good recipes and recommendations on here. Also, share food with others and donate to your local food banks! Rules and Guidelines I've set some rules and guidelines for myself to follow: Have Fun! This is a fun experiment. I get to make yummy food that I'm proud of and that I'm happy to eat! If I'm not having fun and eating great food, I'm doing it wrong. $2.50 a day. I could do this a lot of different ways, such as averaging food costs over 45 days. However, I think that setting an approximate limit of $2.50 each and every day is a stricter constraint. (As an engineer, I find strict constraints freeing. It reduces the number of possibilities you have to consider.) I feel I'll have to think a bit more and learn more with the stronger constraint. If I have money left over after a day, I'm generally not going to let that \"roll over\" to the next day. This doesn't mean that I can't make a big batch of something that costs $10 to make, and then eat it for 4 days! Be Safe! Maintain and track nutrition, get enough calories, and don't eat rotten food. (I would say \"I'm not going to dumpster dive\" but after watching the fascinating Documentary Dive!, I think that's a valid approach!) Share Food! I'm going to share the food I make with others. That's part of the fun. So I'm going to report my costs as single-person costs here. That said, I'm not going to \"cheat\" by buying bulk ingredients in huge quantities that I can't properly preserve and use. When I find good deals, I'm going to buy more for food banks, too. Share Recipes and Techniques! That's the point of this blog. I hope if you have good recipes and ideas, you'll share them with me. Track and Minimize Waste. Food that I don't use needs to be factored into my costs. Plan meals to prevent spoilage. Learn to preserve. Gifts are Free! If someone gives me food (like the awesome canned fruits my Aunt gives out for Christmas,) I consider it free. If you have excesses of food, give them to your friends and neighbors. Don't make myself tired of my favorite foods. I don't have a membership to a Costco or other membership warehouse, and I'm not planning to get one for this experiment. I used to have one, but with 1 or 2 people, there was hardly anything in quantities that I could use in time. (Especially when sharing a freezer between 4 guys in college.) I'm going to buy what I can conveniently buy and store, (and not eat tater tots for a solid month straight like I did in college. I loved tater tots before that and couldn't stand them for years afterwards.) Be realistic. I'm not going to drive across town because they have a slightly cheaper deal on chicken wings. I'm not going to spend all day clipping coupons. I'm going to shop pretty much like I always have. I will look into ways of getting food cheaper, though. Be efficient. Especially with my time. Making big batches and eating the same thing for several meals is one of the secrets of efficiency. Spending part of a day making freezable food that will feed you for weeks is incredibly efficient. Keep on Sciencing! Yes, I've built my own sous vide cooking apparatus. I made molecular gastronomy kits for my relatives for Christmas. I buy sciencey cooking books. I will not apologize for busting out the science or a cool apparatus. Don't burden others. If I want to go with friends to dinner, I will! I will order whatever I'd normally order. I won't make my friends worry about my experiment, and I certainly don't want people not to invite me. I won't be a food snob or a martyr. This is a fun experiment. Demonstrate Calculating Costs and Nutrition. I've developed an awesome calculating tool and programming language called Frink that helps make calculations with units of measure easy. Interspersed with this document will be calculations that demonstrate how easy Frink makes it to calculate things! Exceeding my budget is not failure. As an engineer, I know that everything you try isn't a success the first time. Every day, I'll try to analyze and point out how I could have done better, and can do better the next time. In science, a negative result is every bit as important as a positive result. To quote Thomas Edison, when asked why thousands of his experiments on batteries didn't produce a working result: \"Results! Why, man, I have gotten a lot of results! I know several thousand things that won’t work!\" --Edison: His Life and Inventions, 1910. Day 1 - Tomato Soup and Two Toasted Cheese Sandwiches The first day, not coincidentally, coincided with Ash Wednesday, the first day of Lent. Since that's typically a date of fasting, I'm having a single meal. But one of my favorites—good old Campbell's tomato soup and a couple of toasted cheese sandwiches! And they were proper toasted cheese sandwiches. Butter the bread on the outsides, fill them with good cheese, and cook them in an electric frying pan at 350 °F for a couple minutes on each side. I forgot to take pictures, but you know what a toasted-cheese sandwich and tomato soup looks like. Measuring Ingredients I'm not always going to remember to measure and weigh my ingredients, but I did today, so I'll describe the process briefly. A digital kitchen scale is very very useful for many types of cooking. I like my tomato soup made with milk, so I added 1 can of milk. Now, a digression: Ounces vs. Fluid Ounces A quick digression: Ounces (and pounds and kilograms) are a unit of mass. \"Fluid ounces\" (also written fl.oz.) are a unit of volume. Don't confuse them. The labels on liquids and semi-liquids (like mayonnaise) is usually indicated in fluid ounces (volume.) The labels on solids and canned goods is usually labeled in ounces (mass.) (By the way, if you think that a pound or an ounce is a unit of weight, and not mass, that's a common (but potentially dangerous) misconception. Read the full discussion of this in this Frink FAQ entry.) Okay, back to the topic. I buy my milk by the gallon (volume) but the can of soup is marked by the mass it contains. I wanted to measure the volume of the can. The easiest way to do that, using just a scale, is to weigh the can filled with water, and then weigh the can empty and subtract the weights. This gives you the weight of water that filled the can. Fortunately, our units of mass and volume are calibrated around water. The following are all basically equivalent statements: 1 gram of water fills 1 milliliter. 1 gram of water fills 1 cubic centimeter, or 1 cc, or 1 cm3. (That is, a cube 1 centimeter on a side. Note that this is the same as a milliliter.) 1 kilogram of water fills one liter. 1 kilogram of water fills a cube 10 cm on a side (this is the same as a liter.) 1 ounce of water fills 1 fluid ounce. 1 pound of water fills one (U.S.) pint. (a pint is 16 fluid ounces.) The density of water is 1 kilogram / liter. The density of water is 1 gram / cm3. The density of water is 1 ounce / floz. These rules make it easy. The can, filled with water, was 10.7 ounces heavier than the empty can, so it contained 10.7 fluid ounces of water. Since a gallon of milk cost $2.99, the total milk cost was $0.25. I used up the last of a bit of fancy yummy shredded Tillamook Italian 3-cheese (mozzarella, smoked Provolone and Parmesan!) that I still had open, so the cheese price was higher than some cheaper cheese that I bought later. (Again, no waste!) We'll call it $6 / lb. But how do you weigh shredded cheese? You can't weigh the cheese first and then put it on the sandwich, because how will you know how much you're going to need? I weighed the cheese by weighing the plate + bread before and after putting cheese on the bread and subtracting the difference. It turned out to be 58 g of cheese (total) for 2 sandwiches. I even measured the butter on the bread! I didn't remember until buttering the last sandwich, and I didn't want to get butter all over my scale, so I weighed the butter dish + butter before and after buttering the last sandwich. There was 16 g of butter for one sandwich (2 pieces of bread), so a whopping 32 grams for 2 sandwiches. That amount surprised me. When butter is $3.69 / lb, that comes to $0.26 of butter. Surprising. Hidden costs like this can add up! I have to be careful not to miss them! Thoughts A big part of eating inexpensively is watching for stuff to go on sale. Results that I can obtain today, I may not be able to obtain tomorrow! Dollar Tree sells 41% larger cans of Campbell's tomato soup (15.2 oz vs. 10.75 oz) for $1.00. (Safeway's advertised \"everyday price\" is $0.91, making Dollar Tree's offering 1.29 times as efficient.) Look into house brands or giant cans of soup? I can make huge batches of amazing soup much cheaper. Stay tuned! I'm using up existing food in my fridge for the first few days. My costs should decrease as I start planning and buying better. A good part of this exercise will be to develop and memorize \"rules of thumb\" to estimate how much a portion of food costs. Rule of thumb: A cup of milk costs about $0.20. Rule of thumb: A stick of butter can cost around $1.00. Rule of thumb: A tablespoon of butter costs about $0.12 (there are 8 tablespoons in a stick of butter.) Where is the \"cent\" sign on my keyboard? My TRS-80 used to have one! Day 1 Costs Item Cost 1 Bowl Tomato Soup 1/2 can Campbell's Tomato Soup $0.46 Milk, half of 10.7 floz $0.13 Soup subtotal $0.59 2 Toasted Cheese Sandwiches 4 slices white bread $0.20 Tillamook Italian 3-Cheese, 58 g $0.77 Butter, 32 g $0.26 Sandwiches subtotal $1.23 Homemade Kimchi (73 g) $0.14 Daily Total $1.96 Note: The half can of milk and half can of soup was because I wasn't eating alone! Again, the costs that I'm going to list here are for the portions that I personally eat, even if I share the meal with others. I also probably paid less for the tomato soup, but I don't have that old receipt. I mentioned homemade kimchi here, but I'll describe that another day when I have less to write about! Frink Calculations I mentioned before that I've created a calculating tool / programming language called Frink which is great for helping with physical calculations. I'm including some sample calculations so you can see how easy Frink makes calculating costs. The above calculations were: milkcost = 2.99 dollars / gallon 10.7 floz milkcost 0.2499453125 dollar (currency) cheesecost = 6 dollars/lb 58 g cheesecost 34800000/45359237 (approx. 0.76720867240337398) dollar (currency) buttercost = 3.69 dollars/lb 2 * (272 - 256) g buttercost // Multiply by 2 sandwiches 0.26032183918790344732 dollar (currency) An important thing to note is that you specify the units of measure in each Frink calculation, and Frink automatically does the right thing with them. It contains a large data file of physical quantities, freeing you from having to look them up, and freeing you to make effortless calculations without getting bogged down in the mechanics. Note that in the above calculations, Frink already knows about units of measure such as dollars, gallons, pounds, grams, and allows you to transparently mix those units of measure in calculations. For example, in the cheese calculations, the cost was specified in dollars per pound, while the cheese was weighed and had its mass specified in grams. Nevertheless, you can transparently multiply these and Frink helps ensure the results come out right. Frink runs on your computer (Windows, Mac, Linux) or on your Android device with the app Frink Programming Language. You can use Frink in a web-based interface. Give it a try! It'll make you look smarter. Day 2 - Cabbage Burgers: My Secret Weapon I actually started preparing for this experiment a few days in advance, and readied my secret weapon: Cabbage Burgers! These are also variously known as \"Krautburgers\" (although that gives the incorrect impression that there's sauerkraut inside; it's just cooked unfermented cabbage,) or known as \"Cabbage Rolls\" or \"Runza\" or \"The Best Food You Can Prepare in Advance and Freeze.\" They're a bun filled with cabbage, onions, and ground beef. They're delicious, nutritious, filling, inexpensive, and they freeze and microwave incredibly well, so you can make a giant batch and have cheap food ready in minutes! The previous weekend, I made a gigantic batch of these little delights, using 4 pounds of ground chuck, 2 heads of cabbage, 5 onions, 13 cups of flour, 13 egg yolks (which left me 13+ egg whites for breakfast for 4 days) and a few other ingredients. It was a huge undertaking, but it produced 61 delicious krautburgers that went into the freezer and should provide about 30 meals! Each krautburger cost, by my estimate, about $0.41, $0.47 (see cabbage roll cost update), and two of them make a good meal for only about $0.82 $0.94! I've learned that making a huge batch will last for weeks or months, and is as easy as making a smaller batch. Because I'm going to be eating Krautburgers many times over the next 45 days, I'll publish the recipe and the cost breakdown later. Update: the recipe was published on day 13 and the cost breakdown on day 16. To combine my \"Reduce Waste\" and \"Gifts are Free\" rules, I ate half of the orange that I got in my Christmas stocking (I've never cared that much for most fruit, and I might have let it go to waste if not for this experiment,) and 6 cherries that my aunt canned this year and gave as Christmas presents. These were delicious! I also ate 1/8 of the pound of asparagus I bought for $0.99 / pound. (Put in microwave-safe ventable casserole dish, add 1/4 inch water, put the lid on, open the vent, and microwave for 7 minutes.) Later, I had a bowl of vanilla pudding that I made a few days earlier. A good day of eating, and quite cheap! Personal Notes I have to admit that I went to bed the previous night feeling rather hungry. I expected this. The more I eat, the more I need to eat to feel satisfied. The less I eat, the less I need to eat to feel satisfied. My super-scientific hypothesis is that my stomach \"shrinks\" a bit when I don't eat. Since I had a semi-fasting day yesterday, I felt hungry. And I found it hard to sleep. Hope I adjust. It's weird, but if I go to sleep hungry, I usually wake up not feeling hungry. It was hard not to snack before bed, but I managed to pull through. About my usual eating schedule: I very rarely eat breakfast. Never have, at least since college. I'm usually not hungry in the morning, I'm always grumpy in the morning, (okay, I'm grumpy all day, always) and I'd always, always choose sleeping 5 more minutes over spending time eating! I'm usually fine with eating just one meal a day in the evening, and maybe a snack later. Everybody's schedule and needs are going to be different. Thoughts A very inexpensive day! $1.48, far below my target! Planning ahead by making a large batch of great krautburgers definitely pays off. I didn't feel hungry when going to bed, and I could have eaten twice as many krautburgers and still made my target! Krautburgers combine two of the great inexpensive \"fillers\": flour and cabbage. (Another is potatoes.) There's not a lot of calories in cabbage, but it's delicious and filling, and figures in a lot of low-cost recipes. In old prison films, prisoners only get \"bread and water\" or maybe \"bread and cheese.\" Should I try this one day? Can I make bread cheaper than I can buy it? I'm glad I'm not addicted to coffee or caffeine any more. I never drank coffee but I used to drink at least 4 caffeinated soft drinks a day. A roommate of mine was once quite surprised that a majority of his daily costs went to coffee. If you shop carefully, you can get a can of soda for $0.33 or so, or it can be much more if you buy it from a vending machine! It's not a stated goal of this experiment, but I have a few extra pounds of fat around my gut that I don't mind losing. I'm down about 2 pounds already, which isn't unwelcome. Should I graph my weight? I'm probably not at the calorie total I need to be sustaining long-term. Day 2 Costs Item Cost Krautburgers 2 Krautburgers (total 10.1 oz) (revised) $0.94 Asparagus 1/8 pound asparagus @ $0.99/lb $0.13 Vanilla Pudding 1/6 box instant pudding, Kroger house brand $0.16 1/2 cup milk $0.10 Pudding subtotal $0.26 Homemade Kimchi (76 g) $0.15 Daily Total $1.48 Day 3 - Egg Salad and Surprise Salmon Egg Salad Sandwiches Egg salad sandwiches are one of my favorite sandwiches ever—they're rich and luxurious and filling. I always considered them to be rather expensive and difficult, but they're quite the opposite. They're especially cheap if you have cheap eggs (Albertson's had a dozen eggs for $0.99, which is considerably cheaper than the average $2.19/dozen.) And if you have eggs that are already hard-boiled, as I did, it's even easier. (I didn't actually boil the eggs, though. I steamed them in my Breakfast Machine, which I love. It's a toaster that can also cook 1 to 4 eggs, either poached/steamed, soft-boiled, or hard-boiled. (There's also a 4-slice, 8 egg model.) Fill it with the appropriate amount of water (it comes with a cup marked with the right amounts of water for hard, medium, soft, and poached eggs,) and push the button, and you have perfectly-cooked eggs. This is good because I've never been good at getting eggs cooked just right; I live at more than a mile above sea level, and water boils at the lower temperature of 204°F (95°C), so none of the \"never fail\" egg-boiling recipes you hear ever work right for me. A \"3-minute egg\" is still basically uncooked.) I made egg salad by mashing 3 hard-boiled eggs with 80 grams of mayonnaise, a tiny squirt of mustard, and some salt and pepper. That's it! I should note most strongly that if you put anything else (like celery) into your egg salad, you are a terrible monster. Also, egg salad is best on plain old soft cheap white bread. (There's also nothing more elegant and delicate for your afternoon tea than an egg salad sandwich with the crusts cut off!) Each sandwich only used about 3/4 of an egg, (about $.06 at my good egg prices,) $0.08 of mayonnaise, and $0.10 of plain old white bread, for a total of $0.24 per sandwich. I had one and a half sandwiches, a few chips that I still had open (I weighed them to see how much they would cost) and felt like a king. (By the way, I saw an egg salad sandwich at the grocery store for $4!) Surprise Salmon Today, I went shopping at Albertson's, with a carefully-selected shopping list based on their weekly advertisement. Since it's a Friday during Lent, I planned on making a fish dish. (I've never understood how eating fish was in any way a sacrifice, though.) I had an interesting recipe for fish chowder (which I've never made before,) which sounded filling (it had potatoes and milk). Albertson's advertised frozen tilapia, swai, and pollock on sale for $2.99/lb. These fish can be somewhat bland, but that's a pretty good price for fish. This was my plan. However, when I looked at the frozen fish, I saw that they had whole frozen pink salmon for $1.99/lb! Salmon is one of my very favorite fish, and that is a fantastic price for salmon, which is usually 7 to 10 dollars per pound, so I made the decision on the spot to buy a whole salmon and eat plain salmon instead! (They had the same deal on whole salmon a year ago, and I didn't buy one, and I was sad for the whole year!) 2.25 pounds of salmon for only $4.48! It was kind of scary, because the fish I picked was rather large (2.25 pounds) and frozen solid. I hoped I'd be able to cut it and save portions for later. Luckily, a rough serrated knife sawed through the completely-frozen fish quite easily, allowing me to separate it into portions for freezing: I'm not good at butchering whole fish, but a long, thin, flexible knife let me remove the backbone and fins without much problem. I prepared a couple of baked potatoes by first microwaving them (using the \"potato\" button) and then brushing them with a bit of olive oil and kosher salt and finishing them in a 400°F oven (for crispiness.) While the potatoes were cooking, I brined and thawed the salmon in cold water for 30 minutes with some sugar and salt. You know sometimes when you cook salmon and the yellow, buttery-looking albumin comes out in blobs on the surface of the fish? It doesn't look great, but brining prevents the albumin from leaking out and adds flavor to the fish. This is extremely important when smoking salmon, too! Since the oven was not at the right temperature for cooking salmon (I either bake it low and slow or under a hot broiler,) I decided to pan-fry the salmon using a technique that I learned from Eric Ripert that gives you super-crispy, yummy skin. You dry the skin very well, and sprinkle the skin with a bit of salt, pepper and a fine dusting of Wondra flour. Then pan-fry, skin down, with a little bit of oil and butter, pressing the fish down, cooking for 80% of the time on the skin side, and turning over briefly to finish. As you can hopefully see, the salmon skin was gorgeous and crisp. I had salmon, 2 baked potatoes (with butter and sour cream, not pictured,) asparagus, and a slice of lemon. The 6.25 ounce portion of salmon itself only cost $0.77! Amazing! Oh, and that's free dill from my aunt's garden on top of the salmon! Note the additional costs below. Thoughts I checked the weekly supermarket advertisements very carefully for sales before shopping, and planned several meals to avoid waste. The moral of this story is: read the ads, and plan your meals around deep discounts. The moral of this story is: don't be afraid to adjust your plan based on what you see at the store. Much of the hidden costs of cooking salmon and baked potatoes is in the olive oil and butter, as I was too lazy to walk 30 feet to grab some plain vegetable oil for cooking. I'll do better next time. The butter and sour cream on the baked potatoes are more expensive than the potatoes! I cut back a bit on them, but could cut back more and still be happy. Are there other things that are good on baked potatoes? The cost for potatoes calculated above is for the potatoes I had left over in the pantry. I bought potatoes much cheaper ($3 / (10 lb)) today, so I will do even better in the future on potatoes. I thought potato chips would be too cost-prohibitive, but a small amount of house-brand chips doesn't cost a lot. I like my salt! Whenever you're cooking baked potatoes, cook a few extra and refrigerate them. This lets you make fried potatoes the next day. Fried potatoes are much quicker and better when the potato is already mostly cooked! If they're not cooked already, it's hard to get the inside of the potato cooked without overcooking the outsides. I have to say that Albertson's advertisements had at least ten times as many great deals than the other stores, which made me decide to go there. There were far, far more deep deals. The other grocery stores (King Sooper's and Safeway) didn't even begin to compete on advertised bargains. You'll be impressed with some of the deals I got in the next days or weeks! Almost every single thing on my receipt was on deep discount. The only things not on sale were milk and butter. Margarine is 1/4 the price of butter, but I'm sticking with butter. (Partially to avoid trans-fats.) A bit of vegetable oil for cooking is even more cost-effective. Answering my questions from the other day, big \"family-sized\" cans of tomato soup are actually more expensive per ounce than small cans! I had bought 2 dozen eggs a week ago for the amazing price of $0.99/dozen, (they're normally $2.19/dozen) and I was sad that they were running out. However, I was surprised to see eggs at Albertson's today for the incredible price of $0.50/dozen! Yes! I bought 2 dozen. That's barely more than $0.04 an egg! Eggs are amazing. If someone asked you, as an engineer, how much you would charge to create an egg in a laboratory, how much would it cost? When buying whole fish, you have to assume some waste from bones and fins and such. There wasn't too much waste at all, but you have to factor this into your costs. I still feel a little bad that I didn't try making fish stock from the bones and tail. I will next time. (Saving stock is great for other recipes or the best ramen ever.) I didn't eat the salmon tail. I've hosted cajun food parties almost every year for the past 20 years. The first year, I asked the butcher to save me salmon tails, which I heard were good breaded and deep-fried. They ended up just being all bones and basically inedible. Day 3 Costs Item Cost Egg Salad Sandwich (prices are for 1 sandwich) 3/4 Egg $0.06 Mayonnaise $0.08 2 slices white bread $0.10 1 sandwich subtotal $0.24 1.5 sandwich subtotal: $0.36 Chips Fritos $0.08 1/2 oz potato chips $0.09 Chips subtotal: $0.17 Salmon 6.25 oz salmon at $1.99/lb $0.77 Olive oil for cooking $0.20 1/8 large lemon $0.11 Salmon subtotal: $1.08 Asparagus 1/8 pound asparagus @ $0.99/lb $0.13 2 Baked Potatoes 2 potatoes, approx 12 oz total $0.30 Butter, 3 Tbsp $0.24 Sour cream, 2 oz at $1.69/(16 oz) $0.21 Baked potato subtotal $0.75 Daily Total $2.49 The total of $2.49 is very close to my target! I would have never thought I could have salmon on this budget, but it worked out wonderfully, and I have several more portions of salmon in the freezer! Day 4 - Pork Soft Tacos How is it possible that one of the most delicious cuts of meat you can buy is also one of the most inexpensive? Nothing is more luxurious than a falling-apart-tender pork shoulder with its delicious mix of meat, fat, and gelatin. The only trick is to cook it correctly, and that's not even a trick. Pork shoulder requires low and slow heat for a long time to become tender. This is where your slow cooker (also known as a crock pot) comes in. A slow cooker is almost fool-proof. In the morning, you can drop in your roast with some onions, seasonings, and liquid, set it to low, and come back 9 hours later for meat that's as tender as any you've ever tasted. I rub you, my delicious pork shoulder. And that's what I did. In the morning, I took out the crock pot, set it to low, put in 3 chopped onions, took a pork shoulder and covered it with my homemade spice rub, and set it on top of the onions, and added hot water to cover. I then walked away. (Okay, I came back to add water as it warmed up. More about that tomorrow when I discuss the science of meat temperatures.) Nine hours later, the house smelled amazing, the roast was tender, and the crock pot was filled to the top with rich, delicious broth. Let me make a very, very important point: Save that broth! I will repeat that: Save that broth! I had 4 quarts of dark, delicious, flavorful pork broth into which the fat, gelatin, meat juices, onions, and spices had mingled. You can freeze this broth and make the most amazing ramen you've ever tasted. Which I'm going to do soon. The pork shoulder was 3.41 lb at $1.99/lb, and it will make several meals of pork tacos. Shredding the pork for tacos is easy. Put some of it in a bowl, and take two forks and shred it. It just pulls apart. The tacos had shredded cheese (which I got for the very good price of $2.88/lb,) soft flour tortillas, and shredded cabbage. It's a bit difficult to estimate the cost of the pork that went into each taco until all the pork is gone (which will take several days.) Much of the original pork's mass went into the broth in the form of melted fat, gelatin, and meat juices, so weighing the final pork isn't enough to get a cost estimate. I weighed all the other ingredients, though, and estimated a final cost of about $0.51 per big yummy taco. I ate 4 tacos, so the estimated total for dinner was $2.04, for a very satisfying and balanced meal. The tacos have all your major food groups: grains, dairy, meat, and vegetables. Nothing more is required! For lunch, I had one and a half egg salad sandwiches and some kimchi, like yesterday. Thoughts Next time, make sure to warm up the tortillas, cheese, and cabbage before putting the pork in the taco. It'll all come out warmer and nicer. Save a little of the pork broth to reheat tomorrow's pork shoulder in, just as gently as your crock pot cooked it. Don't boil or microwave it! The pork and broth comes out of the crock pot quite hot. Before I put it in the refrigerator or freezer, I put it into a container (a ziploc bag for the pork roast and tubs for the broth) and cool them in a cold water bath in the sink. (Add ice to make it even faster.) This reduces the time that the food spends in the so-called \"danger zone\" between 40°F and 140°F where bacteria can grow. (I'll write more about food safety one of these days.) Plan your pork and broth usage so that you're done eating it within 3-4 days, unless you freeze it. The cabbage was quite hard. I'm thinking of salting a bit of the cabbage before adding it to the tacos tomorrow. This rapidly softens the cabbage, (and makes it delicious!) as I'll describe when I describe how to make kimchi! Some fancy pork tacos these days are made with kimchi instead of raw cabbage. Try that? Day 4 Costs Item Cost Egg Salad Sandwich (prices are for 1 sandwich) 3/4 Egg $0.06 Mayonnaise $0.08 2 slices white bread $0.10 1 sandwich subtotal $0.24 1.5 sandwich subtotal: $0.36 Homemade Kimchi (76 g) $0.15 Pork tacos (prices are for 1 taco) 0.5 oz cheese at $2.88/lb $0.09 1 6\" flour tortilla $0.08 Cabbage $0.02 Shredded pork (revised) $0.24 Onion $0.04 1 taco subtotal: $0.47 4 taco subtotal: $1.88 Daily Total $2.39 Wow! Very close to my goal, but 5 cents over. Update: The price of pork was recalculated after the pork was done, bringing me back under budget. Some of the costs that I've charged to this meal are actually in the 4 quarts of broth that are going to be used in future meals. Saving the broth effectively makes these future meals cheaper or free! I'm not going to try to do \"creative bookkeeping\" here, but track my costs honestly and conservatively. I consider today a success. Day 5 - Meat Science (and French Toast) Breakfast/lunch was french toast and fried potatoes. As I mentioned on day 3, whenever you're baking potatoes, make another one or two for fried potatoes the next day. Fried potatoes are much quicker and better when the potato is already mostly cooked! If they're not cooked already, it's hard to get the inside of the potato cooked without overcooking the outsides. The fried potatoes cost $0.12 for about 4 ounces of potatoes. French toast is easy, and contains two inexpensive ingredients: eggs and bread. (And a little milk and sugar.) It turns out that each slice of toast uses 1/2 of an egg, so the total cost per slice was $0.10. I had two slices. Breakfast/lunch cost $0.32. Dinner was exactly like day 4—more delicious pork tacos! I believe that I greatly overestimated the amount of pork that I used on day 4, so I may go back and revise the cost of these meals after all the pork is gone, and I can divide the cost of the pork by how many tacos it made. Since I wrote about the pork tacos on day 4, as promised, I'm going to drop some meat science on you! Meat Science! A pork shoulder, uncooked, is a rather unruly chunk of meat. It's a mix of intermingled muscle and fat. As you may know, whenever muscle connects to fat, or muscle connects to bone, there's some connective tissue (commonly known as gristle when not cooked correctly) which is unchewable and not good eats. However, when a pork shoulder is slow-cooked for 9 or more hours at low temperature, you can eat every single bit of the shoulder, and it's smooth and delicious! The connective tissue is no longer a problem. What happened to it? The connective tissue is made mostly of collagen, a tough protein. You can think of collagen as a three-stranded rope, which it strongly resembles. It's a helix of three strands wound around each other. When you cook collagen above about 145°F (63 °C), the three strands begin to unwind from each other. Each strand is gelatin. Gelatin is an interesting protein that can hold up to 10 times its mass in water. However, there's not much water originally in this gelatin strand. With enough time and moisture, these gelatin strands will absorb water from the surrounding cooking liquid and muscle fibers (which squeeze out their own moisture as they heat up.) This makes a rich gel that keeps the meat moist and delicious. Breaking down collagen into gelatin and making the gelatin absorb water is a process that takes both heat and time. Collagen breaks down into gelatin and absorbs water well at temperatures around 174°F (79°C), which is the temperature that a good slow cooker on low setting should hold. Collagen will break down and absorb water at even lower temperatures, but it takes significantly more time. (My slow cooker gets significantly hotter than this, eventually boiling (at the altitude I live, that's 204°F (95°C)) at the edges even on the low setting, so I like to start cooking with just enough water to cover the roast, and add more water as it gets too hot (as measured by a probe thermometer) eventually filling it to the top so I have lots of good broth. Starting with a small amount of water is smart because a crock pot heats quite slowly. (My simple crock pot heats at only 215 watts on low and 335 watts on high.) Before your crock pot reaches 140°F (60°C), you are in the so-called \"danger zone\" where bacteria can grow. You thus want to start with hot water to minimize time in the danger zone.) Note: Collagen also holds muscle fiber to muscle fiber, which is why you can shred individual fibers of the pork shoulder apart with a fork after breaking down the collagen with long, slow cooking. This further tenderizes the meat, and holds moisture in the gelatin between muscle fibers. So Why Don't We Cook All Meat This Way? Cooking a pork shoulder at 174°F to 190°F for 9 or more hours makes it moist and luxurious. This is a cut of meat with lots of collagen, which turns to gelatin, which holds liquids in the meat and keeps it moist and tender. However, if we tried to cook a lean piece of meat (without much connective tissue) this way, we would absolutely murder it and turn it into a dry, tight brick. As meat gets much warmer than about 140°F (60°C), the muscle fibers and connective tissue contract and squeeze moisture out, making the meat very dry. A piece of lean meat cooked at these temperatures for this amount of time would be tough and dry, especially because there's no gelatin to hold 10 times its mass in moisture in the meat. (For comparison, beef is a nice medium-rare at 131°F (55°C) and lean pork is \"done\" and no longer pink at 145°F (62.7°C).) \"Stew meat\" that cooks a long time in stews or chilis is usually something like pork shoulder or beef brisket with lots of collagen. You won't improve your stew by putting in filet mignon or ribeye steak. But pork shoulder or beef brisket are actually made better by long, slow, moist cooking at temperatures that would tie leaner meats into tough knots. I'll write more later about the two major proteins in meat, and why breaking one down protein (myosin) is good, and breaking the other protein (actin) down is bad, and how you can have the best of both worlds with the right cooking technique. (Hint: it's called \"sous vide\".) Thoughts I'll write more later about how surprisingly much energy it takes to heat water, which is one of the hardest substances in the universe to heat. I actually ate the French toast without butter nor syrup to save a few cents. The secret to keeping it moist may be to undercook the eggs slightly, which is what happened. I ate the potatoes without Sriracha sauce nor Mae Ploy sweet chili sauce, which I usually like on anything. I'll have to calculate what a small amount of these costs. These are two sauces that are usually surprisingly inexpensive at Asian markets. Another reason that Sriracha is surprisingly inexpensive is that the founder, David Tran, is unbelievably awesome and just cares about making great hot sauce. Read that article and you'll be a fan too. Note to self: Next time I'm at Taco Bell, \"liberate\" some free sauces. I actually had a ton of sauce packets that I recently threw away because some had been creased and started to leak. Day 5 Costs Item Cost French Toast (per slice) White bread, 1 slice $0.05 1/2 egg $0.04 1 tablespoon milk $0.01 1 slice subtotal $0.10 2 slice subtotal: $0.20 Fried Potatoes Potatoes, ~4 oz $0.10 Vegetable oil $0.02 Potatoes subtotal $0.12 Pork tacos (prices are for 1 taco) 0.5 oz cheese at $2.88/lb $0.09 1 6\" flour tortilla $0.08 Cabbage $0.02 Shredded pork (revised) $0.24 Onion $0.04 1 taco subtotal: $0.47 4 taco subtotal: $1.88 Daily Total $2.20 Again, I won't know the pork cost per taco until all the pork is gone, so I may revise these figures. The pork cost for day 4 was almost certainly overestimated, and I'm easily back within my budget today. Update: The price of pork was recalculated after the pork was done. Day 6 - The Best Damn Ramen that You've Ever Seen After shoveling heavy snow and breaking ice for almost two hours at very cold temperatures, I had 3-inch-long icicles of sweat hanging from my hair, and I was ready for a shower and a huge hot bowl of ramen noodles! Luckily, as you may remember from day 4 when I made Pork Tacos, I saved the delicious broth from the slow cooker, which is the secret for the best ramen you'll ever have: That broth paid off. It's rich and thick and delicious. So rich, in fact, that I diluted it to half-strength. The 4 quarts of broth that I saved will go quite a long way. The other secret ingredient for making ordinary ramen extraordinary is your refrigerator's friend, Bok Choy! I hadn't used Bok Choy much in the past, but it's an incredibly tolerant and long-lasting vegetable. It will stay fresh in your refrigerator for far longer than you'd ever expect. Just buy a big head for about $1.00/lb and break off what you need. (Baby bok choy is beautiful and cute, but it costs about 5 times as much in my local supermarket. You may be able to buy it cheaper in Asian supermarkets, which may have 10 different types of little bok choys, sometimes in huge bags.) Long after cabbage and lettuce and other vegetables have wilted or molded in your fridge, the Bok Choy will still be good. Chop it into pieces, and boil it in your broth for about 7-10 minutes. It maintains a very nice crisp texture even if you under- or over-cook it, and it absorbs the flavor of the broth, making it quite delicious. 3.2 ounces of bok choy cost $0.20. After the bok choy cooked, I boiled a packet of cheap ($0.16) chili-flavored ramen in the broth for the usual couple minutes. I then put it in a giant bowl (29 fluid ounces!) and, for an extra bit of flavor and protein and richness, I cracked a raw egg ($0.08) into it, which cooked in the hot liquid. That was unbelievably delicious and rich. Look at that broth! That's nothing like your usual ramen-seasoning-packet broth, and there was more than twice as much of it! There was even broth left over after re-filling my bowl partway. More than two pounds of hot, delicious ramen soup in my belly made me feel a lot warmer. While I ate my ramen, I watched a Simply Ming episode in which chef Ming Tsai makes elaborate, super-expensive ramen with a new Japanese Iron Chef. They used A-5 grade Kobe beef, smoked maitake mushrooms, dried scallops, mussels, and many more super-expensive ingredients. I'll bet I was every bit as satisfied with my delicious bowl of ramen that cost about $0.54. (For this price I could only buy about 1.5 grams of A-5 kobe beef. For comparison, a U.S. dollar bill has a mass of about 1 gram.) By the way, I forgot to account for the cost of the spice rub that I put on the pork shoulder in day 4, which made the broth so delicious, so I'll account for it below. Making Spice Rub and Buying Spices Tiny little jars of commercial spice rub for cooking meat are incredibly expensive (maybe $4 for a 1.75-oz jar) and meat takes a lot of rub! I make my own spice rub with some inexpensive ingredients I have in my cupboard. I usually make a fairly large batch and have some left over, because it's good to sprinkle on anything from meat to fried or baked potatoes to vegetables. The proportions for my spice rub are somewhat like: Spice Rub (very) approximate recipe 3/4 cup brown sugar 1/4 cup chicken bouillon powder 1 tablespooon garlic powder 1/2 tablespoon cumin 1/2 tablespoon black pepper Every other spice you like including: Cayenne pepper Paprika Chili Powder Onion Powder Brown sugar is relatively cheap. A good rule of thumb is that it's $1.00/lb, or about twice as expensive as white sugar. A cup of brown sugar costs $0.50. I'm going to wildly overestimate the total cost of the big batch of rub that I made as $1.50, about half of which went into the broth (and I have half left over.) Since there's enough broth for about 8 huge bowls of ramen, I'll call it $0.10 in spices per bowl. Dinner was pork tacos again. I definitely have overestimated how much the pork cost, so I'll revise the above calculations when I'm done. There's still enough for a few more pork tacos. Buying Spices By the way, a good way to buy spices more inexpensively is to go to what Walmart calls the \"Hispanic Foods\" aisle. This is especially true for bouillon powder. Walmart sells a giant jug that they call \"Knorr Hispanic Chicken Granulated Bouillon, 35.3 oz\" for $4.98. This is a fraction of the cost of bouillon in the spice aisle. I use this in a lot of recipes, and it lasts me many months. The \"Hispanic Foods\" aisle of your grocery store may also contain other spices much cheaper. I usually get cumin, chili powders, and other spices in this aisle, usually under the \"Órale!\" brand. These spices come in bags instead of jars, and cost about 1/3 what they do a couple aisles away. Another great place to buy inexpensive spices in bulk is Indian markets. These often have bags of spices like cardamom, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, mustard seeds, sesame seeds, and a wide variety of chili powders for drastically lower prices than you can find them elsewhere. Thoughts Since the cabbage for the pork tacos has been somewhat hard, I salted some cabbage and let it stand in the fridge for several hours. This softened the cabbage (and made it tastier.) Rule of thumb: 1 pound of brown sugar costs $1.00 Rule of thumb: 1 pound of white sugar costs $0.50 Rule of thumb: 1 cup of brown sugar costs $0.50 Rule of thumb: 1 cup of white sugar costs $0.25 Rule of thumb: 1 tablespoon of brown sugar costs $0.03 Rule of thumb: 1 tablespoon of white sugar costs $0.015 Learning these rules of thumb has been very helpful for me to estimate food costs in advance and avoid blowing out my budget. I can already estimate the cost of a meal more accurately and quickly in my head. Day 6 Costs Item Cost The World's Best Ramen Broth, spices $0.10 Bok choy, 3.2 oz $0.20 1 egg $0.08 Ramen (1 pkg) $0.16 Ramen subtotal: $0.54 Pork tacos (prices are for 1 taco) 0.5 oz cheese at $2.88/lb $0.09 1 6\" flour tortilla $0.08 Cabbage $0.02 Shredded pork (revised) $0.24 Onion $0.04 1 taco subtotal: $0.47 4 taco subtotal: $1.88 Daily Total (revised) $2.42 A few cents over budget again, but I'll recalculate when all the pork is finished. Update: The price of pork was recalculated after the pork was done, bringing me just back under budget! Day 7 - Colcannon and Pork Pancakes Breakfast was a bowl of quick oatmeal. I can count on one hand the number of times I've eaten oatmeal in my life, but it was very good (once you add brown sugar.) Total cost: $0.16. Containers are starting to sprout strange new labels: That gigantic container cost less than a much smaller can of Quaker brand oats. ($2.99) For lunch, I had a hot dog on a bun. Unfortunately, the purchase of these hot dogs (Oscar Meyer Classic Bun-Length, my favorite) predated this experiment, so they weren't the most cost-effective. I have newer hot dogs that cost 1/3 the price. A hot dog was $0.32, and a bun was $0.16, for a total of $0.48 for a single hot dog. (I have cheaper hot dogs that I could eat on bread for a total $0.15, less than 1/3 the price.) However, my rules for this experiment are that anything I have to throw away, I have to charge myself for, so chow down, wide load. Colcannon It's sort of funny how upset I get when I see something in an advertisement that's much cheaper than I just paid for it. For example, last week I bought 10 pounds of potatoes for $2.99, which I thought was a pretty good deal. But yesterday I saw the same bag at the same store for $0.99! That made me sad. I started thinking, \"well, I could still eat 8.3 pounds of potatoes a day at the old price. Or 25 pounds a day at the new price.\" At this moment, I became enlightened. If I were ever hungry, I could eat a bunch of potatoes. The only thing I'd have to be wary of is spending too much money on stuff like butter, sour cream, or sauce (Mae Ploy sweet chili sauce is really good on boiled potatoes!) So how could I make a bunch of ready-to-eat, delicious long-lasting potatoes? The answer came from a recipe I've made for many a St. Patrick's Day party: Colcannon. Colcannon is an Irish dish (in Irish Gaelic, cál ceannann, meaning \"white-headed cabbage\",) made with mashed potatoes mixed with cabbage. Other variations use kale, leeks, onions, and scallions, in addition to possibly ham or bacon. Since a stick of butter costs around $1.00, I decided to try to use the cabbage to keep the mashed potatoes moist, and eliminate butter or cream entirely. I boiled/steamed some cabbage with water and salt, and saved the cabbage water. This got added to 3.5 pounds of mashed potatoes. The result was still far too dry, so I added 2 cups of milk (which was probably a bit too much.) This made 4.5 pounds of finished Colcannon, all for the price of $1.96! I'll have this ready to eat with any meal. Colcannon, or, Life Discovered on Jupiter's Moon Europa By the way, a big potato ricer makes making mashed potatoes immensely easier and more repeatable. A potato ricer is basically an extruder press that you put boiled potatoes in and squeeeeeeze them through little holes. (It's like a Fuzzy Pumper Barber Shop (which I always wanted as a kid) but instead of being for Play-Doh, it's for food!) No mashing! You don't even need to peel the potatoes! The potato skins stay in the ricer. And when you cut up the potatoes for boiling, you can cut them into very large, coarse pieces. All of these benefits make mashed potatoes in a ricer much simpler than the traditional method. Pork Pancakes The original plan was to finish up the pork tacos for dinner, but I happened to see an episode of Simply Ming in which chef Ming Tsai's dad used a bunch of leftover pork and onions and some simple dough to make crispy pancakes! So that became the new plan. The \"hot water dough\" was simple enough: Hot Water Dough 2 cups flour 3/4 cups hot tap water 3/4 teaspoon salt Mix the three together, knead them for about 6 minutes, and then let it rest, covered, for about an hour. There's no leavener, so they don't rise, so you could probably skip this step if you're in a rush. The dough cost $0.32. Pork Pancake Assembly Roll the dough out as thin as possible on a well-floured surface, spread a thin layer of vegetable oil over the whole surface, and then spread leftover cooked pork, cooked onions, and cooked cabbage over the whole surface. Roll tightly like a jelly roll into a long cylinder. Cut the cylinder into about 4-inch (10 cm) lengths, try to twist the ends shut (just try) and then twist and squish the cylinders from end to end into a thin, flat pancake: Fry them with a bit of oil in a hot skillet, about 375°F (190°C) for about 3 minutes on each side or until crisp and brown. These were quite good! I'd definitely make them again with leftovers. The breading is very inexpensive ($0.32 for the entire batch) and it stretches the remaining pork nicely. This was the first dinner that I've actually felt full after eating (along with 6 oz Colcannon.) Pork Revision As noted before in the last 3 days, it was difficult to estimate how much pork cost per serving until I was done with the pork. The pork shoulder, which cost $6.79, made 28 portions, which is 7 more portions than I originally estimated. Thus, I've revised the last few days' pork prices downward to $0.24 per portion, a reduction of $0.04 per portion. This actually means that the last few days were under budget as I'd hoped! Thoughts The pork shoulder went farther than I thought, so I was able to recalculate some earlier days' costs, which puts me back under budget for every day! W00t! I'm starting to think I should keep track of everything in my head as its cost per pound. If something costs much more than about $2.00/lb, it's hard to fill up on it. I need to add an example here of converting per-mass costs into per-volume costs (for example, how do you calculate how much a cup of flour costs when you bought it by the pound?) My language Frink helps here, because it knows the densities of a lot of common materials, for example: flourcost = 2.50 dollars/(5 lb) 1 cup flour_scooped flourcost 0.15625 dollar (currency) Note that Frink knows the average density of flour in many forms, including scooped or sifted. flour_scooped is the density of scooped flour. See what Frink knows about different forms of flour by entering ??flour in its interactive interface. (Or just click that link.) See what Frink knows about different forms of sugar by entering ??sugar in its interactive interface. (Or just click that link.) Day 7 Costs Item Cost Oatmeal Oatmeal, 1/3 cup (uncooked volume) $0.08 Milk, 1/4 cup $0.05 Brown sugar, 1 tablespoon $0.03 Oatmeal subtotal: $0.16 Hot Dog Hot dog (Oscar Meyer Classic Bun Length) $0.32 Hot dog bun $0.16 Hot dog subtotal: $0.48 Colcannon (price for 73 oz) Potatoes, 3.5 lb $1.05 Cabbage, 8.3 oz $0.51 Milk, 2 cups $0.40 Colcannon, 73 oz subtotal $1.96 Colcannon, 6 oz subtotal $0.16 Pork Pancakes (prices are for 1 pancake.) 2/7 cup flour $0.05 1/7 yellow onion $0.04 Cabbage $0.04 Oil $0.01 1 pancake subtotal: $0.38 3 pancake subtotal: $1.14 Daily Total $1.94 Day 8 - Braunschweiger and Book Recommendations Today was a simple lunch of a Braunschweiger (liverwurst) sandwich, one of my all-time favorites. The Braunschweiger component of the sandwich cost $0.31 out of about $0.42 total, so it's a fairly economical sandwich. (The Braunschweiger I got was $2.50/lb which is fairly good for a meat product.) I didn't have any lettuce, so I put on a few cabbage leaves I had left over. I also had some homemade kimchi, a very small amount of potato chips, and half of some sort of lovely pear (Bosc, I believe) that was in the fridge from before this experiment began (again, if it goes to waste, I have to charge myself for it.) I don't remember how much it cost, but fruit can be very expensive and blow my budget easily. (A single honeycrisp apple, for example, can be $1.79!) I'm going to take the worst-case scenario and estimate the whole pear at $1.00, which is the current selling price of fancy Asian pears in the advertisements. This could easily wreck my budget, and I may revise the price when I go back to the grocery store. (I lived in Germany for 6 months on a youth exchange when I was 21, and dinner in all of my families was almost always a cold dinner of good, dense German bread along with cold cuts of meat and cheese and butter, and something like tomatoes. The meats were always delicous, but Leberwurst was always my favorite (until I got the courage to try the steak tartare, which then became my favorite. Sorry, liverwurst.)) Dinner was the last of the pork pancakes and colcannon, and a bit more asparagus. See day six for the cost breakdown of the pork pancakes and colcannon. Thoughts Luckily, the day's meal was quite under my budget, even with the expensive pear estimate. The potential sky-high price of pears stressed me out, though. I have expensive honeycrisp apples in the fridge from before the experiment which also gnaws at me. One of these days, I may have to eat an apple and nothing else! Stupid pre-experiment lavish lifestyle. Walmart's price for Bosc pears is $1.67/lb, quite a bit cheaper than I estimated. How much did my pear weigh? 6 oz? The half that I ate would be $0.31 then. Whenever I don't know the price of something, or want to comparison-shop, I like to look at delivery.walmart.com which allows you to get actual current prices (from the luxury of your home,) on almost everything that Walmart carries. (You can even have someone put together an order for you that you'll pick up or have delivered in some markets.) Put in a zip code for the Denver area (say, 80112) to check prices if they don't have this service in your region. This is very useful for price comparisons! (Note: The site doesn't work for me in Firefox, probably because of my aggressive ad-blocking. All searches just silently return no results.) I have hard-working friends who like Walmart's service. They fill their cart online, and pick up their order at the store. I haven't heard how well their grocery delivery works, but I know people who could use that. The ability to choose very specific products, quantities, and prices from their whole selection is a very nice feature compared to other shop-at-home systems which allowed the store's shoppers to easily blow out your budget with a poorly-chosen subsititution. Thinking about lunchmeats, I was wondering what the cheapest would be. I haven't eaten bologna for a long time, but that looks pretty cheap. You can get Oscar Meyer brand for $2.00/lb and Bar-S for $1.28/lb. I'll probably stick with Braunschweiger, though. That pork shoulder lasted 5 days! Sometimes pork can start tasting or smelling \"off\" to me after 3 days. I'm very sensitive to that. I hope that cooling it rapidly in the water bath after cooking and before refrigerating helped to prevent any spoilage. It was recooked each time it was served, too. I didn't notice any \"off\" tastes. If you're old-school, you might think you have to cook pork to very high temperatures to avoid trichinosis. Trichina is a parasitic roundworm that was historically spread through pork. In 1943, 1 out of 6 people in the U.S. were infected with trichina. However, due to better pork-raising practices and screening, it has been virtually eliminated in pork in the United States and much of the world. Jeff Potter notes in his excellent O'Reilly book Cooking for Geeks that \"a century ago, ~1.4% of pork was infected [with trichina]; in 1996, of 221,123 tested animals in the United States, 0 were infected.\" Want to know more about pork safety? Want to try to convince your friends that they don't need to overcook their pork? Here's the USDA's Fact Sheet on Trichina! I've seen some recipes that tell you to cook pork chops to 180°F (82°C)! Poor, dry, crispy pork chop. Cooking for Geeks is really an awesome book. It discusses why you're doing what you're doing when cooking, which allows you to generalize your knowledge and predict outcomes. It also goes into a fun variety of interesting techniques including sous vide cooking, molecular gastronomy, and much more. Very highly recommended. Perhaps my favorite cooking book of all time. It's an O'Reilly book. For cooking! (For nerds, that's all you have to say.) I'll write up my kimchi recipe one of these days. Sorry, no pictures today! Day 8 Costs Item Cost Braunschweiger sandwich Braunschweiger (Kroger house brand), 2 oz @ 2.50/lb $0.31 White bread, 2 slices $0.10 Cabbage $0.03 Braunschweiger sandwich subtotal: $0.42 Homemade Kimchi (76 g) $0.15 1/2 oz potato chips $0.09 1/2 Bosc? pear (estimated) $0.50 Colcannon, 6 oz subtotal $0.16 1 pork pancake subtotal: $0.38 1/8 pound asparagus @ $0.99/lb $0.13 Daily Total $1.83 Day 9 - Banana Bread and Urad Dal Before shoveling lots more snow in the morning, I wanted some quick energy so I ate half of a banana ($0.14) and a quick egg sandwich on two pieces of dry white toast from my Breakfast Machine. Why dry? Since I noticed the other day that buttering bread for grilled cheese sandwiches was rather expensive, I decided to save a few cents. I don't know how Elwood Blues eats dry white toast. Next time I'll butter it. Sandwich cost was $0.18. For lunch, I had the most amazing ramen again, as described on day 6. Saving the pork broth from day 4 keeps paying off. Look at that broth! I used up my bok choy, so the total cost was about $0.62. I was very full and had broth left over afterwards, which went to good use again, as you will see below. Also, here's a loaf of my mom's award-winning banana bread, which is the best thing ever (and it's a great use for 3 bananas that were getting overripe): The whole loaf cost $2.52 to make. I ate about 1/16 of it, (I could have eaten the whole thing,) which cost $0.16. I ate the banana bread without butter. It was very good and moist. You can see a slice on the right-hand-side of the ramen picture above. Many people have suggested dried beans as a cost-effective meal. I had some Urad Dal (a small, white lentil-like bean, also called \"matpe bean\" in English) from an Indian market. I've never used them before, so these became an experiment. 1 cup of dry beans (7.6 oz, cost $0.95) were brought to a boil in the leftover pork broth from lunch, reduced to a simmer and covered, and then simmered for about 45 minutes until they were soft. While they were cooking, they smelled exactly like Campbell's Bean and Bacon soup (which is one of my favorites!) Must have been the pork broth. When finished, they were slightly gelatinous and slippery. They were quite delicious and filling. I ate approximately 1/4 of the final product, for a cost of $0.25. I tried adding other spices to the Urad Dal, such as garam masala and tikka masala powders, but it really didn't need it. The pork broth again worked its miracle! Since I wasn't too hungry for dinner after the huge bowl of ramen, I also had a (relatively expensive) hot dog and some colcannon. After calculating my costs for the day, I was at $1.99, so I decided to have a bonus piece of banana bread, this time with butter (the butter cost only $0.03), which brought me to $2.12 for the day. Yum. By the way, so far I haven't tried to eat as close to $2.50 as I can. I haven't needed to, as I haven't been significantly hungry. A Picture Puzzle This was the day that the internets exploded with the \"What color is this dress?\" debate, in which some people saw the the dress as white and gold, and others saw it as blue and black. In that spirit, here's another picture puzzle, which I took after making the ramen: What color are the burners? Do you see them as blue and black (or white and gold?) I tell you that both burners are in fact, both the same color. Why do I say that? Send me your guesses ether on Twitter at @aeliasen or by email at eliasen@mindspring.com. Thoughts I've wondered about accounting for costs of very small quantities of things like salt and baking soda. Even in inefficient quantities, these are usually less than a cent in most recipes. (1 teaspoon of baking soda for banana bread was about 0.6 cents, so I'm not going to worry much about these tiny costs from here on out.) Rule of thumb: 1 teaspoon baking soda: 0.6 cents. Again, I'm finding that foods that cost less than $2.00/lb are efficient for filling you up. Too much more than this, and you may have trouble getting enough at this price level. Useful link: Walmart price search. I watched Martha Stewart cooking some blueberry crisp and a couple of other recipes, and I was able to easily estimate the cost of the dry ingredients (not the blueberries) in my head simply using the rules of thumb that I've listed here. I think that's quite useful! Day 9 Costs Item Cost Dry egg sandwich 1 egg $0.08 White bread, 2 slices $0.10 Dry sandwich subtotal: $0.18 1/2 banana $0.14 The World's Best Ramen, Again Broth, spices $0.10 Bok choy, 4.3 oz @ $0.99/lb $0.27 1 egg $0.08 Ramen (1 pkg) $0.17 Ramen subtotal: $0.62 Banana Bread (cost for 1 loaf) 1 stick butter $0.92 1 cup sugar $0.27 2 eggs $0.16 3 bananas $0.84 2 cups flour $0.32 1 teaspoon baking soda $0.01 Banana bread subtotal (1 loaf): $2.52 Banana bread subtotal (1/16 loaf): $0.16 Urad Dal ~2 oz of dry @ $3.99/(2 lb) $0.25 Hot Dog Hot dog (Oscar Meyer Classic Bun Length) $0.32 Hot dog bun $0.16 Hot dog subtotal: $0.48 Colcannon, 6 oz subtotal $0.16 Bonus banana bread $0.10 Butter, 3.5 g $0.03 Daily Total $2.12 Day 10 - Tuna Casserole Lunch was 1.5 fried egg sandwiches with mayonnaise. See the calculations below for calculating the cost of mayonnaise (which is sold by volume, but I measured it by mass.) Total cost: $0.38. My stomach must be shrinking, because I was full after 1.5 sandwiches. Since it was a Friday during Lent, a fish dish was in order for dinner. It was time to break out a delicious recipe that's at least 80 years old for Tuna Casserole! I obtained this recipe from my friend Richard who made it for a potluck, and everyone loved it. He generously gave me the old family recipe, which noted that his mother made it for his father on their honeymoon in 1935, and they ate the whole batch in one sitting! It's a tuna casserole that's covered with bready pinwheels, and is really delicious and filling. It's quite easy to make, and may last more than one sitting if you can restrain yourself. There is no sacrifice in eating this dish; it's a year-round family favorite of more than one family! (By the way, if you do it right, your pinwheels will be prettier and actually look like pinwheels.) The most expensive part of the dish is 4 cans of tuna, which I bought for $0.79/can, which is a fairly good price. You don't need whole chunk fancy tuna, as you're going to break it up anyway! I looked at large cans of tuna, but they were more expensive per ounce than small cans on sale. The body of the casserole is onions, green bell peppers, and tuna in a flour and milk sauce. (You can call it Béchamel sauce if you're fancy.) The rolls are made from Bisquick and milk, with a bit of cheese rolled in. I modified the original recipe in a few ways: I reduced the amount of cheese in the rolls from 8 oz to 3.5 ounces (you can never taste it anyway), used one bell pepper instead of 2 (because I only had one) and eliminated the jar of pimientos that are usually sprinkled over the top (they're pretty, but I could never taste them.) Also, I had no nutmeg. The whole casserole cost $7.98 to make (great!) so each of the 15 \"pinwheels\" marks a serving that cost $0.53 to make. I ate 3 pinwheels, and the last of the asparagus. Finding inexpensive tuna makes this quite an inexpensive recipe (the tuna was $3.16 of the total cost.) Since I'll probably be eating this casserole for another couple of meals, I'll post the recipe another day. Update: The recipe is posted on day 11. After calculating my costs for the day, I had money left over, so I had another slice of banana bread with butter. Total daily expense: $2.23. Thoughts Useful link: Food density database. Rule of thumb: 1 tablespoon mayonnaise costs $0.06. Rule of thumb: 1 cup mayonnaise costs $0.93. Rule of thumb: 1 pound mayonnaise costs $2.00. Rule of thumb: Light mayonnaise on both sides of a sandwich costs $0.09. Bisquick is about 2.7 times as expensive as the same quantity of flour, but it has oil, dextrose, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in it, so the convenience may make it not worth the time to reproduce yourself from flour and other ingredients. The rolls on top are simply 3 cups of Bisquick and one cup of milk. Couldn't be easier. Frink Calculations I mentioned before that I've created a calculating tool / programming language called Frink which is great for helping with physical calculations. Here's how to calculate the cost of mayonnaise (which is labeled by volume) but weighed by my scale. To do this, we either have to measure or look up the density of mayonnaise. We can easily search for the density of mayonnaise which gives \"0.91 g/ml\"). Each sandwich took a total of 0.75 oz (this is a mass) of mayonnaise: mayocost = 3.48 dollars / (30 floz) mayodensity = 0.91 g/ml 0.75 oz mayocost / mayodensity 0.0916 dollar (currency) So light mayonnaise on (both sides) of a sandwich costs about $0.09. Day 10 Costs Item Cost Fried Egg Sandwich (prices are for 1 sandwich) White bread, 2 slices $0.10 1.5 eggs $0.06 Mayonnaise, 0.75 oz $0.09 1 sandwich subtotal: $0.25 1.5 sandwich subtotal: $0.38 Tuna Casserole 15.75 oz (3 cups) Bisquick @ $4.94/(60 oz) $1.30 3.5 oz cheese @ $2.88/lb $0.63 4 cans tuna @ $0.79/can $3.16 1 green bell pepper $0.79 1 yellow onion $0.30 1 stick butter $0.92 1/2 cup flour $0.08 4 cups milk $0.80 1 casserole total (15 portions): $7.98 1 portion subtotal: $0.53 3 portion subtotal: $1.59 1/8 pound asparagus @ $0.99/lb $0.13 Bonus banana bread $0.10 Butter, 3.5 g $0.03 Daily Total (revised) $2.23 Day 11 - Tuna Casserole Recipe Lunch was a Braunschweiger sandwich with kimchi and a few chips. Total lunch cost, $0.66. Dinner was the tuna casserole from day 10 and some more colcannon. As promised, here's the recipe for the Tuna Casserole! Tuna Casserole Recipe This is the original 80-year-old recipe for the tuna casserole. My suggestions follow. Chop 1 large onion and 2 green peppers. Sauté in a melted stick of butter until glossy. Add 1/2 tsp salt, also pepper and nutmeg to taste. Add 1/2 cup flour and stir together well. Slowly, and over medium heat, add and stir in enough milk for a thinnish white sauce. Add 3 or 4 cans of drained tuna, stir, put into a 9x13 inch cakepan. Prepare a biscuit mix using 3 cups Pioneer or Bisquick mix with one cup of milk. Roll out into a rectangle 3/8 inch thick. Sprinkle 1/2 lb. shredded cheddar and one large jar of chopped pimientos over the biscuit mix. Roll up and cut into 12 equal-sized rolls. Place the rolls on top of the tuna mix. Bake at 350°F for 45 minutes. Alan's suggestions: I find it better to cook at 350°F for 20 minutes, then lower the temperature to 325°F for another 20 minutes. The rolls get a bit too dry otherwise. After cooking, cover with aluminum foil and let rest for 5-10 minutes for the filling to set. This steams the rolls a bit further. I found that 15 rolls fit better in a 13x9\" pan. As mentioned in day 10, I reduced the cost a bit by using less cheese and no pimientos. Thoughts Today's total was $2.49, very close to my target. I didn't realize that I was quite this close! I went to King Soopers today to pick up some items like bread and butter. Butter was on sale for $1.99/lb, almost half the price that I've been paying, so I got a couple of pounds. Butter prices are at an all-time high. During WWII when butter was rationed, people would \"extend\" butter by whipping it with either water or another kind of oil, then refrigerating it to solidify. If using water, a bit of emulsifier like soy lecithin would help keep it together. I might experiment with this. Emulsifiers keep oil and water from separating in solutions. There weren't many other good sales at King Soopers (nor in the other grocery store advertisements) this week. Quite a change from last week's many good deals at Albertson's. As I unpacked all the food, I labeled each item with its prices (and per-serving cost when applicable) with a permanent marker. I also got a few inexpensive experimental items like lard, chicken livers, and bologna. Perhaps I will use them all in the same dish! Day 11 Costs Item Cost Braunschweiger sandwich Braunschweiger (Kroger house brand), 2 oz @ 2.50/lb $0.31 White bread, 2 slices $0.10 Cabbage $0.03 Braunschweiger sandwich subtotal: $0.42 Homemade Kimchi (76 g) $0.15 1/2 oz potato chips $0.09 Tuna casserole, 3 portions: $1.59 Colcannon, 9 oz. $0.24 Daily Total $2.49 Day 12 - End of the Tuna Casserole Today was like some days before -- oatmeal and half a banana for breakfast ($0.35), a braunschweiger sandwich and a very small amount of potato chips for lunch ($0.42), and the last of the tuna casserole for dinner. Daily total: $2.35. That tuna casserole is excellent. I highly recommend it even if you're not trying to eat inexpensively. It's worth every penny. At the end of the day, I had $0.15 left in my budget, so I had a small piece of banana bread with butter. Final total: $2.48. Thoughts I miss potato chips. Day 12 Costs Item Cost Oatmeal Oatmeal, 0.57 cup (uncooked volume) $0.14 Milk, 1/4 cup $0.05 Brown sugar, 1 tablespoon $0.03 Oatmeal subtotal: $0.22 1/2 banana $0.13 Braunschweiger sandwich Braunschweiger (Kroger house brand), 2 oz @ 2.50/lb $0.31 White bread, 2 slices $0.10 Cabbage $0.03 Braunschweiger sandwich subtotal: $0.42 1/2 oz potato chips $0.09 Tuna casserole, 2.5 portions: $1.33 Colcannon, 6 oz. $0.16 Bonus banana bread $0.10 Butter, 3.5 g $0.03 Daily Total $2.48 Day 13 - Cabbage Rolls Cabbage Rolls Recipe As promised on Day 2, here's the Cabbage Rolls / Krautburger recipe! They're a bun filled with cabbage, onions, and ground beef. They're delicious, nutritious, filling, inexpensive, and they freeze and microwave incredibly well, so you can make a giant batch and have cheap food ready in minutes! This recipe is for a single batch but you should always plan on making at least a triple batch because they freeze extremely well, and it's just as easy to make a large batch. I made a larger-than-quadruple batch. A single batch will make about 15 krautburgers. Breading 1 package active dry yeast 1 cup lukewarm milk (110 to 115 degrees) 2 tablespoons sugar 1 teaspoon salt 3 cups all-purpose flour 3 egg yolks 4 tablespoons butter, softened Sprinkle the yeast into 1/2 cup of the milk. Add the sugar and salt and stir until dissolved (actually it will stay clumpy because of the milk. Just let it sit for a while and it will unclump.) Place the mixture in a warm draft-free place for 5 to 8 minutes or until the mixture has begun to bubble. (It may take longer than that.) Pour the flour into a large bowl and make a well in the center. Drop in the yeast mixture, egg yolks, remaining 1/2 cup of milk, and butter, and with a large wooden spoon, gradually stir the flour into the other ingredients until a fairly firm dough is formed. Cover the bowl and let rise in a warm place for an hour. (Over a bowl of warm water is good.) Punch down, let rise for another 45 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Filling 2 finely chopped onions 1/2 head finely chopped cabbage 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 pound ground beef, (80% Lean/20% fat preferable) Garlic or garlic powder to taste Salt to taste Pepper to taste (Optional) Cumin to taste. (Optional) other spices you like. Paprika is good! Taco seasoning would be really good too! In a large pot with a lid, heat oil and cook onions with some salt for 5 minutes. Add cabbage, some salt and pepper (or bouillon powder for even more flavor,) and about 1/2\" of water, cover pot and steam until cabbage is tender, stirring occasionally. Add small amounts of water if necessary while cooking. A little bit of onion and cabbage juice left in is good! Lightly brown ground beef with garlic and do not drain. Mix beef with cooked cabbage and onions and season to taste. The filling will be easier to work with and less wet if cooled somewhat before using. Assembly Cut dough into manageable sections and roll out on lightly floured surface (or unfloured on a dough sheet.) Roll thin using rolling pin. Cut dough into pieces (whatever size you like, about 4\" square is good). Roll out again with a rolling pin for efficient use of your dough! Fill with a couple spoonfuls of filling. Fold corners of dough together, pinch closed, and turn over with seam down on cookie sheet. Bake in oven for 10-12 minutes or until golden. Cool on rack. Can freeze after cooled. These reheat very nicely in the microwave. Update: I broke down the cabbage roll costs in day 16. Note that the final cost was about $0.47, an increase of $0.06 over my estimate. In another year, when ground beef was on sale, I made them for about $0.37 apiece with lots of filling left over! Breakfast was a bowl of oats ($0.18). I've already eaten more oats in the last week than I have during the rest of my life combined (and I've only eaten about 3 bowls.) Lunch was a delicious egg salad sandwich (with the last egg that cost $0.08 and two new new super-cheap eggs that cost $0.04 each) and 1/4 cup of the Urad Dal from day 9. The Urad Dal was absolutely delicious. (Have I mentioned that you should save your pork broth?) Dinner was 2 cabbage rolls, the last of the colcannon, and, since I was well under budget, another 1/4 cup of Urad Dal. After dinner, I had still only spent $1.55 for the day. As an evening snack, I had banana bread and tapioca pudding. Daily total: $1.96. Thoughts If you don't roll the dough quite thin, you will run out of dough before you run out of filling. That's fine! The filling is delicious by itself, or can be packed into a freezable pan to make a delicious meatloaf, or, covered with mashed potatoes, a cottage pie! The first few times I made krautburgers, I didn't have a good breading recipe, so I used Pillsbury Grands! biscuits and rolled them out flat. These were good (especially the buttery ones,) but rather expensive and not as good and elastic as this outstanding breading recipe (thanks to Jenny's mom for the recipe.) When tripling or quadrupling the breading, I was lazy and dumb and quadrupled the amount of yeast that I used. This is silly because yeast is a magical little animal that will multiply itself if you feed it and give it a bit of time! What I should have done is to start a package of yeast in some warm water or milk with sugar and flour, and let it stand for several hours to a day in a warm place. One packet of yeast would multiply enough to supply the whole recipe. If you keep yeast cultured and fed, it can last indefinitely, and you'll always have yeast available. It's hard to make bread cheaply if a single packet of yeast costs at least $0.50, half the cost of a loaf of store-brand bread! The best way to provide \"free\" live yeast culture is to culture your own sourdough. A sourdough starter is very rich in yeast, and makes gorgeous dough. I may start another sourdough culture to see if I can make bread inexpensively. I started sourdough last summer, but didn't bake often enough to make it useful. You need to bake every couple of days (to a week if you keep it refrigerated) and constantly feed and use it. Oh, geez. I just convinced myself. I just got up and made a sourdough starter. I'll talk about that another day. Day 13 Costs Item Cost Oatmeal Oatmeal, 0.43 cup (uncooked volume) $0.10 Milk, 1/4 cup $0.05 Brown sugar, 1 tablespoon $0.03 Oatmeal subtotal: $0.18 Egg Salad Sandwich (prices are for 1 sandwich) 3/4 Egg $0.04 Mayonnaise, 15 g $0.07 2 slices white bread $0.12 1 sandwich subtotal $0.23 Urad Dal (1/2 cup prepared) $0.16 Krautburgers 2 Krautburgers (revised)$0.94 Colcannon, 6 oz. $0.16 Tapioca Pudding 1/6 box pudding, Kroger house brand $0.10 1/3 cup milk $0.06 Milk on pudding (36 g) $0.03 Pudding subtotal $0.19 Bonus banana bread $0.16 Butter, 7 g $0.06 Banana bread subtotal $0.22 Daily Total $2.08 Day 14 - Potato Pea Soup and Fried Chicken I had 3 items which were on sale—milk, butter, and potatoes. Add peas and it becomes one of my favorite dishes—potato pea soup! I decided to make a big batch. It ended up being about 1.4 gallons (5.4 liters). That's a big pot! It took 5.23 pounds of potatoes, 2.2 lb of frozen green peas, 110 fl.oz. of milk, and 1/2 lb butter (I usually use even more butter than this!) The whole batch cost $7.82, or about $0.35 cents per cup. I had 3 cups for $1.05. Since I also wanted some protein, I made some fried chicken! I can count on about 2 fingers the times I've made actual fried chicken in my whole life, so I wasn't sure how it would turn out. I had some big, beautiful chicken thighs (the best part of the bird) for the great price of $0.88/lb, which is about as low of a price as you can get for meat. (Even cheap bologna on sale costs more.) I basically used Alton Brown's recipe, except I didn't soak the chicken in buttermilk. Since I didn't plan ahead and the chicken was frozen solid, I brined/thawed it in water with salt and a bit of sugar. I've pan-fried fried chicken before, but it's hard to get right. Instead, I used my ever-ready deep fryer, which already had oil in it from many dinners in the past. After 20 minutes at 325°F (160 °C), this is what it looks like: Conclusion: a deep-fryer is much more foolproof than cooking fried chicken in a skillet with a smaller amount of oil. It was cooked through and cooked evenly. It was much easier than the fried chicken I've made before. Will do again. Each thigh was very large and averaged about 8 ounces, and with the flour and spices, cost $0.46. I would have gladly eaten several of them, but I ate one and I'm saving one for tomorrow. Or later tonight. Lunch was an egg salad sandwich and the last of the Urad Dal. Since I had $0.45 left over, I had a late-night snack of a $0.25 frozen burrito. Daily total: $2.30. Thoughts I woke up very hungry and a bit weak. I had about $0.54 left over yesterday, so I should have eaten more. I ate a late-night burrito today to fill out my total. I'm not quite sure how to account for the oil, but it has already cooked many meals and I plan on re-using it for as long as it stays good. I even counted a couple of bad potatoes that I had to throw out into my costs. Day 14 Costs Item Cost Egg Salad Sandwich (prices are for 1 sandwich) 3/4 Egg $0.04 Mayonnaise, 15 g $0.07 2 slices white bread $0.12 1 sandwich subtotal $0.23 Urad Dal (3/8 cup prepared) $0.12 Potato Pea Soup Potatoes, 5.23 lb @ ($2.99/(10 lb)) $1.57 Bouillon, 30 g @ ($4.98/(35.3 oz)) $0.15 Green peas, 2.2 lb @ $2.49/(2 lb) $2.74 Milk, 110 floz $2.36 Butter, 1/2 lb @ $1.99/lb $1.00 Potato pea soup subtotal (23 cups) $7.82 Potato pea soup subtotal (1 cup) $0.35 Potato pea soup subtotal (3 cups) $1.05 Chicken thigh $0.43 Flour, spices $0.03 Chicken thigh subtotal $0.46 Tapioca Pudding 1/6 box pudding, Kroger house brand $0.10 1/3 cup milk $0.06 Milk on pudding (36 g) $0.03 Pudding subtotal $0.19 Frozen burrito $0.25 Daily Total $2.30 Day 15 - An Emulsifier Experiment For lunch, I had a couple of extremely cheap hot dogs (Bar S Classic Bun Length Franks, $0.75 for 8) that I had bought on sale 2 weeks ago. Each hot dog was only $0.09, and I ate them on ordinary white bread instead of a bun, which made them quite cheap: only $0.15 apiece. Compare this to $0.48 for my previous hot dog plus bun! I could have 3 hot dogs for the price of 1, but only ate 2. Dinner was more potato pea soup (3 bowls) and another piece of delicious fried chicken from yesterday. When serving the potato pea soup from the refrigerator, there was a huge crust of butter that had solidified on top of the soup which had to be broken apart and carefully portioned into the soup. I got to thinking about ways to improve this, and decided I would do a little experiment with an emulsifier. Emulsifiers help to prevent oil and water from separating. Look how the droplets of butter separate into large droplets in ordinary soup, within seconds of stirring: My mom and I made molecular gastronomy kits for several friends and family this Christmas, and I had an emulsifier, soy lecithin, in my kit. I added 1.2 g of soy lecithin to a bowl of soup (this is a concentration of 0.5% by mass, cost $0.05) and stirred it vigorously and heated it in the microwave. After re-stirring, this is what the soup looked like: Note that the butter no longer separates into large droplets. The emulsifier helps disperse the butter more evenly into the soup. Would this make my soup easier to serve and more uniform? Since butter is less dense than milk, it will still try to float to the surface of the liquid, so it probably won't solve my refrigerator storage problem. But it's an interesting experiment nevertheless! I'll have to try adding some emulsifier to a batch of soup that I store in the fridge and see how well it prevents separation. A big problem is that mixing it vigorously (like with a stick blender) would also break up the potatoes and peas. If I'm going to add emulsifier, I'll have to add it to the hot milk and butter before adding the potatoes. This was a very quick-and-dirty experiment, but it demonstrated that a little bit of soy lecithin will help keep fats from separating in soup. No difference in taste was detected. I tasted a small amount of the soy lecithin powder, and it didn't have a strong taste. For a late-night snack, I also had some tapioca pudding and banana bread. Some of the banana bread had to be frozen because it's not getting eaten fast enough. Daily total: $2.27. Thoughts The sourdough starter is going well. It smells like sourdough. I'll need to feed it with flour (and a bit of sugar) about 12 hours before making some bread. You'll very often see soy lecithin in the ingredients list of anything that contains fat and liquid, such as salad dressings, soups, broths, etc. It may also appear in things like macaroni and cheese to keep the cheese fats from separating from the liquids. Look for it! I have a recipe for incredibly creamy macaroni and cheese that can be made with any kind of cheese. Often, melting cheese can make it lumpy and oily, but a little bit of emulsifier like soy lecithin or calcium citrate will keep it smooth and creamy. Due to the cost of fancy cheese, I may not be able to make it during this experiment, though. I added in the soy lecithin cost ($0.05) even though it was a Christmas present. At my cost, it would cost $1.02 to add enough emulsifier for the entire 1.4 gallon batch.

Total cost: $0.30. Dinner was 2 bowls of potato pea soup (which is disappearing very rapidly!) for $0.70 and 2 cabbage rolls for $0.94. I was hungry, so for a late-night snack I had a bowl of rather ordinary ramen ($0.17) with some bok choy $(0.27) and an egg ($0.04). Cabbage Roll Cost Breakdown I've avoided calculating the exact cost breakdown for the 61 cabbage rolls that I made before the experiment. Here it is: Item Cost Krautburgers (Cost for whole batch) Yeast, 4 packets $1.99 Milk, 4 1/3 cups $0.81 Sugar, 1/2 cup $0.12 Salt, 4 teaspoons $0.02 Flour, 13 cups $2.08 Egg yolks, 13 $0.55 Butter, 17 tablespoons $2.00 Breading subtotal $7.57 Ground Chuck, 80% lean, 4 lb @ $3.99/lb $15.96 Yellow onions, 4 $1.78 2 heads cabbage, 4 lb @ $0.79/lb $3.15 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, $0.04 Filling subtotal $20.93 61 Krautburgers subtotal $28.50 1 Krautburger subtotal $0.47 Since I had been working on the estimate that each krautburger cost $0.41, this increases my costs somewhat on a few days! Luckily, I just went back and revised the totals for the 2 other days (day 2 and day 13) on which I had krautburgers, and was still well under the total on those days! Whew! I just stressed myself out there for a minute. Thoughts The cabbage roll supply is holding up very well. Making a gigantic batch of them was a very good choice. Obviously, the largest part of the cost of the cabbage burgers is ground beef. If you can find it on sale, it's an even better deal. You can also use more cabbage and less beef (by weight, beef costs 5 times as much as cabbage.) Making a sourdough starter or feeding the yeast and giving it time to multiply could have cut $1.50 off of the cost. I fed the sourdough starter with a cup of flour and a cup of water for something I'm going to make tomorrow. If you know me, you know I'm usually grumpy in the morning. I've been especially grumpy in the evenings with this experiment. The ramen didn't taste especially fresh. Not sure why. I have a hard time going back to ordinary ramen after eating the World's Best Ramen that I made on day 6. Here's an interesting article. It apparently doesn't matter whether you eat 2 meals a day or 6, as long as caloric intake is the same. Periodic fasting may also be good for you.

Dinner was another piece of the salmon that I bought on day 3, prepared about the same way, along with a bowl of potato pea soup. I slightly overcooked the salmon in an attempt to get the skin crispy (and splashed hot oil on my hand in the process.) Sourdough Experiment I mentioned before that creating your own sourdough starter was a way to have an active culture of yeast available to make bread more inexpensively. I looked at a few sourdough recipes, and decided to try and adapt a non-sourdough recipe for Garlic Knots that I had seen. Take a look at the pictures in that recipe. It looks good. I had recently created a sourdough starter, which I fed with a cup of flour and a cup of water about 12 hours in advance so it would be nice and active. The sourdough starter had some gentle bubbles in it, so I made a very simple pizza dough recipe, adapting the recipe from the garlic knots site. It was approximately 1 cup sourdough starter, 2.5 cups flour, 2 tablespoons sugar, 2 teaspoons salt, 1 fl.oz. olive oil, and water. Since I made the dough the night before, I followed the usual pizza dough advice and put it into the refrigerator overnight, and then warmed it the next day and tried to let it rise for about 5 hours. In order to try and make it cheaper, and because I didn't have the ingredients on hand, I eliminated the pepperoni, cheese, even the onions. I used garlic powder, onion powder, and a few other spices like oregano. I also used vegetable oil instead of olive oil. Again, since I was using a sourdough starter, I didn't add any yeast. Unfortunately, when I was ready to eat, the dough still hadn't risen appreciably. It had risen a little bit, but I was too impatient to wait another 5 hours or whatever, so I cooked it anyway. So...yeah. To make a long story short, the garlic knots didn't really rise, and were very dense. The taste was good, and they smelled amazing, but they were doughy inside and very solid outside. I made the mistake of putting them back into the oven to try and remove some of the doughiness inside, but it just made them harder. What I learned was that I needed a more active sourdough starter, or a higher proportion of it. Putting the dough in the refrigerator overnight was probably a mistake too. Ah, well, it was a half-assed experiment. I'll try to do better next time. I know that sourdough can make a gorgeous pizza dough; I made a batch about a year ago that was the most beautiful, perfect dough you've ever seen. I don't recall if I added additional yeast, though. I may have. Thoughts I'm really dubious of the \"425°F for 25 to 30 minutes\" idea from the original recipe. Even smeared with olive oil, those things were sizzling within minutes, and I'd think they would be burnt black and hard as a rock in that amount of time. I had to reduce the temperature to keep them from deep-frying and to keep the oil from smoking in the pan. You could probably make these with Rhodes frozen rolls, sort of the way you make monkey bread. Still, you'd have to drastically reduce the time and temperature.

Somehow I stayed up all night playing it. Dinner was a quick Banquet turkey pot pie ($0.79), half a grapefruit ($0.13), and some Macaroni & White Cheddar that I got from a box (the whole box was only $0.25, Wild Harvest brand in-store promotion at Albertson's.) I also had a few of the Garlic Knots from the day before, which I tried to revive and soften by microwaving them in a wet paper towel. It didn't work. Since dinner was so inexpensive, I had a large frozen burrito for a late-night snack. (El Monterey XX Large Bean & Cheese Burrito, 10 oz.) I bought a bunch of these last summer for cheap on an in-store closeout, (I'm thinking $0.50) but I don't remember exactly, so I'm going to call it $1.00, which is the everyday Walmart price. Daily total: $2.30. Thoughts All of the prepackaged food that I bought was on fairly good discount. Watch for promotions (and times when a store runs out of freezer space, which is when I got the burritos.)

HOT CHICKEN! Since I had more beautiful, large, inexpensive chicken thighs ($0.88/lb) in the freezer, I decided to try my luck again with fried chicken. I have always been afraid of making fried chicken. It's hard to cook it evenly. It's hard to make sure it's cooked through. It's hard not to burn it. It's hard not to spatter yourself with oil. It's hard to keep the crust on the chicken. However, I'm getting drastically more confident with cooking it now that I know how easy it is in a deep fryer instead of a skillet. It's also much easier to use just one very tolerant part of the chicken (thighs) so everything cooks evenly and at the same time. I passed the first chicken test on day 14, so it was time to take it a step further. To HOT CHICKEN! Over the last year, I've seen more and more \"hot chicken\" on cooking shows. I've seen chefs who have had their lives changed by trying hot chicken. It's especially popular in Nashville, which even has a Hot Chicken Festival and Hot Chicken Coalition. I've never even tried hot chicken, and I'm not planning on going to Nashville any time soon, so I better try making my own. What makes hot chicken hot? Well, according to most recipes, the chicken is seasoned and fried in more or less the usual manner, but after it's fried, it's always basted with a hot oil and spice mixture which contains unbelieveable amounts of cayenne pepper, along with other spices like garlic powder, chili powder, and usually a fair amount of brown sugar to make a glaze and temper the heat. Many recipes insist that the hot oil actually has to be lard. I bought lard on day 11, so I was ready to go! Most recipes also dredge the chicken in flour twice to get a thicker, crispier crust, dipping it in an egg-and-milk wash in between. This is the first time I've done a double-dredge. Here's the process for hot chicken! Brine chicken (I just used salt and cold water for about 2 hours as the thighs were frozen solid.) Dry chicken. Season chicken (I used the barbecue rub I made on day 6). Dredge chicken in flour and a bit of salt. Shake off excess. Let chicken stand for 5 minutes or more to make a sticky, gummy coating that won't break off in the hot oil. Dip chicken in a wash of approximately equal parts egg and milk. (Some recipes add hot sauce to the mix.) Dredge chicken again in the flour mixture. Shake off excess. Let chicken stand for 5 minutes or more. Deep fry at 325°F (160 °C) for about 18 minutes (or less. Don't burn it!) Brush or dip chicken in spicy coating mixture (see below.) For the spicy coating, I slowly heated 3.5 oz of lard with a frightening amount of spices. I used 2 tablespoons of cayenne pepper which is very intimidating to see being measured out. I also added about 2 teaspoons of garlic powder, 1 teaspoon of chili powder, some salt, and about 2-3 tablespoons of brown sugar. I let this warm slowly and for a long time so that the spices could bloom in the oil and impart their flavors to it. I believe that this tempered the heat of the cayenne pepper significantly. If I would have eaten that much raw cayenne pepper, it would have blown my head off. Instead, it developed a rich, smoky, complex flavor that was absolutely delicious. I think that the lard may have helped to add rich, meaty flavors here. Look at that delicious crust. I brushed the first piece lightly with the hot oil, because I was afraid how hot it would be. It turned out that it was pleasantly hot, and the brown sugar in the glaze made it absolutely delicious. The second piece I brushed quite generously. Yum. I simply can't overstate how good this was. I've made some very good chicken wings in my life. People have told me they were the best wings they've ever had. They've told me that they were the best chicken they've ever had. I've even had people tell me it was the best thing they've ever eaten. Once I literally had so many people rave about my wings that I had a vegetarian decide at that moment to go back to eating meat, and she did. This chicken is as good as any I've ever made, if not even better. It's already one of my favorite foods I've ever eaten. It is one of the best things I've ever eaten. I literally couldn't stop talking about it. The flavor was balanced and rich, spicy and sweet, the crust was crisp and the chicken was moist. And it was amazingly inexpensive and filling (the thighs averaged about 8 oz. before cooking.) Eating two pieces of chicken, I'd never guess for a second that I was trying to eat inexpensively. Wow. What a meal. Not bad at all for a day I only spent $2.00 on food! Easily, a life-changing meal. I can see how professional chefs become obsessed with hot chicken and need to make it in their own restaurants! (You may have noticed some other deep-fried treats in the background of that picture. Those are corn and potato fritters, which are also delicious. I'll write about them tomorrow, as I have more hot chicken to eat tomorrow!) Breakfast was a big bowl of minute oatmeal ($0.22). Thoughts The biggest mistake that I made was setting the chicken in the basket of the deep fryer, waiting a minute or two, and then lowering the basket into the fryer. The crust in the first batch stuck very badly to the basket, and I broke much of the crust off while trying to free it. Always lower the chicken slowly directly into the oil (you",

Here in San Francisco, we have a plethora of Farmers Markets. The thing about produce is: once harvested, the clock starts on it going bad. So the farmers have a ticking timebomb on their hands: if they can't sell the produce at the end of the day, (in most cases) it will go to waste. Some of the enterprising ones take a trip to Chinatown and offload their leftover produce for pennies. So when I was in a situation of hardship where I was living on a few dollars per day, I would go to the farmers market near closing time, and over time developed friendships with them, so they would sell me their remaining produce for dirt cheap.

Once the mother cow is worn out from all the births, they too are killed. reply jvanderbot 6 hours agorootparentMale calves are usually sold for meat (veal). Cows that cannot produce sufficient milk are sold for beef. This is objectionable if you find any of the meat farming practices objectionable, but whey itself does not necessitate killing anything.

It's just not what we seem to want. reply bluGill 3 hours agorootparentMilk cows are not generally used for meat. That is a different breed of cows. Milk cows almost never have male offspring - with AI we can control to ensure only female calf's are born (IIRC this is about 97% accurate so a few males are born).

This is assuming that people would eat calves if they weren't killed so that we can take their milk. reply jvanderbot 5 hours agorootparentYou're right, but I think about it the other direction. We currently _do_ eat the calves that _are_ killed so we can take their milk. We _could_ (probably) figure out a way to not require killing them, I just don't know what that would be. reply GrantMoyer 4 hours agorootparentBack of the envelope math: cows live for about 20 years, but dairy cows are killed after about 4 years when their milk production slows. Assuming they are impregnated 4 times, that's (5 cows * 20 years per cow) / (4 years) = 25 times as costly. And this 25 times as costly milk has to compete with the 1 times as costly milk in a market that's already so competative that milk is sold below cost with government subsidies. It's impossible for practical purposes. reply jvanderbot 3 hours agorootparentIf you're comparing today's market, practices, and subsidies (which are all just measurements of the same signal) to a fictional world where we didn't want to kill any calfs, but using today's subsidies and prices, then I think that's not a fair comparison.

I have personally seen whey produced without harming calves. I also don't understand why some HNer's insist on downvoting simple questions. Trying to silence questioning is not healthy for society. reply GrantMoyer 4 hours agorootparentSo what did they do with the calf? reply svieira 1 hour agorootparentThe mother very quickly starts producing more milk than the calf can drink. In the wild the milk production levels off to the level of the calf's intake (and then slowly rises to match their needs as they age and then tapers off as they age further). In a small dairy situation the calves are kept off of the cows for either the morning or the evening milking and so the cows' milk production remains high the entire time. The calf weans, but from the cow's udder's perspective the calf is still suckling like mad and so the cow keeps producing milk. The calf grows up and is bred themselves, doubling the milk output over the course of two to three years. Now this isn't sustainable in a paperclip-optimizer kind of way, so only the best milkers are kept and the ones that either have a hard time getting pregnant, or are ornery, or produce less milk, or get sick regularly wind up getting harvested for their meat. But there's no need to kill the calves (at the local dairy scale). reply detourdog 2 hours agorootparentprevWait until it is done weaning to start using it's mother's milk. Most Dairy cows don't need to have a calf to produce milk. reply aziaziazi 5 hours agorootparentprevI agree with the downvote think. What you have seen (whey without calves harm) is probably typical an old farming practice OR of some rural family production. That’s great for them and their cows, but have nothing to do with 99% of the milk consumed daily, even the best quality you can buy wherever else those farms are. reply detourdog 2 hours agorootparentDo you think all dairy cows need calves to create milk? I don't care if someone disagrees with my posts I agree that they engage in conversation. Downvoting without explanation is my complaint. Finally the comment that whey production results in dead calves is pretty simplistic and not based on any analysis that I can discern.

That doesn't mean that gluten is bad, just that it causes a poor reaction in some people. Avocados are another one of these things. Some doctors like to call these \"digestive allergies\" to give patients an idea of how they can vary in severity and that they're for all intents and purposes a misdiagnosis from the immune system. reply CharlieDigital 6 hours agorootparent> ...gluten is something that seems to be a culprit of IBS symptoms in certain people. That doesn't mean that gluten is bad, just that it causes a poor reaction in some people... This is also my take on it. I've watched it first hand with my wife -- who is 1/2 Italian -- giving up pasta and bread in the last few years. It has made a huge difference in her daily quality of life with respect to digestive issues (mainly bloating and gassiness). Gluten is a protein so it's not hard to imagine that either this protein is not easily digested by some folks or some byproduct of its digestion feeds some specific gut bacteria that produces inflammatory compounds. If Celiac is a full blown immune response to inflammation caused by gluten, then it seems reasonable that some folks would have a spectrum of reactions to barely registering it or somewhere in between (like my wife). It's possible that it's some other compound that's prevalent in wheat, but avoiding wheat-based products has been life changing for my wife. I would add that this has developed with age similarly to how she has become lactose intolerant as well around the time she turned 40 so if you're in your 20's or 30's and you think this is malarkey, well, give it time (and really enjoy your lactose and gluten!). Why folks downvoted the original comment, I don't understand; this is based on firsthand experience hacking her diet and observing how she felt.

She was one of those people who had to have at least one glass of milk a day and a gallon of ice cream a week and that had to be cut out 100%. She reacts to very small amounts of milk and gluten products. Even top ramen flavor packets in a pasta salad contain enough wheat and milk to give her a miserable day. Much like HFCS, dairy and wheat are fillers in SO many products that it's become a chore to shop and almost impossible to eat out spontaneously anymore. reply CharlieDigital 2 hours agorootparent> This describes my wife almost exactly. Developed gluten and lactose intolerance right around 40. Anecdotally, I've heard this from other women in my wife's peer group so I also wonder if some of this is related to hormonal changes from child birth or maybe even pre-menopause. Her reactions are not as severe as your spouse's -- just gasiness and general abdominal discomfort (enough that it's not worth it for the satisfaction of eating pasta and dairy day-to-day).

Glyphosate may be a critical environmental trigger in the etiology of several disease states associated with dysbiosis, including celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome. Glyphosate exposure may also have consequences for mental health, including anxiety and depression, through alterations in the gut microbiome. However, the research surrounding glyphosate’s effects on the gut microbiome also suffers from numerous methodological weaknesses including artificially high-doses, insufficient duration, proprietary ingredients and an over reliance on animal models. Future long-term studies examining physiologically relevant doses in both healthy and genetically susceptible populations are warranted to determine the real risk posed to human health. reply imtringued 10 hours agorootparentprevI'm not sure what you mean by \"clear cut medical condition\" other than that it is easy to test. reply Beijinger 5 hours agorootparentROTFL.

Optimising for economic cost with the only requirement being \"fill your belly\" and \"be palatable enough\", tends to result in poor nutrition. This is roughly how the industry optimises food - minimise economic cost, maximise yield, and maximise sales (make everything artificially hyper palatable), with terrible results. In the long term this is partly covered by the economic cost on a personal basis because of the cost in health care and loss of ability to produce income due to deteriorating health. But this is displaced in time, and you do not want to do this experiment on yourself, it's not reversible.

If I recall correctly, you get complete nutrition from: potatoes, a small amount of dairy (vitamin A, calcium, fatty acids), and a small amount of ... oats? (or maybe some vegetable?

So making a supply of this nutritionally complete food isn't the hard part, it's basically getting it to people who would eat it. The other sad and ironic thing is that in America, both food insecurity and obesity basically exist side by side.

The reason is that neither has any compassion, to this very day. OTOH, either system could be structured to be based upon compassion, if the people in charge made the choice to do so. Any human system could be altered to incorporate compassion into its motivations and mechanisms. I'm a fan of fettered capitalism with socially-conscious citizens, but that requires the wealthy, middle class, and poor to be compassionate. What is important is to internalize the currently external costs corporations impose upon the environment and populace to make their profit.

What are you made of? Animal flesh provides exactly all the nutrients required for your own flesh, in exactly the perfectly balanced proportion. Just think about it for a second. So, the simple answer is just fatty meat. As a good extra, you can use some liver/kidneys, a good idea is to also throw in some cartilage and skin into your ground meat for perfect nutrients balance. Eggs/fish/cheese for variability. Imagine the careful measured portioning and chemical purification required to collect necessary nutrients from soy and vegetable stems — to make them right for building and sustaining your own animal flesh. Imagine how many things we didn't know 50 years ago about what nutrients are required for our flesh, and how many non-obvious things we will discover in the next 50 years from now, which would completely re-define best practices for synthetic vegetable food many times. reply woodruffw 3 hours agorootparentIt occurs to me that this “exactly balanced proportion” argument doesn’t explain how animals turn vegetables into the meat you crave.

You're probably thinking of the same debunked papers which said that sugary cereals are the healthy way to start your day reply hombre_fatal 2 hours agorootparentWell, instead of getting into that, the simpler debunk is that fatty meat only gives you a fraction of your daily nutrition. Even when you add in eggs and dairy. But only in diet camps (usually \"carnivore\"/\"keto\" camps) on social media do people tell you that research on saturated fats is debunked because it condemns the foods they wish to eat.

We have converging lines of metaanalyses that show this connection which is why reducing saturated fat and LDL cholesterol are unanimous guidelines, not social media fringe positions. ;) reply nlitened 2 hours agorootparent> the simpler debunk is that fatty meat only gives you a fraction of your daily nutrition I have tried the hyped-up \"carnivore\" diet myself for over 1.5 years and counting (started at a tender age of 35), with different levels of strictness (diary/no diary, no cheat days / once a month / twice a month / once a week), while doing blood tests every month. My wife thought I would die, but I was curious whether I would die, or how quickly my health would deteriorate. Happy to report that you're wrong (based of my own anecdata), and not only fatty meat (even without diary) does provide enough nutrients and energy, but it noticeably _improves_ the blood work results and _lowers_ blood cholesterol. > apoB concentration in the blood which is independently causal in atherosclerosis I am pretty sure you're unintentionally mixing up 'causal' and 'correlated'. Correlation is not causation. For example, atherosclerosis might be causal in in increased apoB concentration, or something else completely might be causal in both atherosclerosis and increased apoB concentration, but apoB concentration by itself could be independent from atherosclerosis, or even inverse causal. > We have converging lines of metaanalyses that show this connection which is why reducing saturated fat is a unanimous guideline.

Stop right there. This is playing switcharoo. You devised a hypothesis that elegantly goes like \"healthiest simplest diet is what is closest to your own body\". (And that you used as a justification to eat other animals) But hey I guess the closest to your body is other humans. So seeing as you now backtrack and are not suggesting humans eat humans, thankfully you understand that the original question implies some norms about what is acceptable and what is unacceptable to eat even if it is contains all you need. Now you just need to see why growing numbers of people think about eating not only fellow humans but fellow animals who are conscious, feel pain and suffer, especially the ones who grow up for consumption and suffer entire life tortured as unacceptable and you're all set. In addition there is another \"little problem\" with your argument and that is that humans don't eat through by absorbing stuff like some sort of amoeba. It goes through complex digestive process that extracts some stuff from other stuff. And a bunch of stuff a human body can/should synthesize. Remember healthy eating is also NOT getting stuff you don't need and synthesize. And if you find the closest thing to what's in your body, that'll be a whole lotta stuff you do not need. So no \"just pick what's the same as your body\" is not the most \"simple healthy meal\". On more than one level.

So I don't think we contradict each other here — I've heard you, and I understand your ethical position. > And a bunch of stuff a human body can/should synthesize You're 100% correct here, I am aware of that. For example, if you only eat meat, your body will synthesize glucose which it would be otherwise lacking (which technically means that meat does not contain the \"optimal amount\" of sugars). > Remember healthy eating is also NOT getting stuff you don't need and synthesize And also getting stuff that a body cannot synthesize enough.

The base dish is quite tasty to start with, but now I can afford to use a few nicer or speciality ingredients that take it up a level. If you're making a cauldron of risotto or tomato sauce or whatever that will yield dozens of servings, it doesn't cost that much more per serving to add the extra thing or perform the extra technique that makes it really delicious or interesting (and compensates for the fact you're freezing it).

Bonus is sardines are lower in mercury than bigger fish like tuna. - Goat cheese from Aldi - It's like $2/8oz there, my regular store is more than double that Then I pair it all up with toast. The toast part isn't very healthy, but it's cheap.

Our weekly groceries have doubled over the past 3-4 years but inflation is in the low single digits so what’s it measuring, exactly? The answer, of course, is “whatever the current administration wants it to.” reply mattnewton 16 hours agorootparentInflation is a tricky measure to understand intuitively because, as a rate of change it can compound faster than you think, and, as measured it is basically always a lagging number. 9-10% inflation compounding over 3-4 years is going to be nearly 50% increases in prices, and 100% in something like 7 I think. Official food inflation numbers put out by the US gov after Covid rocketed up to (a very unflattering) over 11% by mid 2022, and have only very recently gone back down to reasonable numbers, meaning you saw large increases in food prices that have only recently stopped increasing. (I don’t think the current administration would want to put out those numbers before the midterms if they were cooking the books). reply chii 12 hours agorootparentThey \"cook\" it by substitution of their basket of items - swapping steak for mince. It makes sense on the one hand, because it's actually what people do in real life, when things get expensive, they substitute. But the CPI measure doing the same means the quality of the basket dropped? reply roenxi 12 hours agorootparentThe situation is complex, but I suspect that is the mechanism that anchors inflation to wage inflation rather than monetary inflation. Prices are the signal for when something should be consumed less - so anything with a price rising faster than wage inflation tends to be downweighted and anything with a price rising slower than wage inflation is kept in the basket. If inflation tended to match to wage inflation then the scheme would be valid, but it doesn't. The newly printed money ends up unequally distributed over the economy, tending to end up with asset owners. I don't understand why people even pay attention to the CPI. There are direct measures of how much money is being created, we can all just use that rate instead. reply zahlman 11 hours agorootparent>I don't understand why people even pay attention to the CPI.

Because it's more obvious how one might try to use CPI to project future expenses. reply Isamu 15 hours agorootparentprevInflation is the change in the Consumer Price Index, calculated by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. They explain the difficulty in representing accurate cost of living: https://www.bls.gov/cpi/questions-and-answers.htm >The CPI frequently is called a cost-of-living index, but it differs in important ways from a complete cost-of-living measure. We use a cost-of-living framework in making practical decisions about questions that arise in constructing the CPI. A cost-of-living index is a conceptual measurement goal, however, and not a straightforward alternative to the CPI. A cost-of-living index would measure changes over time in the amount that consumers need to spend to reach a certain utility level or standard of living. Both the CPI and a cost-of-living index would reflect changes in the prices of goods and services, such as food and clothing that are directly purchased in the marketplace; but a complete cost-of-living index would go beyond this role to also take into account changes in other governmental or environmental factors that affect consumers' well-being. It is very difficult to determine the proper treatment of public goods, such as safety and education, and other broad concerns, such as health, water quality, and crime, that would constitute a complete cost-of-living framework. Since the CPI does not attempt to quantify all the factors that affect the cost-of-living, it is sometimes termed a conditional cost-of-living index. reply lxgr 15 hours agorootparentprev> what’s it measuring, exactly? Many things, the majority of which are not food. While I also find grocery prices in the US extremely bewildering/concerning (why are they so damn expensive!?), I think it does make some sense to benchmark more than just food. For example, consider a hypothetical world in which grocery prices doubled but cost of housing for some reason halved – would you say that that's high or low inflation? reply ryao 12 hours agorootparentprevI got tired of this so I started shopping at a local Aldi.

Of course the new administration will try to cook stats, hopefully the bureaucracy can resist them. Inflation measurements describe what they measure in detail. Food inflation isn't necessarily the same as overall inflation. reply npoc 8 hours agorootparentTrue inflation is money supply inflation. Doubling the amount of money (diluting the total value across more monetary units e.g. dollars), halves the value of each monetary unit, doubling prices. This is why hard assets, like gold, housing increase in price at approximately the same rate that the banks increase the money supply (historically the number of dollars doubles every decade, other currencies are even worse). If people saw the same increases in consumable prices as hard assets then they would be become aware of the falling value of the currency and the currency would quickly collapse in value as they stored their wealth in other things (hyper-inflation). However, the continuous optimisation of production through efficiencies of technology and associated automation means that consumables take less and less human time/effort to produce and so are going down in value at rate of around -5% year. This offsets the 7% devaluation of the dollar to give an overall price increase of consumables of 7-5 = 2% which is a level that the population finds acceptable without losing faith in their currency. However, in recent decades the recent struggle and failure to keep devaluation of the dollar at 7%/year means that the official inflation figures need to be massaged, and so hard assets are removed from the basket goods used in the algorithm (e.g. housing related costs) and more consumables that have benefited from increased automation and reduced value are added. If you run the algorithm used say 15 years ago, you'll find that it produces a much higher inflation figure than the one used today. reply polynomial 15 hours agorootparentprevConfirming that this is how bureaucracy works. reply Mountain_Skies 13 hours agorootparentprevThe outgoing administration claims food inflation was 0.3% over the last year.

Then a little more expensive when they have to come out of state and then super expensive when they're imported because they're out of season in the US generally.

So fooling an interrogator means having them choose the bot as human over an actual human, not just judging the bot to be human (while probably judging humans to be human even more frequently). When the interrogator is only answering \"do you think your conversation partner was a human?\" individually, bots can score fairly highly simply by giving little information in either direction - like pretending to be a non-english-speaking child, or sending very few messages. Whereas when pitted against a human, the bot is forced to give stronger or equally strong evidence of being human as the average human (over enough tests). To be chosen as human, giving 0 evidence becomes a bad strategy when the opponent (the real human) is likely giving some positive non-zero evidence towards their personhood. reply fastball 12 hours agoparentThat's not the original Turing test either. The original imitation game as proposed by Turing involves reading a text transcript of a human and a computer and having the evaluator determine which is which. The evaluator does not interact directly with the conversing parties. reply tripletao 11 hours agorootparentWhere are you getting that? Turing's most famous paper is just as Ukv describes. The link on that site doesn't work for me, but the reference is buried in their source: https://courses.cs.umbc.edu/471/papers/turing.pdf In Turing's test, the forced binary choice means P(human-judged-human) + P(machine-judged-human) is necessarily equal to 100%. This gives the 50% threshold clear intuitive and mathematical significance. In the bastardized test that GPT-4 \"passed\", that sum can be (and actually was) >100%. This makes the result practically impossible to interpret, since it depends on the interrogators' prior. The correct prior seems to be that it was human with p = 25%, though the paper doesn't say that explicitly, or say anything about what the interrogators were told. If the interrogators guessed mistakenly that it was 50% then that would lead them to systematically misjudge machines as humans, perhaps as observed. The bastardized test is pretty bad, but treating the 50% threshold as meaningful there is inexcusable. I see the preprint hasn't yet passed peer review, and I'll regain some faith in social science professors if it never does. Of course the credulous media coverage is everywhere already, including the LLM training sets--so regardless of whether LLMs can pass the Turing test, they now believe they do. reply fenomas 4 hours agorootparentI don't understand why debates like this crop up. The premise of Turing's paper is plainly stated - that asking questions about an \"Imitation Game\" is more useful than asking whether machines can think. That's all! He doesn't make any claim that the the game must be administered a particular way. In fact he spends only a few casual sentences glossing over how it would operate, and he's clearly just conveying the idea in broad strokes, not trying to describe an experimental procedure. And he says nothing at all about how the results might be judged, let alone thresholds for anything. The paper is about what sorts of questions we should examine, not about specifically how they should be examined. So it seems weird to consider a test \"bastardized\" just because it doesn't match how you interpret Turing's casual description. reply foldr 6 hours agorootparentprevIt’s interesting that even though you link to the original paper, you still repeat a very common incorrect summary of the task. The interrogator is not required to judge which of A or B is human, they are required to judge which is a woman on the implicit (though incorrect, in the case of interest) assumption that A and B are both human. While this amounts to more or less the same thing, it’s an interesting nuance that’s often lost in summaries of the task. It would not, for example, make sense for the interrogator to ask A or B whether or not they are human (even on the naive assumption that they’d receive a true answer), as they are working on the assumption that both are human. Hence why Turing’s initial example questions are about hair length and gender, not humanness. To be fair, even Turing himself seems to imagine the interrogator trying to judge humanness rather than gender in subsequent parts of the paper. It’s unclear to me why exactly his initial framing of the task introduces this additional element of complexity. reply fenomas 4 hours agorootparentThis gets brought up a lot, but it seems to me like a simple misreading. Turing describes an initial game with a man (A) and a woman (B), where A's goal is to imitate B, and then asks: \"what will happen if a machine takes the place of A?\" I suppose it's possible that he meant the machine takes A's place by imitating a woman, but it's a lot more plausible that he meant the machine takes A's place by imitating B, i.e. a person. Also there are several quotes later on that make no sense under your reading - check out the quotes including \"imitation of the behaviour of a man\" and \"the part of B being taken by a man\". Those quotes (maybe others, I didn't look) only make sense if the game is for the machine to imitate a person, not a woman. reply foldr 3 hours agorootparentI agree with your last paragraph (see my last paragraph). But I think the most natural reading of the initial task description is that the machine also pretends to be a woman. The line “we do not wish to penalize a machine for being unable to shine in beauty competitions” supports this interpretation, given that a beauty competition is an event for women, under the assumptions of the time. So I think there are conflicting cues in the paper as to the intended interpretation. As you say in your other comment, though, I don’t think Turing thought the exact details of the game were important - which explains why he didn’t trouble to spell them out very exactly. If I had to guess, I’d say that Turing assumes that as the machine has no gender, the only relevant difference between the machine and the woman is that one is human and one is not. So for the rest of the paper he focuses on that difference and is vague on the gendered aspect of the task. reply fenomas 3 hours agorootparentUm. I follow you but that's a pretty huge stretch, considering that nothing in the paper is inconsistent with the conventional reading (that the machine is to imitate a person). There are sentences that are consistent with other readings, but none that's inconsistent with the usual one. reply foldr 3 hours agorootparentThe machine is imitating a person on both understandings of the task. The difference lies in C’s task (whether C is trying to find which of A and B is a woman and which is a man, or trying to find which is human and which is a machine). I think the initial description of the task is genuinely ambiguous. Your interpretation of it hadn’t occurred to me before, but I do see it now. I still think that “…when a machine takes the part of A in this game…” is most naturally interpreted as leaving the task unaltered but for the man being replaced by a machine, rather than implicitly describing the task mutadis mutandis. But reasonable people can certainly differ on such questions of interpretation. Honestly I think Turing’s whole framing of the task is unnecessarily elaborate and confusing. Why even bother describing the man/woman task to begin with? I am not sure. Popular descriptions of the ‘Turing Test’ don’t seem to find this framing of any expositionary value. reply fenomas 59 minutes agorootparentI think the point of the man/woman version of the game is that it lets Turing propose his question in relative terms. He doesn't ask \"can the machine fool somebody N% of the time?\" (as several in this thread imagine), but rather \"can the machine fool somebody as often as one person fools another under similar conditions?\". > Your interpretation of it hadn’t occurred to me before, The idea of a Turing Test is pretty widely understood to mean a test where a person guesses which responses come from a machine, not where they guess someone's gender. So my interpretation here is just that the paper says what most people think it says. reply foldr 43 minutes agorootparentSorry, I am being ambiguous myself. I meant that your interpretation of this specific sentence had not occurred to me: > We now ask the question, \"What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this game?\" I think you are right about what Turing meant. But it had honestly never occurred to me before that this description of the game could be understood as a description of the standard 'Turing test'. So, for this reason, I had always been sympathetic to the point that the standard Turing test does not appear to be the test that Turing describes in the original paper. Here is a paper that makes your case, in case anyone finds it interesting. https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gualtiero-Piccinini/pub... reply d0mine 6 hours agorootparentprevThe original Turing game is whether machine can pretend to be a woman better than a man can (via teletype) as judged by an interrogator: > We now ask the question, \"What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this game?\" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace our original, \"Can machines think?” https://courses.cs.umbc.edu/471/papers/turing.pdf reply Ukv 2 hours agorootparent\"Man pretending to be woman vs real woman\" was just an example used to introduce the question in the form of a party game between humans before moving onto the actual question of a machine pretending to be human vs a real human. At a stretch, by looking at only your quoted snippet you could read that the machine is pretending to be a woman - but that interpretation is not consistent with the rest of the paper. For instance, \"the best strategy [for the machine] is to try to provide answers that would naturally be given by a man\". reply silisili 13 hours agoparentprevI'm skeptical on the claim.

Most of them, if you prompt them right, for that specific problem.

Yes, though also each model's origins give a different idea of what counts as \"horribly offensive\". I'm thinking mainly because the Chinese models don't want to talk about Tiananmen Square as I've not tried grok (how does grok cope with trans/cis-gender as concepts? I know Musk doesn't, but it would be speculation to project that assumption onto the AI). > Their response is always very inhuman, probably due to lack of emotional energy. This, specifically, can also be faked fairly well with the right prompt. Tell ChatGPT to act like a human with clinical depression, and it does… at least by American *memetic* standards of what that means.

Not necessarily. Get a human to solve ARC-AGI if the problems are shown as a string. They'll perform badly. But that doesn't mean that humans can't reason. It means that human reasoning doesn't have access to the non-reasoning building blocks it needs (things like concepts, words, or in this case: spatially local and useful visual representations). Humans have good resolution-invariant visual perception. For example, take an ARC-AGI problem, and for each square, duplicate it a few times, increasing its resolution from X*X to 2X*2X. To a human, the problem will be almost exactly equally difficulty. Not for LLMs that have to deal with 4x as much context. Maybe for an LLM if it can somehow reason over the output of a CNN, and if it was trained to do that like how humans are built to do that. reply refulgentis 13 hours agorootparentExcellent point, I'm not sure people are aware, but these are straight-up lifted from standard IQ tests, so they're definitely not all trivially humanly solvable.

There were genuine concerns that the residents of Ottawa were ready to take matters into their own hands, and it would be a bloodbath. Not to mention the blockade in Alberta where they were found with guns and a pipe bomb, with their communications indicating they were planning to murder the RCMP officers on site! Declaring the Emergency acts was overwhelmingly popular in Canada and remains one of the most popular things Trudeau ever did.

That Act,similar in many ways to the Patriot Act 35 years later in the US, suspended civil liberties under the pretext of a terrorist danger. (The alleged danger at the time was a Quebec group later revealed to be infiltrated by the RCMP, the Canadian secret police.) Twelve communist bookstores in Quebec (unrelated to the terrorists) were burned down by police; several political activists from various groups across Canada were incarcerated in mental hospitals, etc. etc. I publicly opposed the consolidation of this fascist law, both in the university senate and in public demonstrations.

And now we'll curtail the rights of people who absolutely do NOT deserve it. The lurch to the right is deeply inspired by attitudes like this. We even have the Premier of Alberta claiming that unvaccinated people are \"the most discriminated against group in history\", which, whatever \"side\" of the vaccination \"debate\" you fall on, you know is an unbelievably stupid thing to say.

It was bad. We had a young kid and didn't feel even safe walking her to a park, because the route crossed over convoy lines and there were all sorts of stories of harassment and assaults. We didn't even experience the worst of it; lots of people dealt with truck horns blaring 24/7, but at least our street at least was kept clear as an emergency route. We put up with the occupation for about two weeks, but we saw a steady escalation and decided to leave town. We stayed with family for two weeks until the convoy was cleared. I'm very proud of the residents who were brave enough to put up a resistance (the so-called \"Battle of Billings Bridge\"), and I'm appalled by the response by the local police and the province.

According to that logic, the protestors during the Oka Crisis should've just been arrested, stripped of their rights and treated like non citizens since they were armed and threatened the police.

Especially when you, in the same sentence, also recognize that you don't follow Canadian politics? reply bryanlarsen 1 hour agoparentprevThe federal response was largely due to the abject failure of the city & provincial governments to enforce their laws. The city and province had plenty of tools to get rid of the protesters: noise bylaws, parking bylaws, et cetera. They failed completely, so the Federal government was forced to intervene. The federal government did not have nuanced tools to deal with the truckers so used the blunt hammers they did have. reply glitchc 30 minutes agorootparentThat's basically what happened. Between the three police forces, the jurisdiction was unclear. Parliamentary police and city police could not decide which laws to enforce as it depended on where the protestors were located. The province mostly polices highways and small townships that cannot afford their own police force. They quickly regained control of the highways to divert any additional incoming trucks but couldn't step in within city limits for trucks that were already there. reply loceng 53 minutes agorootparentprevWrong. It took TWO Ottawa police chief resignations before a 3rd police chief was willing to make illegal orders against the peaceful protestors.

Which group is tolerated largely depends on your political alignment. bryanlarsen 21 minutes agorootparentprevIt's quite clear what the limits are for protests in Ottawa. There are dozens to hundreds of protesters in Ottawa continuously. There are regularly protests of thousands of people. If you want to block the road, you get a parade permit which is easy to get. You can shout as long as you want, but if you use an amplifier the police will eventually take it away from you. You can carry obnoxious signs. Blocked roads because of protests are an annoying fact of life in Ottawa. But you shrug and move on, it's a cost of living/working in downtown Ottawa. I've never seen a protest block the road for more than 4 hours. reply tensor 25 minutes agorootparentprevYes, they harassed people, they cornered people, yes they restricted access to stores, buildings, and yes they used their truck horns to attack local residents by preventing them being able to sleep for days on end.

This absolutely constitutes behavior that's a danger to our nation so it makes sense to freeze the accounts of the people doing it. To be clear, there were many attempts to settle this without freezing people's bank accounts, but when nothing else works sometimes you have to get out the big guns. reply ungreased0675 8 minutes agorootparentThat logic seems like it would outlaw labor strikes too, especially in important industries. Sometimes, holding the economy hostage is the point. I take exception to the framing of “attempts to settle this.” The government used violence and threat of violence to make the problem go away. There wasn’t an attempt at compromise. Do what I say or else isn’t an attempt to settle. reply eastbound 42 minutes agorootparentprev> effectively holding our economy hostage This is what a protest is. (French here). If protesters go as far, and in Canada it was because you did them dirty, then you must sit at a table and negotiate. You must sit at a table and negotiate with everyone in a country. You cannot do someone dirty then complain that they protest. It’s effects removing the right to protest, and therefore, removing democracy itself. Go live in Singapore? reply adamc 0 minutes agorootparentNot a Canadian, but no, a protest protests and gives voice to the disagreement. Blocking other people's rights is not just a protest and is likely to trigger action to protect others. That's how it goes everywhere that has rights. Normally, some effort is made to do it peacefully, but there are no countries where you can halt the economy whenever you want to force people to negotiate with you. throw0101d 5 minutes agorootparentprev> This is what a protest is. They became occupiers when they started living in their trucks. There is no right to occupy in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. If they had slow-rolled their trucks to create traffic jams that is a protest (but also generally illegal, e.g., Ontario Highway Traffic Act §132), and would have been quite another thing. If you don't like what the government is doing elect a new government: that's what elections are for. You don't get to throw a hissy fit and mess up other people's lives and livelihood every time there's a decision you don't like.

I don't consider this a serious perspective though. reply vlovich123 24 minutes agorootparentI don’t think it’s terrorism but that’s not why the back accounts were frozen. The people involved with noise pollution should definitely have been handed significant fines and escalating punishments similar to anyone violating noise ordinances. It gets trickier since these actions are in support of a larger organized effort but that should be the minimum punishment. The terrorism aspect comes from shutting down trade on a hugely important trade route with our largest trading partner, holding the economy hostage to make demands of the government. That by itself isn’t terrorism per se but the legitimate threats to use violence to keep the embargo going fits the textbook definition of terrorism, using violence or threats of violence to achieve political goals. reply bryanlarsen 10 minutes agorootparentprevWho has called the truck horns terrorism?

The two main fumbles I can see of note are on housing and immigration. On immigration the government only made remarkable changes in the last two years, and as if they touched a hot stove, they already realized their mistake and have already scaled back immigration numbers so much that Canada will effectively have nil immigration for the near future. Not likely a generational issue here. On housing well I agree it'll take a generation to fix it but that was already the case before the Liberals took power. Very much an example of the future is already here but not yet distributed as Toronto and Vancouver were already experiencing a housing crisis in 2014. Less an issue of what the libs actively did wrong but more an issue of how slow they were to act on the fact that Canada has had bad housing policy since the 1990s and few jurisdictions are taking things seriously. Fed housing policy at this instant is actually pretty good in that it is mirroring and supporting the good BC NDP housing policy.

In many countries, you see a centre politician do some very normal thing that gets disingenuous outrage from the right solely with the intention (and effect) of dragging the Overton window over.

On the whole, no. whoknowsidont 22 minutes agorootparentprevBeing \"hyperbolic\" is putting it generously. reply toasteros 35 minutes agorootparentprevNo, because Canada is not \"ruined\" or \"damaged\". The ONE dreadful thing the Liberals did was to renege on their promise of electoral reform. All Westminster-style Parliaments are done a disservice by using First-past-the-post. Trudeau campaigned on replacing the system with proportional representation, but incumbents in Westminster governments will never change the system that made them win. Most people turn to the Carbon Tax as an example, but the Carbon Tax is implemented in such a way that the average family receives MORE in quarterly rebates than what they PAY in Carbon taxes; it's only those with very high incomes who come close to losing money from the tax[1]. Then they'll point to the pandemic and tell you that the worst thing we've ever done as a nation is ask people to get vaccinated and wear a mask during a time where a (not actually) unprecedented virus was rampant. And somehow the virus is the incumbent's fault. After that you'll be told that healthcare is crumbling under Trudeau. Healthcare in Canada is a provincial responsibility, and the vast majority of provinces (eg Alberta) are run by right-wing governments looking to profit from private healthcare, so are employing a starve-the-beast strategy to make private healthcare look attractive. And then some particularly weird people will tell you he isn't tough enough on trans people. [1]: https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/axe-the-tax-and-carbo... reply Dakizhu 7 minutes agorootparentWhat’s dreadful is the rising cost of living and lack of affordable housing, which he failed to address. Moreover he doubled immigration during a time when the average Canadian was struggling to keep up with rising expenses. I’m pro-immigration but not at an unsustainable rate. Housing construction was not keeping up. Trudeau pushed beyond the limits of pro-immigration policy. If it was just conservative propaganda, the liberals wouldn’t be looking at a potentially historic election loss based on current polling. That said, I don’t think conservatives will fix anything. reply toasteros 0 minutes agorootparentThe immigration system we use today was set up by Harper. I'm an immigrant myself, having moved here on a Harper scheme, but under Trudeau. You are absolutely right that this wasn't addressed by the current government, but it is a policy of the previous one. The only reason he alone is being blamed is because he happened to be in charge for a very long time. It is likely to remain unaddressed satisfactorily under PP, too, since landlords benefit from immigration (especially high turnover immigration) and his primary interest is landlords and business owners. This is a symptom of FPTP-based Westminster governments. If we had a more equitable electoral system, the blame can be more appropriately distributed and - even better - the issues can be addressed more efficiently.

Both the opposition Conservatives and the supporting NDP parties (NDP in particular was holding up the Liberal Minority Govt) have been planning non-confidence motions this month that would result in a new election. There was no path to victory for Trudeau after that, so the next best move is to resign and hope the liberals can pick a new leader before the next electoral cycle is too far along and avoid the issue the Democrats had by rushing to select a replacement candidate and alienating some portion of voters by doing so. reply darrylb42 2 hours agoparentprevYes, once they can not lead their party effectively they will usually resign. It has been building to this over the last month or so. reply vivekd 2 hours agoparentprevThis was definitely expected, people within and outside of the party have been calling for Trudeau to resign for a while and that chorus has been getting louder and picking up more prominent figures. I suppose standard procedure in a Westminster parliament is to have a non confidence vote and an election - which is what the opposition parties said would happen when Parliament sits again. Poroguing parliament and having a leadership race is probably a way to try and avoid that or at least go into the election with a less unpopular leader. Proguing parliament is probably the best thing for the liberal party to avoid an election with an unpopular leader. But I don't think it's good for Canada as it states down Trump's tariffs reply gspencley 2 hours agoparentprevCanadian here. It's certainly not normal. News broke yesterday that this was coming. The opposition kept tabling no confidence votes and trying to get an early election called... and Trudeau's approval rating is so low that it might even be the lowest of any Prime Minister in history (though I don't know so if someone does by all means fact check that). However, our upcoming election is this year. It certainly does not surprise me that Trudeau is stepping down from leader of the Liberal party in light of the polling, since the polls are predicting that if an election were called today, the conservatives would win in such a landslide that I don't think many countries have even seen that before. Of course polling and actual election results are two very different things... but I think the Liberal party sees the writing on the wall. If they hope to have any shot of getting re-elected, they can't do it with Trudeau at the head. ... but that doesn't necessarily mean that we all saw him resigning as PM incumbent coming. He's also proroguing parliament until March. This is probably a move to get the other parties to step back and \"STFU\"; to not pass any motions during the party shift (particularly related to calling an early election etc). Lastly, as others have said, the PM position is usually held for an average of 9-10 years (and that's multiple terms .. most incumbents just get re-elected into second and third terms). Trudeau was elected in 2015 so he's about due to exit anyway if we go by averages (though some have served longer). reply seanmcdirmid 58 minutes agorootparent1% below Stephen Harper, which is bad, but not unprecedented bad.

Right now it is purely being used to prevent such a vote since there is a majority in parliament that would now vote against the government in such a situation, which in turn provokes an election. During his delusional ramblings (and that is no exaggeration) Trudeau said that the GG was persuaded to prorogue to the 25th March because of the no confidence vote held back in December which he survived because the NDP supported him.

The sharp turn away from classic liberalism towards authoritarianism, with encroachment on free speech, gun rights, and other freedoms - especially as seen during the height of the COVID pandemic - has been deeply concerning.

And he has relied on the vote banks of groups that shouldn’t be dictating Canadian politics, like Khalistan supporters (an insurrectionist terrorist movement).

One of these is more drastic than the other. reply usrusr 1 hour agorootparentprevTrue. And I believe every system will eventually be gamed to some amount. You do occasionally need change. But if you were to artificially enforce some \"full rewrite\" reform e.g. every n decades, that reform would just end up a tug of war between sides already deep into the existing gaming, trying to increase the effect of whatever tactic their side excels in. One candidate for a possible workaround that I've occasionally been speculating about would be an organized process where n groups are tasked with doing n \"rewrites\" in parallel, and then a process that somehow mixes approval and random selection to pick one. The rationale would be the hope that the low chance of a particular rewrite actually making it would add some distance, would reduce the gaming-the-system incentives. Everybody has some amount of motivation to actually design a fair system, but that's competing with incentive to make it gameable by whatever side the co-author in question is on. But that fairness incentive would not really be diminished much by writing a what-if instead of a definitive future, whereas the incentive to deliberately flaw the would-be system to make it easier to game gets lower with a shrinking likelihood of the proposal actually getting implemented. reply LanceJones 2 hours agoparentprevWho is \"us\"? reply karmasimida 2 hours agorootparentYeah that is a good question to OP The predicted conservative win if the election happens right away, would be a landslide in every sense of that word reply tensor 13 minutes agorootparentNo, it would be a landslide only in one sense, the first past the post sense.

Do they really lack the imagination to understand why this is a feature, not a bug in IRV? IRV, though imperfect, is so clearly superior to one candidate voting if the goal is a responsive democracy. Unfortunately, there are many people who don't want that. IRV closes a loophole for extreme candidates (I have a strong suspicion that the 2016 djt campaign would have been thwarted by IRV had the gop primary used it). It also allows partially aligned challengers to pressure incumbents without dividing the electorate. This would likely be better for the challenger and the incumbent. Consider this past election where Jill Stein was demonized as a spoiler, which she potentially was, but would not have been in ranked choice. I bet there are a lot of voters who would have rather voted for Jill Stein but instead cast their vote for a candidate whom they thought could win (including candidates who received what should have been Jill Stein votes and thus lost important information about what matters to their voters).

My https://llm.datasette.io projects gives me the ideal playground for trying stuff out - any time a new API model comes out I can spin up a new plugin to for LLM, which is a great way to try the model with limited development time (most API plugins are a few dozen lines of code).

I'd say that's the most \"13-year-old in the 2000s\" nick ever, but that honor probably goes to xXSephiroth666Xx. Yours is up there though. Eric S. Raymond recently posted some xeets about how retrocomputing nostalgia is due, in part, to wistfulness for the Cambrian explosion in personal computers, where every little two-bit company comes up with their own wildly different design. The design space hadn't been fully explored yet, and the future seemed pregnant with endless possibility. Then as people figured out what worked and what didn't in the computer design space, the PC sorta won, and it made much more sense to build a PC clone and take advantage of the huge PC hardware and software ecosystem. Raymond predicts that a similar coalescing on proven designs will happen with 3D printers. Of course, ESR believes in the need for government slightly less than he believes in the need for redemption through the blood of Christ the Saviour, so he overlooks a critical forcing factor in this cycle of exploring the solution space followed by settling on proven designs: regulation. Cars were much cooler before the 1970s because the Clean Air Act was passed in the 1970s. There was an initial struggle period during which American autos shipped with anemic engines and features designed to compensate for lack of performance, until technologies like fuel injection became the norm, but again the automakers coalesced into a set of a few designs that both worked and fulfilled the obligations imposed by regulatory bodies... to the point where it's awful hard to tell a Toyota RAV-4 from a Honda CR-V just by looking. I think the internet has gone through a similar exploratory vs. coalescing phase. Back in the 90s and 2000s, HTML and PHP let you create anything, so people created everything. And threw it up on a server, and it was wonderful. So many individual corners of the web with their authors' own perspectives. Now... well, regulation is definitely coming but in the meantime there are things with the force of regulatory bodies you have to worry about. You HAVE to do https which means you need a certificate. You HAVE to have a CDN and CloudFlare protection or else you'll be slashdot-effected or DDoS'd to oblivion. You can't even run an email server anymore without jumping through the hoops it takes to convince major providers you're not a spam farm. These are things you have to either think about yourself or pay someone to think about them for you. So the web has coalesced on a few best-practice designs and service providers. And most people just set up Wix or Shopify pages or Facebook groups anyway. And that's why the 90s/2000s web has such nostalgic power. We could do anything from our armchairs with a bit of HTML and maybe some programming and sysadmin skills. But those days are gone. Maybe we're better off for it. reply toast0 13 hours agorootparent> You HAVE to do https which means you need a certificate. This is kind of true, but, getting a cert isn't a big deal anymore.

There are some projects trying to solve this: OpenRAN, OpenAirInterface, O-RAN Alliance. This project tries to build an open solution following O-RAN standards for RAN software. It is targeting telecom. companies for their Radio Access Network (RAN). Their infrastructure is divided into the Core Network (like a simple internet network) and the Radio Access Network (base stations, antennas and all that stuff). Phones and tablets are User Equipment (UE), nothing to do with srsRAN. reply femto 13 hours agorootparentComplex: yes Proprietary, Closed Standards: no Here are all the 3GPP 4G/5G standards that govern cellular phone networks: https://www.3gpp.org/specifications-technologies Also look under the \"Specifications\" drop down menu at the top of the page. Every release is listed. These standards being freely available is why SRS were able to write srsRAN. There is nothing stopping others from doing so either, apart from the amount of information that has to be understood and digested. Edit: Apart from complexity the other potential barrier is patents, but that's not a technical barrier. reply advael 10 hours agorootparentWhile it's technically true that the specs are public, the implementation not being public is most of the issue being solved reply kurokawad 5 hours agorootparentprevThe 3GPP spec is “available”, but the implementation in practice is closed. Stuff like the scheduler is what actually brings value to the company delivering a good service. Being closed, the interoperability of network components from different vendors is just impossible. That’s the point of O-RAN Alliance. reply miki123211 6 hours agorootparentprevApart from complexity and patents, the other other barrier is licensing. Those technologies aren't terribly useful to use in your house like WiFi is, and even if they were, you need more government paperwork to do it. That means less hobbyist interest. reply blacklion 3 hours agorootparentprevPatents equal proprietary. reply leidenfrost 14 hours agorootparentprevWhy can't I create an ad hoc 4/5g network between phones? Genuine question. It looks so closed and complex compared to more traditional comms like wifi or even ethernet. reply femto 13 hours agorootparentThe LTE protocol is asymmetric between towers (eNodeB) and phones (UE). You could build srsRAN and run a local eNodeB instance to form a local LTE network. Given that it has a radio that operates in the LTE bands, in theory you might be able to build srsRAN for a phone and run the necessary base station software (eNodeB and EPC) on a phone to form an \"ad hoc\" network. It wouldn't be truly ad hoc in that the network would still have a base station, just that it would be running on phone hardware. srsRAN wouldn't be running as an application, but would be replacing the firmware in the phone's LTE modem. Edit: Here is a paper by someone who has built an ad hoc LTE network. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.09262 It does exactly the above: using srsRAN (which used to be called srsLTE) to run local base station software (eNodeB+EPC) to get around the asymmetry in the LTE protocol. reply solarboii 3 hours agorootparentprevIt's complexity is not completely unnecessary. Scale is a huge bitch. Networking between phones, without a common base station, is hard. Harder than WI-FI, because identity is managed centrally and the frecs in use require a license to name some \"simple\" problems. Cellular comms are not designed to handle this kind of scenario. There has been some work to add inter device connectivity lately, to support many interesting use cases. You can find more looking for \"sidelink\" or \"PC5\", but you will not find many phones that implement it. It seems to be mostly focused in vehicular use cases in V2V and V2X scenarios reply kurokawad 5 hours agorootparentprevAFAIK cellular comms aren’t designed to be ad hoc. They require base stations (whose placement is very studied) to build coverage “cells” (cellular). The network is responsible of delivering a QoS, it’s not a best-effort like WiFi. However, if I’m not mistaken 5G has V2V comms (Vehicle to Vehicle) specifically designed for self-driving cars, drones and IoT and that is the most “ad hoc” it can get reply bsder 13 hours agorootparentprev> Why can't I create an ad hoc 4/5g network between phones?

You can turn your phone on anywhere and it'll work. You can have a call/data session while travelling hundreds of miles and it'll work (usually). reply rusk 4 hours agorootparentWhat you suggest could be accomplished with mesh networking. GP is correct in saying the reasons are orthogonal to functional reasons. Phone systems have always been centralised like this. Billing is one aspect, but lawful surveillance is another. reply pgorczak 4 hours agorootparentThey are not entirely orthogonal. You need a central base station with scheduling, high dynamic range and power control to maximize performance in an OFDM system. In addition, most cells used to use frequency division multiplexing meaning that the base station and phones send and receive on different frequencies. So lack of point to point capabilities can at least in part be explained by the design goal of optimizing for throughput and user density. reply mytailorisrich 4 hours agorootparentprevWith respect, if you think that mesh networking would have worked considering the scale and capacity needed, and relevant type of devices then I am afraid this is a case of not knowing what you don't know... reply throw5959 15 minutes agorootparentHow do you solve cross talk in congested areas?

There is no reason why you cant have a software modem aka Icera that was acquired by Nvidia in the early 10s. And there are no modem monopoly by Qualcomm which is common misconception across all the threads on HN and wider internet. MediaTek, Samsung, Huawei, Spreadtrum and a few others have been shipping 4G / 5G Modem on the market for years. The only reason why Apple hasn't released a modem 6 years after they acquired the modem asset from Intel is because having a decent modem, performance / watt comparatively to what on market is Hard. Insanely hard. You have Telecoms from top 50 market each with slightly different hardware software spectrum combination and scenario along with different climate and terrains. It took Mediatek and Samsung years with lots of testing and real world usage at the lower end phone to gain valuable insight.

The CCP effectively told Qualcomm to get lost in 2015 and Taiwan settled an antitrust agreement between them and MediaTek in 2018, so MediaTek, Huawei, and Unisoc/Spreadtrum are not good examples here.

It’s not only insanely long and complicated but there’s a nasty path dependency with most of 4G which is why Intel and now Apple have such a hard time getting their radios to the finish line. Poaching a few Qualcomm or Broadcom employees with better salaries is one thing but without the cumulative expertise contained within the companies, it’s almost impossible to bootstrap a new radio. reply mschuster91 4 hours agoparentprev> Apple has been working on a 5G modem for what feels like a billion years, but other standards seem to be more democratized. The main problem is the sheer age of mobile phone networks. A phone has to support everything from top-modern 5G down to 2G to be usable across the world, that's almost as much garbage that a baseband/modem FW/HW has to drag along as Intel has to with the x86 architecture. And if that isn't complex enough, phones have to be able to deal with quirks of all kinds of misbehaving devices - RF is shared media after all, and there's devices not complying with the standard, the standards containing ambiguous or undefined behavior specs, completely third-party services blasting wholly incompatible signals around (e.g. DVB-T operates on frequencies in some countries that are used for phone service in other countries, and often on much much higher TX power than phone tower sites). If it can't handle that or, worse, disrupts other legitimate RF users, certification won't be possible. But that experience in dealing with about 35 years worth of history is just one part of the secret sauce - that just makes the costs of entry for FOSS projects really huge (which is why all of these projects I'm aware of support only 4G and afterwards since that generation is the first one to throw away all the legacy garbage). The other part of why there are so few vendors is patents, and there is a toooooon of patent holders for 5G [1], with the top holders being either Chinese or known for being excessively litigious (Qualcomm). And even assuming you manage to work out deals with all of the patent holders (because of course there is, to my knowledge at least, no \"one stop shop\" compared to say MPEG), you still have to get a design that fulfills your requirements for raw performance, can coexist peacefully with almost all other users of the RF spectrum to be power efficient at the same time. That is the main challenge for Apple IMHO - they have a lot of experience doing that with \"classic\" SoCs, but almost none for RF hardware, virtually all of that comes from external vendors.

It looks like there is a “fight” with telecom guys trying to license 6GHz for 5G and others fighting for it to be unlicensed. Interesting to see that countries are tilting towards unlicensing even with strong lobbying of telecoms reply AnarchismIsCool 17 hours agoprevIt's always amazing to me how reluctant everyone is to grant ISM bandwidth. If you watch a spectrum analyzer you'll immediately notice that the ISM bands are packed and licensed space is entirely empty. At this point with devices being both much more dynamic and much more spatially multiplexed (and more directional) I have a hard time accepting arguments that really anything from DC to daylight should be licensed at this point outside of a few very small niches (GPS and airband mostly). We should be gradually deprecating equipment that requires absolute band exclusion to operate because just slicing up spectrum is by far the least efficient way of utilizing a finite resource. It's also worth pointing out that we're about to lose about half of one of our ISM bands (915MHz, LoRa, Meshtastic, ELRS, various smart home protocols etc) due to the lovely folks at NextNav wanting dedicated bandwidth for a paywalled GPS alternative. It's by far the best ISM band in the US for long range unlicensed communications due to being in a sweet spot of path loss, penetration, and bandwidth. reply Y_Y 13 hours agoparentIn case you're confused like me, here ISM refers to Industrial, Scientific, Medical[0]. I was trying to figure out why it was relevant to transmit these signals in the interstellar medium. [0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_radio_band reply fellerts 10 hours agoparentprevRelated to your second point: \"FCC seek comments on NextNav petition for rulemaking on lower 900MHz ISM band\" (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41226802). No, we are not about to lose the band, FCC is still deliberating. The rest of the industry is pushing back. reply rkangel 6 hours agoparentprevI agree that there needs to be more ISM bands, but I don't agree that licencing bands is niche at all. The bands owned by Cellular providers are not entirely empty at all, in fact they're very well utilised. It is much easier to make efficient use of spectrum when you can plan it properly, and when there is only one system making allocation decisions (e.g. TDMA/FDMA). Collision based systems (like Wifi) have an efficiency cost. reply AnarchismIsCool 19 minutes agorootparentI was trying to keep the point simple, but realistically I'm not advocating for complete chaos, there will probably still have to be allocations, ie \"Please don't key up your baofeng in the middle of a cell channel\". Equipment will probably always be band specific to an extent, the bands are just widening with technological progress. The issue is that spectrum auctions are probably the least efficient and equitable way of distributing allocations available. There isn't a standard unit conversion between utility in dollars and bandwidth in Hz. There are individuals with enough money that they could buy their own national spectrum allocations just for their personal use alone. That said, there are ways to maintain efficiency. TDMA can still be implemented in a distributed fashion using GPS or device collaboration, we just didn't do it with wifi because it would have been cost prohibitive 20 years ago. For the sake of argument, a naive approach would be to generate a UTM grid square based on a fraction of some maximum reasonable wifi footprint, then the system in that grid would get a frequency allocation, and everything within that grid would time sync and TDMA on that frequency. Neighboring cells would get a different frequency and devices 2-3 cells over could start reusing frequencies. Obviously this doesn't work in an apartment high-rise but that's fixable. reply pjc50 9 hours agoparentprev> amazing to me how reluctant everyone is to grant ISM bandwidth > dedicated bandwidth for a paywalled GPS alternative. I think you've answered your own question here; especially if I look at the huge prices paid in spectrum auctions in the UK and Europe some years ago. Spectrum is an asset, so there's strong pressure to turn it into property that can be charged for rather than let the public use it. reply stefan_ 5 hours agorootparentIf only people wouldn't then turn around and tell us how amazing spectrum auctions are, what a novel great application of economics. In practice it has all the hallmarks of a failed market; most bits travel over WiFi, money ends up in slush funds, coverage is hopeless, large parts of spectrum are allocated to governmental incumbents who want to keep running 50s tech. reply ggm 17 hours agoparentprevYou don't buy exclusivity for emergency services? What if a local congestion event degrades signal to the extent things stop working? This also demands all of the volunteer fire and emergency and rural fire and emergency recapitalise their radio investment. I would worry the exact thing that causes this is mass widespread \"get online and check on aunty jennie\" flash mob effects when emergency comms is most needful. I am probably putting up some FUD argument here. But, I think this should be a contestable line of reasoning. I'd like to hear from some hams, or other spectrum users before I got with this. (I am neither, cell and wifi aside) reply CobrastanJorji 15 hours agorootparentI think that reserving bands for meteorology, Radio navigation, radio location, critical services (maritime mobile, time signal), science (space research), amateur radio, and microwaves is a very good idea. But if you were to redesign the allocations from scratch with modern technology, you could probably clear up a whole lot of spectrum. reply jychang 9 hours agorootparentOn the other hand, how bad is congestion in practice anyways? Sure it's congested, but rarely to the point where it's unusable. I don't think we need to clear out all of the spectrum from 100khz to 100ghz. If we doubled unlicensed spectrum around 2.4ghz, 5ghz, and 6ghz, we'd solve 90% of our congestion issues at the cost of barely any spectrum. Overhauling the entire electromagnetic spectrum allocations would cost millions of dollars of replacing devices; just throwing a bit more at wifi bands would cheaply solve most issues. reply lazide 5 hours agorootparentDefine ‘unusable’? If you assume it’s a smooth degradation where it goes from 50MB/s to 100kb/s, yeah, that’s rare. It is often ‘nothing at all’ for a second or two. And that is unusable for a lot of things. Or at least infuriating. reply fukawi2 15 hours agorootparentprevWe just got a whole bunch of new radios for fire brigade in our state. Every radio has a SIM and fails over to the public cell network if the primary (licensed) network is unavailable. Which ironically is one of the first networks to fail when we have widespread storms etc. reply deelowe 6 hours agorootparentCould the idea be to use satellite cellular as that becomes more commonplace? reply lazide 5 hours agorootparentThe cell network is much more reliable than typical emergency comms, especially when you factor in ‘radio shadows’, etc. Or at least will be out at different times/ways. Oh, unless there is a major disaster, but those are rare. A lot of money goes into building the cell network. reply aziaziazi 11 hours agorootparentprev> get online and check on aunty jennie I wonder if it's still an issue: checking aunt Jennie with text or audio is nowhere comparable in terms of data to checking 2K video news or scrolling tiktok for FOMO. Yes there was cutoffs during mass events in 2010', our 2g/3g infra couldn't keep up with people calling each others, and sure the network is faster now. However the next WTC will be another level if we all live-video check aunty Jenny. It seems way too few people understand (as other said) the bandwidth is not an infinite ressource. And don't start me with ads bloating most website rendering them unusable on a low speed network. I have the chance to live in Europe and the cookie banner is a neat warning of a cumbersome website. We used to do check news with channels' cable TV and radio (grandpa' grumble) and there was no \"network problem\". reply fweimer 8 hours agorootparentprevI have some doubts about the efficacy of spectrum allocated per device class/manufacturer. This in itself is not a congestion management mechanism, although some vendors probably treat it as such. The majority of applications probably benefits from more available spectrum and cheaper devices based on COTS components. Spectrum dedicated to individual users in specific areas is a different matter. I expect that there will always be use cases for this, for backhaul, backup links etc. reply AnarchismIsCool 16 hours agorootparentprevWas waiting for this response... It's a long game. Yeah, we can't just say \"fuck it, everyone go nuts\" tomorrow. There are satellite downlinks that cant be readily changed, equipment capex that needs to depreciate etc. What we should be doing is adding and expanding ISM space as aggressively as we reasonably can and refusing to issue new exclusive licenses without an extremely good reason (and probably exclusively for public/civil purposes). reply danw1979 11 hours agorootparentDo we really need to allow Industrial use of RF across the whole spectrum though? Maybe we need a new definition of public use at “reasonable EIRP” without the industrial heating and whatever other weird uses of RF are out there. reply AnarchismIsCool 11 hours agorootparentThe caveat should be (as it's always been) only radiate as much as you actually need to, and not having/buying sufficient shielding is not an acceptable \"need to\" argument. Microwaves share spectrum with WiFi but unless something is horribly wrong turning on a microwave doesn't jam every wifi access point within a mile. I agree though, reasonable EIRP is something we need to talk about. For instance, there should probably be more of a logarithmic equation for calculating an EIRP alternative that allows more effective power in beam forming systems but to a sane limit. In other words, don't handicap people trying to be responsible with where they send signals but that doesn't mean you can build an absolute laser of an antenna array and start screaming at satellites coming over the hill behind your receiver. reply ggm 14 hours agorootparentprevThis I can get behind. reply polishdude20 15 hours agoparentprevI saw \"ELRS\" and panicked for a bit but remembered it also has a 2.4ghz option reply 05 10 hours agorootparentThere's also the 'fuck the FCC' option since you're going to be breaking FAA's line of sight regs with any long to medium range flights anyway.. reply shizcakes 13 hours agoparentprevNo decision has been made in the NextNav case, and there’s a lot of significant opposition. What’s with the needless fearmongering? reply LastTrain 12 hours agorootparentFear mongering? It’s not like this topic is going to cause a mass panic or anything. reply fellerts 10 hours agorootparentI develop products for the 915 MHz band and became very anxious that I missed FCC's decision (none has been made yet). I agree with GP. reply ElectRabbit 9 hours agoprevFYI: Wifi-7 modems (some of them are AP-capable) are now available for around 15-30€. They support all bands (2, 5, 6) Have a look at the Mediatek (MT7925E) and Intel (BE200-BE202) cards. There also the more pricy Qualcomm QCNCM865. The Mediatek and Qualcomm also works with AMD mainboards. The Intel cards are not compatible with AMD mainboards as they are using a proprietary stuff. At leas the Mediatek works fine with Linux (currently running in Thumbleweed) and AMD. reply ksec 7 hours agoparent>Wifi-7 modems (some of them are AP-capable) are now available for around 15-30€ Just to add additional context, there are a whole loads of components from RF Filter to antenna itself, RAM, etc for an AP or Router. In case anyone got the wrong estimate of BOM cost. Ignoring any other R&D / NRE or Capex involved. And all that excludes the cost of software. reply ElectRabbit 6 hours agorootparentIf you are using the naked modem chip of course. But by buying one of these m.2 cards this stuff is already done. Connect it to the PC and U.fl antenna and start playing around with them. Maybe I should have clarified that these mentioned chips are already places onto M.2 cards you can buy from Ali/Amazon&Co. reply eth0up 8 hours agoparentprevAlso in Tumbleweed, but a bit in Void and others...

Just slightly faster transfers? reply cesarb 15 hours agoparentKeep in mind that, unlike cabled Ethernet, WiFi is a shared medium. Faster transfers also means your device uses less airtime for the same transfer speed. This is especially relevant in dense urban areas, where it's not unusual to see tens or even hundreds of WiFi networks sharing the same few channels. reply giantg2 27 minutes agorootparentEh, seems like the wrong solution if that's the real problem. Building in some signal strength/topology intelligence to weaken the signal would be a better approach. reply matsemann 7 hours agorootparentprevIs it also good for power for small devices? Can power down for longer between sending. reply tadfisher 16 hours agoparentprevCongestion, mostly. Really it's a problem at conventions or sports games where every human and probably each pet brings one or two WiFi transceivers. Best way to alleviate that is more bandwidth. reply giantg2 24 minutes agorootparent\"Best way to alleviate that is more bandwidth.\" I disagree. The best way to fix that is smaller segmentation for less overlap/congestion. Eg use more APs, make the coverage area for each smaller, intelligently adjust power on the devices so they aren't blasting farther than they need to. reply 1oooqooq 16 hours agorootparentprevif we just build one more frequency band lane... reply astrange 12 hours agorootparent6GHz doesn't go through walls so it's pretty difficult for any low-energy user to disrupt others with it. It's better if we can move towards it for this reason. reply quacksilver 12 hours agorootparentCan be good for high density environments such as student dorms, hotels and hospitals. They can put an AP in each room (or in the wired hotel TV) and not have to worry about crosstalk or turning the signal down to get a high quality connection. Or if they build one AP wiring point on the ceiling per room for new homes / small offices or rely on the other bands for backhaul in a mesh network. reply thaumasiotes 12 hours agorootparentprev> 6GHz doesn't go through walls That will make it useless for a home network. If I need to mount wired access points in every room, I can just use the wired network I already have. reply astrange 11 hours agorootparentOh, it goes through American home walls. Those aren't real after all. But how are you going to use Ethernet for your phone and smart lights? reply jrockway 11 hours agorootparentprevHome Wifi is what it is, but this is a big selling point for things like offices. The less Wifi stations that can \"hear\" each other, the better for all of them. The way this is attempted with 2.4/5GHz deployments is to put an AP in every room and turn the power way down, but this only helps a little bit. reply rezonant 12 hours agorootparentprevAnd run those Ethernet cables directly to your phones and tablets. reply Vecr 15 hours agorootparentprevInduced demand is good. People just complain about it with cars due to what they claim are excessive environmentally detrimental externalities. reply stephen_g 13 hours agorootparentApart from the environmental externalities, the problem with induced demand and cars is that cars take up too much physical space on the road for the number of people they tend to carry, so induced demand in any reasonably populated area (like a city) will always produce excessive congestion, and you can basically never build enough lanes to fix that (especially because intersections are often a bigger problem). Whereas with more space-efficient transit, like trains, trams (streetcars) and buses, you can often increase capacity on existing lines or build more capacity for reasonable cost and space, so induced demand isn't as much a problem. reply toast0 12 hours agorootparentThe whole concept of induced demand is really a misunderstanding of the problem. Congestion indicates transportation capacity is below demand. But once the medium is congested, you can't measure what the demand is; only how long it's congested. You can reduce congestion by increasing capacity, or decreasing demand. If you have a pandemic and encourage people to stay at home, you'll find that the transportation networks that are still operating have plenty of capacity. If you add another lane to the 405 in LA, you'll find the duration of congestion has a step change reduction, but as population continues to grow, congestion duration will also continue to grow. If you add mass transit capacity, highway congestion duration will likely be reduced too. When it's a real situation, the question is usually what intervention allows for the most additional transportation capacity given realistic funds availability. Somewhere like the LA area usually takes an all options approach: there is investment in mass transit as well as highways that service mass transit, individual transportation and commercial shipping. Although intentionally reducing population could work too :p reply matsemann 7 hours agorootparent> Congestion indicates transportation capacity is below demand. But once the medium is congested, you can't measure what the demand is; only how long it's congested. But congestion is also part of what controls the demand. It's not a \"true\" demand that you're just not seeing because of congestion. Once the congestion is solved, the demand will increase as that changes the attractiveness of driving. Since driving then for some people will outcompete bus, cycling, trains etc., they will then shift over to driving even though they had no demand for it earlier. It will then reach a new equilibrium, not far off the old congestion. reply lazide 10 hours agorootparentprevEh, I think that’s a misstatement of market dynamics. Yes, congestion is stating that demand is exceeding capacity. However… Congestion is a pushback signal that reduces actual demand, by reducing quality/utility of the actual ‘product’. Congestion is demand being throttled through the mechanism of reduction in quality/availability, instead of some other mechanism, like increases in pricing (tolls), or reduction in customers (aka population decreases or exclusionary rules) through the natural usage of the system. Due to induced demand. Because there is almost always more ‘low quality’ demand, than ‘high quality’ demand. It’s a type of tragedy of the commons. In any ‘free’ system, it almost always ends up this way (see crazy long wait times in nationalized health systems!) precisely because the other options are excluded. Just like on free ways. reply Vecr 13 hours agorootparentprevThat's not bad though, by the preferences of the people driving the cars. I've done a couple very informal low sample count surveys, and as far as I can tell the result of pricing in the externalities and building what mass transit is realistic (not much, in certain places) would lead to at least a short-term reduction in satisfaction. reply iknowstuff 12 hours agorootparentTo be clear, this is what happens when you pander to car commuters and build out car infrastructure instead of livable cities: https://ggwash.org/view/4315/houstons-cars-vs-rotterdams-bom... Google some more before/after car infrastructure photos: https://www.google.com/search?q=before+after+car+infrastruct... So you see it’s NOT just about the environment. It’s about cities being pleasant or dreadful. reply Y_Y 13 hours agorootparentprev> pricing in externalities .. would lead to ... reduction in satisfaction [for those paying] I agree with everything you said and would add > That's not bad though Of course people who aren't paying something would rather not pay it. In the case of externalizing those costs, they're getting an effective subsidy from society at large for something they disproportionately participate in! I think the complaint about induced demand for roads is that it induces demand in those who have the means and motive to drive. The land those roads are on (and the environment the cars may pollute) is also demanded for other uses like green space or railway or housing. It's a rivalrous finite resource and the part of society that doesn't benefit from more roads may be the larger part. reply DiogenesKynikos 7 hours agorootparentprevPeople's preferences are heavily influenced by what is available. Ask the average person in a car-centric American city with no (or barely any) public transit, and of course they prefer to drive. Ask that same question of someone who lives in a city with great public transit (e.g., pick any major city in East Asia, or many cities in Europe) and congested roads, and their answer will be very different. reply ggm 12 hours agorootparentprevCars are a bad metaphor for radio physics. Car congestion is a bad metaphor for RF channel collision because of a number of things including TDM and the non fatal quality of what we call a collision in radio space. reply unethical_ban 12 hours agorootparentprevInduced demand is not inherently good or bad. reply UltraSane 11 hours agoparentprevI just used a WiFi analyzer and in my 70 unit apartment building see 31 APs on 2.4Ghz fighting over 3 channels. 40 APs fighting over 5GHz. and exactly ZERO devices using 6GHz which is VASTLY larger than the other two bands. The 2.4GHz band is tiny and also is just pure noise at this point and the 5Ghz band can be pretty congested in urban areas. 6GHz gives WiFi a huge amount of extra bandwidth. So much that you could use only WiFi to network a dense office of PCs pretty effectively if you used sophisticated smart WiFi access points that effectively allocated the 6GHz channels. reply seba_dos1 9 hours agorootparentIt's only a matter of time when 6GHz networks become wide enough that there's going to be similar congestion there as currently on 5GHz. I remember when available 5GHz spectrum was oh so much wider and oh so empty as well; now you can have 160MHz channels there :) reply ahoka 6 hours agorootparentAs others had said: the higher the frequency, the less it penetrates walls, so congestion will be less of a problem. reply giantg2 18 minutes agorootparentThen why not build solutions to congestion if that's the problem? If you had all APs adjust their power based on the other networks in range, then you could dynamically reduce power output to reduce congestion. If your AP knows you're in a congested area, then it could adjust its behavior accordingly - reduce power, select the least used channel, etc. reply lazide 11 hours agorootparentprevThat could also be due to the high attenuation at 6ghz. Unless your neighbor has a device transmitting on it, it’s way less likely you’d see it. reply duskwuff 10 hours agorootparentI mean, that sounds like it'd be even better for high-density environments like apartments. reply lazide 5 hours agorootparentIt is - but much worse for doing a census of networks within x feet of where you are standing. reply lurking_swe 15 hours agoparentprevthere are some cool uses cases in the enterprise space: https://youtu.be/7p_AHPIVo_0?si=cgPQWPSwpN-yML-5 main benefit for home use is that 6 ghz is uncongested, which is very very nice if living in a dense neighborhood. and of course lightning fast wireless file transfers are possible on the LAN now, which could be beneficial to certain people. reply lazide 14 hours agorootparent6ghz also has a lot of loss in typical building materials, which is relatively good in that there is a lot less inter building noise. It does require more repeaters though for any given network. reply zekica 10 hours agorootparentTo anyone reading: please don't use repeaters. If you can, hard-wire all your wifi APs. reply k4rli 7 hours agorootparentWhat's the reason not to? Would you prefer hardwiring to \"mesh\" as well? Obviously hardwire will always have better performance but the convenience and value should also be a consideration. reply lazide 4 hours agorootparentNot who you are replying to, but more radio transmission and typically less reliability (you’re either using 2x the channels, or multiplexing on the same channel). In my experience, it can work but is often not nearly as good as you’d expect. Hardwired at the APs are way more reliable, and faster. reply aldonius 13 hours agorootparentprevI think on net it works out - surely the average number of access points per network is less than 1.1 reply Dylan16807 15 hours agoparentprevIs there a downside you have in mind? reply pjc50 9 hours agoparentprevWhy not?

TP Omada at least has 10GE support. reply neilalexander 8 hours agorootparentThe UniFi E7 also has a 10GE port.

Though then limited by single 2.5Gbps ethernet port reply zekica 10 hours agorootparentTo saturate 2.5Gbps in a single direction with WiFi 6/7 modulations with 2x2 MIMO (most phones, tables, laptops have 2 antennas), you need a (total) channel width of 200MHz, and that's for devices in the same room as the AP. If you want to saturate it with devices in the next room, you need closer to 240-300MHz, for example: using say you use MLO with 160MHz on 6GHz, 80MHz on 5GHz and 20MHz on 2.4GHz), totaling 260MHz. reply bobbob1921 13 hours agorootparentprevYour going to be hard pressed to saturate that “single” 2.5g eth port. reply dsp_person 10 hours agorootparentWifi 7 + MLO = 4Gbps >> 2.5Gbps reply izacus 6 hours agorootparentThose numbers aren't close to being realistic.

Once that started happening, the treasury (BEP to be specific) very quickly changed the serial numbers so they’re all very recognizable as having come from an uncut sheet. I didn’t check the latest for all denominations, but I know for $1 bills they all start with 99. So if you see a “miscut dollar error” for sale on eBay or the like, always check the serial. If it starts with 99 then it’s just someone who had some fun with a pair of scissors and it’s not a real error.

I am _always_ and _continually_ surprised at what people will pay for things. Literally _nobody_ scaled back their consumption or purchasing during post-COVID inflation. Home prices are sky-high but it's still a sellers market because buyers are scared that prices will jump again and instead of simply being a difficult purchase, maybe next year it will be an impossible one. Must be easy money being a realtor right now. Every time I have sold something on Craigslist or FB Marketplace in the last few years, I list it 25% higher than what I'd actually pay if I were buying it myself and expect to be negotiated down to something sensible. So far, excluding the low-effort moronic \"what's your lowest price\" texts, exactly ZERO buyers have tried to negotiate down. I have come to the conclusion that most people simply have no upper limit to what they will pay for something they want. A few will scoff and turn away. Some will complain about it on the Internet, but most will buy it anyway.

People frame them, give them as gifts, etc. It's just kind of fun to see real money as it comes off the press (and, thankfully, it inspires lots of collectors!) $2 bills are SUPER fun. 99.9% are not worth more than $2, but they still bring a smile to peoples' faces when you leave them as tips, etc. I always keep a stack in my cash box at coin shows to give out as change to kids, tips to the pages, etc. reply kibibyte 1 minute agorootparentI’m visiting Vietnam for Tet, and one cultural quirk of theirs that I’ve learned is that $2 bills are considered lucky money. So much so that kids there will hold onto those $2 bills as keepsakes (though they could spend them). And thus I made my first ever trip to the bank to special order a bunch of $2s. Something I wonder is if an uncut sheet of $2 bills would be considered extraordinarily lucky, because it’s a bunch of $2s in nearly mint condition. Or if it would be considered incredibly unlucky because those kids would have no easy way of cutting them perfectly. reply j7ake 1 hour agorootparentprevIs there a market to buy 2 dollar bills for less than two?

Now I’m wondering if I found Woz’s pad. That would be quite interesting because when I was very young I crank called him after finding his number online.

[0] The $1 notes also go through a lot more use in their life so they degrade much quicker iirc and a bit over 40% of the bills in circulation are $1 bills too so switching over to a coin that lasts decades instead of 6-7 years (https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/how-long-is-the-life-spa...) would really cut down on printing costs. reply trey-jones 2 hours agorootparentprevWell, about 25 years ago the EU issued 1 and 2 Euro coins (no bills for those denominations) and as far as I know still do.

There are a ton of vending machines and other automated stuff that takes dollar bills but not coins. You can say “oh they’d switch”, and maybe, but they don’t want to because it’s expense and complexity for little/no benefit. 2. Critical mass. Similar problem: nobody will invest in supporting dollar coins as long as their customers don’t use dollar coins. Customers won’t use them because they won’t accept them from banks and stores. And they won’t accept them because they know lots of infra doesn’t support them. 3. US psychology sees coins as “change”, not money. If you see someone buying lunch with change, the assumption is they’re homeless or something. It’s irrational, but so what? And it would change… if we ever got over the hump. Don’t think of the problem like a technocrat, where any 5% improvement is obviously worth it. Think of it like a marketer, where you have to change customer behavior, and that needs a 10x value prop. Or I guess we can think like autocrats: we know what’s good for ‘em and they’ll just have to accept it. reply sjsdaiuasgdia 1 hour agorootparentFor many classes of vending machines, dollar bill support is going away without government intervention. For a while it's been very common in the US to see vending machines that have bill, maybe coin, and card options. It's increasingly common to find machines that only have card options, no cash. Products are more expensive and people use less cash generally...how many customers actually carry enough $1 bills to buy themselves a $3.75 bottle of soda? They're already switching because it allows them to charge higher prices with less friction. You'll likely grumble a bit while you're feeding the 4th dollar bill into the machine but a card swipe or tap is the same level of customer effort regardless of cost. Vending machines will continue to move towards electronic payment as the preferred and eventually only widely available option, and will no longer have relevance to what a physical dollar looks like. reply kube-system 1 hour agorootparentYes, it is happening over the course of many decades, naturally, as machines are updated/replaced as a matter of normal business. That's a very different thing in terms of switching costs than an immediate switch that demands replacement all at one time. reply toast0 30 minutes agorootparentAll the novelty $1 coins since the Sacagawea offer the potential for a gradual shift too. Modern multi-denomination coin mechs are likely to accept them, unlike the Susan B Anthony's that were too close to quarters [1]. Some of them even have a sticker near the coin slot advertising the feature. So if someone has given you a dollar coin in change (probably a government cashier or machine), you might be able to use it in a machine. I couldn't find a well reported number on dollar coin acceptance --- just an undated claim of 30% of machines accepting them according to Vending Market Watch but no link to an article or anything. I did see an article on VMW from 2011 about cash recyclers that allow a machine to take a larger bill and issue change with smaller bills rather than only coins, that featured a quote that resonates with me: > \"Customers have told me firsthand how thrilled they are to receive bills as change instead of dollar coins,\" said Mike Gallagher, service manager for Coca-Cola Bottling Co. \"Sales on those machines have increased, and the technology has been extremely reliable.\" [2] [1] I did see one coin mech in the wild that took Anthony dollars; but it was a spendy arcade game and had a dispenser next to it to get the dollar coins you needed from bills or quarters.

But the longer term disenfranchisement trend I see is making the numeric value of money itself ever more depreciated in favor of fine grained price discrimination. So it's not that it will be \"harder to give them money\", but rather that you will be paying twice as much (ie not receiving coupons/vouchers to obtain the real competitive price) based on them knowing that you personally will still buy. reply scarface_74 1 hour agorootparent> it's not that it will be \"harder to give them money\", but rather that you will be paying twice as much (ie not receiving coupons/vouchers to obtain the real competitive price) based on them knowing that you personally will still buy.

Alas, banks are practically a requirement even for local communities. You'd be stupid to put all of your cash under your mattress or in your home. You'd be stupid to walk around all day every day with a significant chunk of cash/change. Keep excess cash in the bank or investments keeps it separated from the risk that your house is broken into or burns down, and separated from the risk of being mugged. Banks are regulated (in all countries I can think of) and federally insured in the US (I dunno about other countries' monetary insurances or policies). So if it's a separation of risk, then why undo all of that by walking around with all of your money in your phone? It's exactly the same problem but now in a brand-new electronic domain with little or no regulation at all. That's a stupid thing to do. So no, I do not use banking apps. Just as I don't put work shit on my phone, I also do not put banking shit on my phone. My phone is where non-technical people talk to me, and is high risk for incoming malware.

Taking the amount budgeted for petty cash means you only spend that much \"that's spent already\", which makes it easier to stick to a budget (because you can't spend cash you're not holding). if the problem is overspending, and there's a budget, there's not generally a problem with underspending that amount, so the idea that it forces more spending isn't a problem (for some people).

A number in some app (that I annoyingly have to 2fa into) which I have to check on a debit card balance isn't at all helpful if you don't actually check it. For the obsessive smartphone app checker, I'm sure it works, but ask all your (close) friends what their current credit card balance is. I bet no one is closer than $100 and some probably aren't even within $500. By the time the card fails a transaction and is getting denied because the card, I'm already at the whatever store and have to give up the purchase in a hugely embarrassing way. A physical bit of cash that you have in your wallet and at home is, well, physically present and simply feels light when you're running low. A debit or credit card with a number in some app does not do that. 2fa is a large blocker here, and while it's understandable from a security practice (so I'm not any to turn that off), it's enough friction to not be convenient, and that's assuming you configure the banking app on your phone because you're not scared of attacks to your phone SMS (which you should be). reply scarface_74 2 hours agorootparentMy 2FA is my face… So the people who are too lazy to check their app are okay with going to an ATM?

(In part because the former is richer.) I guess it just depends on who you talk to and their particular values. I love my country, but to give a bit of a counter point : I am paralyzed due to a cervical spine injury. Medicare will pay 80% of the cost of a new chair after payment of deductible once every 5 years. They do not cover maintenance and repair in most cases. A decent mid-range power-chair with posture and repositioning aids costs between 15k-25k. The air cushion for this chair to prevent pressure sores costs 400-800usd. So, essentially, that means that a permanently disabled person making the high SSDI income of 18k a year is going to be asked to pay 4.5k USD out of pocket every 5 years just in order to take advantage of the offers from Medicare -- and this isn't including repair, wear and replacement of items, or the short 1-2 year life span of most air cushions. By the time the chair hits the next replacement window it will have gone through 2-3 500-800usd cushions and numerous other repairs. To contrast : My friends with similar injuries who are insured under the British NHS receive a voucher for a new chair every 3-5 years. They receive vouchers for repair at local shops. Cushion replacement is deemed necessary during the repair process and they are replaced w/ vouchers as needed, not on a schedule. It's all grass-is-always-greener thinking. The NHS has huge problems, too.

I suspect it's a combination of getting relevant laws earlier (don't know that, just guessing), having less old infrastructure (building new with accessibility is easier than upgrading existing buildings), and having more space (so adding a wheelchair ramp is less of a deal). Europe is generally catching up, but I'd say it's still behind the US. At least the places I know.

The $1 sheet does come with only slight overcharge and everyone I gifted ended up hanging it in their office wall. Its a great conversation starter because majority of people do not know US dollars are produced in sheets nor that civilians can easily and legally purchase them off the US mint site. - on the downside I almost missed my international flight because TSA agent could not comprehend that this is not fake home-printed sheet of $100. The new $100s have the famous security strip engraved and I would imagine putting large number thru airport security machine will tip it as attempt to smuggle large amount of US currency (you supposed to report anything over $10,000 in cash (whichever currency) when you enter or leave US border). So the TSA got warning on their screen and his eyes almost popped out when he unroll a sheet of 16 x $100 bills on one sheet of paper. Other travelers had fun seeing it too. Its only that his supervisor let me through quickly because he said a month ago there was some money summit in NYC and he got plenty of people going back and forth with these sheets. - I think everyone should order a single $1 sheet to have on their wall as it is a great conversation starter. reply percentcer 12 hours agoprevWhy do these sell for so much more than the value of the note? reply BobAliceInATree 3 hours agoparent1) They're novelty collector's items. 2) Selling individual sheets has a lot more overhead per sheet/bill than selling fresh stacks of bills to banks. reply xbmcuser 11 hours agoparentprevIf I recall correctly this is because someone found an infinite money glitch and used a credit card that had a big cash back.

It's another form of Seignorage https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seigniorage, where the government gets to keep the difference between the cost of producing these coins and/or notes and keeps the difference as this money is unlikely to be back in circulation. Same thing happened with the 50 states collectible 25c, it's estimated that the US got $6B because people remove them from circulation. reply eru 10 hours agorootparentBtw, I wonder what strategy would lead to maximisation of Seignorage (in inflation adjusted terms). Ignoring collectors items for a moment, I suspect keeping inflation low will lead to higher absolute monetary balance held by the public, more than making up for not raking in much in 'inflation tax'. See eg how the Bank of Japan could pump out lots and lots of money to be held by the general public, when their inflation rates were low or negative. reply buryat 1 hour agorootparentI doubt that we have a huge paper notes mass being hoarded in the US, most of it should be circulating pretty constantly. I see it important for exports as the US gets to produce paper that we send over to other countries in exchange for goods. They store it and we never pay back as long as our economy, technological progress, science, higher education, cutting-edge healthcare, entertainment, army stay ahead of others then we never ever going to pay back. And Nixon shock where the US dollar stopped being pegged to gold showed that power to others since no one in the world would stop using the US dollar just because it's value now is measured how the US can dictate (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_shock). Most Americans shouldn't keep their money in savings and should invest into the stock market because it's a reflection of our collective economical input. And if you just keep it in Savings then it'll keep up with the interest rate which doesn't change the stored value, so what's the point? While in big indices there always going to be winners because that's just the nature of the game, so by betting on winners you are going to outrun the interest rate by capturing this additional value that is being created. And people working for these winning companies and startups are very interested in beating the interest rate, they're mostly shareholder aligned as they themselves are equity holders. If you don't have equity you're working in, it still makes sense to bet on winning companies since those people are vey much equity aligned and just want to capture the market share. Pension funds, 401k are all tight to various investments, indices, etc. that are all reflection of the total economy. And I see it as my participation in the broader economy as I spend money that creates jobs and creates new economic exchanges further, and as a shareholder I capture that value back anyway.

Also, for years there was a problem with people who'd sift through quarters for rare 1964-and-earlier ones that had silver content, and then return most of the quarters to a bank. And some people would do this in high volume, using coin-sorting machinery, and traveling around the region, to hit many banks. So, a bank branch would lose money on providing the coins and/or lose even more on taking back all the non-silver ones. After my condo building's laundry room vendor recently swapped out the card readers for some dodgy IoT app thing, I've started using quarters again, and finding quarters at all is difficult. Most store customer service counters and checkouts have a rule against trading quarters at all, though one did offer to trade up to $2 worth (like for parking meter). All the laundromats that still use quarters have threatening signs on their quarters changers, that it's only for customers. My bank branch limits to 4 rolls per customer (after verifying that you have an account there), and you can often sense that the counter person enjoys the transaction even less than some of the other money-losing services they provide. reply WalterBright 11 hours agorootparentIt's been a very very long time since I've seen a silver quarter in circulation. reply neilv 11 hours agorootparentThere were enough to make searching worthwhile.

There was no surprise as to why that might be because most of the bills had the obvious signature of Benjamin Franklin and there was one notorious French bordello in his diplomat days that he had been alleged to spend a lot of self-invented money at. It was mostly only good for wallpaper and insulation, but being a diplomat he certainly implied it was good American currency at the time. There's something to weirdly admire about Ben Franklin paying for apparently a lot of French services with money he just kind of made up himself, and they mostly accepted it because it did make interesting wallpaper and decent building insulation. reply omoikane 11 hours agoparentprevMaybe not a wallpaper, but I have been at an office that has a sheet that was framed and hung on the wall.

    "originBody": "The top image shows the structural editor, and shell, for the eyg programming language running on a phone. Later on I’ll show it running on a TV. On both devices the structural editor is a better coding experience than a text editor would be. This post outlines the evolution of the editor over several years, and highlights the major changes over time along with some design thoughts and implementation notes. The web editor is built in Gleam and Lustre; originally it was Gleam and Svelte. There also exists a terminal based structural editor built in Go. Want to jump in and code with it? The latest version is at eyg. Why build a structural editor? Structural editors, also known as projectional editors, enhance writing, editing and understanding code. Unlike traditional text-based editors, these tools treat code as a structured tree rather than a flat sequence of characters. This structured data may be the Abstract Syntax Tree(AST) of the represented program, however it can also be a different structure. For this post I won’t quibble over the differences. Some traditional editors have tools that understand the code structure, for example autocomplete. However in most cases these tools work as suggestions and a traditional text editor will accept any input. I define a structural editor as one that does not accept invalid or arbitrary input. Changes to the program always proceed through well known states. This clarification is important because the editors I talk about here render the program to the user as text, but it’s important to note that there is no way to enter arbitrary text. The benefits of a structural editor are: No syntax errors. Zero time is spent on missing quotes, semi-colons or other details. Better type information. Because the program is always in a valid state the type checker can always run and give meaningful feedback. No keywords Variables can be called var and functions called fn. Either can also be called 🧪 or !_// though maybe they shouldn’t be. Rich visualisations A program can be shown as box and wires, or boolean logic operators. On a smaller scale a record of latitude and longitude can be shown on a map. Reduced complexity There is no lexer or parser so issues like fault tolerant parsing are entirely circumvented. Several other structed editor projects exist. Jetbrains has MPS which targets creating your own domain specific languges. Tylr is a beautiful example but currently only good for one line of code at a time. An adhoc first attempt This is my first recording of the structural editor - admire the minimalistic and clean look. The first generation editor worked by directly editing the AST with no effort to hide the details from the user. Pressing a increased the selection by moving the current selection to the parent node, j/k moved to the previous/next node and i entered insert mode on the current node. You might see the vim influence of these bindings. This first version got a few things right. The command pallet approach in particular is very nice. It allows you to put a lot of help with certain actions. For example when creating a variable the pallet can show all the variables in scope at that position. At the outset the AST design was driven by the development of the editor, one single enum represented all the expressions in the program. This is the complete expression type from that time. pub type Node(m, g) { Binary(value: String) Tuple(elements: List(Expression(m, g))) Record(fields: List(#(String, Expression(m, g)))) Access(value: Expression(m, g), key: String) Tagged(tag: String, value: Expression(m, g)) Variable(label: String) Let(pattern: Pattern, value: Expression(m, g), then: Expression(m, g)) Function(pattern: Pattern, body: Expression(m, g)) Call(function: Expression(m, g), with: Expression(m, g)) Case( value: Expression(m, g), branches: List(#(String, Pattern, Expression(m, g))), ) Hole Provider(config: String, generator: Generator, generated: g) } The update function, called when you press a key in the editor, was a huge case statement for each combination of key pressed and current position in the tree. This approach although simple didn’t scale with complexity. The AST was used by the editor, type checker and code generation so it was not possible to adapt it to the requirements of any particular use case. In this first version too many concerns were rolled into one project. The Provider node is my implementation of type providers and not part of this story. But you can see other videos in my log about them. This first effort eventually ground to a halt under its complexity. A simple AST As a rich AST could not work for all usecases I focused on creating the simplest AST. Complexity for type checking or editing would move to the appropriate modules. pub type Expression { Variable(label: String) Lambda(label: String, body: Expression) Apply(func: Expression, argument: Expression) Let(label: String, definition: Expression, body: Expression) Vacant(comment: String) Binary(value: BitArray) // .. other primitives for integer, string and builtins Empty Extend(label: String) Select(label: String) // .. other operators for lists, unions, effects and references } This AST was the result, it still looks almost identical today By making all features of the language first class, there is a minimal number of compound nodes in the tree. Only Lambda, Apply and Let contain child expressions. To create the record literal {name: \"Eve\"} required the following expression Apply(Apply(Extend(label: \"name\"), String(\"Eve\")), Empty) This change makes interpretation and type checking much simpler, take my word for it. It also simplifies several details of the editor for example: Positions in the tree are denoted by a list of integers where each integer identifies the child node. This path is followed from the root node until the required point in the tree. This step function implements one step of following that path, it takes an expression and goes to n’th child. Only the three nodes mentioned have to be taken into account by the step function. It is known that asking for a child of any other kind of node is an error. This means that variants can be added/removed to the Expression type without in any way modifying or moving around the tree. pub fn step(exp, n) { case exp, n { e.Lambda(param, body), 0 -> Ok(#(body, e.Lambda(param, _))) e.Apply(func, arg), 0 -> Ok(#(func, e.Apply(_, arg))) e.Apply(func, arg), 1 -> Ok(#(arg, e.Apply(func, _))) e.Let(label, value, then), 0 -> Ok(#(value, e.Let(label, _, then))) e.Let(label, value, then), 1 -> Ok(#(then, e.Let(label, value, _))) _, _ -> Error(\"invalid path\") } } This change didn’t effect the external look of the editor but it did substantially clean up the implementation. Text editing is intuitive familiar Moving around the code was tricky in the previous editor. This was because the order of nodes in the tree might not match the order they were shown on screen. For example selecting the field from a record. let x = user.name If user is selected, to move to name required moving left and another move left would jump back to the x of the variable declaration. This is because the . syntax is sugar for calling the select operator on the variable user. In all other cases arguments come after the function but, for select, reversing the order it’s projected to the user makes more sense. Apply(Select(\"name\"), Variable(\"user\")) Making transformations directly on the AST felt powerful but there were too many occasions where an understanding of the AST was needed to know how to move. The next version aimed to fix the navigation issue by keeping a cursor centric approach. This means that one key press of left moves the cursor one position left and a key press of right moves the cursor one position right. Even with moving back to a text based navigation I wanted a fully structural editor so that the program was always a valid structure. Traditional editors have similar behaviour, for example: when typing ( an automatic ) is often placed. In this way you don’t go through a state of having unmatched brackets. The main difference is in a text editor this bracket matching features are adhoc and many other ways exist to create a syntactically invalid program. You can see this working here. This editor was actually quite short lived. I liked that it showed the type of holes in the program directly in the editor. However the editor was unintutive in many cases. Keeping the editor structural but pretending it wasn’t led to too many inconsistencies. There were places that typing certain characters would do nothing because the character was invalid. Implementing this editor got complicated quickly. Intercepting all keyboard events meant dropping out of Gleam and understanding the range and selection API’s in the browser. This resulted in a lot of foreign function interface code A positive aside of this effort to go text based meant I wanted better Gleam bindings to the browser API’s and that need kicked off building plinth a library to do just that. Adding sugar and projections The two previous editors were at opposing ends of a spectrum. For the first, movement was entirely based on the layout of the AST. For the second, movement was entirely based on the layout of the text. I wrote approximately 10k “lines” of EYG code, including a JSON parser and type checker, using the simple AST editor. Transforming the AST felt very powerful when it worked. However, where the visuals did not match the AST representation navigation was unintuitive. I eventually mastered it but it was clearly a blocker for anyone else picking up the editor. This generation of the editor tries to find a middle ground one the spectrum from text to AST. Navigation is always by whole AST nodes. In addition directions are always consistent with how the program is laid out on screen. This was achieved by creating a representation of the program specifically for manipulation in the editor. There is: Editable a type which deals with larger code units than the basic AST Projection a zipper into the Editable type that makes navigation and transforms more efficient. Frame an intermediate representation for rendering expressions that track if they are single or multiple lines. The basic AST is still used by the interpreter and type checker so the complexity of presenting code to the user is only in the modules which deal with showing code to a user. Using the mouse Working with a keyboard is efficient, but only if you know the key bindings to each action you need. Which key to press to get a desired action is not discoverable from looking at the UI element. After all the UI for keyboard actions is just a cursor somewhere in the page. A user is required to consult a cheatsheet of keyboard actions and learn some before ever getting started. This friction makes getting started very challenging. Devices without keyboards have to show virtual keyboards to use keyboard shortcuts. If the actions are being presented on screen they might as well be shown as something more relevant than the letter code corresponding to the short cut. This latest iteration adds a menu and icon based UI for each transformation that is possible on the AST. A question mark button at the top toggles showing text descriptions of each action but at the cost of less screen to work with. The UI works with keyboard, mouse, touch or TV remote. It also works great with a keyboard and if you forget the key, seemlessly switch to the visual. Implementing the visual UI was simple with Lustre and the state and event approach it has. Lustre is an implementation of the Elm architecture. The state of the program works by switching on key press events. pub fn update(state, message) { let Snippet(status: status, ..,) = state case message, status { UserPressedCommandKey(key), Editing(Command(_)) -> { let state = Snippet(..state, using_mouse: False) case key { \"ArrowRight\" -> move_right(state) \"ArrowLeft\" -> move_left(state) \"ArrowUp\" -> move_up(state) \"ArrowDown\" -> move_down(state) \" \" -> search_vacant(state) // Needed for my examples while Gleam doesn't have file embedding \"Q\" -> copy_escaped(state) \"w\" -> call_with(state) \"E\" -> assign_above(state) \"e\" -> assign_to(state) \"r\" -> insert_record(state) \"t\" -> insert_tag(state) \"y\" -> copy(state) \"Y\" -> paste(state) // \"u\" -> \"i\" -> insert_mode(state) \"o\" -> overwrite_record(state) \"p\" -> insert_perform(state) \"a\" -> increase(state) \"s\" -> insert_string(state) \"d\"\"Delete\" -> delete(state) \"f\" -> insert_function(state) \"g\" -> select_field(state) \"h\" -> insert_handle(state) \"j\" -> insert_builtin(state) \"k\" -> toggle_open(state) \"l\" -> insert_list(state) \"#\" -> insert_reference(state) \"z\" -> undo(state) \"Z\" -> redo(state) // \"x\" -> \"c\" -> call_function(state) \"v\" -> insert_variable(state) \"b\" -> insert_binary(state) \"n\" -> insert_integer(state) \"m\" -> insert_case(state) \"M\" -> insert_open_case(state) \",\" -> extend_before(state) \"EXTEND AFTER\" -> extend_after(state) \".\" -> spread_list(state) \"TOGGLE SPREAD\" -> toggle_spread(state) \"TOGGLE OTHERWISE\" -> toggle_otherwise(state) \"?\" -> #(state, ToggleHelp) \"Enter\" -> execute(state) _ -> show_error(state, NoKeyBinding(key)) } } } } The UI buttons make use of the same events and update logic. Each button in the visual UI consists of; the icon to show (I use the heroicon library and the outline style) a text description of the action (which is shown when “show help” is on) the keypress event to dispatch. fn cmd(x) { ShellMessage(snippet.UserPressedCommandKey(x)) } fn item_before() { #(outline.arrow_turn_left_down(), \"item before\", cmd(\",\")) } fn item_after() { #(outline.arrow_turn_right_down(), \"item after\", cmd(\"EXTEND AFTER\")) } fn undo() { #(outline.arrow_uturn_left(), \"undo\", cmd(\"z\")) } fn redo() { #(outline.arrow_uturn_right(), \"redo\", cmd(\"Z\")) } There are more actions than available keys so the EXTEND AFTER string value can be dispatched by clicking the correct button, but not by any keyboard binding. Here is the final result, as of today. What’s next There will be more iterations of the editor but this one is interesting. I want to see what other people make of the structured editor experience. You can try it out now and if you have any opinions please get in touch. Bluesky the best right now. The EYG language is still developing. References to external packages and better error messages based on effects will be coming soon. To keep up with that progress join the newsletter. I'm building EYG an experiment in a building better languages and tools; for some measure of better. All progress is reported in my irregular newsletter.",

Programs are not text, there's an impedance mismatch that shows at the seams. There're good reasons it hasn't been done more: text is good for troubleshooting, \"every program should do one thing well\" and maybe preventing lock-in. But with programming tools reaching maturity, we'll see more of this. Also there's an AI-related aspect: bots can understand structure just fine. reply ok_computer 1 hour agoparentIn my opinion, that’s the magic of programming languages. I type a few high level words and characters, then there is a deep stack of interpreting the strings into machine code and returning data and side effects. It is stupid simple as the end user and immensely complex chain of machinery. SQL is an extreme example of strings parsed to make complex computer behavior. Shell scripting too. For enforcing complete object correctness and interfaces as they are explicitly designed then low code no code seems like it has a better proposition. Anyway, maybe structured editors fit a space between dumb strings and pointing and clicking blocks and connectors. I’m all for correct tool for the job and end user. I think that minimizing end user tooling with some LSP go-to definitions and linting in a text editor is my preference. Similar to how FIFA used to be against high tech slow mo replay for soccer matches to make the sport egalitarian / accessible for the whole world I think that analogously programming should focus on the simplicity and portability of authored documents. reply taeric 1 hour agoparentprevThere are good reasons it hasn't been done more, and I don't think it is just \"text is good for troubleshooting.\" At large, text wins because the job of a program text is to communicate the program to a user in a way that a computer can also be made to use. Things that help include that text can have multiple interpretations and meanings. This is why most variable names are nouns. You can literally \"ascii art\" parts of code to help convey some ideas. The most important part of why \"text\" wins, though, is that it is all visible. Yes it implies some structure underneath that the computer is going to need. The text, though, is fully visible to users. People think they want the ability to \"structurally edit,\" and you can sometimes make that work rather nicely. Most of the time, though, you are working with structures that are not complete. And worse, completing them will not be a process that goes in the same direction as the text. You will have to start a stack in how you are processing things to complete as you go. I'm torn on the bots comment, as I just don't know. LLMs, arguably, are leaning in on the structure that has been embedded in our symbolic text over many years. The same structure has not necessarily been developed in computer programming texts? (Also worth paying attention to how most of these goals were pursued with symbolic programming techniques back in the day. LISP, of course, but also term rewriting techniques that used to be rather magical.) reply LeftHandPath 1 hour agoparentprevIt's fascinating because I came to a similar conclusion while working with very old IBM mainframe code editors (AS400 / IBM i \"Source Entry Utility\") It's nearly impossible (if you read the docs) to write something with bad syntax on those machines. Columns are semantic in most of the languages (COBOL, RPG, DDL). When you write a program, if you don't know what you're doing, you can press \"F4\" and it will show you what each column means and when/how to use it [0]. It's not exactly a structured code editor, but it shares some similar concepts (see the link; you often write code in a \"prompt\" at the bottom of the screen, and the line won't insert until it's complete, though you can write it by hand if you wish). All of that said, IBM's old SEU is still vastly inferior to modern text editors and IDEs, mostly because of the limited view window and the lack of syntax highlighting / basic modern features [1]. I think that, especially for enterprise code/development, there are some benefits to structured editing that are worth exploring. Not having a linter shout at a partially-complete line because you paused for a second or two would be nice, as well.

I played with Smalltalk, and later Pharo, a bit, but it was years ago. As I recall the editor was always aware of the state of the system. And I think it was at a level beyond what any current IDE can do. While I do not remember if it allowed you to enter invalid code, it was definitely an interesting approach. So I will be following Eyg for sure. reply xkriva11 22 minutes agoparentIn Pharo, the method needs to be syntactically valid to be saved. reply unshavedyak 3 hours agoprevAwesome! Glad to see more exploration in this space. I too am exploring this, though i am perhaps making it yet even more complicated. I want to represent relationships between AST nodes in a visual way. Eg, i love Node editors in Blender and if it was given a good keyboard based UX i could imagine editing structural code in it. I still imagine the code would be visually text, but i'm imagining that you'd be able to see a series of nodes in a code flow graph for your current editing context. I figure AST editing (to some degree) is a generally good thing, but also representing code flow somehow is also a desired thing. It's what i do in my head, so can it be visualized in a beneficial way? Difficult to say. Keyboard first will also be a challenge as i'll need to have a lot of intelligent alignment and visual compression. Thanks for the post! Love to see work in this space. reply alexvitkov 2 hours agoparentMy biggest problem with node-based programming interfaces is the absurd number of nodes required for even fairly simple expressions, e.g `b*b-4*a*c` is 9 characters in most textual languages, but it would require 9 nodes in most visual scripting systems. I imagine you could have an arbitrary \"expression\" node with N inputs and a textfield, but I've never seen it done and it still feels like a bigger hassle than punching out the expression in a textual language. reply unshavedyak 4 minutes agorootparentWell to be clear, my model (that i'm trying to make, it doesn't exist yet) is very mixed with traditional text editing. I agree with you, which is why mine is more of a text editor augmented by nodes. Notably each node is a variable scope window into text. I'm imaging a single function, more so than individual AST elements. The node can then have multiple inputs and outputs (or relationships of varying types, as i'm imagining) similar to how Blender can have many fields, inputs and outputs. The variable scoping would mean you can make a single node as large or as small as you need. Including a whole file, or a single expression within a single function, etc. The goal of this would be to visually reduce unrelated clutter, such that relationships should be clear and not dizzying. I want the nodes to visually represent how i normally work. Which is to say i have a text editor open and often i'm only looking at a single function in the file. Then i jump in and out of the function to related functions. Similarly those are text editor nodes as well, and so the chain continues. I should stress, i really enjoy my text editor (Helix). I'm trying to add onto that UX ultimately, rather than replace it entirely. Reduce the things i think/hope i don't care about -- ie unrelated functions in a file -- and add things like visual relationships. Imagine an aggressive traditional text editor setting which folds all code you're not using. But with a slightly different representation which hopefully adds to the experience. Sidenote, another motivation for me is to leave the Terminal. I've been in Terminal for 20 years now but just leaving it is not alone worth it. I want to toy with graphical representations that would be difficult in a Terminal. Something to justify it's existence when compared to something as easy and flexible as the Terminal is. reply narag 20 minutes agorootparentprevIndeed, a hybrid approach seems better. reply unshavedyak 3 hours agoparentprevOh, related in this space: https://mbuffett.com/posts/structured-editing-syntax/ I thought this blog post had an interesting idea too. Basically that a structural editor which truly knew the underlying AST could then alter the visual representation of the code entirely. Eg changing it to look like Python, or whatever insane thing. Not advocating for that of course, but the idea that the editor could be effectively transpiling the code in real time is an interesting area to explore too. I imagine not for the purpose of \"Write Python that becomes Rust\" or w/e, but just in general customizing the experience.

Because the program is always in a valid state the type checker can always run and give meaningful feedback. Note that programs can be syntactically well-formed but ill-typed. For example `let x = true + 1` has valid syntax but produces an \"undefined\" type for the variable `x`, if the type system does not support type error recovery.

I wonder how much better a structured approach could be but it's obviously a large amount of work that I don't yet have time for. reply aiono 1 hour agorootparentPlain Text diffing has some obvious drawbacks: 1. If you rearrange your functions you will see a lot of additions and deletions while semantically there is no change in the program. It's just noise. 2. If you rename a variable you don't really have any actual change in places where it is referenced but text diff will again show a lot of noise. But the code references is still the same code. reply williamdclt 1 hour agorootparentprevGit (or whatever does the diff under the hood) is _adequate_. Every week I see diffs that are confusing, especially during merge conflicts, it’s honestly a bit embarrassing that in this day and age we don’t have anything better for something that is so central to our job reply kmoser 2 hours agorootparentprevA structured approach would be able to easily do things like ignore when a symbol was renamed (since that wouldn't affect the tree structure). So there are good reasons for wanting to do it that way, vs. a line-based diff. reply amar1729 1 hour agoparentprevfor diffing syntax trees, I've been trying out diffsitter, and it feels pretty good so far https://github.com/afnanenayet/diffsitter reply cfiggers 1 hour agoprevI enjoy Lisp and Lisp-alike languages specifically because with the right editor support you can do a lot of this kind of structural editing stuff without giving up the niceties of source code as text. reply mtreis86 1 hour agoparentYeah in emacs with paredit/smartparens/parinfer or whatever, it is both text and structure. With parinfer you change the text and the structure gets modified to match. With the other two you can change the structure directly with a command that has a silly but descriptive name like slurp or barf. reply like_any_other 27 minutes agoprevFor structural code editors to thrive, what is needed is a universal, simple, minimal, txt-like format for the AST, so that AST-editors are not locked to a single programming language each. reply zellyn 25 minutes agoparentYou might enjoy reading up on EYG and/or listening to podcast appearances of the creator… reply crowdhailer 24 minutes agorootparentIndeed.

I'm not sure I agree with this assertion. I think structural editors need to be language specific so that they can offer higher value edits that might only make sense for specific languages. reply like_any_other 14 minutes agorootparent\"Text-like\" meaning easy to parse and universally understood. With language-specific (or indeed, all) AST/generic tree attributes serialized in a uniform way that does not entirely break parsing if an editor does not understand one of them. More, that that 'understanding' can be factored out of the editor core, as is done with language servers today. reply tcoff91 12 minutes agoprevHaven't lisp coders been doing this forever with emacs? reply perlcommunity 1 hour agoprevhttps://www.jgrasp.org/ reply penteract 3 hours agoprevHaving made my own forays into making a structural editor, I'd like to sing the praises of plain text: storing something that has been created by pressing buttons at a keyboard as something very close to the sequence of buttons that have been pressed is a great idea. The magical ability of plain text is to go back in time and ask \"what if I pressed a different button a minute ago/yesterday/last year?\". This lets you see and fix mistaken keypresses, and even shapes the kind of mistakes you can make in a moment of confusion into ones that are quickly fixable. The direct representation of buttons pressed also really helps with teaching/learning: With plain text, for mechanical questions on the level of \"What buttons do I press to make a program that looks like that?\", the answer is obvious for anyone who knows how to type. Try the editor discussed in the article to appreciate how different answering that question can be in a structural editor. Seeing and explaining how someone got where they did is also straightforward (\"you missed a semicolon\", \"you misspelt a variable name\"). Ideally, those are problems that don't happen in a structural editor, but people who press a slightly wrong sequence of buttons will probably still exist. These arguments get much weaker when you aren't using a physical keyboard; I think this is the reason the article starts by talking about writing programs on a phone and a TV. In those environments structural editing has much more to offer. reply norir 4 hours agoprevI think structural editors are a great feature to add on top of a language with a definite textual representation. If you can pretty print the ast (as the fib example shows), you should generally be able to parse the output to generate the structured output. reply EdiX 1 hour agoprevI used a structural text editor a while back (technically a structural text editing mode for emacs). I went in completely buying the structural text editing propaganda (it's more logical, it will make you more efficient, it's the future...) but I eventually found the experience so excruciatingly bad and stupid that I now think the whole endeavour is a complete waste of time, the idea sounds good on paper but there are some fundamental unsolvable problems with it. The problem is that, when you want to make a change to piece of source code you know its current state and you know how you want it to look like at the end. With a normal text editor you will simply make a bunch of changes that turn the text as it into what it should be, it will normally go through a series of invalid states but you don't have to think about what those states will be or care about them. With a structural text editor this is impossible, invalid states can not be represented so when you want to make a change to your source code you don't just care about the beginning and end state, you also want to find a series of valid states that takes you from the beginning to the end where each one can be reached from the previous one with an editor command. For example, let's say you have a function call: (afunc 1 2 3) and you want to turn it into a conditional function call based on a flag: (if flag (afunc 1 2 3)) with a normal text editor you: 1. type \"(if flag \" before the call 2. type \")\" after the call It doesn't matter the order in which I do these operations or how I move the cursor. With a structural text editor, I have to: 1. create a new form before the function 2. type \"if flag\" 3. select the entire function call 4. cut it 5. paste it as the first branch of the if This is however only possible if the context where the function call currently is allows adding a new node before it (i.e. it's inside the equivalent of a lisp progn). If not I'd have to use a different strategy, for example: 1. select the entire function call 2. use a command to create a node around it 3. type \"if flag\" I did this for a few months, eventually I realized that I didn't want to think about the syntactical validity of the intermediate states my program goes through while I'm editing it, because they exist for mere seconds, and I didn't want to memorize the large palette of commands necessary to create those intermediate states. It was all additional cognitive load that accomplished nothing but satisfy someone's esthetic sense that source code should always be in a syntactically valid state. So of the benefits listed in the article: 1. \"No syntax errors\" is actually a major detriment of the structural editing model 2. \"Better type information\" is a lie, all that the structural text editor guarantees you is that the program is syntactically valid, not that it will pass type checking 3. \"No keywords\" is a lie, it's only true if you use a new programming language and don't store it on disk as text which opens a whole other can of worms (can't even read source code without a special text editor, won't work with github, won't work with any versioning system, won't work with grep, can't copy paste a chunk of it in an email...) 4. \"Rich visualization\" is an entirely different story from structural text editing but as far as I know nobody has ever shown visual programming to actually provide any kind of tangible benefit 5. \"Reduced complexity\" is the one I give them, yes if you are making a structured text editor you don't have to write a fault tolerant parser, it does make your (aka the text editor's implementor) life easier Fans of structural text editors usually mention that they will unlock \"more powerful refactoring tools\" but actually all you need for those to be \"unlocked\" is a dumb parser and an automatic code formatter, like \"go fmt\". Refactoring a function to be inlined into another is still a difficult operation to implement correctly but it isn't like the difficult part is running a parser on the source code, it's dealing with variable shadowing. reply herrington_d 56 minutes agoparentThis is a pretty fair comment. I wonder how structural editing figures out things like formatting/searching/diffing and copy/paste across different editors. reply EdiX 5 minutes agorootparentThose are all orthogonal concerns to the way the text editor behaves. You could have a structural text editor operate on plain text files and a dumb text editor operate on AST, you can do plain text diffs of ASTs or diff AST parsed from plain text files, etc etc... Some of these have existed historically (or even still exist). Paredit-mode is a structural text editor that saves and loads plain text files, Smalltalk was typically implemented as a dumb text editor but then code was saved as compiled binaries (which meant you couldn't save your functions if they weren't syntactically correct but you could have unsaved syntactically broken functions), Mathematica represents its code in a weird format that might as well be binary but copy/paste converts to plain text, there's one git plugin (don't remember the name right now) that does syntax aware diffs even though git deals with plain text... reply cbm-vic-20 2 hours agoprevThis is neat. I wonder if this could be generalized to other languages with Tree-Sitter and LSPs. It could be helpful for programmers with accessibilty issues, among many other use cases. reply crowdhailer 2 hours agoparentIt could be in principle. EYG was developed along with the editor so that has effected the design of the AST. Ideally if a useful/powerful/pleasant/intuitive structured editing experience was found for EYG (and it's minimal AST) then it would be proven to work and so putting the effort into doing for a program with a more complex AST would be worth the effort. reply daveloyall 3 hours agoprevSince this is a post about a programming tool, I expected links to repositories.

The notebooks still emit code (typically python) which is then interpreted as usual. reply naikrovek 4 hours agoprevI have wanted something like this for so long that I can’t remember when I started. Strongly coupling source code to plain text is a lost opportunity to improve tooling. reply norir 3 hours agoparentI disagree that plain text is an obstacle towards better tooling. You can do most of what the author describes with direct plain text edits pipelined into an analysis program. But I also think that the ux the author presents is undesirable. When writing new code, one must pass through a phase of broken code to reach the working code. I would not want an editor blocking me from typing a word that isn't yet defined but I do want it to notify me instantly that there is a problem.

I have wondered many times if some structural editor with a bunch of high-level library methods (Dijkstra's, for instance) would actually give a good/fast experience for most days. I haven't had the time or interest yet to try and build something yet. But perhaps I should. reply crowdhailer 2 hours agorootparentI'd love to get this to the point where add your own keybindings to structural edits, potentially very involved ones. It's superficially not very different to a combination of vim macros, auto completes or templates in other editors but I think the end result could be interesting as the units of change would be more meaningful. I think it's the same benefit of a hygienic macro system vs a source file manipulating version of meta programming. reply crabbone 2 hours agoprev> Unlike traditional text-based editors, these tools treat code as a structured tree rather than a flat sequence of characters. This is such an obvious lie... Of course, even the disastrously bad editors like VSCode or IntelliJ tools understand code to have structure and allow interaction with that structure. Hell, even text editors not intended to deal with code will usually be able to deal with some structure, like identifying words, lines, perhaps even paragraphs and operating on them. > No syntax errors. Zero time is spent on missing quotes, semi-colons or other details. Usually paid for by inability to copy and paste chunks of code... not sure if it's worth the price. > Better type information. Because the program is always in a valid state the type checker can always run and give meaningful feedback. Why would you want to run typechecker all the time? What's the benefit? I run it when I'm interested in the results... otherwise it's just noise. By the time I'm interested in results, I'd get code in a decent enough shape to compile, so it won't be a problem. Other known downsides of this approach: having to access the code in places where the editor isn't available, s.a. reading diffs, debugging, running third-party tools unaware of structured format (which, given how our programming practices have developed, will be inconsistent between versions and platforms). All in all, I've seen these attempts multiple times before, and it always looks like the benefits simply aren't worth the effort. Or, maybe, too many stars need to align in order for this to actually become really useful in the day-to-day programming work, and so it doesn't happen because of some circular dependency where the tools won't be built, until the product is good enough to use, but the product is never good enough to use because there aren't any tools? reply rzwitserloot 3 hours agoprev [–] I've been toying with the idea of making something very very much lik this, but, for an existing language. Which makes it far, far more complicated; I'm sure various aspects of the design of whatever language one would build this for are needlessly convoluted due to not having been designed with this kind of editing in mind. A few concerns: * As developers, our 'world' is so defined by text, we textify things that aren't: We write marked up documentation in plain text (HTML, markdown, etc) and we despise using tools like LibreOffice to write that sort of thing, and we even 'draw' helpful graphs in `.dot` files. We do this for a good reason: It 'works' with our other tools. git itself, and the cavalcade of git-understanding frontend version control systems, are excellent at showing you diffs between textual representations. They don't do 'diffs between these 2 png files' or 'diffs between these two .docx files' well or at all. Hence, these projects either balloon, or need a pragmatic take. Either you staple 'also reinvent git' onto the project (and in passing you are increasing the hurdle to adopt or try out this stuff for any interested folk), or you think about how to adapt the idea to fit existing practices. In this specific case the latter seems like the obvious answer: The way to store the program is as a file that, if opened in a text editor, looks just like it. But, I _can_ edit files in git and it looks like a text file even if it really isn't; so what happens if I edit an eyg file with a text editor? How 'perfect' must it be? What happens if in hand-editing the file I added some whitespace that shouldn't have been there as per the canonical storage rule? These are all easily solvable details, of course. But it's where my brain went. I'm pretty sure the correct answer is 'the source file is still text and is still readable; it's just that the language has some extreme style requirements (think about a language that has no line continuation facilities whatsoever, long lines will just have to be long lines, and dictates exactly how many tabs you can insert; indenting with spaces is not allowed at all, that sort of thing). This is fine because the language is meant to be read as plain text but only edited with the structural editor. * I often try to think how it would be if I was doing my programming work with a structural editor. From time to time I do things that seem blatantly annoying if I only had a structural editor. Where I really _want_ to dip into syntactically utterly invalid gobbledygook because I'm doing some text edits which will get back to valid code but I go through invalid code. For example, block-based copy/pasting (block = multiselect/multicursor). I'm having a hard time seeing how that would work in a structural editor but I use it from time to time. It feels like a structural editor can hopefully come up with alternatives for all the use cases but I'm not sure. Should there instead be a 'fallback' option where your source file turns into raw text mode and your edit functionality is like any plain jane text editor, you do your text-based transformations and then when done exit that mode, at which point the structural editor reparses what you have. I think that's right but it means the language does, actually, need all the bells and whistles after all: A Parser, an AST, good error handling for syntax errors, and so forth. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
