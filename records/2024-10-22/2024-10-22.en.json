I'm just over here worried about small nothings and now I'm filled with an overwhelming feeling that I should be a part of something much larger. Truly inspiring, and a little bitter sweet. :) reply glimshe 2 hours agoparentWhen I look to the heavens in awe, thinking about humanity's future and our place in the Universe, I remember that we still have JavaScript and thus very far from space exploration. reply araes 1 hour agorootparentThat's alright, Javascript already has space travel. [1] And quite a few other software languages [2]: Credit to Andrei Kashcha (Github anvaka) [3] previous post on Hacker News for \"Software Galaxies\" [2] Also, to @ratedgene if you feel left out, you should be part of something meaningful. Go join the exploration mission for space travel and astronomy. It's a resume submission away. [4] Having worked at NASA, the work environment, while critical and argumentative much of the time, is still very much sci-fi fans and the dream of galaxies far far away. If European, then ESA. [5] If Asiatic, possibly JAXA [6], China's space agency [7] is usually off limits to posters on HN. If not those, how about grants and research in related areas. There are many ways to contribute.

It really is f'ing massive out there huh. Makes me wonder what this is all about, I'm sure it's something, I wonder what. :) reply layer8 6 hours agoparentIt’s even more “massive” down below. There are only 27 orders of magnitude between human size and the size of the observable universe, but 35 orders of magnitude between human size and the Planck length. ;) reply lynguist 44 minutes agorootparentSo we are rather “large” beings and not small ones.

If it were 1902, you'd probably be mocking the Wright brothers. reply dreamcompiler 2 hours agorootparentThere are three levels of difficulty in innovation: New Engineering, New Science, and New Fundamentals. What the Wright Brothers did was the easiest of the three: New engineering. It didn't contradict anything then known in accepted science. Fusion energy is being studied now, and it's substantially more difficult than what the Wright brothers did because it requires New Science. But it doesn't violate any of the accepted fundamentals of the universe, so it will probably happen eventually. Now we come to the most difficult of the three: New Fundamentals. Traveling to other galaxies falls in this category. For it to work we would have to discover some brand new principle that makes the universe work, and that principle would need to be so radical that it makes what we now know about the laws of physics wrong. That's not likely to happen.

If something indeed created the universe or some definitive sequence of events spurred it into existence, I think that would constitute \"meaning\" enough for humans to be satisfied. But there is almost certainly not way to observe that fact because it is outside of the realm of our possible experiences. But even then, if we knew what caused the universe to exist, we would then be looking at the cause of the universe and wondering what caused that cause to exist.

The ecosystem is damaged, and often times destroyed by adding a single non-native species. Of course it does. \"Ecosystem\" and \"species\" and \"native\" are human terms referring to categories we invented to make sense of things. Life itself is one ongoing, unbroken, slow-burn chemical reaction at planetary scale. It's always in flux, it's always balanced in myriad ways on some timescales, unbalanced in others. Even without getting reductive to this degree, there's hardly a case an ecosystem was destroyed. Adding non-native species ends up rebalancing things, sometimes transforming them into something dissimilar to what came before - but it's not like life disappears. The ecosystem is there, just different. Though it sure sucks to be one of the life forms depending on the \"status quo\". > That doesn't seem random does it? Yes, it very much is random. If thermodynamics teaches us anything, it's that random looks quite organized if you zoom out enough and smooth over details. reply HarHarVeryFunny 6 hours agorootparentprevEvery part of the ecosystem, at any point in history, has co-evolved to be the state it is in - it's an intricate network all balanced to co-exist. If you change any part of the this ecosystem then the rest will have to adapt to the change, but evolutionary timescales are relatively long, and it's not going to settle down to where it was before. Whether you regard a new balance as simply that, or as the old balance being destroyed is just your choice of description.

Climates and ecosystems and geology change. Life on Earth has persisted through some wild misadventures and atmospheric changes, but it's a very complex system. Surely it's theoretically feasible that some surprising thing could set us off on a course towards ending up with an atmosphere similar to Venus or Mars one day? How can we know with certainty this won't happen? To me it seems like \"life-ism\" rather than species-ism at that point.

It’s mostly because of our timescale being only witness to a decline and what’s lost is tangible and known. What’s unknown is how on an evolutionary timescale the field is being reset for the next round of species to emerge. From that perspective, it’s a bit interesting to think what could happen. Particularly in the mammal world as humans have or will have eradicated most large predators. Prey populations will swell/collapse and cause adaptation. Some current herbivores/omnivores may convert to carnivore due to the availability of resources. A lot will happen. If you freeze time to protect existing species too much, it’s mostly just for sentimental reasons. Some species do a great service to current ecosystems and are vital to human life as we know it, protecting those is a little different IMO (bees come to mind.) reply phito 5 hours agorootparentprevSure but you know very well that when people say \"the planet\" they mean \"the ecosystem\". It doesn't change what I meant. There's been mass extinctions before, way worse than what will happen with human-made climate change. Life has proven to be very resilient and ecosystems re-emerge.

But all this makes sense when you realize it’s a primitive human myth made by primitive people with limited understanding of the universe and the world around them. reply protonbob 3 hours agorootparentNot to get to into the weeds but being made in the image of God does not necessarily involve physical appearance. Also, it has nothing to do with being heliocentric or geocentric. I don’t really get the point that you’re making. reply bbor 4 hours agorootparentprevWell, creation was made for one god, which happens to look just like us and never once mentions other peoples. To be a Christian astronomer you have to believe one of these: 1. God is wasting the vast, vast, vast majority of the universe on emptiness while he focuses on his fave planet. 2. The universe is full of humans, in which case Jesus is presumably getting re-crucified every few seconds to absolve new groups. Or I guess maybe he split up into a trillion copies that all got crucified at once? Or we’re the 1-in-a-trillion lucky ones that everyone else just gets to hear about? 3. The rest of the universe has aliens because god got bored/wanted things for us to play with, as his super special favorite species. The aliens don’t get to look like god, ofc. No offense intended to anyone, but I don’t see how you could possibly accept Christian doctrine without necessarily thinking of earth as unfathomably special. reply protonbob 3 hours agorootparentOh I do think it’s special. But thinking of the universe as a waste because there are lots of uninhabited planets is pretty human focused.

Hold up your thumb to the horizon and notice how many things fit alongside it compared to your thumb help downwards against the ground.

The story went that their local system was in some sort of a dust cloud, so they had no stars visible from their planet. At some point, that cloud somehow dissipated. On the planet, one of the inhabitants bothered to look up one night, and it hated everything it saw. So the race developed a space program to go out there and destroy it all.

Their historic mission was to find out if there was anything or anywhere on the other side of the sky, from which the wrecked spaceship could have come, another world maybe, strange and incomprehensible though this thought was to the enclosed minds of those who had lived beneath the sky of Krikkit. History was gathering itself to deliver another blow. Still the darkness thrummed at them, the blank enclosing darkness. It seemed closer and closer, thicker and thicker, heavier and heavier. And suddenly it was gone. They flew out of the cloud. They saw the staggering jewels of the night in their infinite dust and their minds sang with fear. For a while they flew on, motionless against the starry sweep of the Galaxy, itself motionless against the infinite sweep of the Universe. And then they turned around. \"It'll have to go,\" the men of Krikkit said as they headed back for home.

Maybe these species are distributed evenly throughout our 90-billion-lightyear-in-diameter universe. Maybe half evolved to our current level of sophistication in less time than it took us. So... what is the minimum duration of time, after the big bang, that some lineage of creatures might take to evolve from sludge into a life form capable of emitting data via radio waves? It cannot happen instantaneously... first conditions need to cool down enough to be amenable. Beyond that, it seems to require a little time for evolution to get to human-like level, it took us 13+ billion years.

So even if you assume an earth like planet couldn't have formed any earlier than ours, other intelligent life in the galaxy only has to go through the geological processes and evolve a tiny tiny fraction of a percent faster to have tons of time to send all the signals they ever want. Nearest other galaxy is only a couple million LYA which ain't too bad either. reply thomassmith65 12 hours agorootparentMy guess, again based on the lack of cosmic signals we have detected, is that intelligent life is rare enough - at this age of the universe, at least - that we have no company yet in the Milky Way. That leaves a lot of room though - there might already be simpler forms of life. But I won't go to the mat arguing my impression; we only have evidence from one planet to go by, so any view here lacks empirical evidence. reply rvnx 17 hours agorootparentprevIt depends what you call Life. If it is a machine that can reproduce itself, growth, collect energy, use energy, do actions based on events, etc, then animals match this profile (perhaps even plants), and also, at some point computer will probably reach that goal.

We have the technology and knowledge to adapt, change course, finally get of fossil fuels, and enter into a new age of sustainable renewable energy.

That’s about 100^5, so one way to think of this is that if you categories these by any four properties (temperature, stability, hydration, day length) then you’d expect about 100 samples for any point in that 4D space. So even if you believe Earth is unique along four critical metrics, there are about a hundred planets per galaxy that also have those attributes within a percentage point.

It's just too arrogant to think we currently can place odds on all the important events necessary for us or something like us to come into being. At the time this equation was devised, I'm not even sure they understood how crazy lucky the development of mitochondria was. In reality, we just don't know the many factors that might've affected our outcome. Also, it's just pure lottery falacy to reason about the statics that specifically \"we\" exist. If the odds for some strange reason settled out around about 1 of there being a single sentient species in our universe, that species would come to reason about itself and produce the same long odds of their existence. It's a longshot that a specific someone wins the lottery twice. It is a statistical inevitability that someone will win twice.

Why carbon? Because it is so dynamic. It readily forms complex molecules which interact in interesting ways. Looking at other forms of chemistry we don't see much as naturally varying as carbon.

Take two points in earths history bound by the same physical laws and life can look dramatically different. You can think of it like how we all use the same microsoft word but that doesn’t lead to the same exact book being written independently twice or more often. The amount of permutations to be taken along the way is a countless number probably far larger than the number of habitable star systems in the universe. reply kjkjadksj 16 hours agorootparentprevI agree. There is a huge bias in our culture that we imagine a human supremacy. We are the top of the food chain we think. The masters of our world we argue, despite simple bacteria being superior in all environments compared to fragile sickly humans. We not only assume that aliens would think like us, we think they would even look like us with more or less the same body plan. We think they would have the same cultural sensibilites of exploration aboard a ship, of making treaties and even sharing technology. Even in this thread you get pushback from replies and downvotes from people who are almost offended that this would not be the case. If you ever study evolution on the other hand, you would realize how fantastical these assumptions all are. No, life elsewhere if anything is far more likely to look like how it did for most of the history of life on earth: unicellular. People forget that even multicellularity, let alone an organism with an entire bodyplan, emerged from pure chance, and could have easily been wiped out or outcompeted for resources as soon as it came if it didn’t have sufficient fitness. How lucky it was for us that our ancient eukaryotic ancestors enveloped that first mitochondria. How different life would look today if that never happened and we never had such an energy source to actually support these later iterations, considering all life that exists today are directly descended from this single line. How supremely unlikely it all is to tread even close to the same path.

Are there too many for even astronomers to care to bother cataloguing? reply DrBazza 5 hours agoparentMost Milky Way stars have been catalogued (to some luminosity/visibility). Wikipedia to the rescue (almost...): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_catalogue#Gaia_catalogues reply bbor 5 hours agoparentprevAs another comment says we have a naming system for the Milky Way, but I believe the point of looking above and below the Milky Way is to explicitly find galaxies (/intergalactic forms), not stars. There’s commentary on stuff like supermassive black holes at the center of other galaxies, but AFAIK as an amateur, it’s not feasible to study individual stars in other galaxies, so we have no need to name the vast majority of them. It’s basically impossible to grasp what looking at a hundred thousand galaxies means, and that’s just a small section. It’s literally beyond human comprehension. In October 2016, deep-field images from the Hubble Space Telescope suggested that there are about 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe, or about 10 times more galaxies than previously suggested, according to the journal Nature. In an email with Live Science, lead author Christopher Conselice, a professor of astrophysics at the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom, said there were about 100 million stars in the average galaxy. Which comes out around 10^24, and even that’s “likely an underestimation”. The earth’s surface area is 10^8 km^2, so naming all the stars would be like naming every spot in an imaginary grid of 0.01mm^2 (!!!) squares covering the whole earth.

And they will study the code and discover their own \"natural laws\" and invent their own things. And they will progress until they create a completely simulated world of their own.

In a way our universe is very lazy, at large scales where consciousness exists the universe is coherent, predictable. The smaller you get the lazier and fuzzier the universe gets to save computational work. The actual state of things is only computed on small scales when you measure them. The speed of light puts limits on how far humanity can travel to extend the bounds of the simulation. Maybe the expansion of the universe is yet another hedge at limiting how far human can travel. Also, as things are red shifted due to expansion you can run the simulation of far away places slower due to time dilation. The speed of light and the plank length are both hard codes to bound computational work. The plank length to bound computation getting too complex in the micro scale and the speed of light to limit computation in the macro scale. It is also very convenient that the closer we look at things the more we see that under the hood things are discrete which is very convenient for simulating. Maybe every level of the sim increases the plank length and decreases the speed of light in order to deal with inefficiency of doing a sim within a sim? Maybe at the final level of the sim we end up with the truman show. reply ffwd 14 hours agorootparentThis is an interesting idea but personally I think the opposite - the universe is not lazy and all details matter at all levels. Like imagine making a complete account of all world views of all people in all of history - all perspectives, and all the physical events of that history. There is almost infinite detail there. In a way, in the universe all the details of all the things matter, including at the physical level, otherwise you wouldn't get the diversity and complexity you get now. reply dnate 2 hours agorootparentThere are a lot of ways the illusion of more detail than there actually is is given.

Using the sun as a giant gravitational lens seems much more tractable. reply cvoss 14 hours agorootparentReally? I wouldn't think the sun is nearly massive enough to do what would be required here. Stars visible near the edge of the Sun appear in slightly different spots from their actual locations. If there was a distant planet directly behind the Sun whose light were focused back to an image on our side of the Sun, you'd have to get really far back from the Sun to resolve the image, no? And furthermore, it's exceedingly difficult to orient such an apparatus to look in the desired direction; you are beholden to the orbital mechanics of your viewing satellite as it plods along. Whereas, multi-site telescopes spread across the Earth have already been demonstrated as a feasible technology (recall the black hole images). It is well within our ability to set up a constellation of satellites, perhaps spanning a few of the Earth-Sun Lagrange points. reply skykooler 12 hours agorootparentYes, you'd need to get quite far from the Sun to use it as a lens - about 650 AU is where it starts becoming practical. It would also not be re-orientable, so any \"telescope\" launched to that location would only be able to observe a single target. (But, notably, it is far easier to send a probe to a far point in our own solar system than it is to send it to another star entirely.) There's a paper that goes into much more detail at https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.06351 So why not use interferometry instead? Well, it has some significant drawbacks. For example: the Event Horizon Telescope used radio telescopes - and pretty much had to, due to how interferometry works: you need to be able to compare the phase shifts between the multiple telescopes, which means you need to be able to sample the signal faster than the radio frequency you're using and record it. The EHT records 64 gigabits per second for each telescope, and then all this data needs to be combined to compute the resolved image. This amount of data would be problematic for space-based telescopes - even on Earth, it was not practical to send multiple petabytes over the internet, so it was saved to hard drives which were shipped by truck instead. This isn't practical in space, so you would need to transmit the data by radio, which means you'd end up with some crazy ratio of thousands of hours of transmitting for every one hour you spend recording. reply mlyle 12 hours agorootparentprevhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_gravitational_lens > you'd have to get really far back from the Sun to resolve the image, no? Yah, a few hundred AU. > you are beholden to the orbital mechanics of your viewing satellite as it plods along. Yah, any mission like this -- interferometry or gravitational lensing -- is going to be super long and hit very few targets. > Whereas, multi-site telescopes spread across the Earth have already been demonstrated as a feasible technology Yah, at radio frequency while pinned to a common rock. The wavelength of visible light is hundreds of nanometers and we're talking across massive distances and significant gravity gradients and even relativistic corrections. The \"big\" space interferometers currently being considered are in the mid-infrared (e.g. longer wavelengths) across baselines of hundreds of meters. All of these ideas are really hard. reply stouset 12 hours agorootparentprev> Really? I wouldn't think the sun is nearly massive enough to do what would be required here. You \"just\" need to get far enough away (~600AU). Interferometry is extremely difficult to pull this off with and it’s further complicated by the host star being so much brighter than the exoplanet.

First it was the simple act of looking up to a mysterious, clean and regular clockwork unfolding in the heavens. The fortuitous match of eye structure, atmospheric transparency to certain wavelengths etc. that created a permanent mental stimulus that was complex yet not beyond grasp. Astronomy and the development of Mathematics were closely intertwined in the dawn of civilization [2]. Then it was the invention of the telescope [3], one of our first sensory-extension devices, that marked the beginning of the modern science and technology era. Culminating into the satellite era (detached \"eyes\" lifted into low-Earth orbits) and the incredible ESA projects like Euclid (looking out at the furtherst reaches of space) and Copernicus [4] (looking back at us and our predicament).

During this survey, the telescope observes the shapes, distances and motions of billions of galaxies out to 10 billion light-years. By doing this, it will create the largest cosmic 3D map ever made.

Anyway, from Kant’s Wikipedia: In the Universal Natural History, Kant laid out the nebular hypothesis, in which he deduced that the Solar System had formed from a large cloud of gas, a nebula. Kant also correctly deduced that the Milky Way was a large disk of stars, which he theorized formed from a much larger spinning gas cloud. He further suggested that other distant \"nebulae\" might be other galaxies.

Read Later Kristina Armitage/Quanta Magazine Introduction By Jordana Cepelewicz Math Editor October 21, 2024 View PDF/Print Mode algebraic geometry combinatorics history of science integers mathematics modular forms number theory profiles statistical physics All topics (opens a new tab) One afternoon in January 2011, Hussein Mourtada (opens a new tab) leapt onto his desk and started dancing. He wasn’t alone: Some of the graduate students who shared his Paris office were there, too. But he didn’t care. The mathematician realized that he could finally confirm a sneaking suspicion he’d first had while writing his doctoral dissertation, which he’d finished a few months earlier. He’d been studying special points, called singularities, where curves cross themselves or come to sharp turns. Now he had unexpectedly found what he’d been looking for, a way to prove that these singularities had a surprisingly deep underlying structure. Hidden within that structure were mysterious mathematical statements first written down a century earlier by a young Indian mathematician named Srinivasa Ramanujan. They had come to him in a dream. Ramanujan brings life to the myth of the self-taught genius. He grew up poor and uneducated and did much of his research while isolated in southern India, barely able to afford food. In 1912, when he was 24, he began to send a series of letters to prominent mathematicians. These were mostly ignored, but one recipient, the English mathematician G.H. Hardy, corresponded with Ramanujan for a year and eventually persuaded him to come to England, smoothing the way with the colonial bureaucracies. It became apparent to Hardy and his colleagues that Ramanujan could sense mathematical truths — could access entire worlds — that others simply could not. (Hardy, a mathematical giant in his own right, is said to have quipped that his greatest contribution to mathematics was the discovery of Ramanujan.) Before Ramanujan died in 1920 at the age of 32, he came up with thousands of elegant and surprising results, often without proof. He was fond of saying that his equations had been bestowed on him by the gods. More than 100 years later, mathematicians are still trying to catch up to Ramanujan’s divine genius, as his visions appear again and again in disparate corners of the world of mathematics. The English mathematician G.H. Hardy, after receiving a letter from Ramanujan and recognizing his brilliance, arranged for him to study and work with him in Cambridge. Alamy Ramanujan is perhaps most famous for coming up with partition identities, equations about the different ways you can break a whole number up into smaller parts (such as 7 = 5 + 1 + 1). In the 1980s, mathematicians began to find deep and surprising connections between these equations and other areas of mathematics: in statistical mechanics and the study of phase transitions, in knot theory and string theory, in number theory and representation theory and the study of symmetries. Most recently, they’ve appeared in Mourtada’s work on curves and surfaces that are defined by algebraic equations, an area of study called algebraic geometry. Mourtada and his collaborators have spent more than a decade trying to better understand that link, and to exploit it to uncover rafts of brand-new identities that resemble those Ramanujan wrote down. “It turned out that these kinds of results have basically occurred in almost every branch of mathematics. That’s an amazing thing,” said Ole Warnaar (opens a new tab) of the University of Queensland in Australia. “It’s not just a happy coincidence. I don’t want to sound religious, but the mathematical god is trying to tell us something.” New Worlds Ramanujan’s mathematical prowess was obvious to those who knew him. Without formal training, he excelled; by the time he was in high school he had devoured advanced, though often outdated, textbooks, and was doing independent research on different kinds of numerical properties and patterns. In 1904, he was granted a full scholarship to the Government Arts College in Kumbakonam, the small city where he had grown up, in what is now the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. But he ignored all subjects besides math and lost his scholarship within a year. He later enrolled in another university, this time in Madras (now Chennai), the provincial capital some 250 kilometers north. Again he flunked out. After failing out of college, Ramanujan ran away from home, prompting his mother to post a missing-person notice in The Hindu. The Hindu He continued his research on his own for years, often while in poor health. During that time, he tutored students in math to support himself. Eventually he secured a job as a clerk at the Madras Port Trust in 1912. He pursued mathematics on the side and published some of his results in Indian journals. Hoping to get some of his work into more prestigious and widely read publications, Ramanujan wrote letters to several British mathematicians, enclosing pages of findings for their review. “I have not trodden through the conventional regular course which is followed in a university course,” he wrote, “but I am striking out a new path for myself.” Among the recipients was Hardy, an expert in number theory and analysis at the University of Cambridge. Ramanujan’s first letter to G.H. Hardy included formulas (5), (6) and (7), strange nested fractions that Hardy said “defeated me completely; I had never seen anything in the least like them before.” Courtesy of Ken Ono Hardy was shocked at what he saw. Ramanujan had identified and then solved a number of continued fractions — expressions that can be written as infinite nests of fractions within fractions, such as: They “defeated me completely; I had never seen anything in the least like them before,” Hardy later wrote. “They must be true because, if they were not true, no one would have had the imagination to invent them.” The formulas, unproved, were so striking that they inspired Hardy to offer Ramanujan a fellowship at Cambridge. In 1914, Ramanujan arrived in England, and for the next five years he studied and collaborated with Hardy. L.J. Rogers proved a set of equations in 1894, but no one read his work. He later became famous when Ramanujan independently discovered the formulas 20 years later. Wikimedia One of Ramanujan’s first tasks was to prove a general statement about his continued fractions. To do so, he needed to prove two other statements. But he couldn’t. Neither could Hardy, nor could any of the colleagues he reached out to. It turned out that they didn’t need to. The statements had been proved 20 years earlier by a little-known English mathematician named L.J. Rogers. Rogers wrote poorly, and at the time the proofs were published no one paid any attention. (Rogers was content to do his research in relative obscurity, play piano, garden and apply his spare time to a variety of other pursuits.) Ramanujan uncovered this work in 1917, and the pair of statements later became known as the Rogers-Ramanujan identities. Amid Ramanujan’s prodigious output, these statements stand out. They have carried through the decades and across nearly all of mathematics. They are the seeds that mathematicians continue to sow, growing brilliant new gardens seemingly wherever they fall. Ramanujan fell ill and returned to India in 1919, where he died the next year. It would fall to others to explore the world his identities had revealed. The Music of the Game Hussein Mourtada grew up in the 1980s in Lebanon, in a small city called Baalbek. As a teenager, he didn’t like studying and preferred to play: soccer, billiards, basketball. Math, too. “It looked like a game,” he said. “And I liked playing.” As an undergraduate at the Lebanese University in Beirut, he studied both law and mathematics, with an eye to a legal career. But he soon found that while he enjoyed the philosophical aspects of law, he did not enjoy it in practice. He turned his attention to math, where he was particularly drawn to the community. As a child, his teachers and classmates were what excited him about going to school, even though he often fell asleep during class. As a budding mathematician, “I had the impression that these are beautiful people,” he said. “They are honest. You need to be honest with yourself to be a mathematician. Otherwise, it doesn’t work.” Hussein Mourtada has been bringing Ramanujan’s work into the 21st century. Basma Jaffal He moved to France for his doctorate and started to focus on algebraic geometry — the study of algebraic varieties, or shapes cut out by polynomial equations. These are equations that can be written as sums of variables raised to whole-number powers. A line, for instance, is cut out by the equation x + y = 0, a circle by x2 + y2 = 1, a figure eight by x4 = x2 − y2. While the line and circle are completely smooth, the figure eight has a point where it intersects itself — a singularity. It’s easy to spot singularities when you’re dealing with shapes that you can draw on a sheet of paper. But higher-dimensional algebraic varieties are far more complicated and impossible to visualize. Algebraic geometers are in the business of understanding their singularities, too. They’ve developed all sorts of tools to do this. One dates back to the mathematician John Nash, who in the 1960s started studying related objects called arc spaces. Nash would take a point, or singularity, and define infinitely many short trajectories — little arcs — that passed through it. By looking at all these short trajectories together, he could test how smooth his variety was at that point. “If you want to see if it’s smooth, you want to pet it,” said Gleb Pogudin (opens a new tab) of the École Polytechnique in France. In practical terms, an arc space provides an infinite collection of polynomial equations. “This is really the thing that Mourtada is expert in: understanding the meaning of those equations,” said Bernard Teissier (opens a new tab), a colleague of Mourtada’s at the Institute of Mathematics of Jussieu in Paris. “Because these equations can be very complicated. But they have a certain music to them. There is a lot of structure which governs the nature of these equations, and he’s just the person, I think, who best listens to this music and understands what it means.” Share this article Copied!

Trinity College, Cambridge Shortly after graduate school, Mourtada and two other young mathematicians, Jan Schepers and Clemens Bruschek, were studying the arc space associated with a very simple kind of singularity. They broke up the space to better understand it, just as an archaeologist separately examines the layers of an ancient site. Eventually they got stuck, but something kept nagging at Mourtada. He and his colleagues had computed a series of numbers. These numbers corresponded to how many polynomials there were in each of the first few pieces of the arc space. They somehow looked familiar. “I kept on repeating them like a child,” he said. “And then suddenly I remembered.” Hidden Patterns Everywhere The Rogers-Ramanujan identities are like an enormous cut emerald: immensely complex and beautiful, and appearing utterly different depending on your perspective. Ramanujan has become a celebrity in the world of mathematics. In 2011, India issued a commemorative postage stamp in his memory; a few years later, a film was made about his life. India Post, Government of India Each identity sets a complicated infinite sum equal to a complicated infinite product. As such, the statements reveal a strange link between two mathematical functions (addition and multiplication) that shouldn’t, in this context, have much to do with each other. Other researchers quickly came to see unexpected mathematical wonders in them. The English mathematician Percy MacMahon started his career in the late 19th century as a soldier, only for illness to steer him away from the military and into math. In 1915, he was writing the first comprehensive textbook on combinatorics, a subject that deals with counting methods. He read about the equations that would later be dubbed the Rogers-Ramanujan identities and realized that just below the surface, the functions on either side of the equal sign were also about counting. Consider an integer such as the number 4. It can be broken up into parts in a finite number of ways: You can write it as 4, as 3 + 1, as 2 + 2, as 2 + 1 + 1 or as 1 + 1 + 1 + 1. Mathematicians say that the number 4 has five “partitions.” Bigger numbers have far more partitions: The number 200, for instance, has nearly 4 trillion. Partitions are so basic that “people have thought about them as long as people have thought about mathematics,” said Andrew Sills (opens a new tab) of Georgia Southern University. It’s not just a happy coincidence. I don’t want to sound religious, but the mathematical god is trying to tell us something. Ole Warnaar, University of Queensland The first mathematician to study partitions systematically was Leonhard Euler in the 18th century. He proved the very first partition identity: that for any integer (say, 4), the number of partitions whose parts are all odd (two partitions in this case: 3 + 1 and 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) is equal to the number of partitions whose parts are all distinct, meaning there are no repetitions among them (4 and 3 + 1). MacMahon saw that the two Rogers-Ramanujan identities could be interpreted in a similar way. (The German mathematician Issai Schur, isolated due to World War I, independently discovered the identities and came to the same conclusion.) The sum side of the first Rogers-Ramanujan identity counts the number of partitions of a given integer that don’t have any duplicated or consecutive parts. (For the number 4, there are two: 4 and 3 + 1.) The product side counts the number of partitions whose parts all leave a remainder of 1 or 4 when divided by 5 (4 and 1 + 1 + 1 + 1). For any integer, the number of partitions satisfying each condition will always be equal. Mark Belan/Quanta Magazine “This is a very weird fact. It’s mysterious,” said Shashank Kanade (opens a new tab) of the University of Denver. “I mean, where did the 5 come from?” For much of the 20th century, mathematicians would delight in thinking about the strange hidden phenomena that Ramanujan had unearthed. During World War II, for instance, the physicist Freeman Dyson wrote that he “kept sane by wandering in Ramanujan’s garden.” In the 1970s and ’80s, Rodney Baxter (top) and James Lepowsky found surprising connections between the Rogers-Ramanujan identities and other areas of math — statistical physics and representation theory, respectively. But it wasn’t until the late 1970s that they uncovered additional facets of the Rogers-Ramanujan identities. It started when an Australian physicist named Rodney Baxter (opens a new tab) created a simplified model of a gas in order to understand phase transitions, the points at which a system’s behavior suddenly changes (like when liquid water turns to ice). While computing certain key numbers in his model, he rediscovered the Rogers-Ramanujan identities through the lens of statistical mechanics. Around the same time, the Rutgers mathematicians James Lepowsky (opens a new tab) and Robert Wilson (opens a new tab) proved that the Rogers-Ramanujan identities also arise in representation theory, the mathematical study of special symmetries. Their result opened a whole new field — the theory of so-called vertex operator algebras, which are used today in string theory, and which played a key role in one of the biggest recent results in group theory: the proof of the “monstrous moonshine” conjectures. “You begin to see that these identities are natural. They are part of a general frame of things, which is much, much more general than just the partition identities,” Teissier said. This trend of the Rogers-Ramanujan identities surfacing in various fields of mathematics continued into the 1990s and 2000s. They appeared in number theory, in the study of central functions called modular forms; in probability theory, in work on Markov chains; and in topology, in polynomials used to distinguish and classify knots. Each time, the identities could be re-proved using techniques from those fields — and each time, mathematicians could exploit those connections to produce new identities, planting more and more seeds in Ramanujan’s garden. Magic Numbers In 2010, as Mourtada was pondering the arc space of a simple singularity called a fat point, he had something of a revelation. To understand the singularity’s deeper structure, he had divided the corresponding arc space — essentially a complicated system of infinitely many polynomial equations — into layers, and had started to count the number of polynomials in each one. Hardy and Ramanujan collaborated closely for years. They exchanged letters about mathematics until Ramanujan’s death. Trinity College, Cambridge The numbers he ended up with, he noticed, weren’t random. The sum side of the Rogers-Ramanujan identity — the number of partitions with no equal or consecutive parts — “suddenly came to my mind,” he said. “I figured out that even if I was counting something which is different from partitions, this was actually exactly what I was counting.” It made sense, he realized. It’s long been known that you can associate a polynomial equation to any partition. But each piece of Mourtada’s arc space included only a specific subset of polynomials, and therefore only a specific subset of partitions. And Mourtada wanted to count them — precisely the purview of partition identities such as those of Rogers and Ramanujan. In 1976, George Andrews discovered Ramanujan’s “lost notebook” — 100 loose-leaf pages of (unproved) results that Ramanujan came up with in the year before he died. Vladimir and Mariana Tonchev He, Bruschek and Schepers proved that the structure of their arc space could be described by this identity. “It’s very surprising that such a simple singularity could have such a deep underlying structure,” Schepers said. “We were very excited.” Excited enough for Mourtada to jump on his desk. Bruschek and Schepers left mathematics soon afterward. But Mourtada continued to build on their work. “You could say this was the baby case,” Teissier said. Over the next decade, “he made the whole thing much more conceptual … a completely general type of business.” In 2015, a young Iranian mathematician named Pooneh Afsharijoo (opens a new tab) arrived in France to begin her graduate studies with Mourtada. Since then, the two have been working together to understand many other (and much more complicated) singularities and their arc spaces. That’s led them to find a wealth of new identities — and an extension of the oldest one. The Rogers-Ramanujan identity says that the same number of partitions always satisfies two very different conditions. Afsharijoo, now a postdoctoral researcher at the Complutense University of Madrid, discovered a third condition, expanding the scope of the original identity that Ramanujan had written down over 100 years earlier. Now, Mourtada and Afsharijoo are also using networks of points and edges called graphs to represent information about their arc spaces, allowing them to apply tools from graph theory to uncover additional novel partition identities. This new connection adds even more evidence to “the magic which is inside the integers,” Afsharijoo said. Partitions and the Primes Every time the Rogers-Ramanujan identities pop up somewhere new, mathematicians are both surprised and unsurprised. The unexpected appearance of the identities offers a fresh connection to explore, further evidence of the mysterious unity between the many different fields of math. “The surprise of it has not worn off. It still seems unreasonable that all these things are true,” said George Andrews (opens a new tab) of Pennsylvania State University. A Life Inspired by an Unexpected Genius Q&A A Life Inspired by an Unexpected Genius May 19, 2016 Read Later But when it comes to these identities, everyone also expects the unexpected. “That’s kind of the trademark of Ramanujan’s kind of mathematics,” said Ken Ono (opens a new tab) of the University of Virginia. In September, Ono and two collaborators — William Craig and Jan-Willem van Ittersum — published yet another application (opens a new tab) for partition identities. Rather than looking for a new source from which these identities would spring, they were able to use them for an entirely different purpose: to detect prime numbers. They took functions that counted partitions and used them to build a special formula. When you plug any prime number into this equation, it spits out zero. When you plug in any other number, it instead spits out a positive number. In this way, the partition identities can give you a way to pick out the entire set of primes from the integers, Ono said. “Isn’t that crazy?” “Partitions are about adding and counting,” he said. “Why would they be able to detect which numbers are prime or not, on the nose, which is a multiplication thing?” By tapping into the rich mathematical theory of modular forms, he and his colleagues found that this formula was just a glimpse of a much larger class of prime-detecting functions — infinitely many, in fact. “That’s mind-blowing to me,” Ono said. “I hope people find it beautiful.” It indicates a deeper relation between the partitions and multiplicative number theory that mathematicians are now hoping to explore. Related: Mathematicians Chase Moonshine’s Shadow Three Puzzles Inspired by Ramanujan Behold Modular Forms, the ‘Fifth Fundamental Operation’ of Math In some ways, it makes sense that partitions keep infiltrating every corner of mathematics. “The theory of partitions is so basic,” Andrews said. “Counting stuff and adding stuff up happens in almost every branch of mathematics.” Still, the precise nature of those connections is hard to work out. “It’s really about getting the perspective right,” Ono said. “This is the great thing about Ramanujan’s work,” Kanade said. “It’s not just one identity he discovered, and a dead end. It’s always the tip of an iceberg. You just have to follow it through.” “Ramanujan is someone who can imagine things that someone like me cannot,” Mourtada said. But the development of new fields of mathematics has “given us the possibility to find new partition identities that Ramanujan could probably have found just by imagination.” “That’s why mathematics is so important,” he added. “It allows ordinary people like me to find these miracles, too.” By Jordana Cepelewicz Math Editor October 21, 2024 View PDF/Print Mode algebraic geometry combinatorics history of science integers mathematics modular forms number theory profiles statistical physics All topics (opens a new tab) Share this article Copied!

Maybe there are other topics where the same phemonen exists. I'm not sure if off the top of my head I can think of one where it gets so intense so quickly - long, detailed, emotionally charged anecdotes immediately when school comes up! [I love a good yarn, and am not judging or belittling people for expressing themselves here, I must stress]. I have speculated in my comfy armchair as to why our education structures seem to make venting such a need for people. Anecdotally, there does seem to be a suggestion of some sort of lingering and powerful malaise around the whole thing, in any case. I wonder if it's like an abusive relationship - the emotional work required to move on and have better relationships (i.e., different educational structures) gets so large at some stage that all you can focus on is \"coping\". And you're sort of stuck, and the cycle more or less continues. EDIT: may I just add - I read that whole article, and am very fond of Ramanujan. He made university much harder for me when I learned about his existence, as my maths classes seemed so far removed from whatever it was he was doing. reply jmcqk6 3 hours agoparentI think there is another force at play here - the assumption that there is a platonic ideal good education system that works at every scale of population. Attempting to scale something that large forces people into boxes that fit inside the framework - one must necessarily ignore little detailed differences between humans. But from the perspective of those individual humans, ignoring those little details doesn't really work. Those things are important, and tend to ping our egos, so we react accordingly, and are eager for opportunities to give voice to this frustration. reply everdrive 1 hour agorootparentThere's another potentially missed point. There is no education system, nor any amount of effort which could have granted me the genius of Ramanjuan. He had something I never will. It would be like dream to run faster than Usain Bolt. reply jmcqk6 37 minutes agorootparentOn the other hand, it's likely that you have the potential to be really good at something that is totally outside your awareness right now, and having a broad education can be beneficial to expanding your exposure to such possibility. reply vladimirralev 15 minutes agoparentprev> massive influx of personal anecdotes a.k.a. sampling from the distribution of interest. Once you have enough anecdotes, you actually have a representative distribution of the real thing. Selection may be biased but you can weight those data points as you like, it's still good data. reply danmaz74 1 minute agorootparentExcept for the fact that anecdotes aren't a random sample, they're selected because they're interesting. reply burkaman 4 hours agoparentprevI think it's just because every single person here has at least a decade of personal experience in education. One of the things many people like about HN is that when an article about some obscure subject is posted, there is often someone in the comments with personal experience who can share a story. Education is one of the few subjects where we can all be that person. reply cassepipe 4 hours agoparentprevMy guess would be it's because it's an experience (most of us) have in common in years full of first times. It's also an experience that took as least as much space in our life than work now does. It's also a place where we had to deal authority and groups. So whenever you make any point about education, if the point you are making seems to negate/go against the grain of my own experience, I will probably tell you :) (Venting is a need that everyone has when under pressure not sure it has anything to do with our education structures) reply ok123456 1 hour agoparentprevTrama mostly. reply sanj 3 hours agoparentprevParenting. reply dgfitz 1 hour agorootparentThis is the long and short of it.

I just have an inkling it is good for children to see a contrast of parents, not just one parent. reply babyent 18 hours agoprevThat was a fun read. What really stuck out to me was how R failed in a bunch of other subjects except math because he wasn’t interested in them. I know society and norms expect students to learn all these other subjects. But what if those just aren’t interesting to someone? I wonder how many geniuses we skip on because doing the chores of homework and getting through boring classes is busywork and memorization for the sake of getting an A. Meanwhile, hardly anyone actually remembers anything about those topics and even the best students mostly go on to achieve only above average things. My class valedictorian went on to become a doctor and while that is certainly impressive to me, there are many doctors and he practices (like almost every other doctor) and isn’t pushing the boundaries of medical science. I feel terrible writing that because I’m certainly not as smart as him, but R is just so impressive and I’m glad he got his lucky break. People like R would be lost in the sea of averages because their genius would be kept shut by norms. Almost every extraordinary person I read about seems like they were 1 step away from being forgotten, and got some huge universal break that boosted them. reply nordsieck 18 hours agoparentIMO, you're thinking about this backwards. It's good that public school exposes children to many subjects - hopefully most of them. So that they can discover if they click with one of them. The real danger is that someone never gets exposed to a subject at all. College is the place to specialize in a subject. reply seiferteric 18 hours agorootparentExposure is good, but success in school requires you to be successful in these subjects as well. I have had similar thoughts recently as OP thinking about what I want for my young kids and what my experiences in school were. Being _really_ good in one thing should allow you to make up for being subpar in other areas, but it doesn't. You can only get an A (or A+) in math for example, even if your a genius. But maybe you should be able to get an A++++ that makes up for D's or F's in English for example and still get accepted into top universities. We need a system that accommodates spiky people better. reply jyunwai 17 hours agorootparentThe admissions process to universities in the province of Ontario in Canada has a direct solution for this, which applies to well-known universities in the global technology industry, such as the University of Toronto and the University of Waterloo. Most of these universities look at an applicant's grades for just six courses. After looking at the courses required for certain programs (such as calculus and physics for certain programs), the remainder of the six courses comprise the student's top grades for any courses at the Grade 12 (final year) level. So, a high school student aiming for a top engineering or mathematics program will not be hamstrung by a poor grade in Grade 12 English, nor will a student aiming for a top international relations program be hamstrung by a poor grade in Calculus. At the same time, the student going into a STEM program will have an exposure to Shakespeare, which can provide inspiration and a rich set of works to explore later in life. The student going into international relations may later be inspired some years later to study mathematics for its beauty as a hobby, some years later. I remember the feeling that I was wasting time with many of my courses in those years, despite having good teachers for many of them—I thought my time spent on mandatory humanities courses like music took time away from more practical subjects, and I wish I took a programming course (though I did love my English classes). Perhaps this remains true for many students, but I personally took an interest in music performance as a hobby years later in life, and the years-old lessons in music theory came back to me. My English classes also introduced me to literature, which has remained a very important part of my life that has guided me through highly consequential life decisions for the better. It is unlikely that I would have taken an interest in literary works without my exposure to English in school. reply jjmarr 4 hours agorootparentIn 2024 you are not getting into Waterloo CS with anything less than a 99% in your top6. And that's the entry level. If you really want to get in, you have to grind math competitions, clubs, etc. I go to a mid-tier university (Toronto Metropolitan University) and the admissions average for CS was 97% last year. The admissions process for universities in Ontario is a joke at this point. Imagine if students going to Harvard instead of SUNY Plattsburgh differed by 2 percentage points in their high school averages. This means you must be absolutely perfect to have a shot of getting into a good school. In reality, teachers overlook mistakes and just give you the marks needed to get into top school if they think you deserve it. But because everyone does that, you also need to farm extracurriculars. Maybe I'll write a blog post about this since it sounds like people are interested. reply theLiminator 54 minutes agorootparentImo school grades should be disregarded entirely. We should bring back standardized testing, but make the ceiling much higher. Most people should score fairly low on it. This way, you can really see how good people are. At this point, people just get weeded out in university. This would also help the case of people like Ramanujan, he might score perfectly on the math portion of the standardized tests, and despite poor scores on everything else, he'd be distinguished. reply triyambakam 34 minutes agorootparentHe might also fail the standardized test entirely. reply alephnerd 4 hours agorootparentprevThis is the same reason why STEM admission became so competitive in UCs in California. UCs historically admitted using a mix of class rank, GPA, and test scores, but the number of seats at UCs didn't really increase in the past decade+ despite a small baby boom in the 2000s, and the growing prominence of STEM in the 2010s, so the average GPAs and SAT scores for UC admissions skyrocketed. Plenty of Californians have anecdotes of getting rejected from mid-tier UCs but getting into MIT or Stanford. It's had a downstream impact out-of-state as well, as plenty of Californians now attend out-of-state STEM programs for that reason (played a major role in upleveling UT Austin/UW/UIUC/GT/UW Madison's reputations among STEM-targeting HSers ime) and make STEM admissions harder in out-of-state colleges as well. That said, education quality for STEM majors is consistent across all UCs so the UC you go to doesn't matter as much academic quality wise. reply jjmarr 3 hours agorootparentI'm convinced good students don't need good universities as much as good universities need good students. I get the same internships and job opportunities as someone that went to UofT and I'm studying much of the same curriculum. A degree from a good university signifies a smart and dedicated student primarily because the school selects the best students for graduation. That occurs during acceptance and by making the program difficult, causing bad students to leave. The higher level of competitiveness is hurting the best universities during that acceptance phase. Ontario universities are no longer able to differentiate between the best and average. Waterloo is an exception because it has introduced math competitions across the province as a way to identify \"A+++\" students, but only Waterloo benefits from that. I'm noticing that many Ontario schools are now ignoring the acceptance phase and focusing on the weed-out phase. UofT accepts students into a common math/CS program, then only accepts the best students into CS for second year onwards. Queen's University has a common first year for all engineering majors. Even so, because the acceptance phase no longer differentiates, a lot of good students that would beat the second phase are caught in the first filter. reply jyunwai 5 minutes agorootparentTo add on, I’ve worked with a lot of current and past Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU) students at an aerospace industry non-profit. I do not see a difference with their quality of work and dedication between them and University of Toronto (UofT) students. Several of these students went on to land engineering and research internships at the Canadian Space Agency or work at a well-known aerospace company. The main advantage that UofT has for its undergraduates is related to funding. UofT’s engineering design teams tend to be better-funded than TMU’s, though TMU’s engineering design teams still perform very well—proudly outperforming UofT’s teams in certain years despite the funding gaps. In addition, some TMU students I’ve spoken with mentioned that UofT has more research opportunities. The name of the university also has a positive impact on admissions for students applying to graduate school. These advantages are not a reflection of the students who attend, but rather UofT’s ability to raise funds. There is also a disadvantage I’ve seen at UofT. The TMU engineering students I’ve known have mentioned getting extensions approved easily for assignments and homework, to pursue professional opportunities such as hackathons and conferences. That is generally unheard of, from my experience in a STEM program at UofT. Policies are strictly outlined (with some leniency in many courses, such as dropping the lowest assignment mark), and I generally have not seen professors grant exceptions to these. But the main difference I’ve seen between TMU people and UofT people is university pride. I’ve met several people who were proud to go to TMU and succeed, whereas I haven’t seen that at UofT (with the exception of UofT’s engineering department). I’m satisfied with the opportunities I’ve gotten due to attending UofT—especially as I was involved with its on-campus work program and an engineering design team there—but I haven’t met many UofT people fiercely proud of their school, in contrast to the TMU people I’ve met. In any case, I am happy to work with people from either school. Work experience and personality has mattered more to me than the name of the university that a person went to, and both TMU and UofT offer great opportunities for students to gain relevant experience—though these are up to the students to pursue, outside of their required classes. alephnerd 3 hours agorootparentprev> I'm convinced good students don't need good universities as much as good universities need good students.

In Engineering+Accounting+Actuary+Nursing I agree. > The higher level of competitiveness is hurting the best universities during that acceptance phase. Ontario universities are no longer able to differentiate between the best and average. Same thing in California, and that's largely because faculty hiring and infrastructure just didn't keep pace with the amount of students declaring Engineering+Accounting+Actuary+Nursing majors (Accounting+Actuary+Nursing face the same problems as STEM fields), which meant admissions need to be much more competitive because you can only teach so many students. I assume it's a similar story in Ontario due to decades of austerity in the province. > Even so, because the acceptance phase no longer differentiates, a lot of good students that would beat the second phase are caught in the first filter. Yep. Because infrastructure didn't scale. > Waterloo is an exception because it has introduced math competitions across the province as a way to identify \"A+++\" students, but only Waterloo benefits from that Yep, the Euclid is basically a soft requirement now for Waterloo CS admissions. Honestly, Ontario should just ditch \"autonomous\" universities and merge them under a single \"University of Ontario\" system and simplifying cross-system course transfers. Ontario should also force Colleges to stop giving Bachelors degrees and convert them either into Community Colleges to transfer to a University or convert larger Colleges into Universities. This is what Quebec does, and most state systems in the US (California, Texas, New York, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Massachusetts, etc). There is no reason for UWaterloo or Wilfrid Laurier to be two different universities despite being a couple blocks away from each other. Same for UT, UT Scarborough, York, TMU/Ryerson, etc all in GTA reply computerdl 11 hours agorootparentprevAlthough I agree with the sentiment, the Ontario university system doesn't actually work that way. For example for Software Engineering at Waterloo, the admission average is calculated using the five required courses plus whatever your highest course is excluding the former[0]. In practice, I believe every single Ontario university program lists English one of the required courses so it will always be included in your top six average.

If you figure you take Math, Science, History, English in your senior year, Then take 2 electives, that is basically a full schedule already. Short of replacing one of the poor grades with a freebie like Gym, I am not seeing where that solves the issue. This might be a difference in US and Canadian education, so maybe 6 courses means something different. reply jyunwai 15 hours agorootparentA mathematics-focused student in Ontario could take Calculus & Vectors, Advanced Functions [1], Computer Science, and Physics—the first two courses should be straightforward for this student. Though Computer Science and Physics are distinctly different from the mathematics courses, these are still directly useful for a mathematics student to learn—the problem-solving skills should also carry over. Key mathematical discoveries have been inspired by problems in computer science and physics, and many rigorous university-level mathematics books still draw from problems in these fields to motivate certain problems. At the least, they are less laboratory-heavy than Biology and Chemistry (the student could still attempt these subjects, though, and choose to omit the grades for university admissions). That leaves a couple of other classes—or just one if English is required, as noted by another commenter. My school offered subjects like Grade 12 Drama, Visual Arts, and Music, where much of the grading was effort-based. In my school, most students in my classes saw these courses as a break from other intensive courses, with grades not being as much of a concern. This would allow the student to avoid using a grade for History, Economics, French (or another foreign language), or another subject. The English requirement would then be a difficult challenge for the mathematics-focused student. I wish I could speak more about what it was like for most of my classmates who went on to study engineering, as many of them took the standard English course (I took a more demanding version of the course, due to personal interest). My classmates at the time did not seem to have an issue with university admissions to competitive programs despite not enjoying the subject at the time, but the other commenter makes a good point that minimum grades for admission standards have increased greatly since then. -- [1] As an aside: a past classmate—who was brilliant at mathematics and also great with people—later poked fun some years later about the Ontario government's naming for math courses. He said, \"there's Grade 11 Functions... and then in Grade 12, there's Advanced (!) Functions.\" The last I heard, he went on to work as an investment banker at a top hedge fund by profitability in the United States. reply ecshafer 1 hour agorootparentInteresting. So it seems that from reading this, Canada, or at least Ontario, has a lot more electives at grade 12 than the US. So this might be more like the UK with their A-levels. In the US a highly motivated student might take say 4-5 AP courses, which would essentially count as their freshman year at university. But they would be unlikely (short of going to a few dedicate highschools) of having more than maybe 2 math courses in a single year. reply ckcheng 14 hours agorootparentprev> then in Grade 12, there's Advanced (!)

Then we defined subtraction, multiplication and inverse elements, and constructed Z and Q. From there you get to algebraic groups, and from there you can hand wave a lot of details.

Not with literal platitudes but with a paper you think they’ll agree with, incorporating arguments similar to the ones they made in class, etc. However, what I found is that even if the professor disagrees with your paper you’ll usually get an 80% if it’s well-written, well-researched, and well-argued. To get above that on something they disagree with requires both a highly open-minded professor and an argument they can’t find fault with. reply 3vidence 15 hours agorootparentprevNote here, in the current years, grades / competition has exploded so for the more competitive programs it is nearly impossible to get in without high 90s in all the required courses (English is required for all programs). So responding to OP, you indeed must be an expert in all subjects to have a chance to study in your field of expertise. reply atoav 12 hours agorootparentprevA few points on this: - How and when would you know a subject doesn't click? In my case German (my first language) and English sucked for roughly 8 years. I ended school with A in both and was the only student in my school without a single mistake in my exam. - School gives you good grades if you managed to learn the topics at hand. Being able to learn what is needed or what you are bad at — not what you want and are good at is a skill in itself that can be important in life. I'd argue unless you are an exceptional genius (unlike 99,999% of pupils) you gain more from pulling through than you would if you called yourself a genius and focused on a single topic. Schools goal is to educate the majority - pupils (and often also their parents) are utterly unable to judge which bits of school will be essential to their later life. I had many collegues who utterly hated every second of a multitude of subjects, only to years later tell me how glad they are now to have had been subjected to it (which brings me back to my first point) We could (and should!) argue on how school works as a system of grades, teachers and pupils — ideally teachers would motivate students to become curious about and proficient in subjects without the motivation of good or the threat of bad grades. But if my experience as an educator at the university levels (without grades in mh case) shows one thing it is that those first semester students who are really able to judge what will be useful to them later on are not many. Many of them are more like the dog in the meme: \"Only stick, no take\" — they want to be able to do the cool thing without knowing what is needed to do the cool thing. reply FeepingCreature 11 hours agorootparentI mean, just as a counter-note: I utterly hated every second of a multitude of subjects, and indeed now I am 37 and I never needed them and was entirely correct about what I would require later. reply atoav 1 hour agorootparentThis is also part of my point, e.g. having learned Italian for years was exhausting and mostly pointless when I did it, and nowadays I can somewhat understand it whenever I am in Italy, which is maybe every two years. Was that worth it for the level of skill I gained: probably not. But I wouldn't be able to tell if some of the mental agility I have today (beyond languages) could be attributed to the fact that I was exposed to this language which differs from my first languages in multiple ways. The lessons you may take away from any given subject is not necessarily limited to its raw content. This is a quite known topic in educational sciences, e.g. when answering the question why it still makes sense to teach kids how to do maths without a calculator in an age where you have it always in your pocket — that is because it (A) forms an intuition about mathematical correctness and (B) logical and numerical thinking gets trained as an side effect. Ofc all of that doesn't happen when you are unlucky enough to have had bad teachers, but that wasn't the argument. reply weweweoo 9 hours agorootparentprevPersonally I loved history, social science and geography, but none of that has been useful in working life.

I would argue that sometimes students are right when they complaint about a subject being useless or obsolete (e.g. our network professor told us everything about the OSI protocol stack in great detail, and barely touched TCP/IP), but most of the time they don't know what will be useful later in life. reply atoav 1 hour agorootparentYeah I mean, I can come up with 1000 lessons that would be utterly usless to 999 out of 1000 students in practise — but that wouldn't stop me from teaching those 1000 lessons in a way that really hooks those students to the topics discussed. On the flipside you can take the most essential, practical and important topic and deliver it with such dullness that everybody falls asleep. The first step in teaching (IMO) is to make people interested to hear what is being said. If your subject is useless and boring to most people you have to find a way to make it useful and interesting to them. This requires rethorical and social skills, good presentation skills and a deep understandingnand interest for the subjects to be thought. In reality most subjects have interesting bits, but is the task of the teacher to make them relate to the world. If your prof thougth you about the OSI protocol stack so long everybody forgot its practical applications and how it binds together with higher level stuff, that is certainly knowledge, but it doesn't help you making it part of your understanding of the world. reply CM30 9 hours agorootparentprevYeah, these are definitely points worth noting. Especially as in many cases, the way something is taught can have a huge effect on how well you do in it/understand it, and students will end up not liking subjects that they could have liked in university or the workplace. So you also have to wonder how many potential math prodigies we've missed out on, simply because they had a bad maths education at school. reply irjustin 17 hours agorootparentprev> Exposure is good, but success in school requires you to be successful in these subjects as well. Being specific, it's not school, it's what school grants you i.e. a paying job. The higher paying, thusly more coveted jobs, generally filter against good grades which then the requirement pushes downwards into schools because, at scale, it's a decent system; leveraging the schools to help decide who is good. > Being _really_ good in one thing should allow you to make up for being subpar in other areas, but it doesn't. I counter with, if you are \"_really_\" good, it shows because you truly are a genius and you get fast tracked on that subject, but I think your \"_really_\" is actually just \"_pretty_\" and you're trying to include more than the 1 in 100 million. To directly answer your point, for the \"slightly smarter than everyone else\" my middle school allowed kids to attend highschool in specific subjects and then highschool into the nearby community college and considered \"harder/more prestigious\" than the AP programs - admittedly only in math for this latter part.

You have a wide education until 16 and sit a broad range of exams at that age (GCSEs) and then specialise in a few (most often three) subjects from 16 to 18. You usually need to pass English and maths GCSEs, but universities mostly care about the subjects you do in the last two years (except for very competitive courses). This can be a problem for those who want to keep options open until they are 18 (like my younger daughter). Even the system up to 16 is pretty flexible.

I do think its good to give kids a broad education, and for some it would be good to continue that for longer. For others (like you) its just boring. I also think there should be more opportunities for adult education, so if you decide later in life that you would like to learn about English literature or physics or whatever you should have a chance to do it. AT the moment in the UK things seem to be going the other way, with an over expansion of universities sucking up money, and further education colleges that used to offer adult education putting the resources into \"16 to 18\" courses. reply Cthulhu_ 10 hours agorootparentprevSame in the Netherlands, it's become more flexible even since I went through school. It sucks until about age 16 (or 17/18 if you take a higher level education that includes e.g. Latin / Greek), then you get to go to vocational education and either do a work/school combo (1 day a week of school), or continue fulltime school for 3-10 years (3 years for most associate's degrees, 4 for bachelor's, more for a master's, and often you can go from the one to a higher level if you choose to).

But more than that, you see how themes are repeated throughout history, and how the author's experiences changed how they illustrated those themes. English classes taught you plenty of history - not so much in rote facts, but rather by illustrating parts of the cultural zeitgeist of different eras and how authors reinforced, protested, or recorded what was happening at the time.

Even if the goal is a cultural appreciation, Shakespeare's plays will tell you as much about England in 1585-1613 as Terry Gilliam's filmography does about the Anglosphere in 1971-present. It's more than zero, but it's also missing the overwhelming majority of the context and the world in which it exists. Modern readings treat Shakespeare with excessive reverence: not just \"a playwright\" but \"The Bard\". Those plays were made to be performed with very short rehearsal time before performing, outside, with no lights (at most fire, but it was wood and thatched and burned down from a theatrical cannon), in a crowded venue where audiences would be expected to jeer and cheer, whereas today it's a finely rehearsed performance by people who take it seriously performed for an audience who consider it high culture. Monty Python's Gumbies aren't well understood by new viewer today, as modern news treats \"the man on the street\" somewhat differently than in the 70s. How wrong do modern viewers comprehend Shakespeare's characters, considering that \"The Taming of the Shrew\" is classified as a comedy? That said, I was also busy teaching myself a lot of maths and science ahead of the classes; what I learned from school but would not have taught myself was the basics of German and French (though only the former stuck with me), the absolute basics of music notation, some metalworking and woodworking, and PE.

Have one class for addition and subtraction, another for multiplication and division, then geometry, algebra, etc, etc. Then let students graduate from one to the next based on proven ability rather than by age.

I believe that any person here with an inkling of relatable technical experience can greatly appreciate the work you've been doing. Software development can be complicated and frustrating, especially when things don't work as you expect them to (but then, you learn and become better).

We tend to do this because of the way our brains estimate things of significant scale, like the fact that keeps floating around social media about how bad most of us are at having a concept of the difference between thousands, millions, and billions. There are many valedictorians (of the order of some per thousand) but few Ramanujans (of the order of tens per billion?), and gearing an overall education system specifically for those few could do a disservice to a great many others at every level below. Ramanujan was not the result of an effective education system anyway: like a lot of other world changing minds he was largely self-taught. Perhaps there is room to encourage more investigation to the side of the curriculum a lot more than we currently do, but the problems that stop other \"Ramanujan\"s, that could so easily have scuppered Ramanujan himself, are usually not caused by the education system but by other societal problems (death & disease, racism, sexism, caste or class biases, etc.) not giving them a chance to explore & self-learn or have useful access to education & other resources at all.

In it he divides artists/philosophers into two categories: foxes and hedgehogs. It is inspired by a fragment of ancient Greek poetry which reads, \"the fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one great thing.\" In other words, some great thinkers looked at the world through the lens of one big idea, and others can't be easily reduced. Two major caveats. The first is that Berlin never wanted the essay to be taken all that seriously. To him, it was an intellectually parlor game. But if TvTropes is any indication, people are addicted to classifying things into simplistic categories, so the fox and hedgehog game took off. Second, the rest of the essay actually challenges the binary by focusing on Leo Tolstoy, an unimaginably creative thinker and writer who, according to Berlin, was a fox by nature but wanted to be a hedgehog. Why did I share all of that? Well, without taking the categories too seriously I do think some people are more foxy by nature and others are more hedgehog-esque. I've always thought of myself as a fox (which to be honest, might limit me), and I had no interest in focusing on a single subject in school. At worst, I'm a dilettante who can have a surface level conversation about any intellectual topic at a party. At best, I can muster up a real enthusiasm about trying something entirely new.

Geniuses, however cool they may be, are not necessarily the most effective increase in unit production efficiency per person that you can create. The point of the education system is essentially to create workers that make the economy productive. I don’t think you can say, even all these years later, that Ramanujan, that mathematician, made the economy more productive, but he certainly increased the high watermark of human civilization and created an inspiring story for individual achievement, creative realization, and artistic and mathematical expression. There’s something sublime and transcendental—no pun intended—in the kind of truths that he was able to tease out and the unique, idiosyncratic way that he expressed them. Sort of like a Basquiat of mathematics, I suppose. Or probably better than that. That aside, I think it’s unfortunate that he died of cholera or something, isn’t it? I mean, he apparently didn’t think it was unfortunate that he was going to die. And certainly, the formal education system didn’t necessarily fail him, in that a professor at a university recognized his genius and sponsored him to the UK. But I think, in a sense that you identify, there is this general failure of the education systems in the human civilizations on this planet to foster perhaps the best thing that they could be fostering. They’re more like a manufacturing assembly line to produce cogs as part of the economic machine. Not that there’s anything necessarily wrong with that. I think it’s good that people can have a role to play in the larger economy and that there are pathways to bring people to the level of capability where they can contribute like that. But the lack of pathways that these systems provide—those that could contribute to the creation of the full realization and expression of individual potential—I think is sad.

Sure, give them a well rounded education, but don’t weight those grades anywhere close to equally. reply gaoshan 5 hours agoparentprev\"...they weren't interesting to him\". That’s how I felt about mathematics. History, literature and language were the areas I was interested in, for example. It seems to me that an individual’s strengths aren’t necessarily indicative of an all-encompassing genius. Rather, they are often more focused, tied to specific subjects or fields in which that person naturally excels. That's not to say an individual can't have a wide range of strengths. reply barrettondricka 18 hours agoparentprevThe best way to learn is to play and come up with stuff yourself. But playing doesn't get you anywhere specific. People who play around a lot, clearly know much more and in depth than everyone else, but when you hand them a random checklist, chances are they won't know a few. Standardized tests are screwing everything up. People who learn on their own might stumble upon the entire alphabet except for the letter \"B,\" but standardized tests want only the first 5 letters. Hence the incredible efficiency of knowing the entire alphabet is thrown under the bus in favor of making sure none of the 5 are missing. You can't teach someone to play, and there is no way to play systematically, at scale, and with guaranteed results. All the incredible people I know have some hole in \"basic\" knowledge, and if it is revealed nobody cares about them being miles ahead elsewhere. \"Their basics seem lacking, in the name of stability and norm, throw them back to square one.\" Following standards never produces something new, but the world is so afraid of failure and lack of definitions in \"messing around\" that they are willing to trade their souls for it.

The gap between Ramanujan and the average class valedictorian is much wider than the gap between the class valedictorian and the average student.

Extreme outlier geniuses are extreme outliers and there’s no easily generalizable pattern around them. The ideal education for a young Ramanujan is probably different from the ideal education for a young Von Neumann.

    "originBody": "Announcements Introducing computer use, a new Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Claude 3.5 Haiku Oct 22, 2024●5 min read Today, we’re announcing an upgraded Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and a new model, Claude 3.5 Haiku. The upgraded Claude 3.5 Sonnet delivers across-the-board improvements over its predecessor, with particularly significant gains in coding—an area where it already led the field. Claude 3.5 Haiku matches the performance of Claude 3 Opus, our prior largest model, on many evaluations for the same cost and similar speed to the previous generation of Haiku. We’re also introducing a groundbreaking new capability in public beta: computer use. Available today on the API, developers can direct Claude to use computers the way people do—by looking at a screen, moving a cursor, clicking buttons, and typing text. Claude 3.5 Sonnet is the first frontier AI model to offer computer use in public beta. At this stage, it is still experimental—at times cumbersome and error-prone. We're releasing computer use early for feedback from developers, and expect the capability to improve rapidly over time. Asana, Canva, Cognition, DoorDash, Replit, and The Browser Company have already begun to explore these possibilities, carrying out tasks that require dozens, and sometimes even hundreds, of steps to complete. For example, Replit is using Claude 3.5 Sonnet's capabilities with computer use and UI navigation to develop a key feature that evaluates apps as they’re being built for their Replit Agent product. The upgraded Claude 3.5 Sonnet is now available for all users. Starting today, developers can build with the computer use beta on the Anthropic API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud’s Vertex AI. The new Claude 3.5 Haiku will be released later this month. Claude 3.5 Sonnet: Industry-leading software engineering skills The updated Claude 3.5 Sonnet shows wide-ranging improvements on industry benchmarks, with particularly strong gains in agentic coding and tool use tasks. On coding, it improves performance on SWE-bench Verified from 33.4% to 49.0%, scoring higher than all publicly available models—including reasoning models like OpenAI o1-preview and specialized systems designed for agentic coding. It also improves performance on TAU-bench, an agentic tool use task, from 62.6% to 69.2% in the retail domain, and from 36.0% to 46.0% in the more challenging airline domain. The new Claude 3.5 Sonnet offers these advancements at the same price and speed as its predecessor. Early customer feedback suggests the upgraded Claude 3.5 Sonnet represents a significant leap for AI-powered coding. GitLab, which tested the model for DevSecOps tasks, found it delivered stronger reasoning (up to 10% across use cases) with no added latency, making it an ideal choice to power multi-step software development processes. Cognition uses the new Claude 3.5 Sonnet for autonomous AI evaluations, and experienced substantial improvements in coding, planning, and problem-solving compared to the previous version. The Browser Company, in using the model for automating web-based workflows, noted Claude 3.5 Sonnet outperformed every model they’ve tested before. As part of our continued effort to partner with external experts, joint pre-deployment testing of the new Claude 3.5 Sonnet model was conducted by the US AI Safety Institute (US AISI) and the UK Safety Institute (UK AISI). We also evaluated the upgraded Claude 3.5 Sonnet for catastrophic risks and found that the ASL-2 Standard, as outlined in our Responsible Scaling Policy, remains appropriate for this model. Claude 3.5 Haiku: State-of-the-art meets affordability and speed Claude 3.5 Haiku is the next generation of our fastest model. For the same cost and similar speed to Claude 3 Haiku, Claude 3.5 Haiku improves across every skill set and surpasses even Claude 3 Opus, the largest model in our previous generation, on many intelligence benchmarks. Claude 3.5 Haiku is particularly strong on coding tasks. For example, it scores 40.6% on SWE-bench Verified, outperforming many agents using publicly available state-of-the-art models—including the original Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o. With low latency, improved instruction following, and more accurate tool use, Claude 3.5 Haiku is well suited for user-facing products, specialized sub-agent tasks, and generating personalized experiences from huge volumes of data—like purchase history, pricing, or inventory records. Claude 3.5 Haiku will be made available later this month across our first-party API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud’s Vertex AI—initially as a text-only model and with image input to follow. Teaching Claude to navigate computers, responsibly With computer use, we're trying something fundamentally new. Instead of making specific tools to help Claude complete individual tasks, we're teaching it general computer skills—allowing it to use a wide range of standard tools and software programs designed for people. Developers can use this nascent capability to automate repetitive processes, build and test software, and conduct open-ended tasks like research. To make these general skills possible, we've built an API that allows Claude to perceive and interact with computer interfaces. Developers can integrate this API to enable Claude to translate instructions (e.g., “use data from my computer and online to fill out this form”) into computer commands (e.g. check a spreadsheet; move the cursor to open a web browser; navigate to the relevant web pages; fill out a form with the data from those pages; and so on). On OSWorld, which evaluates AI models' ability to use computers like people do, Claude 3.5 Sonnet scored 14.9% in the screenshot-only category—notably better than the next-best AI system's score of 7.8%. When afforded more steps to complete the task, Claude scored 22.0%. While we expect this capability to improve rapidly in the coming months, Claude's current ability to use computers is imperfect. Some actions that people perform effortlessly—scrolling, dragging, zooming—currently present challenges for Claude and we encourage developers to begin exploration with low-risk tasks. Because computer use may provide a new vector for more familiar threats such as spam, misinformation, or fraud, we're taking a proactive approach to promote its safe deployment. We've developed new classifiers that can identify when computer use is being used and whether harm is occurring. You can read more about the research process behind this new skill, along with further discussion of safety measures, in our post on developing computer use. Looking ahead Learning from the initial deployments of this technology, which is still in its earliest stages, will help us better understand both the potential and the implications of increasingly capable AI systems. We’re excited for you to explore our new models and the public beta of computer use—and welcome you to share your feedback with us. We believe these developments will open up new possibilities for how you work with Claude, and we look forward to seeing what you'll create.",

Somewhere on Anthropic's website it says that Opus is the most advanced, but on other parts it says Sonnet is the most advanced and also the fastest. The UI doesn't make the distinction clear either. Then on Perplexity, Perplexity says that Opus is the most advanced, compared to Sonnet. And finally, in the table in the blogpost, Opus isn't even included? It seems to me like Opus is the best model they have, but they don't want people to default using it, maybe the ROI is lower on Opus or something?

I think they originally announced that Opus would get a 3.5 update, but with every product update they are doing I'm doubting it more and more.

Why isn't it included in the benchmark if new Sonnet beats Opus? Why are they so ambiguous with their language? For example, https://www.anthropic.com/api says: > Sonnet - Our best combination of performance and speed for efficient, high-throughput tasks. > Opus - Our highest-performing model, which can handle complex analysis, longer tasks with many steps, and higher-order math and coding tasks. And Opus is above/after Sonnet. That to me implies that Opus is indeed better than Sonnet. But then you go to https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models and it says: > Claude 3.5 Sonnet - Most intelligent model - Claude 3 Opus - Powerful model for highly complex tasks Does that mean Sonnet 3.5 is better than Opus for even highly complex tasks, since it's the \"most intelligent model\"?

At the same time I think they want to keep their options open to either: A) drop a Opus 3.5 soon that will bring the logic back in order again B) potentially phase out Opus, and instead introduce new branding for what they called a \"reasoning model\" like OpenAI did with o1(-preview) reply diggan 3 hours agorootparent> I wouldn't attribute this to malice when it can also be explained by incompetence.

It mentions the new model by it's full name \"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022\" so clearly they've gone through at least that page. Yet the wording remains ambiguous. > Sonnet 3.5 New > Opus 3 > Sonnet 3.5 is generally how they stack up against each other when looking at the total benchmarks. Which ones are you looking at?

I've not been keeping up and the official information now assumes far too much familiarity to be of much use. reply hobofan 2 hours agorootparentI think it's first important to note that there is a huge difference between -o models (GPT 4o; GPT 4o mini) and the o1 models (o1-preview; o1-mini). The -o models are \"just\" stronger versions of their non-suffixed predecessors. They are the latest (and maybe last?) version of models in the lineage of GPT models (roughly GPT-1 -> GPT-2 -> GPT-3 -> GPT-3.5 -> GPT-4 -> GPT-4o). The o1 models (not sure what the naming structure for upcoming models will be) are a new family of models that try to excel at deep reasoning, by allowing the models to use an internal (opaque) chain-of-thought to produce better results at the expense of higher token usage (and thus cost) and longer latency. Personally, I think the use cases that justify the current cost and slowness of o1 are incredibly narrow (e.g. offline analysis of financial documents or deep academic paper research). I think in most interactive use-cases I'd rather opt for GPT-4o or Sonnet 3.5 instead of o1-preview and have the faster response time and send a follow-up message. Similarly for non-interactive use-cases I'd try to add a layer of tool calling with those faster models than use o1-preview. I think the o1-like models will only really take off, if the prices for it are coming down, and it is clearly demonstrated that more \"thinking tokens\" correlate to predictably better results, and results that can compete with highly tuned prompts/fine tuned models that or currently expensive to produce in terms of development time. reply wavemode 22 minutes agorootparentprevI think the practical economics of the LLM business are becoming clearer in recent times.

I'm wondering at this point if they are going to release Opus 3.5 at all, or maybe skip it and go straight to 4.0.

I think this page[0] provides the best overview I can link to. Yes, GPT4 is better in the MMLU benchmark, but in all other benchmarks and the LMSys Chatbot Arena scores[1], GPT4o-mini comes out ahead. Overall, the margin between is so thin that it falls under my definition of \"on par\". I think OpenAI is generally a bit more conservative with the messaging here (which is understandable), and they only advertise a model as \"more capable\", if one model beats the other one in every benchmark they track, which AFAIK is the case when it comes to 4o mini vs 3.5 Turbo.

That being the foundation is going to influence what's built on top. For program access, one could claim this is even how linux tools usually do it: you parse some meant-for human text to attempt to extract what you want.

The end goal isn't just web pages (And i wouldn't say most GUIs are web pages). Ideally, you'd also want this to be able to navigate say photoshop or any other application. And the easier your method can switch between platforms and operating systems the better We've already built computer use around GUIs so it's just much easier to center LLMs around them too. Text is an option for the command line or the web but this isn't an easy option for the vast majority of desktop applications, nevermind mobile. It's the same reason general purpose robots are being built into a human form factor. The human form isn't particularly special and forcing a machine to it has its own challenges but our world and environment has been built around it and trying to build a hundred different specialized form factors is a lot more daunting. reply infecto 2 hours agorootparentprevYou are not familiar with this market. The goal of a UI Path is to replicate what a human does and being able to get it to production without the help of any IT/Engineering teams. Most GUIs are in fact not web pages, that's a relatively newer development in the Enterprise side. So while some of them may be a web page, the goal is to be able to touch everything a user is doing in the workflow which very likely includes local apps. This iteration from Anthropic is still engineering focused but you can see the future of this kind of tooling bypassing engineering/it teams entirely. reply swalsh 3 hours agorootparentprevBuilding an entirely new world for agents to compute in is far more difficult than building an agent that can operate in a human world.

I've been pro for maybe 6 months. I'm not a power user leveraging their API or anything. Just the chat interface, though with ever more use of Projects, lately. I use it every day, whether for mundane answers or curiosities, to \"write me this code\", to general consultation on a topic. It has replaced search in a superior way and I feel hugely productive with it. I do still occasionally pop over to ChatGPT to test their their waters (or if Claude is just not getting it), but I've not felt any need to switch back or have both. Well done, Anthropic! reply gumboshoes 32 minutes agoprevFor me, one of the more useful steps on macOS will be when local AI can manipulate anything that has an Apple Script library. The hooks are there and decently documented. For meta purposes, having AI work with a third-party app like Keyboard Maestro or Raycast will even further expand the pre-built possibilities without requiring the local AI to reinvent steps or tools at the time of each prompt. reply TechDebtDevin 1 hour agoprevNot that I'm scared of this update but I'd probably be alright with pausing llm development today, atleast in regard to producing code.

I'm working on a small side project and while I love ironing out implementation details myself, it's tough to ignore the fact that Claude/GPT4o can create entire working files for me on demand.

On the other hand, OpenAI has moved to a naming convention where they seem to use a name for the model: “GPT-4”, “GPT-4 Turbo”, “GPT-4o”, “GPT-4o mini”. Separately, they use date strings to represent the specific release of that named model. Whereas Anthropic had a name: “Claude Sonnet”, and what appeared to be an incrementing version number: “3”, then “3.5”, which set the expectation that this is how they were going to represent the specific versions. Now, Anthropic is jamming two version strings on the same product, and I consider that a bad choice. It doesn’t mean I think OpenAI’s approach is great either, but I think there are nuances that say they’re not doing exactly the same thing.

If true, then the fact that they previously had date strings would be a purely academic footnote to what I was saying, not actually relevant or meaningful. reply HarHarVeryFunny 2 hours agoparentprevWell, by calling it 3.5, they are telling you that this is NOT the next-gen 4.0 that they presumably have in the works, and also not downplaying it by just calling it 3.6 (and anyways they are not advancing versions by 0.1 increments - it seems 3.5 was just meant to convey \"half way from 3.0 to 4.0\"). Maybe the architecture is unchanged, and this just reflects more pre and/or post-training? Also, they still haven't released 3.5 Opus yet, but perhaps 3.5 Haiku is a distillation of that, indicating that it is close. From a competitive POV, it makes sense that they respond to OpenAI's 4o and o1 without bumping the version to Claude 4.0, which presumably is what they will call their competitor to GPT-5, and probably not release until GPT-5 is out. I'm a fan of Anthropic, and not of OpenAI, and I like the versioning and competitive comparisons. Sonnet 3.5 still best coder, better than o1, has to hurt, and a highly performant cheap Haiku 3.5 will hit OpenAI in the wallet. reply nisten 3 hours agoparentprevFor a company selling intelligence, that's a pretty stupid way of labelling a new product. reply riffraff 3 hours agorootparent\"computer use\" is also as bad a marketing choice as possible for something that actually seems pretty cool. reply accrual 2 hours agorootparentI'm not sure what a better term is.

But you can do it indirectly by having it write a program that produces the correct result. Interestingly, I didn't even have to have it run the program, although usually you would write a tool which counts the number of w's in \"strawberry\" and return the result Which produced: Here's a simple Python function that counts the number of 'w's in the word \"strawberry\" and returns the result: ```python def count_w_in_strawberry(): word = \"strawberry\" count = word.count('w') return count # Call the function and print the result result = count_w_in_strawberry() print(f\"The number of 'w's in 'strawberry' is: {result}\") ``` This tool does the following: 1. We define a function called `count_w_in_strawberry()`. 2. Inside the function, we assign the word \"strawberry\" to a variable called `word`. 3. We use the `count()` method on the `word` string to count the occurrences of 'w'. 4. The function returns the count. 5. Outside the function, we call `count_w_in_strawberry()` and store the result in the `result` variable. 6. Finally, we print the result. When you run this code, it will output: ``` The number of 'w's in 'strawberry' is: 1 ``` This tool correctly identifies that there is one 'w' in the word \"strawberry\". reply jandrese 1 hour agorootparentI always thought the halting problem was an academic exercise, but here we see a potential practical use case.

While that may be true, isn't another reasonable explanation that the Copilot development team is moving as fast as they can and these sorts of workarounds are being forced through in the name of team velocity? Wouldn't another way of saying that be \"the Copilot development team is leveraging their Microsoft ownership to create products in a way not available to the general marketplace?\" The goal might not be to squash competition, but blessing one client with special treatment not available to others can still be anti-competitive. Whether that would fall afoul of any regulation is beyond my expertise. Naively, most companies have internal APIs that are not generally available. But then most companies don't have paid public marketplaces on their platform. reply canes123456 22 hours agorootparentIs it even not available to competitors? Visual studio is open source.

Not doing something like this would make Copilot at a disadvantage. reply sshine 21 hours agorootparent> Visual studio is open source Sort of.

Yes, in their recent interview with Lex Fridman they argued that life as an extension is too limiting. The main reason we criticise Microsoft for doing this and not them is just their size and market dominance. Why jump through hoops to make competitors better able to hotwire their own AI into VSCode, or hotwire Copilot into their own IDE, when it's easier to iterate fast and remain unpredictable? reply falcor84 20 hours agorootparent> Why jump through hoops to make competitors better able Because that is the competitive philosophy that allowed VS Code win in this space. It fits with that great quote from Bill Gates: \"A platform is when the economic value of everybody that uses it, exceeds the value of the company that creates it.\" By having VS Code give a priority to another MS/GitHub product that they aren't willing to give competitors, they're diminishing VS Code's value as a platform, and encouraging competitors to build their own IDEs rather than building on top of it. reply yencabulator 20 hours agorootparentThat just tells you where in the EEE lifecycle you are.

That's what Cursor did, and (I think) Microsoft will agree with that and maybe even welcome developers to do this. reply tristan957 23 hours agorootparentHas Microsoft allowed Cursor to access the VSCode Marketplace? As far as I know, it is against the ToS for any editor other than VSCode to access it. reply pzmarzly 23 hours agorootparentProbably not.

You famously cannot use the C/C++ language server bundled in the C/C++ extension or Pylance.

Again this is just the same as RHEL repos behind license login. reply tristan957 22 hours agorootparentRed Hat provides support for their packages. If you're not paying for support, you don't get access to the repos. That makes sense to me. What does Microsoft gain by creating a walled garden? They don't provide support. All that they provide is hosting. The Eclipse Foundation provides hosting for free for OpenVSX, which is an amazing service to the community of people using VSCode forks that aren't allowed to access the VSCode Marketplace.

As outlined at https://ghuntley.com/fracture/ as soon as you compile \"VSCode\" (MIT) the ecosystem fractures in a bad way (tm) including no-license to run majority of MSFT extensions (Language LSPs, Copilot, Remote Development). If you are a vendor producing a MIT fork then one needs to iterate the graph and convince 3rd party extension authors to _not use the MSFT extensions_ as dependencies _and_ to publish on open-vsx. This is how Cursor gets wrecked in the medium/long term. Coding agent? Cool. You can't use Pylance with it etc. VSCode degrades to being notepad.exe. MSFT uses Cursor for product research and then rolls out the learnings into Copilot because only Copilot supports all of \"Visual Studio Code\" features that users expect (and this is by design) reply kburman 23 hours agorootparentIf MS didn't owned VS code.

So that copilot thing may just be their incubator project. It may be not though. reply Lramseyer 23 hours agoparentprevNot malicious, but still selfish. It's important to remember that the copilot extensions are an extremely effective way of monetizing VScode. So it seems more like they're kind of compromising on their API usage rules in order to get to market quicker. But allowing themselves to use the APIs before anyone else is in a way anti-competitive, because the only way one could compete would be to use the unfinished APIs. But that requires users to go through more hoops to install your extension. I should also mention that I am a VScode extension developer and I'm one of the weirdos that actually takes the time to read about API updates. They are putting in a lot of effort in developing language model APIs. So it's not like they're outright blocking others from their marketplace. reply rcarmo 23 hours agorootparentCheck my comment elsewhere (it's now bobbing up and down).

These days I work at a competitor. All words my own and represent neither entity. Microsoft has the culture and the technology to tell private and public APIs apart and to check code across the company to ensure that only public APIs are called. This was required for decades as part of the Department of Justice consent decree and every single product in the company had scanners to check that they weren't using any private APIs (or similar hacks to get access to them such as privately searching for symbols in Windows DLL files). This was drilled into the heads of everyone, including what I assume are 90% of VP+ people currently at the company, for a very long time. For them to do this is a conscious decision to be anticompetitive. reply dchest 21 hours agorootparentWhat a coincidence, I was just browsing Microsoft's Go fork (for FIPS compatibility, basically replacing Go crypto with OpenSSL and whatever API Windows has, just like there's a Google's fork that uses BoringSSL), and found this patch: https://github.com/microsoft/go/blob/microsoft/main/patches/... Upstream Go tricks Windows into enabling long path support by setting an undocumented flag in the PEB. The Microsoft Go fork can't use undocumented APIs, so this commit removes the hack. So, even if they fork something, they have to strictly follow this guideline and remove undocumented API usage. I wonder if this only applies to Windows APIs though. reply skissane 21 hours agorootparentprev> Microsoft has the culture and the technology to tell private and public APIs apart and to check code across the company to ensure that only public APIs are called.

I thought that only applied to private Windows APIs? The antitrust case was about the Windows monopoly specifically, so other MS products calling Windows private APIs was in its scope. But, this is more comparable to another MS product calling a private Visual Studio API – I don't believe that was in the scope of that antitrust case. Did Microsoft have policies and processes against that scenario too? reply Arainach 18 hours agorootparentThe settlement was (presumably, I've never read it) about not using a monopoly in one area to gain influence in another, so I would not be surprised if Windows was the primary focus, but the overall message was fairly universal, and it makes sense: Microsoft builds platforms and overwhelmingly those platforms rely on other parties, so don't leverage anything internal/unfair as that hurts the platform. This means that Office shouldn't use private Windows APIs and pin itself to the taskbar. It means that Surface shouldn't have special integrations (whether with Windows, Copilot, or whatever) that aren't available to third parties. It means that Azure shouldn't build things that are only available to Office. You build for the platform. The push was originally around a legal mandate, but it turns into a culture. reply skissane 17 hours agorootparent> The push was originally around a legal mandate, but it turns into a culture. Whatever the scope of the legal mandate was, it expired over a decade ago now. Culture can change over time. Even if Microsoft had this culture strongly when you worked there, it might have become much weaker in the years since. Within a corporation, culture can also vary a lot between different teams/divisions/etc - maybe it is still strong in some parts of the company but gone in others. reply SSLy 21 hours agorootparentprevvscode is developed by VPs borged from github, no? those wouldn't know. not that I approve such things, certainly not. reply swyx 21 hours agorootparentvscode predated github acquisition by several years reply adolph 21 hours agorootparentprev> vscode is developed by VPs borged from github Other way around: In 2011 [Erich Gamma] joined the Microsoft Visual Studio team and leads a development lab in Zürich, Switzerland that has developed the \"Monaco\" suite of components for browser-based development, found in products such as Azure DevOps Services [0] 0. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_Gamma 1. https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/ reply rty32 23 hours agoprevVery interestingly, just yesterday I discovered that VSCode has a set of APIs for adding SSH tunneling, and under normal circumstances you must launch vscode with special flags to be able to use them.

Its open source so if you want to use these API's you can in a forked version. And of course if you're developing something thats free for everyone to use, and its not forcing you to use it, I don't see an issue with using private API's. And while some make the alegory to IE its not the same since its not pre-installed on every machine, nor are they forcing you to use it.

They know they can coordinate with the Copilot team to change or remove API usage much quicker than third party extensions. I bet they'd love if there were a way to have trusted testers that they could _force_ to make timely updates like they likely can with Copilot. Maybe they should look into Chrome's Origin Trial system and make time-limited API tokens so that extension developers know that features relying on experimental APIs will break, even if the API itself doesn't. That seems to keep causal usage at bay and make sure that trial developers stay on top of things. reply torginus 21 hours agoparentprevThis, there are APIs in Windows today, that were added temporarily in one of the early betas of Windows 95 as a stopgap measure.

Before you introduce public APIs you need a use case and someone to spearhead them and copilot is doing that. As for Microsoft not allowing installs of stuff like live share on other forks I guess it is because they are seen as different products and not part of the vsc codebase itself. I would understand if extension authors would complain about not being able to access the same apis (might be the case) but at the end of the day they can still fork and do whatever they prefer.

Typescript can, very cynically, be seen as an on-ramp for vscode, as vscode has pretty much the best typescript suppor. reply boredtofears 22 hours agorootparentLuckily that’s why we have OSS licenses, if/when they do that there will be a community fork. reply dartos 1 hour agorootparent> if/when they do that there will be a community fork One would hope, but if all the project’s experts are hired and have been working for a company that closed their once open source project, forks will have a hard time surviving. That’s why redis and elastic search didn’t see an explosion of popular forks. Terraform has opentofu, but I haven’t looked in on them in a while. I don’t believe there are any Atom forks around since Microsoft killed that project after aquiring GitHub. Also, the actual Visual Studio code you download from their website is NOT fully open source. It contains closed source extensions and configurations. reply rty32 23 hours agoparentprevI mean, Microsoft has been very clear about their business model of VSCode -- similar to Chromium, the base product is free and you can do whatever you want (and indeed there are lots of products reusing the core of VSCode), but extension marketplace/remote/GitHub Copilot are proprietary. It sounds like a fair deal to me -- Microsoft can't just do open source without expecting to get something in return. Now, coming back to private APIs, it's hard to know whether this is because Microsoft intentionally wants to keep competition out, or it is just hard to standardize/finalize APIs. I do know that VSCode development team takes extreme care when it comes to their APIs -- new features can take years before they are ready (most recenly coverage APIs, for example), and they don't want to release something when it's not ready, and I respect that. And to be fair, they have a number of \"inline completion\" APIs standardized as both VSCode APIs and LSP protocol (upcoming). I'm sure there is a lot to be desired, but it should be a nuanced discussion instead of simply \"Microsoft bad\". (I am a VSCode extension & LSP author, not affiliated with Microsoft at all) reply rcarmo 23 hours agorootparentThis. LSP is a great example of something that also takes a while to flesh out because the problem space spans a lot (syntax, autocomplete, etc.) reply rapind 23 hours agoparentprevIt worked out so well for them with the browser… oh wait. reply jampekka 23 hours agorootparentIE had over 50% market share for over 10 years. It was likely a major factor for Windows holding the desktop OS monopoly. reply jimbob45 23 hours agoparentprev [–] What's the harm here if the APIs are temporary and they don't have a history of elongating the lives of temporary APIs like this? They've stated the purpose of these \"proposed APIs\" and we have no evidence from the last decade to believe they'd renege on their stated goals. reply dartos 23 hours agorootparent> What's the harm here if the APIs are temporary The “if” is carrying a lot of weight. It gives Microsoft a solid competitive edge and a form of vendor lock-in in their otherwise mostly open product. We don’t know that they’ll be temporary forever. > They've stated the purpose of these \"proposed APIs\" Just like how they said recall would not be a required feature, but is a dependency of the file explorer in the next version of windows? Microsoft will say whatever looks good for them, obviously. > last decade But we do from the last 11+ years ;) I’d always err on the side of not trusting giant monopolistic corporations with a history of garnering good will to cash in on it later. Especially when that company has been very aggressively inserting itself in nearly every JS projects dependency/software delivery pipelines. I gain nothing by trusting them, but I stand to lose my project’s independence from them. reply ndiddy 23 hours agorootparentprev [–] The harm is that third-party developers aren't allowed to publish extensions that use \"proposed APIs\", but Copilot doesn't have to follow these rules because Microsoft both develops the extension and runs the Extension Marketplace website. Microsoft is therefore able to add functionality to their extension that third-party developers can only add by forking VS Code. VS Code forks lose access to the Extension Marketplace, and many Microsoft-published extensions (such as Pylance and LiveShare) will only run on official Microsoft builds of VS Code, not forks. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

While such dra­mat­ic means of vot­er sup­pres­sion occurred often enough in the Recon­struc­tion South, tac­tics of elec­toral exclu­sion refined over time, such that by the mid-twen­ti­eth cen­tu­ry the Jim Crow South relied large­ly on near­ly impos­si­ble-to-pass lit­er­a­cy tests to impede free and fair elec­tions. These tests, writes Rebec­ca Onion at Slate, were “sup­pos­ed­ly applic­a­ble to both white and black prospec­tive vot­ers who couldn’t prove a cer­tain lev­el of edu­ca­tion” (typ­i­cal­ly up to the fifth grade). Yet they were “in actu­al­i­ty dis­pro­por­tion­ate­ly admin­is­tered to black vot­ers.” Addi­tion­al­ly, many of the tests were rigged so that reg­is­trars could give poten­tial vot­ers an easy or a dif­fi­cult ver­sion, and could score them dif­fer­ent­ly as well. For exam­ple, the Vet­er­ans of the Civ­il Rights Move­ment describes a test admin­is­tered in Alaba­ma that is so entire­ly sub­jec­tive that it mea­sures the registrar’s shrewd­ness and cun­ning more than any­thing else. The test here from Louisiana con­sists of ques­tions so ambigu­ous that no one, what­ev­er their lev­el of edu­ca­tion, can divine a “right” or “wrong” answer to most of them. And yet, as the instruc­tions state, “one wrong answer denotes fail­ure of the test,” an impos­si­ble stan­dard for even a legit­i­mate exam. Even worse, vot­ers had only ten min­utes to com­plete the three-page, 30-ques­tion doc­u­ment. The Louisiana test dates from 1964, the year before the pas­sage of the Vot­ing Rights Act, which effec­tive­ly put an end to these bla­tant­ly dis­crim­i­na­to­ry prac­tices. Learn more about the his­to­ry of Jim Crow vot­er sup­pres­sion at Rebec­ca Onion’s orig­i­nal post here and an update here.

Reply Upthorn says: October 21, 2024 at 10:05 pm This is of very lit­tle use with­out the scor­ing guide — sev­er­al of the descrip­tions are ambigu­ous, and we do not know which were accept­ed as cor­rect. Each of the instruc­tions is rel­a­tive­ly sim­ple to reach *a* rea­son­able inter­pre­ta­tion of, which allows a casu­al read­er to come to the con­clu­sion that this test was actu­al­ly quite easy. This is a very dif­fer­ent test if ambigu­ous instruc­tions accept only one poten­tial inter­pre­ta­tion as valid, or accept sat­is­fy­ing either poten­tial inter­pre­ta­tion. I would also pro­pose “requires notic­ing that ambi­gu­i­ty and sat­is­fy­ing all pos­si­ble inter­pre­ta­tions” but that vio­lates “Do what you are told … noth­ing more.” and the gen­er­al lem­ma that there should be a 1 to 1 cor­re­spon­dence between tasks and instruc­tions. E.g.: “Write every oth­er word in this first line and print every third word in the same line, (orig­i­nal type small­er and first line end­ed at com­ma) but cap­i­tal­ize the fifth word that you write” Does every third word mean “write word first print word same” or “oth­er this and third the”? Are both answers accept­able? Only one? Does “but cap­i­tal­ize the fifth word that you write” apply to the whole instruc­tion, or only the sec­ond clause? And “Spell back­wards, for­wards” The com­ma intro­duces ambi­gu­i­ty. It could either be telling you that the the fol­low­ing word mod­i­fies the pre­vi­ous clause (and you should spell the word “back­wards” in a for­ward man­ner) in which case the com­ma is unnec­es­sary and the sen­tence has the same exact mean­ing with­out it, *or* it could be telling you that the word order of the sen­tence is unusu­al (like “Use the force, you must”), in which case the com­ma is nec­es­sary. As a result, both “back­wards” and “sdrawrof” are com­plete­ly cor­rect per­for­mances of the task. Does the answer key instruct the exam­in­er to accept only “back­wards,” only “sdrawrof,” *either* answer? Sev­er­al instruc­tions, as-writ­ten, *are* impos­si­ble to fol­low exact­ly: For instance “draw a line around the short­est word in this line” is like­ly ask­ing you to cir­cle the “a”, but, by the exact def­i­n­i­tion of a “line”, this is impos­si­ble, as a line can­not con­tain any curves or angles, but a shape can­not be “around” some­thing else with­out hav­ing curves or angles. And, most egre­gious­ly, “Draw three cir­cles, one inside (engulfed by) the oth­er” is self-con­tra­dic­to­ry. This is log­i­cal­ly equiv­a­lent to the instruc­tion: “Draw three cir­cles: the engulfed, and the engulfer, with the engulfed com­plete­ly con­tained by the engulfer.” The num­ber of cir­cles is spec­i­fied to be three, but the spec­i­fi­ca­tion of their arrange­ment does not allow for the exis­tence of a third. Is it safe to assume that the test-writer was inex­act with direc­tions and that lack­adaisi­cal per­for­mance of instruc­tions will be accept­ed? Be care­ful, as one wrong denotes fail­ure of the test. Reply Upthorn says: October 21, 2024 at 10:06 pm Ack. That last line should be “Be care­ful, as one wrong answer denotes fail­ure of the test.” My mouse point­er got away from me as I was re-edit­ing my phras­ing.

Per a note on https://www.crmvet.org/info/la-test.htm: > [NOTE: At one time we also displayed a \"brain-twister\" type literacy test with questions like \"Spell backwards, forwards\" that may (or may not) have been used during the summer of 1964 in Tangipahoa Parish (and possibly elsewhere) in Louisiana. We removed it because we could not corroborate its authenticity, and in any case it was not representative of the Louisiana tests in broad use during the 1950s and '60s.] Each parish in Louisiana implemented their own literacy tests, which means that there wasn't really much uniformity in the process. Another (maybe more typical) test: https://www.crmvet.org/info/la-littest2.pdf reply tptacek 19 hours agoparentThis is super interesting. The Slate author who originally posted the Tangipahoa test followed up, with a bunch of extra information, and a pointer to a '63 Louisiana District Court case ruling the constitutional interpretation test you linked to unconstitutional: https://web.archive.org/web/20161105050044/http://www.laed.u... reply nneonneo 19 hours agorootparentThe original Slate article: https://slate.com/human-interest/2013/06/voting-rights-and-t... The follow-up, in which the author chronicles their (unsuccessful) search for an original: https://slate.com/human-interest/2013/07/louisiana-literacy-.... The follow-up explicitly notes that the word-processed version shown in the original article is a modern update; a typewritten version that is supposedly closer to the original is shown at the bottom of that article (and available at https://web.archive.org/web/20160615084237/http://msmcdushis...), although the provenance of this version is also unclear (\"McDonald reports that she received the test, along with another literacy test from Alabama, from a fellow teacher, who had been using them in the classroom for years but didn’t remember where they came from.\") reply tptacek 19 hours agorootparentRight, and you'd assume that if it was widely delivered in Louisiana, there'd be contemporaneous records; what that test is doing is pretty obvious. reply bryanrasmussen 6 hours agorootparentsince what that test was doing was trying to illegally deprive black people of their right to vote I'd think they'd try to keep it as hidden as possible, which is what I would recommend one do when breaking the law. reply woooooo 6 hours agorootparentHow hidden can you keep a test that many thousands of voters take? reply tptacek 1 hour agorootparentYou don't. You'd find contemporaneous accounts from people who'd taken the test and complained about it. That's how the social science of history works. I think the consensus here is that the brain-teaser test is either not real, or was not widely used (nobody has been able to find an instance where it was). A clarifying bit of context: there were extensive complaints about the multiple-choice constitutional interpretation tests that were given at the time. reply dragonwriter 2 hours agorootparentprev> How hidden can you keep a test that many thousands of voters take? After its taken, and presuming active measures were taken to prevent distribution other than for people taking it who would then return it, pretty easily. Paper is biodegradable, burns easily, can be shredded (and recycled into new paper), etc. reply bryanrasmussen 4 hours agorootparentprevnext [4 more] [flagged] lokar 4 hours agorootparentIf there is a credible threat of retaliation (violence, employment, housing) for even trying to vote, then this is very effective. Why take a big risk if you won’t get to vote anyway? This way you don’t actually have to give the test very often, everyone quickly figures out the “rules” and falls into line. reply bryanrasmussen 1 hour agorootparentright, the test exists as the last unbeatable line of defense, not the first. reply biorach 4 hours agorootparentprev> I certainly hope you're not so naive There is absolutely no need to take this tone, especially seeing as the person you are replying to is clearly in good faith. reply bena 3 hours agorootparentprevThat's kind of a weird paradox in general and it's how we lose a lot of information. Things that were ubiquitous didn't necessarily become recorded. Because it's just the way things were. reply relaxing 18 hours agorootparentprevWhy would you assume that? reply tptacek 17 hours agorootparentBecause the test we're talking about is comically unfair, and people were complaining in the press about multiple-choice constitutional knowledge tests that were only subtly unfair. reply danesparza 9 hours agorootparentDo you really think Black people would have been covered fairly in the press in the 1960's? reply tptacek 1 hour agorootparentFairly? No. At all? Obviously yes, because the unfairness of the tests we know to have been administered was widely covered. reply bbarnett 6 hours agorootparentprevNonsense, of course they were in some press. There were many white Americans fighting for equality for all. Heck, look at the recent BLM movement, the woke discussions, #metoo and more. All of these things were possible because of the 60s, because of white legislators, white judges, white supreme court judges, pushing for change, enacting change, creating the US today which, while imperfect, is quite supportive of equality, both legally and culturally. So yes, there was all sorts of main stream media pushing for equality. Heck, the first interracial kiss on US primetime was in the 60s on Star Trek ToS. reply relaxing 4 hours agorootparentSome examples of racism were documented in some progressive outlets, therefore all examples of racism would have made it into the public record? Maybe there was concern, when progressives were fighting this sort of thing, that if they picked the most unbelievable example, the naive public (those not familiar with the residents of a typical Klan-era backwater Louisiana parish) would question its veracity… as we see today… Imagine you were going to forge a such a test? I don’t think I could make up something this ridiculous if I tried. I’d have to be practiced in generating trick questions, and motivated by malice to come close. Realistically, I’d give up and pick one of the readily-available real examples of poll tests to use. reply gamblor956 13 hours agorootparentprevThere is an actual SCOTUS case on these tests, confirming that they indeed actually exited, see Louisiana vs. U.S. (1965). Also this sample test (https://lasc.libguides.com/c.php?g=940581&p=6830148) is from the Law Library of Louisiana, aka, the State Bar of Louisiana. Are you accusing the State Bar of Louisiana and the Louisiana Supreme Court of lying about the history of their state? And this article (https://www.nola.com/news/politics/civil-rights-victory-50-y...) by NOLA actually goes through the history of the tests, citing contemporaneous reporting of the tests over several decades, though you would probably need physical access to the microfiche archives to confirm them yourself. Unless you are suggesting that SCOTUS, SCLA, and the biggest newspaper in Louisiana are all conspiring together to make up these tests, the historical record for these tests existing is very well established. reply Workaccount2 3 hours agorootparentThe example literacy test you link to is dramatically more level headed than the one in the article.

It's a trick question. It's the Vice President, who is elected by the people (a)... but not for the role of president of the senate.

Question #5 is entirely discretionary depending on the context of what power you are discussing. And that's the point: these literacy tests were filled with questions like these that let the test giver choose the right answer based on whether they wanted the test taker to pass. reply tptacek 1 hour agorootparentYes. Which is why, even in the 1960s, even in Louisiana, state courts struck these tests down. I agree with you about them.

Which is why, even in the 1960s, even in Louisiana, state courts struck these tests down. I'm pretty sure the reason why, \"even in the 1960s, even in Louisiana\", state courts struck the tests down is that such tests categorically were ruled unconstitutional by the US Supreme Court in 1949, not because of the particular unfairness of particular tests as viewed by the state courts in the 1960s. reply pie_flavor 1 hour agorootparentprevFortunately, you only had to answer 4 of 6 correctly. https://www.crmvet.org/info/la-littest2.pdf reply WillPostForFood 12 hours agorootparentprevThe question is whether the test in the article is a real example of a literacy test, not whether literacy tests existed. reply atoav 12 hours agorootparentYou think it is unlikely that a famously problematic-in-terms-of-race state issued a problematic-in-terms-of-race literacy test?

Speaking to many of the outraged commenters, Do you think that the example test is a reasonable analog of any state's voting process currently in use?

If so, what additional changes would you propose to supplement current statutes? reply mrgoldenbrown 48 minutes agorootparentWe may be protected from the specific literacy tests mentioned here, but there are modern variations that accomplish the same goal of disenfranchising black voters. North Carolina's legislature asked for data showing how white folks and black folks used various voting techniques (in person vs by mail, preregister vs day of register, etc) , and then modified the voting rules to specifically lower black votes. One judge used the phrase \"with surgical precision\". They were so blatant about their true intention a federal court struck it down. But other states saw what they did and managed to pass similar laws with just a tad more subtlety and plausible deniability. reply Terr_ 2 hours agorootparentprev> Racism and/or vote fixing via the methodology claimed in this article would be a serious and despicable thing, however, as far as I'm aware, we are protected from this now and have been for a long time. The protection took a major hit in 2013, when the US Supreme court made a 5-4 decision in Shelby vs. Holder [0], permitting some areas to (re-)start a strategy of imposing unconstitutional and discriminatory laws just before an election, with local authorities knowing that any court-case voiding their law can't arrive in time to matter. Then they just enact the same kind of discriminatory law before the next major election, over and over, with no real punishment. While state legislatures aren't currently choosing to enact things quite as blatant as before, the same exploit makes it possible.

Neither the President nor his running mate are elected by the people; they're elected by the Electoral College. And the question isn't about the President Pro Tempore of the Senate. reply silisili 11 hours agorootparentI think that's the point of these questions, to have no clear answer. So a presidential candidate picks a vice president running mate. Voters vote for the pair. The electoral college then, usually but not always, cast votes matching the voters. So who decided? Technically the electoral college. Who were guided by the voters. Who voted for someone the president picked. reply cedilla 9 hours agorootparentThe answer key is included, and the correct answer according to the test is indeed \"the people\". reply lupire 3 hours agorootparentprevThe Political Party chooses the vice presidential candidate for its Elector.

The entire process of voter registration is nothing more than a means to disenfranchise voters. reply M4v3R 12 hours agorootparentIn many parts of the world voter registration is a perfectly normal practice and no one challenges it. The biggest reason for having it is that it disallows voting multiple times. What in your opinion makes the voter registration disenfranchising for voters? reply dagw 10 hours agorootparentThe problem isn't necessarily voter registration per se, but how easy or hard you make it. Giving politicians or bureaucrats the power to disenfranchise voters by requiring jumping through seemingly arbitrary hoops or based on vague rules will always lead to abuse. In many countries if you are a citizen (or permanent resident, depending on the election), old enough, and registered as living in the country you are automatically registered to vote. No need to do anything, your form shows up in the mail before every election. The only times you might have to do something is if you've very recently moved to a different part of the country or if you live abroad. reply shiroiushi 12 hours agorootparentprevIt's an additional step that must be completed well ahead of election day, making voting a two-step process. It shouldn't be necessary: you can determine on election day whether someone's already voted or not before they cast a vote. reply pmontra 12 hours agorootparentThat requires some preparation. Example: in Italy the state knows where everybody live (this is self reported but it could be inferred in many ways) and, more importantly for this case, where everybody has residence (that might not be the correct English word, sorry.) I could have residence in a city because I was born there but I could live in another one because for one year I have to work in that other city. But I don't sell my home, terminate contracts with utilities etc, also because maybe I go back home once or twice per month to visit friends and parents. Ok, so when I have to vote I do it in my city of residence, in a given place and not in any other one, and I have a card that I have to present together with my photo id. They have a register with the voters that are expected to vote there and they check my name on the list, stamp my card, give me the ballot. Note that this is a process that starts when one is born and keeps going through all the life of a person. It's quite an effort but it makes participating to elections very low effort for a voter. If we had to register to vote... Who would vote, only very interested people. It's amazing that so many people vote in the USA given the process. reply sokoloff 8 hours agorootparentMerely requiring photo ID is controversial in the US (and not done in MA where I vote).

If you don't actually refuse, but you explain you just forgot your ID at home, you can still provide your details verbally and are usually allowed to go, and \"invited\" to show your ID within XX days at any police post. But if you were driving a car, there will be a small fine anyway. If the officer has any suspicion you lied, or that your ID is fake, you can be taken to a police station for identification. reply gruturo 3 hours agorootparent....ahem, obviously I meant Passport... not Password... reply alexey-salmin 12 hours agorootparentprev> you can determine on election day whether someone's already voted or not before they cast a vote. Can you suggest a specific mechanism to do it that would be transparent to the public? I don't know about the US specifics but in Russia people voting multiple times was the main strategy of fraud in 2010s (that is before they gave up all the pretence). Before this scheme came into being, the system of isolated voting points where every action was observable and verifiable based solely on the local context had worked reasonably well, to the displeasure of authorities. reply pmontra 9 hours agorootparentYou should apply a large permanent mark to people that already voted. It must last one day or so. But that could infringe the right of not to vote, unless voting is mandatory. Or make impossible to vote twice because everybody is tied to exactly one anonymous ballot. See my reply to parent, about the voting system in Italy. However if some party control a part of the voting system, they can do whatever they want in several ways. For example vote with the ballots of people that didn't go to vote.

If the distributed system is not partitioned, you can show up to vote anywhere and they tell your home precinct that you've voted; then during vote counting the precinct where you voted tells your home precinct \"add the following to your vote totals\". If the system is partitioned -- either from network outages or remote polling locations or mail-in ballots -- then your ballot goes into an envelope and is physically sent to your home precinct in the week following the election, to be verified and included in the count. reply dh2022 1 hour agorootparentBut what if I vote three times in three different locations all different from my \"home\" polling location? reply cperciva 1 hour agorootparentIf the network is connected, the first time you vote succeeds and marks you as having voted; subsequent attempts fail because they know you've already voted. If the network is not connected, your three remote ballots go into envelopes marked \"dh2022\" and in the week following the election they are physically transported to your home polling location, at which point they see that you tried to vote three times, set those ballots aside, and call the police. reply alexey-salmin 1 hour agorootparentThis breaks the anonymity of the vote, marks can be traced back to real people.

So this is different from actual constitutional scholars. That makes this question unsuitable for literacy tests. At a minimum: I think people should be given ample time to complete a literacy test, at a date and time chosen by the test taker, and also have multiple attempts available.

It was intentionally about ambiguity. It was intentionally designed to allow the test grader to decide pass or fail, regardless of what the \"correct\" answer was.

Too many \"rational\" people who think that these were just clever word games and that \"they seem fair,\" when being unfair was the entire point. As if the law, and the test givers were going to treat the people taking these tests fairly.

The government then tried to exclude him using a dictation test, which could indeed be in any European language, and the test he failed was administered in Scots Gaelic. Some controversy arose when it turned out that the person giving the dictation test couldn't themselves understand Scots Gaelic, but the High Court ultimately ruled in Kisch's favour for the somewhat amusing reason that Scots Gaelic was 'not a European language' (at least within the meaning of the relevant law).

And I would argue, that the new right indeed does see the connection, they want to have that connection to today times (see shouting SA slogans). \"It is some unclearly defined Nazis who took over the control of Germany and did all the killings and destroyed a few countries around.\" Not sure what that sentence means. \"But not anyone's grandfather was involved.\" You seem to have missed the 1960/70s where the topic exactly was that \"The fathers did this and didn't talk about it\" (In the West, East Germany just declared themselves victims of the Nazis) - which directly lead into the red terror (Red Army Faction RAF) of the 1970s as a reaction to \"old nazis\". And you seem to have missed the large Wehrmacht discussion in Germany https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wehrmacht_exhibition (late, I know) \"And supposedly the companies which built their wealth on slave work and death of thousands continue to prosper.\" Many companies have paid [0] (late, not enough IMHO) for using slave labor - at least that discussion led to every company pay a historian to write down that part of their history most ignored before. The biggest problem is not the companies but some rich people in Germany like the Quandts who are one of the richest families in Germany and own a large chunk of BMW - they got their money by slave labor, selling to the Prussian army and the Wehrmacht and by stealing from jews.

During the Cold War they were a lot less honest; the Nazi regime was often used as propaganda against the other side. e.g. West Germany would downplay Germany's capitalist class's role in Hitler's rise to power and emphasize the racial nature of the Holocaust. East Germany[0] would do the opposite, emphasizing capitalism and de-emphasizing antisemitism[1]. These different spins on the same events were intended to downplay their side's role in the Nazi regime, shifting all the blame to the other. This is especially true in the West. Large swaths of the German capitalist class actively backed Hitler and the Nazi party, and got away with it. How they got away with it is particularly appalling. One of the most common defenses at Nuremburg was \"I was just following orders\", an excuse that was usually rejected. But there was one very specific kind of order that would reliably keep Nazis (Hugo Boss, IG Farben, etc) out of the noose: shareholder duties. In the name of anticommunism, there was an active campaign in the First World[2] to downplay the war crimes of German capitalists after WWII. The AfD is not a result of Germany being tired of remembering. They're a result of Germany's denazification being incomplete - and politically influenced by the exact same economic forces[3] that put Hitler in the chancellor's seat in the first place. States create liberal democracies with free markets, businesses figure out how to exploit those markets, they get unfathomably rich before someone can stop them, they coopt or overthrow democracy, and then replace liberalism with tyranny. Overthrow is possible because society has vulnerabilities that can be exploited through propaganda and outrage porn. You socially engineer the public into abolishing their own liberty to hurt the other that they hate. In America, that vulnerability was African Americans. In Nazi Germany's case, it was deeply rooted antisemitism. In today's Germany, it's immigration[4].

But I know it should be Stazi - it sounds more like something Colonel Klink would say. In general as a reply, I'm not sure where you grew up in Germany (or if, because of Stazi). I grew up in West Germany in the 1970 and 1980 and there was not one week where there wasn't a story about German war crimes, genocide etc. in one of the large magazines. It was also a large topic in school. But it seems where you grew up things were different. \"In Nazi Germany's case, it was deeply rooted antisemitism. In today's Germany, it's immigration\" No it's the same. Racism together with the special case of antisemitism. People don't change. \"The AfD is not a result of Germany being tired of remembering. They're a result of Germany's denazification being incomplete\" Interesting view point. I would assume it is wrong (though I do think denazification in the East was incomplete), it doesn't have anything to do with being tired of remembering or incomplete denazification. Its just that people don't change, and they are nationalists, socialists and racists (just like the Nazi party - (National Socialists)) and with the rise of the populist right in the US and all over Europe, they thought they should band together again.

Not sure what the argument is. The \"Because\" looks like it should be an argument. Also the sarcasm seems to make it an argument somehow. Was it just an expressed opinion of \"Germany was most of the time undemocratic, unfair and discriminating\"? Yes, it wasn't democratic in the Kaiserreich from 1871 until 1918, it had huge democracy deficits in the Weimar republic from 1918 to 1933, it was a murderous, facist dictatorship from 1933 to 1945, and a Russian puppet state with fake elections from 1945 to 1989 in the East.

The instruction is clearly to draw a line under something. That something may be whatever is followed by \"under\", so you underline \"the last word in this line\". Or \"in this line\" just narrows it down, so only \"the last word\" is to be underlined. Or the whole \"last word in this line\" is meant as an instruction to be interpreted, so it's \"line\". In that case, be careful not to underline the period, as sentence marks clearly aren't part of a word. Or maybe they are.

Because then you can use this adject dismissal of reality to apply racist laws and claim they're not racist. In the naivest, most shallow analysis Voter ID is not racist because black Americans are just as capable of receiving ID. The logic is fine, but purposefully ignorant. The barrier to ID IS NOT just \"do you have the physical/mental ability to get ID\". The barriers are economic and geographic. When you don't put DMVs in black areas that becomes a barrier. When IDs cost money that becomes a barrier. When a motor vehicle is required that becomes a barrier. reply M4v3R 12 hours agorootparentprevnext [4 more] [flagged] llamaimperative 5 hours agorootparentAssuming that you’re sharing this in good faith, the claim “it’s difficult for black folks to get identification” is a compressed way of saying “ease and necessity of accessing civil services like DMVs is not evenly distributed across the country e.g. very GOOD accessible civil services in Harlem, Manhattan and NOT very accessible civil services in rural Appalachia, and the unevenness tends to correlate with other forms of inequality in our society such as along rich/poor and white/black lines, meaning some types of voter ID laws create systematic bias in who is able to exercise their constitutional right to vote, and given that it is effectively impossible to make any impact in any election via voter fraud even without voter ID laws, the mass disenfranchisement of a non-random sampling of Americans is not worth the upside.” Hope that helps! reply consteval 5 hours agorootparentprevFrom a statistical standpoint, there are proportionally less black people with ID than other racial groups. It's not a matter of capability, it's purely a factual matter.

Additionally, think about all the votes that were passed when these tests were present. Every one of those votes meant a huge and consistent portion of the population could not participate. Which probably created a situation where that population was at a disadvantage across many systems. Even if they stopped doing this test in 19XX, it would take a significant amount of time to unwind not only the unfair policies enacted under it but also the damage done by those policies to families. We might still be undoing the damae from them. A similar case is redlining -- city policies that forced immigrant and minority populations to live in certain areas, limiting those family's abilities to participate in the growth of housing value. A couple generations cannot accrue value from their homes, because they've been forced to live in a low value area. Even once redlining became illegal, those families were 60 years behind in an exponential growth curve. Fixing the policy is a great start, as was removing these tests, but we need to do more to actually make things right. The sheer unadulterated racism from the past is still very much being felt in the present, as waves and ripples from past decisions and policies led to inequal financial and social outcomes that take generations to repair (if they ever can be repaired.) reply jhp123 5 hours agoparentprevnext [2 more] [flagged] boohoo123 4 hours agorootparentThe CIA (disguised as Trump supporters to help invalidate half the country) implemented these tests? That's weird. reply akira2501 19 hours agoprevIt's possible. It was designed to be. It was used because southern Blacks actually did have a lower literacy rate than Whites at the time and this was seen as the most expedient \"filter\" they could create. The real racism was in all the ways to bypass the test. Grandfather clauses, land ownership clauses, \"demonstrated understanding\" options. Most White people challenged by the test wouldn't ever need to actually confront it. These weren't the only requirements either. You had to be of \"good character\" and \"understand the duties and obligations of citizenship under a republican form of government\" and to be able to \"read _and_ write.\" Finally even if you were Black and managed all of this it wasn't at all a guarantee that your registration or vote would be accepted. Sometimes this understanding would be communicated in an act of violence. The test is a tiny archival curiosity created by a much more overt system. reply tptacek 19 hours agoparentIt's not possible. Several of the questions have multiple valid answers. It's pretty obvious what the scheme is. reply akira2501 19 hours agorootparentThat comment is a reflection of my pedantry and I don't think we're actually disagreeing. It's not possible to know the right answers because there never were any. This means the test has no predictive power, not that it's impossible, and again, since some Whites unable to prove education did have to contend with this, it was designed that way intentionally. I feel \"near impossible literacy test\" is a terrible description. The \"intentionally ambiguous literacy test\" would be more apt. More worrying is I am unable to find a definitive provenance for this document. It suggests it was used in the early 1900s but the print quality and format seems unusual in several ways to me. Which is why I attempted to reduce it in favor of considering the rest of the system. reply not2b 19 hours agorootparentThe reason that it is impossible is that there is no possible set of answers that would require the test-giver to acknowledge that a test-taker passed the test.

Most notably, pilot examinations for aviation and maritime certifications. I think they use these types of questions to exclude rule memorisation and test the ability to reason about the intention or relevant effects of rules and principles of the art involved. It seems like the intention is also to penalise the inability to reason about ambiguous situations, ensure that the subject can effectively divide attention (if you spend too much time focusing on these ambiguous situations trying to find a nonexistent perfect answer you will fail the test), and to filter out low cognitive ability in general. I’m not a test design expert, however, so ymmv. reply kelnos 18 hours agorootparentprev\"Impossible\" is apt, because it is not possible to answer all the questions on the test in an unambiguously, objectively correct manner. \"Impossible\" also refers to how the test administrators used it: in order to make voter registration impossible for some people. > That comment is a reflection of my pedantry Stop with this sort of thing, please.

But imagine, if only people who can really understand written text, who can calculate, who understand how legal system works, who have basics of logic could vote. Of course, those tests shouldn't be that ambiguous, but if they were phrased a bit more clear, these would be very simple. At the same time, English has changed in the last 50 years. That phrasing might have been common back then. reply oersted 6 hours agoparentI think there's a broad misunderstanding about the core goal of democracy. It's obviously not the optimal system to ensure that the best possible decisions are taken, it's not designed for that. It's more about allowing everyone to have a say in their destiny, to decide together what \"best\" means, even if it's somewhat objectively wrong. Of course, you need significant balancing mechanisms to ensure that bad decisions are not too common. So you don't let the people micromanage everything and you build the system such that different parts of it keep each other in check. Sometimes it goes too far and the population has very limited choice over what's going on, sometimes it doesn't go far enough and the system is incompetent and chaotic. Often it's both, it's a hard problem. But there's obviously better human organizational systems to take the right decisions towards a given goal or metric. That's why companies are not democratic, they are better at optimizing wealth creation (or whatever other metric), but we keep them sandboxed within the big-picture, keeping monopolies to a minimum (particularly the monopoly on violence, the core leverage of any government) so that they have a somewhat limited influence on people's lives. The military is not democratic either, neither is the justice system, nor many other performance-critical systems, they are more optimized to take better decisions at the expense of giving a choice to everyone they impact. reply SilverBirch 8 hours agoparentprevI think you're being a bit naive. The test was designed to disenfranchise people, it was literally designed by people who didn't want black people to vote. You can't say \"Well I guess it could've been less ambiguous\" the whole point was to be ambiguous to give a pretext to disqualify black people from voting. You can get 0 answers wrong and there would still be a way of throwing away your vote. Take question 11 - cross out the number necessary when making the number below 1 million. Do you cross out the excess 000s or do you cross out 1,000,000. Or do you cross out enough numbers to make the number below 1 million? The answer is it doesn't matter because (a) by giving you a multiple viable chance they've already managed to disenfranchise a percentage of the people they're targetting, and (b) whatever you do they can just claim the opposite interpretation and refuse you a right to vote. There wasn't some high minded idealism behind this test. It was a tool for the people administering the election to select who they wanted to allow to vote. Any test you design will serve the same purpose, albeit some more efficiently than others. reply marcusverus 7 hours agorootparent> It was a tool for the people administering the election to select who they wanted to allow to vote. Any test you design will serve the same purpose, albeit some more efficiently than others. Yes. The point of literacy and competency testing is obviously exclusionary.

And in this it works remarkably well. reply oersted 6 hours agorootparentSome say that the Roman Republic lasted for so long because it gave just enough voice to the people so they felt heard and the ones in power could not afford to fully ignore them, while not giving the people sufficient power to elect someone that could up-end the oligarchic status quo that was proving to be so competent. There were also lots of checks and balances within the oligarchy to prevent any given radical person or faction from taking over. For example, Consuls (president-like) were voted-in indirectly through a popular assembly (kinda like the Electoral College). They elected two Consuls that had to rule jointly and keep each other in check. Their term was only 1 year and they could not run for election again for the next 10 years. Consuls rarely had the chance to do any significant damage to the system or build-up power. The Senators served for life and acted as a counterbalance. They were also elected rather indirectly by other popular assemblies, but they came mostly from the aristocracy that maintained a consistent tradition of Roman culture and morals, for better or worse. The thing is that there were enough of them (300, later 600) that internal competition always kept them in check and prevented anyone from getting too much power. An interesting system. But please do not take this as me advocating for such a system. The Romans were terrible violent oppressors by modern standards. A system of government lasting for a long time is not necessarily a good feature, it just means that it's good at keeping its power, nothing else. A status quo that cannot be easily changed is great if you are lucky and the status quo turns out to be good, but it's horrible if the situation is bad and there is no easy way to fix it. I just wanted to give a bit of context. reply Cthulhu_ 4 hours agoparentprev> But imagine, if only people who can really understand written text, who can calculate, who understand how legal system works, who have basics of logic could vote.

    "originBody": "Hands-on Apple’s AirPods Pro hearing health features are as good as they sound The AirPods Pro 2 will soon offer more robust hearing protection and a new hearing aid feature. But it’s the hearing test that really hooked me. By Chris Welch, a reviewer specializing in personal audio and home theater. Since 2011, he has published nearly 6,000 articles, from breaking news and reviews to useful how-tos. Oct 21, 2024, 11:00 AM UTC Share this story Apple announced a trio of major new hearing health features for the AirPods Pro 2 in September, including clinical-grade hearing aid functionality, a hearing test, and more robust hearing protection. All three will roll out next week with the release of iOS 18.1, and they could mark a watershed moment for hearing health awareness. Apple is about to instantly turn the world’s most popular earbuds into an over-the-counter hearing aid. That also means we’re about to enter an era where we’ll need to get comfortable with people wearing earbuds at all times. There’s a perception that leaving your earbuds in while talking with other people is rude. Transparency mode in many of today’s earbuds sounds totally natural and lifelike, yet I still constantly remove my buds to show someone they’ve got my undivided attention. That way of thinking has to change when popular earbuds start pulling double duty as hearing aids. It’s a powerful way to reduce the stigma that’s all too common with hearing aids, but this shift will take time. Over the last several days, I’ve been able to preview Apple’s hearing health features. At times, the experience has been emotionally intense. I’m someone who grew up with a Discman and iPod basically attached to my hip, and I’ve been to countless concerts over the decades. I also haven’t seen an audiologist since 2018 or so. That’s anything but unusual; Apple says 80 percent of adults in the US haven’t had their hearing checked in at least five years. Putting a test right on your iPhone is a great way to improve that trend. The AirPods Pro 2 are transforming into something much more than wireless earbuds. Prevention: hearing protection Did you know there are people who’ve already been replacing earplugs with the AirPods Pro at concerts? Until this fall, Apple had never endorsed such a use case or advertised its earbuds as hearing protection devices. The company knew people were doing it but kept quiet on the subject. That’s now changed. With iOS 18.1 and the soon-to-be-released AirPods firmware update, the AirPods Pro 2 will offer hearing protection at all times across noise cancellation, transparency, and adaptive audio modes. There’s no “concert mode” or a specific setting to toggle. You can think of this as an expansion of the loud sound reduction option that was already in place. Hearing protection is on by default, and Apple says “an all-new multiband high dynamic range algorithm” helps to preserve the natural sound of concerts and other live events. This chart shows the effectiveness of Apple’s hearing protection across the different sound modes of the AirPods Pro 2. Image: Apple Which listening mode you’ll use for concerts comes down to personal preference. I’ve found adaptive audio works well since it lets you customize whether you prefer more noise cancellation or more passthrough. But even in full transparency mode, some level of hearing protection is active. The more noise cancellation that’s applied, the longer you can remain in relatively loud environments. There are limits to what the AirPods Pro 2 can handle; Apple’s hearing protection isn’t cut out for extremely loud, sudden noises like gunfire, fireworks, or a jackhammer. Sustained noises over 110dBA are also too much for the earbuds. Some clubs and concerts can definitely exceed that threshold, so be aware. The AirPods Pro aren’t as discreet as some hearing aids, but their popularity and ubiquity could help reduce stigma. Awareness: the Apple hearing test You’ll need a quiet space when taking Apple’s hearing test. Before getting started, your iPhone will do a quick analysis of ear tip fit and environmental noise to ensure you’re good to go. All of these hearing health features are calibrated for Apple’s stock silicone tips, so if you’re using aftermarket third-party tips (including foam), there’s no guarantee you’ll get the optimal experience. Once the test begins, you just tap the screen whenever you hear any of the three-beep tone sequences. There are a few key things to know about Apple’s hearing test. For one, it’s designed so that you can’t predict or game it. The test can play any frequency at any time, so no two are the same. Apple tests your left ear first, and here’s something I wish I’d known going in: it’s completely normal to hear nothing at all for several seconds at a time. It was in those moments, when five, six, or even 10 seconds would pass without an obvious tone sequence, where I’d start feeling pretty anxious. My best advice is to avoid wondering if you should be hearing something at a given moment and instead just focus on the tones as they come. Some can be incredibly faint. There are visual cues that let you know the test is still moving along even during silence — the most obvious one being a large circle that animates onscreen throughout the process. (You’ll also notice a progress dial for each ear that fills as you take it.) My left ear has a bit more hearing loss than my right. Screenshot: Chris Welch / The Verge I took the test twice several days apart, and my results for both ears fall under “little to no hearing loss.” Having recently turned 40, I’ll take that. The ranges are as follows: Little to no loss: up to 25dBHL Mild loss: 26–40dBHL Moderate loss: 41–60dBHL Severe loss: 61–80dBHL Profound loss: above 80dBHL I also learned that my left ear has definitely lost a bit more over the years than my right, which is something I’ve never noticed in daily life. The slight difference between my two tests is exactly the margin that Apple expects for people who take it multiple times. Results are stored in the Health app, where you can export individual tests (or all of them) as a PDF. Here’s how one of mine charts out: Hearing test results can easily be accessed from the Health app. Screenshot: Chris Welch / The Verge You can also import charts from tests you’ve taken with a hearing professional. This data is what’s used to configure the hearing aid feature. Apple’s hearing test only takes about five minutes, but it felt like a long five minutes for me and everyone else I’ve let try it. Again, that’s probably because it’s been too long since many of us have done this. The second time wasn’t nearly as stressful. I can definitely see the hearing test having a viral moment on TikTok and other social media, which seems like a great thing for awareness all around. Hearing loss is incredibly common: 1.5 billion people around the world are living with some extent of it, according to the World Health Organization. Assistance: AirPods as hearing aids For those 18 years and older with mild to moderate hearing loss, the AirPods Pro 2 can now serve as a clinical-grade hearing aid. Once enabled, you can also toggle on a “Media Assist” setting that uses your hearing test results to optimize the sound of music, phone calls, and video content. Within the settings menu, you can use sliders to fine-tune the hearing aid feature’s amplification, tone, and balance. These options are also accessible via Control Center on an iPhone, iPad, or Mac. Much like you can slide a finger on the AirPods Pro 2 stem to adjust volume, you can use that same gesture to control amplification when the hearing aid mode is active. You can only use the hearing aid feature when in transparency mode. Apple’s instructions for the hearing aid feature advise that it takes time — in some cases, weeks — for customers to get fully accustomed to the sound. Jerry Saltz, the art critic at New York Magazine (and someone with diagnosed hearing loss), took Apple’s hearing test at our Manhattan office and was impressed in his brief time trying out the hearing aid feature. But no one has had access to it long enough for an in-depth assessment. I’m sure there’ll be detailed comparisons between the AirPods Pro 2 and existing OTC devices in the near future once iOS 18.1 is widely available. You can make hearing aid adjustments from the iOS settings menu. Being able to use Apple’s $250 earbuds as a hearing aid is a huge deal for those who can benefit from this capability. That’s substantially less expensive than over-the-counter hearing aids from Jabra, Sony, and other brands. But the AirPods won’t be right for everyone. People with more severe hearing loss will still need to seek out other solutions (including those pricier products). And the main tradeoff with the AirPods Pro 2 is battery life: they can last for around six hours with the hearing aid engaged, which doesn’t match what you’ll get from many OTC and prescription hearing aids. But this is a big milestone — and it seems inevitable that Samsung, Google, and other tech heavyweights will follow Apple’s lead fairly quickly. I’m all for that, even if it feels strange that hearing aid functionality has become the latest aspect of ecosystem lock-in. We spent a long time bemoaning the loss of the headphone jack. With advancements like this, and earbuds helping to improve so many people’s quality of life, we’re finally starting to see a worthwhile payoff.

If anybody from the accessibility teams is reading this, please know that it is difficult for me to overstate my gratitude and my appreciation for the amount of work this must've taken. Music sounds unbelievably better through my AirPod pros, and I didn't even know what I had lost until I heard it again. I'm willing to bet that a lot of my middle aged compatriots don't even know how much their hearing has degraded… Get your hearing test tested, folks, while you still have it! reply analog31 16 hours agoparentYes, and protect your hearing while you can. Turn down your tunes. Disclosure: Working musician. I wear musician's earplugs when playing in bands. reply Semaphor 14 hours agorootparent> I wear musician's earplugs when playing in bands. As a musician, you possibly have custom ones, but for anyone else who’s not an audiophile, you can get decent ones that mostly preserve the sound while lowering the volume for around $15-20. A godsend for concerts. reply analog31 13 hours agorootparentI actually just use the Etymotic ER20's. I'd rather have cheaper ones that I can afford to lose, and also have a pair in each instrument case. reply analog31 3 hours agorootparentI'm past the edit window here, but have a couple more thoughts. First, I'm just a jazz player, so my gigs can get loud, but not screaming stooopid loud. Second, I am almost always amplified on stage, meaning that the most delicate subtleties of optimal tone quality are lost anyway. Many of the rock players are moving to in-ear monitors, which block everything but replace it with your monitor mix, received via wireless. On the other hand, some band mates, and my kids, play classical. Their needs are a lot more critical in terms of perceiving their tone quality. A benefit of the fitted plugs is that you can get the capsules with less attenuation, which means you're still safe in something like a classical ensemble, but without losing too much. reply blendo 11 hours agorootparentprevYes, +1 for etymotic. I’ve used them for years. reply euroderf 6 hours agorootparentprev> A godsend for concerts. Maybe necessary for movie theatres too. Contemporary volume levels are abusive (imo). reply SketchySeaBeast 5 hours agorootparentAre they ever. I watched Alien Romulus in Imax, I'm not doing that again, it was painfully loud. I am an avid concert goer and I wear earplugs every time - Romulus without earplugs was by far the loudest thing I've been exposed to this year. reply SketchySeaBeast 5 hours agorootparentprevAnd, if you can't afford those, just get some orange foam ones - they have excellent protection, often greater than the audiophile ones, and, let's be honest, that bar or arena you're going to wasn't built with sound quality in mind. reply tim333 4 hours agorootparentPersonally, also at the very cheap end, I like wax ones partly because you can vary the noise blocking as needed - put them in loosely or squish them in. reply an_d_rew 15 hours agorootparentprevTotally agree but there's a small caveat... Everybody has vastly different sensitivities to sound exposure. Even identical twins with identical sound exposures can have drastically different hearing profiles especially as they age. I actually have always been very careful with my hearing; there is some evidence that I may have a very very mild congenital birth defect that makes me prone to hearing loss, but that's largely speculation. My wife is actually older than me and has a spectacularly sensitive hearing - as does her mother! - and she's the drummer! (The wife, not her mother :-) I just do keys and vocals...) That's why it's so important that everyone protect their hearing because even though it's not too loud for the people around you, it might be too loud for you - and you won't know until it's too late. reply formerly_proven 10 hours agorootparentHearing being a \"logarithmic\" sense and decibels make this a bit weird to me. Like losing 6 dB of hearing in a car crash is considered negligible and insignificant, but that actually means the ears lost half their sensitivity in a flash (and it's never coming back, just like teeth). Likewise your 50 dB hearing loss is considered moderate, but actually represents a 300-fold reduction in acuity. reply an_d_rew 4 hours agorootparentExactly! Although I try not to think about that too hard because... well it's kind of depressing. But it's the exact reason that hearing aids are so difficult to design. For example if you were to naïvely try to just \"add back\" 50 dB of gain to a 70 dB ambient sound, that hearing aid would be trying to pump 120 dB of sound energy into your ear canal... which would actually cause damage to the surrounding cochlear bands... But if it doesn't try to add something there, then everything sounds distorted because you have way too much sound energy from the other frequency bands, perhaps ones where you have much higher sensitivity. Hence the multi band compression and why it's so difficult, and why hearing aid manufacturers focus on speech intelligibility above and beyond everything. reply dagmx 13 hours agorootparentprevI shoot live concerts as a hobby and it blows my mind that I’m the only one in the media pit with hearing protection. My Apple Watch is screaming at me that its damaging levels of audio, and I can’t imagine listening to the show without protection. reply iwontberude 3 hours agorootparentWhen I go to rock concerts I am the one percent, when I go to bass music shows all of a sudden half of the people are wearing ear protection. I think some scenes and genres are better about this than others. reply JKCalhoun 6 hours agoparentprevMy wife is in her 50's. Her hearing seems noticeably poor than it used to be but she is in a bit of denial about it. This will be my first purchase of Air Pods — and for my wife. A kind of stealth hearing aid.... reply an_d_rew 4 hours agorootparentHearing loss is one of the very few proven and CAUSAL mechanisms behind cognitive degeneration as we age. They even know the mechanism: the slow imperceptible year by year withdrawal from rich communication patterns with our environment. I found that it took me a little while not to feel \"old\" when I discovered that I needed hearing aids. But my oh my what a difference. It's difficult to describe to someone what it's like and how much less cognitive energy you have to put into even simple things like discussing lunch with your wife! reply meragrin_ 5 hours agorootparentprev> A kind of stealth hearing aid.... I've had hearing aids for years. People don't notice unless you don't have much hair or you have to have the industrial strength ones. reply Loughla 5 hours agorootparentI would add, I've also never heard anyone make fun of another human for having hearing aids. I do not understand the stigma around these things. reply KineticLensman 4 hours agorootparentI've been wearing them for 10 years and have never had any bad comments as a result. When I first got them, work colleagues were visibly pleased for me that I had done something about a problem that was getting worse (not being able to follow quiet conversations in meetings). The one time someone did say something slightly negative that included \"oh it's that guy with the hearing aids\" I came back with \"yes, and thanks to them I can hear what you just said, the clue is in the name\", which got a general laugh that helped a lot. But that was a one off, apart from people slightly staring sometimes when they notice them, no one seems bothered. reply JKCalhoun 4 hours agorootparentprev\"Stealth\" in this case means I am stealthily getting her to try a \"hearing aid\" by way of Air Pods. reply DanielleMolloy 11 hours agoparentprevDid you try AppleMusic? Not directly related to your case, but I thought I had some age-related hearing loss when listening to Spotify Premium only for a decade. I appreciate their recommendations (found me a whole bunch of new interesting bands, even new favourite ones), but didn't know how awful Spotify's quality is even in comparison to Apple's standard codec. I didn't make the switch yet since for lossless since I don't have enough space on my phone, but am considering it, even for just showing support for the current music quality efforts over at Apple. reply gnatolf 10 hours agorootparentSpotify high quality is usually 320kbps. If not, it's because only worse qualities are recorded/available. I have sincere doubts you're able to hear a difference to lossless qualities, especially if you're listening on the go or in non-hifi setups. The Apple RDF seems strong here. reply dbspin 10 hours agorootparentI've heard this argument so many times - but personally I can trivially easily here the difference between Tidal / Apple Music and Spotify's 'high quality' setting - even on wireless headphones. Music on spotify sounds flat and drained. No idea if this has something to do with their compression technique, some kind of EQing, or a flaw in some other part of the pipeline, but I've blind tested it many times and its night and day. reply frereubu 9 hours agorootparentI can't speak to Apple Music or Tidal, but I did a test between the Spotify and CD versions of Xtal from Selected Ambient Works 85-92 by Aphex Twin and the difference would be clear to absolutely anyone - the Spotify version is very tinny. People often trot out the \"most people can't tell the difference\" argument, but I wonder how many of those people have actually tried a variety of tests? My hunch is very few. reply amlib 6 hours agorootparentAre you sure you are not comparing a normal release to the remastered version? There are plenty of albums out there that have \"improved\" or remastered versions but are not labelled as such in the album title, and Selected Ambient Works 85-92 is one of those. reply slickytail 10 hours agorootparentprevGenerally the problem with this type of argument is that the two sources are not volume-matched. Try out an ABX test here, of lossless vs various lossy codecs: https://abx.digitalfeed.net/ reply threeseed 9 hours agorootparentSo that test doesn't mention how the FLAC was encoded back in 2014. Because most of the benefits of Apple/Tidal lossless come from the fact they are encoding in 24-bit, 192 kHz direct from the original masters. reply ZeroGravitas 8 hours agorootparentWhich is effectively a remaster and so invalidates every single claim that detecting a difference is due to superior fidelity. reply threeseed 8 hours agorootparentNot all of the library is encoded this way and you can still easily hear the difference. reply amlib 6 hours agorootparentWhich still means it's a remaster/different mix. I used to be like you many years ago, thinking that high samplerates and bit depth were essential and the ultimate way of getting the best possible sound quality, but in reality 44.1khz 16bit is plenty for humans. Get over it. Whoever mixed the 192khz version essentially remastered it and put a bit of a spice over it. You can easily prove it by producing a downmixed 44khz version (use a high quality resampler) from the 192khz version and trying to blind ABX both, I doubt you will be able to spot any difference, and if you do, congratulations your sound system has some weird intermodulation issue from the high frequencies present in the high sample rate version, that is causing a listenable sound to appear (which should not be there). reply dbspin 6 hours agorootparentI think you're missing the wood for the trees here. It makes no functional difference to the listener whether the reason spotify sounds worse is their use of lower quality masters, or some aspect of their streaming or compression. In practice their library sounds significantly, measurably worse to many people. I've also blind tested this with friends when I signed up for Tidal, and most people I tested were able to clearly hear the difference. reply layer8 5 hours agorootparentprevThis. No double-blind ABX test has ever been able to discern the difference between an above-CD quality file and its downsampled CD-quality equivalent, or even a 320 kbps MP3 encoding of it. reply threeseed 1 hour agorootparentprev> Get over it It seems more like you need to get over it. I have never cared about bit rates etc. I just care about how it sounds and I know that lossless sounds significantly better to me and to many others. The amount of gaslighting when it comes to audio is always bizarre to me. reply threeseed 9 hours agorootparentprevI can easily hear the difference between Lossless and AAC on my two IEMs (Blessing 2 Dusk + IE600) as well as my open-back Focal Clear. And even with Bluetooth via AptX HD. With the quality of audio improving so much in recent years I would take a guess that almost anyone can appreciate the significant difference in sound quality forSpotify high quality is usually 320kbps 320kbps of what? Theoretically, if Spotify's claims are true, Ogg Vorbis at 320kbps should be indistinguishable from lossless in most listening scenarios. In practice, I found this not to be the case and there is a significant difference, even when using lossy equipment like Apple Airpods Pro. I do not understand where the difference comes from. It could be that Spotify uses a crappy encoder. Could be that they \"cheat\" on bitrate. Or it could be the interplay of different compression schemes. But something is definitely off. I compared to Apple Music with lossless and Roon ARC playing my own FLAC-encoded media. I really wish Spotify offered lossless. reply arianvanp 9 hours agorootparentprevSpotify does some loudness normalization that you could disable in the settings. (Don't know anymore as don't use Spotify for years). Maybe worth checking. reply SirMaster 5 hours agorootparentBut that's just an auto volume level, it doesn't actually change the sound balance or dynamics or anything like that. It just makes the average volume of the track closer to the average volume of other tracks. reply lawgimenez 7 hours agorootparentprevTry listening to death metal, the difference is obvious. reply danaris 7 hours agorootparentprevYou can't judge the quality of a digital audio file purely on its bit rate. There are many things that (can) go into digital mastering and re-encoding that can make huge differences in actual audio quality of the final product, even with the same file format and bit rate. reply repler 5 hours agoparentprevIt's just like putting on glasses but for your ears! I had the same experience as you did - what a difference. reply miki123211 11 hours agoprevIt feels like mainstream technology is slowly replacing most if not all accessibility devices, and I think that's a really good thing for those who need them! This already happened to blind people. We used to have color testers, specialized audiobook / ebook players, GPS devices, text scanning / OCR machines, devices for banknote recognition, barcode readers, talking scales, thermometers, blood pressure meters and so on, all as separate devices, all extremely expensive. Nobody really had or carried all of these at once, though most people had at least some, it was just too expensive and impractical. Nowadays, while those devices still exist, all you really need is any smartphone (even a low-end Android will do, though iOS is much better for this use case IMO), a free screen reader, which both OSes include by default, and a couple of free / cheap apps. Things like talking scales can be replaced with accessories connected over Bluetooth that don't technically talk, but that expose the measurements to your smartphone screen reader. reply jgrahamc 8 hours agoparentIt feels like mainstream technology is slowly replacing most if not all accessibility devices, and I think that's a really good thing for those who need them! Pretty much everyone eventually suffers from some sort of \"disability\". Hearing, eyesight, motor control, strength, etc. etc. So, I like to think of accessibility features as being made for everyone. Some people just need them earlier or with deeper functionality than others. reply jillesvangurp 10 hours agoparentprevInteresting perspective. I never thought about this properly. But it seems things like Google Lens and other machine vision apps paired with a good screen reader can help blind people to \"see\". I did some recent experiments with the openai api recently to see if I could make sense of photos by classifying and describing things. That worked surprisingly well for the absolute minimal effort I put in ( It's literally painful to watch movies in modern theaters without them. > It may look silly, but I still plug my ears when a large truck/train passes by. Do not be afraid, fellow high-sensitivity brother. As scientifically proven, the normies brains will literally melt when they become unable to follow conversations, excluding them from social life, while being too stubborn to wear hearing aids and suffer from tinitus. Meanwhile we will continue to hear. > noise cancelling buds Consider Moldex 780201 SPARK PLUGS, my go to earplugs for sleep and when I am sure I don't need to listen to anything. Deeply inserted they provide extreme noise cancelling and are even better than airpod prods in some frequencies (though worse in others). reply asdfman123 13 hours agoprevThe technology that destroyed my hearing is now here to save it! reply switch007 11 hours agoparentThat's modern capitalism for you. reply Solstinox 6 hours agorootparentHumans creating problems they then need to then solve transcends and predates any ideology. Capitalism just lets you scale it out to new heights! :) reply artdigital 16 hours agoprevWent to see an artist (DJ) I liked and forgot my filters. Remembered that I had my AirPods Pro and used them in transparency mode and after only 10 minutes completely forgot I had them even in. I was surprised how good they worked as hearing protection! Now when I’m at festivals and I have friends without earplugs, I usually recommend them to just use their AirPods Pro (if they have some) instead of buying cheap plugs reply Gigachad 16 hours agoparentI've done that. At some point I felt like they weren't doing anything and pulled them out only to discover what a good job they had been doing. They lower the volume while keeping the sound pretty much the same. It's incredible. reply whoitwas 9 hours agoparentprevThis comment confuses me, but makes sense. Concerts are for consuming sound, people wear ear plugs??? Wouldn't that defeat the purpose? Like a blindfold in a theater? reply roelschroeven 6 hours agorootparentBands, DJs, clubs, concert venues, festivals (almost) all insist on playing music much louder than needed for reasons I'll never understand. The choice between \"play music on a decent level for everyone to enjoy without causing hearing loss\" and \"play music too loud, requiring everyone to either wear ear protection or suffer hearing loss\" has somehow been decided in favor of the latter. It's ridiculous. For some kinds of music it is more or less ingrained in the culture -- think of the \"It goes up to 11\" in Spinal Tap. But in fact it's worse than that; almost all music is played way too loud. During the Covid period I attended a number of smaller scale events, that for some reason used a lower sound volume. It Was So Much Better. Those events proved what I already heavily suspected: you do no need those high sound volumes to fully enjoy music. reply LysPJ 9 hours agorootparentprevThe music at many concerts and nightclubs is unfortunately loud enough to cause permanent hearing loss. Ear plugs reduce the volume to a level where you can still hear the music, but the risk of long term damage is reduced. (You can get \"musician's ear plugs\" which attenuate all frequencies equally, so they don't make the music sound weird.) reply belzebalex 9 hours agorootparentprevThe main reason is that it's tough to have a uniform sound pressure distribution on a stage. That means the people at the front usually have very high sound levels, while those at the back have way lower. Technicians then make the tradeoff of having too high pressures at the front (where you must have earplugs) to afford to have medium levels at the back. reply bouvin 9 hours agorootparentprevEarplugs lower the volume, they do not cut the sound completely. Good earplugs (I use Etymotics myself) can do this without affecting the sound quality, making concerts enjoyable and safe. reply jghn 4 hours agorootparentI grabbed a pair of Eymotics several years ago and never looked back. For a while I didn't believe they worked and kept having to take them out, only to realize that they were in fact dampening the volume even though the music sounded the same. reply ntlk 9 hours agorootparentprevWeirdly, earplugs can make it easier to hear certain detail, despite the reduction in volume. I wear earplugs at concerts and I can hear all the instruments, despite them somehow reducing the intensity of crowd noises. It’s also a lot easier to hear people talking to you, as long as they’re speaking in the direction of your ears. reply Peanuts99 8 hours agorootparentprevI know several people who have permanent hearing damage as a result of loud clubs in their 20s. Gotta look after your hearing when listening to love music. reply Almondsetat 13 hours agoprevYou can say a lot of things about Apple, but which other consumer-facing tech company adds features meant to accompany people throughout every phase of their lives? People are growing with their smartphones, and the need for some functionalities only starts to become obvious later in life. reply makeitdouble 6 hours agoparent> which other consumer-facing tech company SONY. Apple really took Sony's playbook and ran with it, with the whole ecosystem play and strategy tax. Jobs famously took inspiration from there, Sony lost to Apple on the music market though, and got toasted again on mobile phones, despite having been researching the market for so long. reply tim333 4 hours agorootparentThey even basically copied the iPhone design off Sony https://es.pinterest.com/pin/78742693455593417/ And then freaked out when Android copied that off them which seemed a tad hypocritical. reply mannyv 3 hours agorootparentUh, no. reply lnsru 12 hours agoparentprevIt’s just marketing. A plus point in differentiation matrix from gazillion competitors. And a justification for a higher price tag. The products are nice though. reply bobnamob 9 hours agorootparentIf all marketing had actual consumer benefit we'd be much better off. I can understand the cynicism, but I think Apple's investment into accessibility and health (I'm talking heart attack detection, not gamified activity tracking fwiw) as a differentiator is one of these rare win-win situations. reply stavros 9 hours agorootparentHow is are win-wins rare? They're literally what capitalism is based on. reply tgv 6 hours agorootparentThat's a very Friedman-esque take. Capitalism is nothing more than private ownership of means and capital (usually in a market largely free of government control). The recent inflation outbreak is a clear example where capitalism is not a win-win. Banks, hedge-funds, private equity are other good examples. reply bobnamob 8 hours agorootparentprevYeah fair shout. I guess my perception of their frequency’s been beaten down by HN cynicism over the years reply tim333 3 hours agorootparentprevThey've been at it for a while. One quote: >At a shareholder meeting in 2014, a conservative finance group wanted Cook to make a commitment to doing only those things that were profitable. Cook replied, \"When we work on making our devices accessible by the blind, I don't consider the bloody ROI.\" reply an_d_rew 11 hours agorootparentprevI understand your point and in someway do agree that it is marketing and it is a way of differentiating themselves. But inly to justify a higher price tag? Yes it is true they are premium products, but I don't think it's true that they're that much more expensive than similar items occupying the same marketing niche from other manufacturers. And they are far more than an order of magnitude cheaper than even a low end set of hearing aids. But all of that is despite the point. Samsung, Sony, Bose,… The list goes on. I have bought high-end headphones from them all, some with some without noise cancellation. In ear, over the ear, wired and Bluetooth... the list goes on. NOBODY has a headphone that accommodates my hearing loss except Apple. And they started doing it years ago as a feature buried in the accessibility settings. But they kept improving it to the point where it is now FDA approved. \"A plus point in a differentiation matrix…?\" This is the kind of action that buys customer loyalty for life. I hope you never get to experience the depth of hearing loss that many of us have and how utterly transformative this kind of technology not just can be, but IS. reply uberduper 5 hours agorootparentBose made a product ~10 years back called Hearphones which were far more capable than what Apple is doing here. IIRC Jabra earbuds have had \"hearing aid\" features for years. They, unfortunately, don't help with single side deafness the way the Hearphones do. Apple isn't doing anything groundbreaking here but they are doing it at a very competitive price. The airpod features also do not help with single side deafness. :( reply TiredOfLife 8 hours agorootparentprevSamsung has had amplified passthrough for years. reply anaclet0 1 hour agoprevThis is pretty cool! Exclusive inside Apple’s audio lab where the company is taking on hearing loss https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOkiDwH98sE reply irjustin 16 hours agoprev> Transparency mode in many of today’s earbuds sounds totally natural and lifelike, yet I still constantly remove my buds to show someone they’ve got my undivided attention. That way of thinking has to change when popular earbuds start pulling double duty as hearing aids. It’s a powerful way to reduce the stigma that’s all too common with hearing aids, but this shift will take time. This will never be not true. You're fighting human nature. The vast majority of people don't need hearing aids and those who do you'll likely know they need a hearing aid if you're having regular or more personal conversations. If you're getting your order taken at Starbucks, you can totally have ears in even today. reply acdha 15 hours agoparentWhen was the last time you heard someone get called “four eyes” for wearing glasses? Mockery used to be common but society can improve and it seems like accepting people with disabilities as fully human has been improving even if we still have room to go. reply derefr 14 hours agorootparentI have a feeling that mostly went away not because society got any more considerate, but rather because glasses became much more commonplace, due to the explosion in prevalence of nearsightedness. reply klausa 13 hours agorootparentIsn't the proposed mechanism the same here? The stigma will/should go away, because more people will keep their earbuds in; because they will use them as hearing aids. reply irjustin 12 hours agorootparent> because they will use them as hearing aids. But we're saying most people don't require hearing aids and thus will never reach mass market and thus the stigma won't disappear. reply acdha 4 hours agorootparentIsn’t that approaching the problem from the other direction? Hearing aids have some stigma because they’re not as widely needed as glasses before old age, but that’s not the primary reason why AirPods sell so the numbers are completely different. In my generation most of us have been talking about older Boomers relatives who’ve resisted visible acceptance of aging and pretty much everyone has been optimistic that they’ll use AirPods and wear an Apple Watch because those don’t telegraph “I’m elderly” the way hearing aids or one of those dedicated fall monitors do. reply irjustin 3 hours agorootparentYou said it yourself it's for a specific group of people. Society will still think it's rude if someone they know who doesn't have a hearing problem under 40 doesn't take their ears out when trying to have a material conversation with them. It doesn't matter how many old people have airpods in. Because again - the younger group generally doesn't need it. Taking your ears out is a sign of respect and showing attention like the article says. Why are we so bent on fighting human nature? reply acdha 2 hours agorootparentI haven’t witnessed that dynamic: the people leaving their AirPods in tend to be young in my experience and it doesn’t seem to be seen as rude unless you’re ignoring the other person. reply Schiendelman 7 hours agorootparentprevAlmost everyone needs hearing aids. It's just a matter of when. reply euroderf 6 hours agorootparentprevOoh, I like \"four ears\". When I splurge on AirPods I'll encourage my family to call me that until they get used to them. reply irjustin 15 hours agorootparentprevwe're saying the same thing - if you have a disability it's totally fine. You know who in your life has the hearing impairment, but the vast majority do not have this disability thusly \"taking your ears out\" is respectable. The glasses analogy only works if general society has hearing impairments, but that's not the direction we're going as the human race, so we won't see this. reply Ylpertnodi 14 hours agorootparentprev>Mockery used to be quite common...

I’m giving an order and basically getting an ACK. reply azinman2 5 hours agorootparentBecause you’re interacting with another human being who is there helping you. I’m guessing you’ve never worked retail/service before. People treat retail/service workers like shit all the time. To wear an AirPod while ordering is another distancing layer that dehumanizes the other person. reply FumblingBear 2 hours agorootparentI always take out headphones when interacting with service workers, but I'd say at this point a solid 80% of them have their own airpods in even when taking orders or in a directly customer facing role. I think the social stigma has just changed over time. reply azinman2 14 minutes agorootparentI’m not seeing people working with their own AirPods in. I would not think very highly of such an employee. reply renewiltord 16 hours agoparentprevSocietal views change. Moving from the Jabra Jawbone to AirPods it seems like it went from “that asshole business guy” to “literally everyone” in no time. When I was young, talking on a Bluetooth headset while walking down the street was worthy of derision. Things have changed a lot since then. reply MBCook 15 hours agorootparentTo go back way further, wasn’t Sony worried about the Walkman initially because the only people who wore headphones at the time out and about tended to use them for hearing aids at the time?

There was a period when the Borg look was widely seen as representing “At any moment someone more important than you could call me.” reply jmull 8 hours agoprev> And the main tradeoff with the AirPods Pro 2 is battery life: they can last for around six hours with the hearing aid engaged, which doesn’t match what you’ll get from many OTC and prescription hearing aids. Since they are comparing to devices $1K and up, maybe getting two pairs makes sense. reply mmmlinux 3 hours agoprevMy girlfriend is hard of hearing and wears hearing aids. When we first started dating I tried them at one point to see what it sounded like. I knew right then apple was going to come for that market.

As someone with a diagnosed, severe hearing loss, I wonder how these compare to prescription hearing aids. I currently wear a pair of Phonak hearing aids and am looking to replace them, but I wonder if spending 5-6k on another pair is worth it versus the OTC or Apple AirPod options that exist today. reply ilt 16 hours agoparentIf you have severe and above hearing loss, these won’t help much. This is what I have gotten to know from lot of forums. They do work well for my moderate-to-severe hearing loss. Been using for around 7 months now. reply an_d_rew 15 hours agorootparentYes the problem with severe hearing loss is that hearing aids simply cannot compensate for what is no longer there. Hearing aids are actually a a lot more complicated than just boosting frequencies. At the very simplest, these days they are wide/multi band compressors that try to balance discomfort with natural hearing, generally focusing on speech intelligibility since that is by far the most important target. If you have severe hearing loss I would strongly recommend putting yourself in the care of a professional. Costco is a great source of probably the lowest cost versus highest quality hearing aids these days... but the reason I say \"professional\" is because there are so many kinds of hearing loss and they all affect your perception markedly differently. It's a lot more than just \"missing some sensitivity at some frequencies\". reply ilt 15 hours agorootparentI know what you mean. I am in India. Hearing aids are exorbitantly priced here and there is no Costco. I will definitely go for more professional ones once I can afford them, and not just buying them, but losing them too. reply an_d_rew 14 hours agorootparentOof! How unintentionally North-American-centric of me - apologies! But regardless of where you or anyone else is, hearing aids are eye-wateringly expensive :-( and often for rather understandable reasons. reply an_d_rew 16 hours agoparentprevMy experience is that they serve different purposes. I have a very nice and expensive set of ReSound hearing aids and they're fabulous at what they do, which is focus on speech and kind of on music if I set them for that. They're also unobtrusive and easily last 18-20 hours on a charge. I forget I'm wearing them, and nobody notices that I have them. My AirPods I use primarily for running and listening to music because they just sound unbelievably better, and they're probably fine for a concert although I haven't done that with them. But I think for long-term use every day all day it wouldn't be that comfortable or unobtrusive. Would love to hear the experience of somebody who's trying it, though! reply wenc 15 hours agorootparentI don't have hearing loss, but I wear 2 pairs of AirPods Pro 2 over the course of a 10 hour day. The reason I have 2 pairs is because 1 pair only gets 5-6 hours of battery life, and I need to swap them while they recharge in the case. Comfort? To me, very comfortable. I just leave them in there with Active Noise Canceling on all the time. I may be showing my age, but if you remember \"Get Smart\", AirPods Pro 2 are like a Cone of Silence -- except they actually work. reply nomel 15 hours agorootparentprevLooking at the web, they’re also over $4500. I think the people who will most appreciate the AirPods are the ones that can now afford to put something in their ear to help their hearing. reply blendo 10 hours agorootparentprevIn my experience, the rubbery Apple ear tips in the AirPods have better sound isolation and audio quality, but foam aftermarket tips better keep the AirPods from falling out. reply aeternum 16 hours agoprevI'd like to see Apple run some opt-in scientific trials. For example: Does active noise cancellation result in more or less hearing loss? Or Alcohol consumption: Apple Health could ask each day how many drinks you had and many people want to track it anyway. Correlate that to health metrics at a wide scale. It'd be much more powerful than any currently existing study given the userbase likely to opt-in.

I have a feeling that it might be difficult for Apple to obtain FDA authorization for a system consisting in part of a device that Apple didn't manufacture (i.e. an Android phone). Getting the iPhone + Airpods system authorized was unusual enough already. reply makeitdouble 6 hours agoparentprevThere are a bunch of other makers already selling OTC ear aids, they will probably be a better choice specifically with android. e.g. https://hearing.electronics.sony.com/ reply 015a 5 hours agoprevI think its awesome that Apple has built these features, and I prefer to live in a world where they exist versus don't. The hearing aid feature, to me, is a little overblown. It feels to me like the biggest positive impact it will have is, with some luck, forcing down the price of typical hearing aids and opening up the conversation on more competition. It might also be good in a pinch, and good for lower income customers(?), but I think at the end of the day there's a reason why hearing aids are generally pretty slim, skin colored, and innocuous. There's no reason why I have to take my Airpods out when I order Chipotle, I can hear everyone perfectly fine with them in, but I do because there will always be social stigma talking with someone who has earplugs in. There was an \"event\" on Threads a while back where a wedding photographer asked \"the world's\" opinion about asking attendees to take their Apple Watches off. Some people say \"oh hell yeah, those are gaudy, I don't want any of my wedding party even wearing one at any point in the event\", meanwhile one person responded \"The Apple Watch is literally a medical device for me, I need to wear it as often as possible, I can't take it off\". Idk; feels like a related concept. Sometimes the social stigma doesn't matter, these devices drive some people insane with anxiety about their health, Apple's marketing plays up the anxiety because it sells hardware every year... at some point, someone will say \"I can't take the Airpods out, they're my hearing aids, as diagnosed by iOS 18.1\", and maybe this is just me being an old man yelling at clouds, but... that's cringe, go see a doctor. The other angle I don't hear talked about enough: The Air Pods Pros don't have the battery life to really fill the same role as hearing aids. reply tzs 16 hours agoprevBased on the graph it looks like the hearing test only tests out to 8 kHz.

There is a similar situation with the Natural Cycles app, which is cleared by the FDA as a medical device, so you can buy it with an FSA or HSA, or have insurance pay for it - which is mandatory, since it is legally a birth control device, which they have to cover. (It is also a steal for the insurance company since it costs roughly $10 a month.) I expect that insurance plans that cover hearing aids are going to cover this eventually, as a set of AirPods Pro 2 is $249, which is substantially cheaper than other hearing aids on the market. An open question is if any other manufacturer will be able to get a device that works this well at this price point - the amount of software and chip design engineering that went into H2 and the bridgeOS or RTKitOS that the AirPods run is just not something smaller manufacturers will be able to easily copy.

Well, \"classic\" hearing aids have two features that I don't see Apple replicating any time soon: longer battery life (AirPods roughly last around 4-6 hours depending on battery degradation and usage, whereas hearing aids run for days) and most especially, support for audio induction loops [1] - basically PA systems for the impaired, you'll find these in churches, conference/meeting rooms, concert halls/stadiums and in the UK also in taxicabs. Classic hearing aids will have their place for quite the time to come.

I still haven't been able to determine if this \"new\" feature is any different from what already exists. I hope so because when you enable your audiogram for transparency it sounds like you're in an ASMR video. There's no way to make it sound natural but louder, which is what I would expect from a hearing aid. reply MBCook 15 hours agorootparentThe audio gram stuff existed, but wasn’t well known and as mentioned required a third party app. The hearing aid stuff was only recently certified by the FDA as an OTC hearing aid.

And that’s not to mention the fact that you can buy replacement individual AirPods or cases cheaper than a full set. Or just get AppleCare so replacements are even cheaper if you tend to lose/damage them a lot.

(Graeme Jennings/Washington Examiner via AP, Pool, File) The Associated Press WASHINGTON -- A federal rule banning fake online reviews is now in effect. The Federal Trade Commission issued the rule in August banning the sale or purchase of online reviews. The rule, which went into effect Monday, allows the agency to seek civil penalties against those who knowingly violate it. “Fake reviews not only waste people’s time and money, but also pollute the marketplace and divert business away from honest competitors,” FTC Chair Lina Khan said about the rule in August. She added that the rule will “protect Americans from getting cheated, put businesses that unlawfully game the system on notice, and promote markets that are fair, honest, and competitive.” Specifically, the rule bans reviews and testimonials attributed to people who don’t exist or are generated by artificial intelligence, people who don’t have experience with the business or product/services, or misrepresent their experience. It also bans businesses from creating or selling reviews or testimonials. Businesses that knowingly buy fake reviews, procure them from company insiders or disseminate fake reviews will be penalized. It also prohibits businesses from using “unfounded or groundless legal threats, physical threats, intimidation, or certain false public accusations.” People can report violations at https://reportfraud.ftc.gov.

Amazon is notorious for allowing shady practices like Sell product A for lots of 5* reviews, then change the product listing to a completely different thing (which may or may not deserve 5) ... Another aspect is review solicitation. eg: ios games often pop up with their own modal of \"Rate us\" and if you click 5 it redirects you to app store to make a review, if you click 4 or less it redirects you to a feedback form.

Do they require only users who verifiably used/purchased the product to submit reviews? Do they require the reviewer to actually use the product? for sufficient amount of time so that the review is more than just \"first impression\"? So many loopholes, this won't change anything except perhaps a few big marketplaces but it's doubtful they will be able to police it reply marinmania 32 minutes agorootparentI don't have the most faith it will be easy to execute but I would imagine: - Some disgruntled people at company's could leak directly, which would make engaging in this behavior riskier - Random individuals or competing companies could monitor product reviews and report. For example, show that an Amazon product ID used to be for another product 3 months ago when reviews were written. I'm optimistic. There are a lot of regulations (including digital regulations) that everyone ends up following even if the government isn't monitoring things themselves. The risk of penalty just needs to be high enough, and hopefully places like Amazon realize the downside/penalty of fake reviews now makes it worth policing. It obviously won't help your \"first impression\" review problem but that's not the intent of the law and not sure why the government would be involved in that. A lot of movies don't hold up well on a rewatch, too.

I can review a can opener in a few minutes. Either it opens the can or it doesn't. How would I ever review something like a Ford F-350? I don't even have a trailer heavy enough to test the towing capacity. reply PaulDavisThe1st 1 hour agorootparentWell, that's a bad example ... The can opener I had for the first 50 years of my life left a dangerous crazy sharp metal edge around the opening which I cut myself on more than once. The Oxo can opener I've had for the last 10 years rolls the edge as it cuts and removes the entire top of the can; what's left is extremely safe, at least by comparison with the old style. Then again, when I was much younger, I had a backpacking can opener that was useful when hiking in places where sometimes buying canned foods made sense. It was about as large as a very large postage stamp, and crazy good for the size and weight. I wouldn't want to use it at home (much), but it was awesome when I had to carry it around. So, even for can openers, the story can be complicated. Also, assuming that the primary purpose of an F350 is towing is ... interesting. Lots and lots of them here in rural NM (as much as anyway, anyway), and they are rarely towing anything. reply bear141 1 hour agorootparentNot debating the practicality here, but even if you need your truck to do something only once in the entirety of your ownership, it needs to be capable of this all the time. Towing, crawling, etc. reply mlyle 1 hour agorootparentI disagree. I've never had a vehicle that does 100% of whatever I'd want a vehicle to do. At some point we need to make tradeoffs and accept that we'll either have limitations or need to solve some problems in a different way. Letting something that is 1% of operating hours for a device drive requirements strongly is often a mistake. With some obvious exceptions because e.g. I cannot choose when I am going to engage in maximum braking and defer it to a different vehicle. reply conductr 1 hour agorootparentThey do make trade offs. Just not the same you might make. The F350s are limited on where they can park and are a pain in the ass to drive around a city. Some people tow stuff more frequently than they go into the city though, so it probably is a reasonable trade off to them. Also comes with some other perks like comfort and more beefy off road capabilities. Something that is valuable in rural areas even without towing. I tow stuff about a dozen times a year and live in a city. I drive a Tahoe because not being able to tow when you want to is a pretty big inconvenience even though I’m a single occupant driver 90% of the time and it’s way bigger than I “need”. Turns out it’s quite comfortable and I just like it, even if I wasn’t towing ever. I went years of renting vehicles just to tow. It sucks in a lot of ways. No one just wakes up and thinks “I’m going to tow some stuff”. You’re doing it for a reason, there’s probably a high amount of labor involved in that reason, trying to do it all in the rental window or find an appropriate vehicle on the day you need it. Is a challenge. I’ve set rental reservations then it rains so I can’t do the work I needed to. Clear skies tomorrow but have to wait a week for another rental to be available. It’s a hassle. Another thing I struggle with is my towing needs fluctuate a lot. Earlier this year I was doing a construction project and ended up needing to tow stuff practically every day for 6 weeks. If I tried to do that any other way than owning a capable vehicle, it’d have been logistically challenging. Trying to time vehicle rental with trailer and equipment rentals would have dragged the construction project out to easily triple the time just by adding delay, probably much longer. Not to mention the cost of it all. Which the bigger vehicles do cost more, but they are assets even if depreciating. When you rent it’s pure expense. The rent cs own calc can flip quickly. reply mlyle 44 minutes agorootparentSure. I'm not saying it's completely unreasonable. Here the person was saying \"once in the entirety of your ownership\". If it's really once in the vehicle's life, then you really should rent something else when you need this. I understand renting vehicles to move stuff is a PITA. I've used the hardware store's trucks several times and it adds a lot of anxiety to a project (though I've never had a really tough time with availability). reply conductr 22 minutes agorootparentAh I think he was making a point about the need being Boolean more so than a literal meaning of once. You said 1% which probably matches up to my usage of the tow feature. All good though, those rentals are definitely the most available but they rarely work for me as I usually need more time. They design it to be highly available for short store-to-home trips. Occasionally I still rent, sometimes I need a bigger truck than I have due to weight. ultimafan 32 minutes agorootparentprevI bought a truck for similar reasons (was tired of constantly having to rent/borrow cars to tow or haul/pick up something that doesn't fit in a \"normal\" car). I got a lot of utility use out of it over the years and I do honestly agree, even though I now almost never have to use it for anything truck-related I'm still very happy with it, it's very comfortable and reliable. I'd buy another one in a heartbeat. The convenience of knowing I can spontaneously throw anything I want in the back without ever thinking or planning about it in the rare cases I do still occasionally have to is just the cherry on top at this point. reply vel0city 1 hour agorootparentprev> but even if you need your truck to do something only once in the entirety of your ownership I'd just say rent something for that one off time in its entire ownership. Otherwise, I'd be daily driving a 26' box truck because I moved apartments every few years. One time I had to ship a few pallets of stuff across the country. I guess I should have just bought a semi-trailer truck as a daily driver. reply conductr 1 hour agorootparentprevI see a ton of 5 star reviews that just say something like \"Super fast shipping!\" and think, \"OK, have you even opened the box? does it work? is this review for FedEx?\" reply LargeWu 1 hour agorootparentprevSome will be obvious, such as a review for a book or game or other media item that hasn't been publicly released.

Sellers will sell a product say a usb adapter, cheap and fully functional, users leave reviews and then the seller changes the listing to be a completely different item, retaining all the previous ratings and sale counts. How would this apply here is a good question. Wouldn't like to assume but regulatory bodies usually think about these things in advance no ? reply thereddaikon 2 hours agorootparentHaven't ebay reviews always meant to be about the seller and not necessarily the product?

SnazzyLabs is a good example - he should be well within the criteria for Apple to be sending him iPhones and Macs early, but I can only assume Apple thinks he's too critical when he finds an issue he doesn't like.

Bunch of people report Amazon as being rife with fake reviews. FTC puts together some sort of working group that does some research to figure out if it's true. If it's true, they reach out to Amazon telling them to fix it after handing them a fine. After a while, they verify that Amazon implemented sufficient safe-guards against fake reviews.

I certainly hope this will get fixed and not jump to the next loophole. reply consteval 30 minutes agorootparent> business wants it this way Of course they want it. It's purely objective for them and purely deceptive to the consumer. Therefore, it's the perfect thing for the FTC to regulate - I mean this is what their purpose is. Enforcement will be difficult, but I really think platforms like Amazon isn't the problem. They're a unified platform, it's pretty easy for them to enforce better review. Maybe you need to have actually bought the product, maybe they monitor product descriptions for asking for reviews, maybe they audit packages for those little \"review us 5 stars!\" slips, maybe they prevent modifying products, etc. The true tough thing to enforce is little shops. You know, convenience stores, smoke shops, that type. I've been told, verbally, many times that if I review 5 stars, I get some discount.

[1] https://levkk.github.io/rwf/migrating-from-python/ kvirani 4 hours agoNice, congratulations. It must feel so surreal launching this! One of my biggest learnings from doing a bunch of web MVC through Rails over the years is that the framework should heavily discourage business logic in the model layer. Some suggestions: - Don't allow \"callbacks\" (what AR calls them) ie hooks like afterCreate in the data model. I know you don't have these yet in your ORM, but in case those are on the roadmap, my opinion is that they should not be. - That only really works though if you not strongly encourage a service aka business logic layer. Most of my Rails app tend to have all of these as command aka service objects using a gem (library/package) like Interactor.* * It's my view that MVC (and therefore Rails otb) is not ideal by itself to write a production-ready app, because of the missing service layer. Also, curious why existing ORMs or query builders from the community weren't leveraged? Disclaimer: I haven't written a line of Rust yet (more curious as the days go by). I'm more curious than ever now, thanks to you! reply ecshafer 2 hours agoparent> One of my biggest learnings from doing a bunch of web MVC through Rails over the years is that the framework should heavily discourage business logic in the model layer. I am curious where this comes from, because my thinking is the absolutely opposite. As much business logic as possible should belong in the model. Services should almost all be specific more complex pieces of code that are triggered from the model. Skinny controller, Fat Model, is the logic of code organization that I find makes code the easiest to debug, organize, and discover. Heavy service use end up with a lot of spaghetti code in my experience. The other part is that from a pure OOP pov, the model is the base object of what defines the entity. Your \"User\" should know everything about itself, and should communicate with other entities via messages. > Don't allow \"callbacks\" (what AR calls them) ie hooks like afterCreate in the data model. I know you don't have these yet in your ORM, but in case those are on the roadmap, my opinion is that they should not be. This I agree with. Callbacks cause a lot of weird side effects that makes code really hard to debug. reply CharlieDigital 31 minutes agorootparent> I am curious where this comes from, because my thinking is the absolutely opposite. As much business logic as possible should belong in the model. The opposite of this is what Fowler has called an \"Anemic Domain Model\"[0] which is ostensibly an anti-pattern. What I've learned from my own experience is that with an anemic domain model, the biggest challenge is that the logic for mutating that object is all over the codebase. So instead of `thing.DoDiscreteThang()`, there could be one or more `service1.DoDiscreteThang(thing)` and `serviceN.DoDiscreteThang(thing)` because the author of `service1` didn't know that `service2` also did the mutation. Domain models are hard to do well and I think the SOA era brought a lot of confusion between data transfer objects, serialized objects, anemic domain models, and domain models.

Callbacks cause a lot of weird side effects that makes code really hard to debug. Also Django signals, Symfony events... makes things extensible but also hard to debug indeed. reply JamesSwift 51 minutes agorootparentprevIn general, I think 'unit test' level business logic should be in the model (think configuration for data-driven workflows, normalization logic, etc) but 'integration test' business logic should be in a service (callback logic, triggering emails, reaching across object boundaries, etc). I think most people agree about skinny controllers but I've definitely seen disagreement on if that gets moved to fat models or service objects. reply idle_zealot 2 hours agorootparentprevThis sounds to me like the standard OOP versus Data Oriented programming divide. You want to think of code as a bunch of bundles of data and associated functionality, GP wants to think of code as data models and services or functions that act on them. reply yoyonamite 1 hour agorootparentprevIt's because people ended up with models that were thousands of lines and difficult to reason about. Out of curiosity, did you end up running into this issue and how did you deal with it? reply throwaway313373 40 minutes agorootparentIf I had to choose between thousands lines in models and thousands lines in controllers I'd definitely take \"fat\" models over \"fat\" controllers. reply sodapopcan 3 hours agoparentprev> * It's my view that MVC (and therefore Rails otb) is not ideal by itself to write a production-ready app, because of the missing service layer. This is quite the claim. I despise service objects, personally. They end up scattering things around and hurt discoverability. There are other ways to do modelling that scale very well. There are a few blog posts on it, here's one from someone at Basecamp: https://dev.37signals.com/vanilla-rails-is-plenty/ This is of course very OO which I'm not a huge fan of. Elixir's Phoenix framework, for example, uses \"contexts\" which is meant to group all related functionality. In short they could be considered a \"facade.\" In any event, if you like services you like services, they can work, but saying MVC isn't enough for production-grade is a bit misguided. I do agree that model callbacks for doing heavy lifting business processes is not great, though for little things like massaging data into the correct shape is pretty nice. reply jt2190 3 hours agorootparentIt would help a lot if you would clarify what you mean by “service object”. In my experience a single method on a service object would define a transaction. Is that what you mean by “service object”? reply sodapopcan 2 hours agorootparentAlong the lines of what OP is talking about, part of the problem is that Rails has no service objects, so I have seen a handful of different ideas of what they mean (probably no more than 10). The one I've seen he most is stuff like `UserRegistrationService` or the like. These things can end up getting scattered and in general, I would rather just talk to the business object, ie, `User.register` which can delegate to a more complex private object handling it. It's basically \"inverting\" things. The win here is that things are more discoverable (You can look at the user object and see a list of everything it does) and more importantly draws better boundaries. This way the web layer only has to know about `User` instead of `RegisterUserService` and `DeleteUserService` etc. Again, services can work and aren't inherently bad, but plain MVC can certainly also work. reply CSSer 1 hour agorootparentI feel like the same people that like UserRegistrationService will argue that database table names should be plural because it reads better, which is wrong for similar reasons. reply sodapopcan 45 minutes agorootparentI don’t really follow.

So far I've reluctantly agreed with the hive mind that Axum on balance is the best choice, despite being lower-level than I'd like. Other contenders were Loco (but was TOO much like Rails) and Rocket (whose macros only started to bother me after writing more Rust). Your framework seems to perfectly match my criteria of \"batteries-included, but not too prescriptive\". Great addition to the ecosystem! reply throwaway313373 3 hours agoprevI would kinda expect REST framework to be able to generate Swagger (aka OpenAPI) definitions out of the box. That's one of the killer features of FastAPI in my opinion. Also, I don't really understand what is the reason for creating your own ORM instead of integrating with, let's say diesel.rs [0] and what is the reason for inventing your own template language instead of just picking one of the most popular existing template engines [1]. Other than that this project looks really interesting and I will definitely keep an eye on it. [0] https://diesel.rs/ [1] https://crates.io/categories/template-engine reply levkk 3 hours agoparentI tried Diesel years ago, it was too \"Rusty\" for me. It made you define your schema twice, and couldn't use the same structs for inserts and selects (so 3 times, really). Overall, great first attempt at matching database types to Rust types, but the ORM needs to be more flexible and ergonomic - it's supposed to make writing queries easier, not harder :) As for templates, writing your own language is almost a right of passage into 30s+ nerd club. I never read the dragon book, but I always wanted to take that class in school. There will always be different implementations of the same thing, and writing this one that mimics very closely what ERB (Rails) does felt right. reply the__alchemist 3 hours agorootparentSame: I was put off by keeping track of models in triplicate, and the lack of automatic migrations. These are considered features, vice bugs; it's not for me. reply phibz 1 hour agorootparentI tried diesel about 5 years ago. I needed to do relationships where the foreign key lived on the other side of the relationship from what diesel wanted. IIRC diesel only supported the key on a specific side, I think it was a M:1 relationship. Diesel docs said this was unsupported. I was still learning traits at the time but navigating how to implement this in diesel was beyond me. I used sqlx and moved on. reply xyst 1 hour agorootparentprevNever been a fan of ORMs in general. Working with the extra abstraction layer on top of SQL can be painful. reply throwaway313373 47 minutes agorootparentprevRe ORM: fair enough, I don't have any experience with Diesel, just wanted to know if you have an actual reason or if it's just a case of NIH [0] syndrome :) Re templates: I understand that writing a new template engine can be a very fun task (it is both hard enough not to be boring and easy enough not to feel daunting). I also thought many times of creating my own template engine to fix things that I don't like in the language that I am currently using (mostly jinja2). But if you intend this project to become an actual production ready solution, I see a lot of good reasons not to reinvent template language: 1. Forcing users to learn yet another template language is an additional entrance barrier 2. Tooling support. Existing languages might already have a good tooling support (coming from Python world: PyCharm supports both Django templates and jinja2 very well) including syntax highlighting, auto-complete, auto-formatting, linting etc. Are you going to create all of it yourself? 3. You mentioned planned migration from Python. How exactly I am supposed to manage templates during the transition period? Do I have to have two copies of each template: one in legacy language and one in your new language? If you had a template language compatible with Django/jinja2 [1] this problem would not arise. 4. Whether we like it or not more and more people are using LLMs for coding. This potentially could solve the issue of migrating templates. I expect LLMs to perform really well on the task of \"translating\" a template from ato a . The problem is that if your template language is brand new, LLMs probably didn't have enough examples in their training sets to \"learn\" its syntax. So, basically, you are setting up your users for a boring, tedious and error prone task of rewriting each template manually without a proper support from their IDE/editor. Meh. BTW, Django makes it very easy to bring your own template engine [2].

You write integration tests against the server and get an openapi spec as output. But thats for rails. reply florianmartens 1 hour agorootparentprevI agree. API-first is the way! Change your schema, auto-generate types into your code and use them for your server definition. It's just faster and more secure this way. Use api-fiddle.com or spotlight.io to work with the schemas (branching, sync with Github). In a fully typesafe world, it should be pretty hard to derive from the shema this way. reply giancarlostoro 1 hour agorootparentprevAs others suggested, I would diff against a generated one, then potentially treat the generated one as source of truth in the future...

This goes back to the good old monolith vs. microservices debate. Writing a stable WSGI server is possible, and not very hard with a bit of attention to detail, e.g. thread counts, vacuum (just like good old php-fpm, restart every n requests...), etc. Basically if you implement most options uwsgi has, you're on the right path.

    "originBody": "In the past 3 years, I’ve run over 300 interviews. On average, I meet someone new every 3-4 days to understand if they’re the right fit for an early-stage startup. I especially like capping interviews with an open-ended question that really lets great candidates shine. One of my favorite now-retired questions is, in Thielian fashion: “What’s something you’ve learned that you believe gives you an edge - something that you’re almost surprised more people don’t know about?” One of the all-time best answers I heard was this: When you’re starting something new, the most important thing is knowing what to learn. Followed by unpacking an optimal learning flow: Very quickly identify what the foundational knowledge is. Build a personal curriculum to become an expert and avoid the trap of the expert beginner. Sprint hard the first 15-20 hours to impress initial memory, then decelerate to a more regular pace. #1 and #2 are common structured approaches to learning, whereas #3 is a relatively novel interpretation of spaced repetition. But at a more meta level, the unexpected takeaway is the vast majority of people likely haven’t updated their mental model for learning in decades. (Stop and think for a moment on the last time you did this.) Learning to learn is extremely high leverage. 40 hours at 25% efficiency is the same as 12.5 hours at 80% efficiency. And it turns out that being productively honest is one of the most effective and kindest things you can do for yourself.",

It doesn't have to be actively not fun either, but the primary feeling should be that of effort. It should look a lot less like that \"10 minute full body\" workout from your local digital media creator and a lot more like a serious session at the gym. You want the mental equivalent of sweating. It's not that the quickie doesn't do anything, it's just that it is wildly suboptimal if you actually care to learn. [0] https://x.com/karpathy/status/1756380066580455557?lang=en reply cloverich 3 hours agoparentA counter point, or maybe complementary point (b/c I agree w/ the quote). I killed myself trying to do more than 8 pull ups in a gym for ages; at times I'd be going to the gym 4x a week doing full body workouts, always working hard, always sweating, always gassed at the end; consistently doing pull ups to exhaustion on multiple sets. Yet 8 was a kind of ceiling. At some point I stopped working out, but got a pull up bar at home. I stuck it in my office doorway. I would do occasional pull ups -- never more than 2-3, usually only 1. But just casually a few times a day, nearly every day, when I walked by it. It was never hard, it never felt like work. It became more of a way to briefly relax, an alternative to the cigarettes I used to smoke. Well after a year of that when someone challenged me to a friendly pull up competition, I was shocked that I could do 15 in a row easily, I still had more in the tank even. That always stuck with me because it taught me that while hard work is important, consistency is _more_ important. Working \"hard\" as such is often not only not required, but perhaps often not actually the thing that will help. reply nickburns 58 minutes agorootparentFor anyone not familiar with this methodology, it's called 'greasing the groove.' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmOEgK5o2yg reply cjbgkagh 2 hours agorootparentprevThat’s a reasonably well known strategy to pull-ups. Start at one regularly and slowly build up once it becomes easy enough to do so. I think learning is more like growing plants, you don’t need to get everything perfect, or even one thing perfect, but a set of things to good enough. There are a lot of things that interfere with learning so the presence of those will inhibit learning regardless of effort. reply systems 1 hour agorootparentprevhow much weight did you loose during that time? you either lost significant weight, or added significant muscle .. no other way .. the end result here is more significant than how you reached it for pull up, loosing weight is usually far more important than adding muscle, so i am leaning toward you lost weight reply cloverich 57 minutes agorootparentOh, I'm pretty lightweight / lanky (hover around 165lb, BMI around 20-21). I didn't see any significant weight change at the time, perhaps I transferred muscle if that's a thing since I was doing less general muscle building at that point - just pushups and the casual pull up routine, running (sprints) to blow off steam. I can see weight loss being a significant factor for heavier people, esp. those that are heavy and strong. I am definitely neither (typical things like bench press / squat etc I used pretty light weights). reply marginalia_nu 55 minutes agorootparentprevEh, you can also improve your lifts by just not being exhausted every time you go to the gym. With lifting, more is not always more. Fatigue and failure to properly recover is a fairly common reason for plateaus, especially with full body pulls. reply zer0tonin 2 hours agoparentprevThis is complete bs. I've learned 2 languages to fluency by mostly watching movies. I've learned the linux cli by setting up a minecraft server for my friends in high school. I've learned programming by making IRC (and later Discord) bots for communities I was part of. All of this was fun, and it worked better than staring at a textbook and hoping that my \"effort\" pays off. reply bityard 2 hours agorootparentI think there is some conflation in this thread between \"learning\" and \"practice\" which are fairly different things. As an ADHD person, nothing shovels the dopamine into my neural receptors quite like going from zero to \"knows enough to be dangerous\" in a new hobby or field of knowledge. That's the fun part. But climbing the experience curve much further than that requires some amount of _deliberate_ study and beyond that deliberate _practice_ and experience in order to become something like an expert. Chasing questions down rabbit-holes is fast and entertaining but only takes you so far. Deliberate practice (studying) is mostly less fun, even when that thing is your life-long passion and/or career. But necessary if you want to be highly skilled in that area. reply sksxihve 2 hours agorootparentprevAgreed, consistency is more important than doing a marathon session.

This is a must. Eg: For RL it would be Barto&Sutton book. Sometimes the best source is not intuitive. Eg: The best way to become a safe driver is to go to performance drivign school - its a bit expensive but they tell you how to sit and stay alert in a car which I have never seen outside of these schools. One of my most common things nowadays is to ask ChatGPT is to ask to build a curriculum. Creating and understanding what a great curriculum looks like is 20% of the work of understanding a field. You can LEARN ANYTHING now if you have the time and inclination and elbow grease. Truly nothing is beyond your grasp - NOTHING. Its a magical time. I'm actually building a tool that will do all this for you and get you started down the learning path faster than what we have now. And for the curious - the best way to learn medicine is not a textbook. There are solutions out there like Skethcy which work much better for anatomy. My own learning project - learn Medicine \"on the side\". It seems ludcirous that we give up the keys to our health to doctors just so we don't have to learn 2 years of courses. Am going to fix that! reply firejake308 5 hours agoparentAs a medical student, perhaps I can give some recommendations on the best free resources to learn medicine. If you like YouTube videos, Ninja Nerd has a great channel for learning the foundations. If you like textbooks, I used Guyton for physiology and Harrison's is probably the standard for clinical medicine. If you just want to look up how to treat a specific condition, look up \" clinical guidelines\". You'll always be missing the additional knowledge that comes from years of experience, but there's no harm in increasing your knowledge as long as you maintain the humility to remember that your knowledge is incomplete. It's similar to how I learned software development as a hobbyist, so I understand a little about headlines like OpenAI switching from Next to Remix, but at a deeper level, I don't really understand what it's like running Next.js at the scale of MAUs. But it's still worth learning so that I have a little more understanding about the world around me. reply keeptrying 1 hour agorootparentThanks for the reply. Yep I'm ware of Guyton and Nnja. The marginal information that a doctor has from real life is useful but with so many medical errors, for 80% of people they aren't relevant.

It seems ludcirous that we give up the keys to our health to doctors just so we don't have to learn 2 years of courses. Am going to fix that! While I admire the drive to become knowledgeable in the field of medicine outside of a professional curriculum in the disciplines, I’m not aware of any curriculum that proposes competency as a medical doctor in two years. Though I haven’t practiced medicine in many years, I do have a degree in medicine and went through internship, residency and fellowship. Trust me, it was far more than two years. Further, I don’t see how you would be able to (legally) gain experience in any of a range of procedures without following the consensus training path. reply keeptrying 1 hour agorootparentThe first two years are the scientific part of a medical course. The next two are more about interacting with a live patient in a variety of settings. Obviously this si useful. But most of the harm created by the medical system and skewed doctor incentives (only 15 minutes to see you) can be averted by those 2 years. For example: knowing to e able to read a examination report means abiliy to ask questions immediately. reply apwell23 6 hours agorootparentprevCan you tell me why doctors are totally useless in diagnosing extremely common issues like acid reflux. Why do GI specialists have no freaking clue what is causing acid reflux. Why do they not know what how exactly my a1c is relevant to heart disease instead of just prescribing me a statin. I personally know couple of doctors who themselves are clueless in fixing their own chronic conditions. Let alone helping someone else.

Not sure what exactly they study for like a decade if they don't have answers to almost anything. reply wordpad25 4 hours agorootparentAsking a doctor to diagnose and treat a chronic condition from a list of symptoms is like asking a detective to solve a crime from a list of evidence.

Start with Anatomy. And the basic anatomical form. Start with a problem you personally have. (Go to a doc if its serious!) Figure out your concentric anaotmy of hte issue, the pathology. Everytime you read a textbook it will push you to a new subject. Do this for at least 5 hours and you'll be able to relate to your doctor much better. If you want to know what a dcotor looks at for decision support - you can go to uptodate.com - I think they have a free trial for 3 days or something. The most essential idea is that a doctor is someone whose model of hte human body is much more realistic than yours. Thus as you learn medicine keep improving the model you have of your own body and how someone elses would be different from yours - for all major body systems - lymph, respiratory, nervous, endocrine , muscular, digestive, integumentary, urinay, excretory, circulatory etc. reply johnnyanmac 12 hours agoparentprev>you need to find the very best learning resource there is. This is a must. I think there's a line around \"good enough\", unless your goal of course is to be on the road to \"become the very best\". I think the better metric is making sure you have a accurate resource over a quality one. The 15-20 hour \"sprint hard\" methodology isn't stopping after that first sprint, just slowing down. So if you find/can now access a better resource later, just start the sprint again on that. I know from experience (in real time, unfortunately) how easily \"find the best resource\" can end up becoming \"spend weeks collecting resources but not consuming them\". reply Arisaka1 10 hours agorootparentThe other problem is: How do you recognize what is \"good enough\" if you lack the skills/competence required to be able to say \"this is good enough\"? For example, I'm a frontend developer who wants to learn backend. And let's say that I chose C# and .NET for this. I can either do tutorials in Microsoft docs and then reach out to Reddit or some other community for resources, to receive the commonsense advice \"just build something\", and we're back to zero because now the goal is to build something for learning's sake therefore what is \"good enough project\" to build to maximize gains? reply keeptrying 4 minutes agorootparentGet in front of an expert and ask them what they should have read first. In most fields the best will know. And the process of getting inf ront of the best will also teach you about the field. reply johnnyanmac 8 hours agorootparentprev>then reach out to Reddit or some other community for resources, to receive the commonsense advice \"just build something\" An expert giving bad advice isn't going to help with your curriculum. To give a charitable interpretaion, forums like Reddit are very used to getting mostly Novices coming to ask questions. To the point where even if an advanced novice is asking about how to reach \"Competent\" level they will still give novice advice. And the best way to climb from novice to advance beginner is to \"just build stuff\". There's definitely an open secret that there's plenty of novice material, and plenty of expert material. But the road to competent and proficient is basically a dead man's land for many subjects. I argue the curve to competent is harder than Proficient and Expert[0]. Such a hard point that you often won't find \"best resources\" without either education, consulting an expert, or simply work a job in that topic. I don't have much better advice if you are seeking resources. But the next step up if you get stumped is to put more effort into finding other experts who will help out. try to email those potentially open to give advice on what to find or what's good/bad. Join communities similar to what domains you want to explore and form relationships. If you are getting to that point, offer to help contribute to projects others are working on. [0]: Expert is steeper, but by that point you have a good sense of judgement to figure out what is a good or bad resource to study from. So it's \"easier\" to learn how to learn by this point. reply tokinonagare 9 hours agorootparentprevI'm giving a C# class at a university-like institute (for the first time in my life) and I'm glad I had the time to learn the language while it evolved over the last 15 years. Learning nowadays is daunting because of the size of the language and the N ways to do even simple things. You also need to understand the programming landscape before C# (mostly C and Java) to understand some decisions made by language designers. As much as I like learning by myself, sometimes I have to admit that taking (and paying) for a class is the good solution. The way I organize notions for my students would take them months/years to understand by themselves, if at all. reply internet101010 5 hours agorootparentprevI ran into this issue when diving into the world of Rust. What ended up getting me to move forward was asking Claude/4o to design a curriculum that would teach me the basics in a way would lead to completion of a project I had in mind. I ended up dropping 4o and going exclusively with Claude. Claude is amazing at teaching. reply neonsunset 10 hours agorootparentprevI understand the struggle but may not be able to offer an exact solution. People usually expect you to just throw something together without structure, but if you don't have preliminary experience with doing anything similar at all, you are stuck with a blank piece of paper and no ideas, and it feels absolutely terrible. I don't know what works for you, but what worked for me was finding open-source projects in a domain I'm looking to write an application or a library in and using them as a reference. With time, you become able to determine which ones are of high quality and are a good example, and which ones are not. You could also ask Claude/ChatGPT for references to starting point. On C# specifically, I can recommend looking at https://github.com/bitwarden/server which is more \"traditional\" style but does not have much nonsense/bloat you would usually see in an enterprise codebase. That's what I always reference as a style and project layout guide for newcomers that don't already know how they want the project to look. And then as you go through the code, you can always dump the snippets into a chatbot and then cross-reference the replies with documentation if needed. Chatbots also great at quickly sketching up project structure - it can be a terrible one but it's easier to do \"hey, I don't like this, let's change it to X\" than trying to come up with everything from the scratch. If you already have experience with writing TS-based applications with e.g. React components, base router, etc., you can more or less translate this onto structuring an ASP.NET Core application with controller/api handlers, model classes, services, ORM layer and similar. There really is no true right or wrong singular way of doing it, and people who claim there is are dogmatics from a cargo cult. In general, a lot of C# code out there that you will encounter will take more steps to solve its task than strictly necessary, as the generational trauma of ungodly horrors of 666-layer \"Clean\" architecture DDD-done-badly monoliths still haunts many, manifesting in a milder form of \"write a small three file microservice as a 40-file three-project solution\". It is highly useful to approach new patterns and anything that seems ceremoneous with \"is this abstraction strictly required or can this piece be removed and done in a few lines of code or maybe a method?\". On tooling - can strongly recommend using .NET CLI which will be very familiar after using NPM and co.: Create new projects/solutions with 'dotnet new {template name}' (e.g. console, classlib, sln, gitignore). Add/remove projects to/from a solution with dotnet sln add/remove Add dependencies with 'dotnet add package PackageName' or 'dotnet add reference path/to/project' if you want to combine multiple projects. Run projects with 'dotnet run' (-C release). Hot-reload for most scenarios is possible with 'dotnet watch'. Publish into a final complete application with 'dotnet publish -o {path}'. There are many ways to do the last one, but for simple back-ends doing the default output and then copying it to a \"runtime\" image in a dockerfile will suffice. reply chrisvalleybay 10 hours agorootparentprev^ This is exactly it.

The internet is full of information. Sometimes it’s too much, unstructured or tangential to the goal at hand. Textbooks, in my experience, are truly written by the experts. It’s been vetted, rigorously reviewed and fact checked. It’s not inspired by influencers or clickbait. Obviously YMMV, but when you find a top recommended textbook, it’s usually miles beyond a YouTube video or medium blog for deeper level content. It usually flows better and makes more sense as you study consistently. reply keeptrying 1 hour agorootparentprevRealize I didn't answer your qeustion. Online courses aren't really holistic enough and not fundamental enough. They are usually dertivatives which are a translation of sorts from source documents.

What a drag that would be. reply esperent 13 hours agoparentI studied mathematics and I think this subject illustrates my feelings on this perfectly. Coding, just as well. When it comes to learning maths, or a new programming language, there's all this tedious boilerplate you need to know. The rules, or syntax, the names of everything, how it all fits together. There's ways to make learning this stuff more fun, but ultimately, not that much more fun. And anyway, the learning part is not the good part, it's the things you can do once you reach a certain knowledge level that are incredible, beautiful, even sublime. On the other hand, take something like learning to paint, or taking dancing lessons. Unless you're hoping to become a member of an international ballet company, learning to dance is the fun part. As another point, if you're a knowledge worker and you're likely to have situations in your life where someone basically says to you \"right mate, you've got the job, here's a huge body of deep technical knowledge to learn, get up to speed, see you Monday\" then a certain amount of skill in knowing how to absorb that quickly is a good thing. reply blackoil 12 hours agoparentprevI would say \"fun\" is overrated. We have become so focused on everything being fun that everything including fun itself has become tepid and mediocre.

I think I was trying to get at something more like that the experience of learning itself is itself a good thing (even if it's not fun, even if it's suffering, even if it's hard) and I think mechanical and stoic recipes to optimize the process fail to adequately appreciate that fact. The best part of learning piano isn't getting good at piano---it's learning piano. And sure there are some things we have to learn that we aren't that interested in learning, but I think even those things have the capacity to be worthwhile experiences if properly framed.

I think learning should be fun and that fun learning is the most effective I don't disagree, but maybe the author is making do with what they have. Maybe they only have 30 minutes ~ 1 hour of free time per day (which is dystopian on its own), and need to think about efficiency if they want to achieve a certain degree of proficiency in whatever they're learning. Another interpretation is that they are only trying to optimize their learning process if it's work related, because they need to. Or maybe they have an engineer mindset, and make the process more efficient is a fun thing to do by itself. reply celurian92 13 hours agoparentprevI so much agree with you. I understand and remember the things I learn more when I am having fun or it piqued my curiosity. But I guess shortness of time needs us to focus on the efficiency aspect of it too. reply johnnyanmac 12 hours agoparentprevThe steps here are fairly generic and can fit into whatever regimen you have. It simply comes down to \"find your learning path and grind hard in the beginning. Then you can slow down and relax after that first burst\". Seems like decent enough advice if you ever have trouble getting started. It's actually not unlike cramming for a test, except you keep study afterwards and don't dump that knowledge the day after. \"fun learning\" or not, just make sure to really dive in in the beginning. reply jvans 8 hours agoparentprevIf I'm not having fun learning something I can't stick with it. Efficiency without tenacity/grit is useless. It's kind of a tautology that \"more efficient is better\", but I agree it's pointless without fun. Being less \"efficient\" but having fun will yield better results imo reply sam29681749 13 hours agoparentprevI somewhat disagree. Although having fun is important, I also want to make the most of my time. further, I think some aspects of learning can be a real slog, but when you get through it you find it rewarding. reply adamc 5 hours agoparentprevYeah, I agree. Also, I don't think there is an ideal way to learn something. Different people absorb lessons best in different ways. The people I've thought were most successful were not grinding their way through learning but enjoying it, letting new questions arise and pursuing them. Is that efficient? It might not seem so. But the learning tends to be more transformative; they grok the lessons more deeply. A work colleague once told me that it's like reading textbooks in graduate school -- you read it once just to get a general sense of the vocabulary. They you start over, concentrating on the meaning. New ideas take a lot of study to learn well. \"Efficient\" learning strikes me as a compromise where you get a superficial understanding for the sake of speed. reply will-burner 1 hour agoprev>What’s something you’ve learned that you believe gives you an edge - something that you’re almost surprised more people don’t know about? I don't know if it's just me but I would not be stoked to be asked this question during an interview. During interviews you're implicitly trying to differentiate yourself from others vying for the position. You usually do this by talking about your experience in different ways. I find it annoying when the interviewer explicitly asks you to differentiate yourself from others vying for the position. In part it annoys me because I think that should be the job of the interviewer to determine based on how I've answered their concrete questions about my experience.

Its ok if I'm doing it for fun. But if I want to learn, the key seems to be that every single day I start the day learning or reinforcing something, and do no other activity until that one is completed. A somewhat related thing I learned in medical school, is that many people have an internal cue for when you've really learned something. When you have re-visited something for the nth time, and the feeling you have is a deep level of annoyance that you are rehashing the same thing again, that is usually the signal that it will stick.

You probably can't. You need to rely on knowledge of others to identify good resources.

In a crude way: google it. You'll probably get a generic (maybe even horrible AI slop) on top. But you're not looking for a perfect guide on first Google (not unless you have a very popular topic). Look for terms used and start googling those to narrow down to a more specific place. Maybe a forum post full of (hopefully) competent+ people answering your question. Maybe you find a quality guide to follow. Maybe you find you're on a completely wrong rabbit hole and figure out better terms to Google. That's basically half my learning while on the job. Usually works pretty well in my personal time too. reply xandrius 15 hours agoparentprevI tried to think about this and came to a personal realisation that perhaps there is no strict \"foundational knowledge\" for most topics. Pick programming, is knowing binary operations foundational? Is knowing compilers? Is it knowing bubble sort? Or perhaps knowing data structures? I believe that if you have been using/working in a field, whatever you touch for your own goals that's enough. And perhaps the difference between being an expert beginner and an expert is whether you still care about such a distinction? If you can achieve your current and future goals and can eventually learn new concepts then you're good. I'd say a beginner might be someone who wouldn't even know where to begin. Let's pick chemistry for myself: sure, I could follow some video but without the video I wouldn't even conceive how to get started with anything. While, say woodworking, I wouldn't call myself an expert but I would be able to imagine starting a random project from scratch and eventually figure out all the parts. So, maybe: - beginner: can't complete a project without help/support - mid: can complete but is unsure whether that's the best way - expert: has completed it before somehow reply rustcleaner 14 hours agorootparentI'd argue the principles Turing and Wolfram lay out in regards to universal computation and computational equivalence are the most foundational, and then various systems or architectures (flow vs stack, etc), etc, are important as there needs to be concrete examples implementing the fundamentals. If you really want to get esoteric, programming goes all the way back with society and religion. Just like how a machine can compute so too can a group of people through their actions, if they adhere as religiously to their tasks as the fablic of reality seems to adhere to its laws in governing the motions of matter. Programming is the building abstract structures which, when represented with matter in the right ways that can take advantage of the moment-by-moment Gets Things Done™ nature of the fabric of reality itself, produces useful transformations of its initial states. Very complex behavior arises from the simplest of mechanistic rulesets, and it's found universally in biology and in places all over reality.

In my experience, that's a necessary first step to learning. I need to get my hands dirty, get a feel for what I'm working with. An experience is worth a thousand pictures, which are worth a thousand words - you can't gain that basic understanding and instinct by reading, only by having all the sensory inputs of doing it. Then it's time to read. Now you must find an expert to guide you. First, you'll have too many blind spots - you can't possibly find all that's current, you can't find the best sources efficiently, and much won't be in books yet. And without expertise yourself, you can't distinguish the worn-out theories from the evergreen standards from the unproven innovations; the promising from the unlikely from the absurd; you won't know the consensus from the fringe; the guy advocating their personal theory - maybe even a credible one - from the balanced survey of established ideas.

Now, if I say I want to get into this scene for good, I am immediately daunted with a mountain of diverging learning paths to take. Should I take to Python and its massive library ecosystem, or should focus on database fundamentals? In every choice taken there are seemingly infinite branches, and it is rather hard to focus if you aren't even sure you're on the right track. Last time I sat in an analytics/consulting interview they grilled me on highly specific technical questions on data pipelines and warehousing and testing and other topics that I've never had to worry about before at work. In another assessment, I was grilled on some AWS/Redshift-specific things. In yet another I was expected to know deep learning. It is all too hard for someone not originally with an engineering (or adjacent) background. reply eacapeisfutuile 13 hours agorootparentYeah learning to actually use in practice is different from preparing for interviews. I would say continue where you already built some knowledge and branch out when you realize you have to, and then work on learning one branch as you go. For interviews you may need to lookup what type of questions to expect and memorize details on that, unfortunately. That is not useful in practice but can be necessary for interviews. reply Tier3r 15 hours agoparentprevI'm also wondering this. Two possibilities.

Main Learning Principles: Retrieval Practice: Actively recalling information strengthens memory and makes learning more durable. Self-quizzing is more effective than passive review. Spaced Repetition: Spacing out learning sessions over time leads to better retention than cramming. Interleaved Practice: Mixing different types of problems or subjects during study sessions improves learning compared to studying one topic in blocks. Elaboration: Explaining ideas in your own words and connecting them to existing knowledge improves understanding. Generation: Attempting to solve a problem before being shown the solution enhances learning. Reflection: Reviewing what you’ve learned and considering how it applies to your life strengthens learning. Varied Learning: Learning in different contexts and environments makes the knowledge more adaptable and versatile. Key Takeaways: Rethink study habits: Active learning techniques outperform passive ones. Learning is more effective when it's effortful—embrace challenges. Long-term retention relies on consistent, spaced, and active engagement with material. reply paldepind2 1 hour agorootparentThat summary is pretty good based on what I remember from the book. I think the second to last point, _effort_, deserves a bit more of an emphasis though. It's actually a common theme through all the effective learning methods that they require more effort and that more effort generally implies more effective learning. As an example, simply rereading a text takes little effort compared to doing flash cards, and the later is more effective. reply dinobones 15 hours agoprevI've been wanting to try this approach for learning a language.

I'd love to start fresh on a new language, take 800 new words, try to learn 10 a day, and see where I get after 3 months.

This thing you're talking about is called 'word coverage'. It's the percentage of words you know in a given text. I've created lots of word coverage graphs in the past, and, as research has shown, you won't really be understanding much until you reach the high 90s in terms of word coverage. The famous number for being able to read English texts extensively requires a word coverage of around 98%. And while it depends on the text, in order to reach 98%, you generally need to know around the top 5k words in a language. Funny enough, when you understand 75% of the words in a text, you subjectively feel like you're understanding like 10% of what's going on. reply jamager 7 hours agorootparentThis is exactly correct.

Like other people said here, understanding will probably still be limited, esp. in writing. But expressing even complex things becomes easier. E.g. instead of saying \"Do you have medication against migraine\" at a pharmacy you could say \"Do you have something for pain here\" while pointing at your head. This is what we call fluency, and starting at 800 words I would argue you have basic fluency in the language. And also regarding understanding spoken language – those words might be enough to express that you haven't understood something and ask people to simplify. Words are not enough, though – pronunciation and grammar also play their part. reply mchaver 11 hours agoparentprevThis post will give you a sense of what understanding 80% of the text looks likes https://www.sinosplice.com/life/archives/2016/08/25/what-80-... reply kebsup 8 hours agoparentprev800 is definitely too little.

The frequency of words in every human language follows the Zipf distribution, which is a power law, like the pareto distribution. Some learners create what are called frequency lists, which are lists of the most common words, and learn those words first. In general, you get (disproportionately) more bang for your buck from learning the most common words than the rarer words when it comes to understanding. However, due to the very long tail of word frequency distributions, you eventually need to just start learning words as they come and stop trying to over-optimize with a frequency list. reply raincole 14 hours agoparentprevDepending on your definition of \"understanding\".

Most people stop learning being motivation dries up as Test Anxiety rises to the point where they are at a \"low-performance\" place in the eustress curve. A few days there and people pause until it becomes urgent. A lot of this is a lack of momentum, but also not dedicating or having access to judgements of learning about your own progress. In other words, if you judge your learning at all, it helps you manage. There is a natural tradeoff between the flow-state of \"just one flashcard with one information principle at a time, endlessly\" and the longer term state influencing your time in flow-state of \"am I progressing, what don't I know, how do I feel about my learning and mistakes?\" Think about learning databases, or CSS. When did you really takeoff? Probably A) Practically copying others examples (existing queries ran in PhpMyAdmin, or codepen code) And then later B) Once you overcame a big mistake and saw progress - suddenly what \"Display\" did clicked for you, and you saw how useful it could be to use the \"fixed\" option, it unlocked your understanding of the items in A and confirmed or disconfirmed your understanding of how it works. Again it all depends. Self-motivated learning, even for a job, is easier to work with than compulsory learning. Because there, you don't even have the motivation to gaze up to the horizon and gather any excitement or understanding for what the learning might later lead to. It doesn't feel like a path, it feels like a brick wall. In this regard, a list of subjects is somewhat skin to someone stacking bricks, rather than elucidating a path.

    "title": "Don't Publish with IEEE (2005)",
    "originLink": "http://cr.yp.to/writing/ieee.html",
    "originBody": "D. J. Bernstein Notes on writing papers Don't publish with IEEE! Before you read this page, you should understand (1) authors putting papers online to benefit readers, (2) commercial publishers using copyright to limit #1, and (3) authors dedicating papers to the public domain as one way to stop #2. I have a separate page discussing these issues. It turns out that, in response to #3, IEEE is overriding its scientific referees and flat-out refusing to accept public-domain papers. I learned about this from a UIC graduate student who had submitted a paper to a conference whose proceedings were to be published by IEEE. After the paper was accepted, IEEE notified the student that a copyright transfer was required. The student declared his intention to put his paper into the public domain. The IEEE Intellectual Property Rights Manager threatened the student with non-publication of the paper. Faced with this pressure, the student capitulated and, rather than eliminating the copyright, transferred it to IEEE. When I heard about this incident, I asked the IEEE Intellectual Property Rights Manager to explain his overall assertion that IEEE refuses to publish public-domain papers: Works from government authors are in the public domain, and I find it difficult to believe that IEEE refuses papers from government authors. I see that the IEEE Copyright Form has a special section for government authors. How many public-domain papers does IEEE actually publish? Surely you have the exact figures for each year. Is it fair to say that, in fact, IEEE publishes many public-domain papers? The IEEE Intellectual Property Rights Manager refused to answer these questions. In his messages to the student, the IEEE Intellectual Property Rights Manager had asserted that ``IEEE needs to be the owner of the work ... by assignment.'' Obviously this is impossible for papers in the public domain: copyright assignment isn't possible when the copyright no longer exists. I looked at the IEEE Copyright Policies and found that public-domain papers were clearly exempted from the copyright-transfer requirement: Such transfer shall be a necessary requirement for publication, EXCEPT for material in the public domain. (Emphasis added.) I asked the IEEE Intellectual Property Rights Manager to explain the contradiction between his statements and the IEEE Copyright Policies. His only response was the rather idiotic comment that ``IEEE policy requires authors to submit an IEEE Copyright Form in order for publication to occur''; needless to say, the IEEE Copyright Form is written by the IEEE Intellectual Property Rights office. In his messages to the student, the IEEE Intellectual Property Rights Manager had explained IEEE's alleged need for being ``the owner of the work'' as follows: ``We can put it into the Xplore database and license it to others as one of our ongoing electronic distribution of IEEE publications.'' I asked the IEEE Intellectual Property Rights Manager for clarification: When there is no copyright, IEEE is completely free to do these things. It can distribute the work as widely as it wants, and it can authorize others to do so. All IEEE gets out of a copyright is the power to _stop_ the distribution of the information. If the public domain is a problem for IEEE, how does IEEE publish works from government authors? Do you have a better explanation for your desire to be the owner of the work? Is it fair to say that IEEE actually _does_ want to stop the distribution of scientific information? Naturally, the IEEE Intellectual Property Rights Manager refused to respond. The IEEE Intellectual Property Rights Manager had also devoted some effort to trying to fool the student into believing that papers could not simply be dedicated to the public domain. I asked for clarification: The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has commented that ``It is well settled that rights gained under the Copyright Act may be abandoned.'' The standard way to abandon copyright is by a clear written dedication of the work to the public domain. One example of a public-domain dedication is http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain; surely you're aware of attorney Lawrence Lessig's Creative Commons effort. You stated that ``there is a specific legal process for placing your work in the PD.'' When the student asked you for details, you refused to answer. Instead you said that you were ``dubious about the idea of simply declaring one's intention to inject a work into the public domain,'' and that IEEE needed to be able to ``prove'' its rights. If IEEE has trouble ``proving'' its rights to publish a public-domain paper, then how does IEEE ``prove'' alleged authorship of a paper whose copyright is allegedly transferred, and how does IEEE ``prove'' an allegation of government employment? Is the ``legal process'' you mentioned something more than making a clear written dedication of the work to the public domain? If so, what exactly is the process? Why didn't you answer the student's question regarding this process? Is it fair to say that the IEEE Intellectual Property Rights Office is trying to intimidate authors into transferring copyright to IEEE? The IEEE Intellectual Property Rights Manager refused to respond. The bottom line is that IEEE is refusing to accept public-domain papers except from government authors. IEEE has no justification for this position. IEEE's action is a blatant attempt to maintain control over papers that would otherwise have been freely available to the public. Unfortunately, at least in this student's case, the attempt succeeded: a paper that was accepted by IEEE's scientific referees, and that would have been in the public domain without IEEE's pressure, is now part of IEEE's copyright portfolio. Consequently, I am blacklisting IEEE here. I recommend that authors find another publisher. Springer, for example, tacitly (although quite unhappily) allows public-domain papers, and AMS explicitly does not require a copyright transfer.",

Nowadays everyone puts their papers also on arxiv.org so at least we can read each other's papers for free. While of course still paying the fees to these publishers who are doing nothing but messing up the PDF (I have to fight them to fix the mistakes they add every time a paper is published), while claiming to do a value-add, which happens to add value to nobody but their own pockets. It's a scam through and through. Of course one has to examine why this system is still in place. And it's mostly to do with policies in universities, where certain journals/conferences are valued more, and changing that is hard, because e.g. Springer happens to own the name. So we all pay millions to Springer, for the use of this name (that we, together, made great, not Springer), and in return, they charge us the privilege of reading the papers that we reviewed, edited, and wrote.

It's an unsavory part of our job, but given that there are fewer jobs, less grant funding, etc. than the number of strong applications, it's a necessary evil. To the best we can, we try to evaluate their research record directly. But it is maddeningly difficult to evaluate work even slightly out of your field, and so journals serve as a signaling mechanism.

MIT in providing some other access methods to the same Elsevier articles for their researchers -- at the cost of some extra inconvenient steps -- is actually proving the opposite of the anti-publisher stance: The Elsevier publisher's articles are still valuable to us.

Before the UC system also cancelled their subscription with Elsevier they reported paying $11 million annually. > The Elsevier publisher's articles are still valuable to us. Yes, but not $11 million/year with a 3 year lock-in. UC reported (at the time of ending the contract) that they have a perpetual license to ~95% of relevant work on Elsevier, so that $11 million/year went to access 5% of Elsevier's library. What we do see is publishers shifting to open access (OA), which appears to result in lower Uni costs, but shifts the expense burden to researchers.

No. \"TechRxiv offers several Creative Commons licenses, all of which permit you to retain copyright of your work. You do not need to transfer your copyright to TechRxiv.\" 2.

Furthermore, the concept of a \"public domain\" paper in academia just seems weird to me. the concept of \"public domain\" means that the contents can be reused in whole or in part without attribution of any sorts to the original author(s). that goes against the ethos of academia (i.e. plagiarism) in regards to authoring papers, so unsure what public domain for the actual paper gives users vs. the document being what I'd refer to as \"freely available\" (i.e. no one else can charge for access to the document, only the 'copyright' holder can). If the author has a right to freely distribute the document (and anyone who gets the document from the author maintains the same right), I don't see what public domain \"assignment\" gains anyone. i.e. copyright assignment (to the publisher) with the ability to freely distribute the paper accomplishes all these goals. The only thing (I can imagine) that it doesn't accomplish is giving others the ability to collect a bunch of papers together and sell it for \"profit\". But that doesn't seem to be a something DJB views as needed (and in fact, rails against the publishers who are requesting the copyright assignment for that very purpose). reply cernocky 8 hours agoprevWhat we need is: 1. make science self-publishing using decentralised protocols the default 2. redefine traditional journals and publishers as curators or labellers on top of the network, instead of owners reply beezlebroxxxxxx 8 hours agoparentBefore you do either of those you need to convince academia that publishing in traditional journals/\"prestige\" legacy journals does not matter as much to the job.

Once you pass the initial filters, you will be judged by other academics, who are usually pretty reasonable. (For every reviewer 2, there is also a reviewer 1 and a reviewer 3.) They may not always notice that things work in different ways in different fields, and they may not have enough time to evaluate you properly. But they will usually at least try to see behind the metrics. Governments are another matter, because they lack the expertise to judge your work.

I think this is a useful analogy because one can subtract (in theory) the gatekeeping entirely: distributing proof of work is required for the distributed consensus to update. However, and, crucially, journals differ in their effect on the consensus, e.g. IEEE or PNAS have much higher impact factors, and the competition both among researchers and institutions creates a market opportunity for gatekeeping, that naturally sorts those same researchers and institutions for the next ground of grants. Again, I think it's hard to understand what a fix would look like, if we don't first recognize how distributed consensus should work for science. Algos like Paxos require a leader, and editorial boards for journals are effectively leaders. reply einpoklum 8 hours agoprevThe situation had not improved much for the 10-15 years at least after that post was authored (which is when I was actively publishing). But - writers could, then, and can now, use the \"standard trick\" to get past IEEE copyright transfer requirements: https://academia.stackexchange.com/a/119002/7319 that works for a person who actually holds copyrights and can trasfer them - so that IEEE gets its papers, and eventually the author regains the right to also publish, modify, distribute etc. their paper.

I made a MQTT topic for each pump, valve and section of pipe along with some state for each (water direction, pump or valve on/off, pressures, etc). It's a website, so I used mqtt.js and jQuery to update the colours and fills of the SVG to represent the various states. It's statically hosted and there's a mqtt broker that's been running in a container, untouched for nearly 10 years now.

There are a lot of options in the protocol where it's not immediately clear what they do and why they are important, or in what combination they need to be used to make sure things work as intended, and the documentation is often not great at explaining. Part of this may also be on the Eclipse Mosquitto Python client that I had been using. I took me several days to figure out that the client was running into a race condition on a slower system that resulted in subscriptions to topics silently being ignored which caused the associated callbacks to malfunction despite following their documentation 100%. Overall, this has been one the messiest experienced I have ever had with a protocol, certainly one that isn't that old. reply DannyBee 5 hours agoparentSo your client just sucks here. My experience with the eclipse clients (paho, etc) is similar to yours in both python and C++, - it makes it overly complicated and seems very low level. It also is somewhat buggy because of the architecture. I believe (perhaps wrongly), it's all basically maintained by one person or close to it (only one person has contributed to the C++ client in the past 6 months, for example, and nobody has contributed in the past 3), so i kind of understand how it's gotten this way over time. I filed a simple PR (1 word change) to fix an obvious bug and it took 2 years to review it and accept it with no changes. Again not a complaint, just trying to portray how the state feels - a lot of libraries, bugs, and work, and few overworked people helping get it all done. I moved to other clients and the experience is much much better in python, rust, C#, and C++. Most of them have a good combination of high and low level API's, so if you just want to send a message on a topic, you don't have to worry about acks, retries, etc. But if you need control, you can get it. Honestly, i worry at this point that keeping paho/etc alive in this state is doing more harm than good - if they were officially dead it would at least force the issue. Right now you end up with users who have an experience like yours, and then either give up on MQTT or assume they are doing it wrong :) reply vv_ 5 hours agorootparentAfter reading your post, I went looking for good C/C++ implementations suitable for embedded development, and honestly, I couldn’t find many!

It looks like it's easy to start using it, but then the breadth of protocols and implementations start getting to you. At a point in time, I remember the only reliable way we had of knowing if we had successfully connected to a server was to try to subscribe to a topic twice and catch a specific error code on the on_connect message (which actually was documented as a success code at the time). I know how crazy it sounds and maybe there was a better way to do it, but, if there was, I don't think it was that easy to find. It's easy to complain, though. I'm very grateful so many people have worked to create this library. If they hadn't, I wouldn't have built what we've built with it. I really admire people who take on these huge projects. reply HankB99 5 hours agoparentprevI've used the Paho APIs in Python, C and C++ and moved on to not using any of these APIs. Where possible I use mosquitto_sub and mosquitto_pub to support the protocol and then just read/write standard input/output. It's not a matter of bugs (though I have encountered at least one) but rather it's just easier to use a program that's been written and tested to manage the connection to the broker. The only place where I was unable to do this effectively was with the last will and testament message (and I might not have tried hard enough.) It also doesn't work with microcontrollers that don't run something like Linux. reply qudat 2 hours agoparentprevWhile not directly competing with mqtt, https://pipe.pico.sh is a great pubsub tool that leverages ssh for communication, effectively creating an authenticated, networked *nix pipe system.

Apart from that, Boost has quite a few goodies such as Boost.Json, Boost.Program_options, Boost.Interprocess, Boost.Lockfree, Boost.Unordered, Boost.Dynamic_Bitset, etc. Some libraries, like Boost.Atomic, Boost.Thread, Boost.Chrono and Boost.Filesystem, simply became obsolete with modern C++ versions. In fact, they served as the blueprint for the corresponding C++ standard libraries.

Historically it's been used in Oil & Gas for SCADA (getting data from remote well sites). 10+ years ago we added it to Kepware (OPC server) and streamed tag values to \"the cloud\". I was at a conference giving a presentation on it when Arlen Nipper, one of the creators of MQTT, came up after the presentation and said I did a \"decent job\". It was humbling :). Fast forward to today, and we have a new company (HighByte) modeling factory data at the edge and sending it via MQTT, SparkplugB (protocol over MQTT), direct to S3, Azure Blob, etc, etc. All that to say, MQTT is a big driver in Industry 4.0, and it's cool to see it so heavily used all these years later. reply red-iron-pine 31 minutes agoparent> MQTT is being used a lot more in recent years inside of factories for sharing data between machines.

They would not open anything else for us no matter how we implored them so I wrote a live TCP wrapper over MQTT to get around it. It was a local multithreaded TCP daemon that listened for outbound requests on a certain port, wrapped them in MQTT and then published them using a unique topic. The server daemon would detect these topics and unwrap them before forwarding to our server processes. So the client machine thought it was making a live TCP connection to our server but in the middle was a funky invisible MQTT wrapper. It was really elegant once it worked but my goodness was it a pain to debug - a couple of months before I got the whole thing right because of all the blind alleys I went down. reply ericvsmith 7 hours agoparentI’ve worked at places where subverting firewall rules like this would get you fired.

My personal gripe with LwM2M is that it uses CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) as its primary transport protocol. Since CoAP is based on UDP, you’re forced to rely on DTLS for authentication and encryption. Managing sessions with DTLS can be quite frustrating, and unlike TCP, there’s no reliable indication of when a session is closed by your peer. Another issue is that it doesn't strictly follow the client-initiated communication pattern and can receive unsolicited messages from the server. I have found this to be very unreliable in real-world conditions for Device Management use cases. reply sunshine-o 2 hours agoprev [–] I never understood why we don't use MQTT for simple systems monitoring, with a push model.

    "originLink": "https://github.com/SysSec-KAIST/LTESniffer",
    "originBody": "LTESniffer - An Open-source LTE Downlink/Uplink Eavesdropper LTESniffer is An Open-source LTE Downlink/Uplink Eavesdropper It first decodes the Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) to obtain the Downlink Control Informations (DCIs) and Radio Network Temporary Identifiers (RNTIs) of all active users. Using decoded DCIs and RNTIs, LTESniffer further decodes the Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH) and Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH) to retrieve uplink and downlink data traffic. LTESniffer supports an API with three functions for security applications and research. Many LTE security research assumes a passive sniffer that can capture privacy-related packets on the air. However, non of the current open-source sniffers satisfy their requirements as they cannot decode protocol packets in PDSCH and PUSCH. We developed a proof-of-concept security API that supports three tasks that were proposed by previous works: 1) Identity mapping, 2) IMSI collecting, and 3) Capability profiling. Please refer to our paper for more details. LTESniffer in layman's terms LTESniffer is a tool that can capture the LTE wireless messages that are sent between a cell tower and smartphones connected to it. LTESniffer supports capturing the messages in both directions, from the tower to the smartphones, and from the smartphones back to the cell tower. LTESniffer CANNOT DECRYPT encrypted messages between the cell tower and smartphones. It can be used for analyzing unencrypted parts of the communication between the cell tower and smartphones. For example, for encrypted messages, it can allow the user to analyze unencrypted parts, such as headers in MAC and physical layers. However, those messages sent in plaintext can be completely analyzable. For example, the broadcast messages sent by the cell tower, or the messages at the beginning of the connection are completely visible. Ethical Consideration The main purpose of LTESniffer is to support security and analysis research on the cellular network. Due to the collection of uplink-downlink user data, any use of LTESniffer must follow the local regulations on sniffing the LTE traffic. We are not responsible for any illegal purposes such as intentionally collecting user privacy-related information. Features New Update v2.1.0 Supports recording IQ raw data of subframes to file. Please refer to LTESniffer-record-subframe branch and its README for more details. Supports offline decoding using recorded files (README). Enable API in the downlink mode (only apply for identity collecting and mapping API) New Update v2.0.0 Supports two USRP B-series for uplink sniffing mode. Please refer to LTESniffer-multi-usrp branch and its README for more details. Fixed some bugs. LTESniffer is implemented on top of FALCON with the help of srsRAN library. LTESniffer supports: Real-time decoding LTE uplink-downlink control-data channels: PDCCH, PDSCH, PUSCH LTE Advanced and LTE Advanced Pro, up to 256QAM in both uplink and downlink DCI formats: 0, 1A, 1, 1B, 1C, 2, 2A, 2B Transmission modes: 1, 2, 3, 4 FDD only Maximum 20 MHz base station. Automatically detect maximum UL/DL modulation schemes of smartphones (64QAM/256QAM on DL and 16QAM/64QAM/256QAM on UL) Automatically detect physical layer configuration per UE. LTE Security API: RNTI-TMSI mapping, IMSI collecting, UECapability Profiling. Hardware and Software Requirement OS Requirement Currently, LTESniffer works stably on Ubuntu 18.04/20.04/22.04. Hardware Requirement Achieving real-time decoding of LTE traffic requires a high-performance CPU with multiple physical cores, especially during peak hours when the base station has many active users. LTESniffer successfully achieved real-time decoding when deployed on an Intel i7-9700K PC, decoding traffic from a base station with 150 active users. The following hardware is recommended Intel i7 CPU with at least 8 physical cores At least 16Gb RAM 256 Gb SSD storage SDR LTESniffer requires different SDR for its uplink and downlink sniffing modes. To sniff only downlink traffic from the base station, LTESniffer is compatible with most SDRs that are supported by the srsRAN library (for example, USRP or BladeRF). The SDR should be connected to the PC via a USB 3.0 port. Also, it should be equipped with GPSDO and two RX antennas to decode downlink messages in transmission modes 3 and 4. On the other hand, to sniff uplink traffic from smartphones to base stations, LTESniffer needs to listen to two different frequencies (Uplink and Downlink) concurrently. To solve this problem, LTESniffer supports two options: Using a single USRP X310. USRP X310 has two Local Oscillators (LOs) for 2 RX channels, which can turn each RX channel to a distinct Uplink/Downlink frequency. To use this option, please refer to the main branch of LTESniffer. Using 2 USRP B-Series. LTESniffer utilizes 2 USRP B-series (B210/B200) for uplink and downlink separately. It achieves synchronization between 2 USRPs by using GPSDO for clock source and time reference. To use this option, please refer to the LTESniffer-multi-usrp branch of LTESniffer and its README.

To figure out the base station and Uplink-Downlink band the test smartphone is connected to, install Cellular-Z app on the test smartphone (the app only supports Android). It will show the cell ID and Uplink-Downlink band/frequency to which the test smartphone is connected. Make sure that LTESniffer also connects to the same cell and frequency.

In this case, the debug messages will be printed on the terminal. Output of LTESniffer LTESniffer provides pcap files in the output. The pcap file can be opened by WireShark for further analysis and packet trace. The name of downlink pcap file: sniffer_dl_mode.pcap, uplink pcap file: sniffer_ul_mode.pcap, and API pcap file: api_collector.pcap. The pcap files are located in the same directory LTESniffer has been executed. To enable the WireShark to analyze the decoded packets correctly, please refer to the WireShark configuration guide here. There are also some examples of pcap files in the link. Note: The uplink pcap file contains both uplink and downlink messages. On the WireShark, use this filter to monitor only uplink messages: mac-lte.direction == 0; or this filter to monitor only downlink messages: mac-lte.direction == 1. Application Note Distance for uplink sniffing The effective range for sniffing uplink is limited in LTESniffer due to the capability of the RF front-end of the hardware (i.e. SDR). The uplink signal power from UE is significantly weaker compared to the downlink signal because UE is a handheld device that optimizes battery usage, while the eNB uses sufficient power to cover a large area. To successfully capture the uplink traffic, LTESniffer can increase the strength of the signal power by i) being physically close to the UE, or ii) improving the signal reception capability with specialized hardware, such as a directional antenna, dedicated RF front-end, and signal amplifier.

For uplink sniffing mode, GPSDO is only required when using 2 USRP B-series, as it is the time and clock reference sources for synchrozation between uplink and downlink channels. Another uplink SDR option, using a single USRP X310, does not require GPSDO. Q: For downlink traffic, can I use a cheaper SDR? A: Technically, any SDRs supported by srsRAN library such as Blade RF can be used to run LTESniffer in the downlink sniffing mode. However, we only tested the downlink sniffing function of LTESniffer with USRP B210 and X310. Q: Is it illegal to use LTESniffer to sniff the LTE traffic? A: You should have to check the local regulations on sniffing (unencrypted) LTE traffic. Another way to test LTESniffer is setting up a personal LTE network by using srsRAN - an open-source LTE implementation in a Faraday cage. Q: Can LTESniffer be used to view the content of messages between two users? A: One can see only the \"unencrypted\" part of the messages. Note that the air traffic between the base station and users is mostly encrypted. Q: Is there any device identity exposed in plaintext in the LTE network? A: Yes, literature shows that there are multiple identities exposed, such as TMSI, GUTI, IMSI, and RNTI. Please refer to the academic literature for more details. e.g. Watching the Watchers: Practical Video Identification Attack in LTE Networks",

I love it. In case you did not know, the letter Q in PHICH stands for \"request\". reply derefr 12 hours agoparentIf anyone is wondering what the parent poster is talking about — the abbreviation PHICH (which isn't mentioned in the referenced project, but is just an example of a weird mobile-network acronym) expands to \"Physical channel HybridARQ Indicator Channel\"; and then the embedded \"ARQ\" inside it, purportedly expands to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_repeat_request . Some might claim that the \"Q\" in \"ARQ\" is actually \"query\"; and that people who choose to expand the \"Q\" as \"request\" just have a dim view of the average person's vocabulary level. Personally, though, I'd argue that, if you think about it, the \"Q\" is probably not \"request\" or \"query\", but rather just another appearance of the conventional opaque \"Q\" that appears in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_code. reply dylan604 5 hours agorootparentIt's up there with the accepted Tx/Rx for transmit and receive. reply hnuser123456 2 hours agorootparentAt least \"receive\" makes more sense for Rx than \"prescription\" reply twojacobtwo 3 hours agorootparentprevI always saw those as parameters for some reason.

I see that it supports FDD only (no TDD) and is limited to 20MHz, so some limitations. I see that it can do some amount of real-time decoding, which is interesting. In cell towers, a big part of the processing is done by fairly general-purpose processors, but still much more tightly integrated with the hardware than this software is. reply tonygiorgio 4 hours agoprevFun stuff, glad to see open source stuff like this still being used. Did downlink eavesdropping in the network security lab at college about 10 years ago. One of my projects was measuring how much cell activity dropped during spring break, another was to do timing attacks on known phone numbers at known locations to see if I can pull temporary IDs (not temporary enough IMO) and do repeat calls to see if they’re still in the area.

You can still install an external clock into the UFL connector on the Pluto though so you can sync a few if you want or use a GPSDO for frequency accuracy. You can also install the extra Tx/Rx pair onto the UFL connectors they added recently-ish. reply teruakohatu 15 hours agoparentprevSeems like if you had a PC already, you could get away with a bladeRF 2.0 micro xA5 for $670, but this can sniff downlink only. reply fhsm 9 hours agorootparent> xA5 for $670 No longer for sale (out of stock with no plan to restock https://www.nuand.com/product/bladerf-xa5/ ) reply wkat4242 11 hours agorootparentprevYeah for me that is already eye-wateringly expensive :) (Being in Spain where purchasing power is low). reply RachelF 14 hours agoparentprevYes, there is cheaper hardware like the Adalm Pluto with enough bandwidth and dynamic range, but it is not supported by the looks of things. reply superkuh 14 hours agoparentprevFor those interested in a more accessible LTE meta-data decoder check out https://github.com/JiaoXianjun/LTE-Cell-Scanner which can work with even cheap rtl-sdr dongles (for some things).

Can someone outline the architectural limitations of using a smartphone modem for such network debugging/sniffing tasks? reply wkat4242 8 hours agorootparentSmartphone modems (baseband) are super optimised for battery life. They don't send any traffic that isn't meant for the device itself on to the CPU. That would only cause unnecessary load. They could perhaps be modified to do that but the baseband firmware is usually very closed source. There is only one example I know, there was one particular dumbphone from the 2G era for which the baseband sourcecode was available due to a hack. You could use several (one for uplink and one for downlink) of these with modified firmware to sniff 2G traffic. I forget which model it was exactly but obviously the price ballooned on eBay :) Haven't heard of this happening with later models. Baseband sourcecode firmware is really rare. reply motrm 6 hours agorootparentCertainly Qualcomm modems can have their diagnostic mode enabled when you have access to /dev/diag - usually on rooted devices but occasionally on stock. You can ask the processor to send higher layer information via diag, including the messages the base stations send. There’s also commands to lock on to a specific base station so you’re not constantly moving from cell to cell. There’s plenty of commercial devices that use this functionality to provide network monitoring and management capabilities for mobile network operators checking out base station functionality in the field. TEMS comes to mind for that but they’re certainly not the only ones. It’s a deep rabbit hole :-) reply wkat4242 3 hours agorootparentThe diagnostic mode just lists the cells and their parameters afaik. It doesn't capture IMSIs or traffic to/from other devices like this does. It's like the network diagnostics menu built into Samsung and Apple phones. reply seba_dos1 2 hours agorootparentIt isn't even able to list some crucial parameters needed to identify neighboring cells. It's simply dumping data that's already used by the modem for its regular operation. It does, however, more than just \"listing cells\" though. You can sniff all the comms, but only between your device and the base station. It won't listen to anything else, you need SDRs for that. reply throwawayC123 5 hours agorootparentprevYou may be thinking about the Motorola C123. Back in the days, you could use it to dump TMSI and IMSI using OsmoconBB : https://osmocom.org/projects/baseband/wiki/MotorolaC123 reply wkat4242 3 hours agorootparentYes, that was the one! Thanks! reply seba_dos1 2 hours agorootparentFWIW, the same chipset was used as a modem in the Openmoko phones. reply beeboobaa3 4 hours agorootparentprev> Haven't heard of this happening with later models.

Some even document how to compile and run software on them - though of course it's only about the application CPU and not the actual modemy stuff that runs on separate DSPs with proprietary signed Qualcomm firmware. Most (all?) standalone modems are basically screenless smartphones/SBCs with integrated modem these days. reply ajsnigrutin 4 hours agorootparentprevBecause they have to do only one thing, and literally billions are produced every year, so if qualcomm spends 1 billion for R&D, the modem price will only need to be $1 \"higher\" to cover the r&d cost... if SDR development costs $1 mio (and that's basically zero for hardware design), and 10k units are sold, that's $100 per device in R&D cost. (numbers simplified and rounded to make an example) reply mytailorisrich 5 hours agorootparentprevPhone modems (software + hardware) are very expensive to develop and only inexpensive to purchase because of the staggeringly high volumes and the fact that they are highly integrated. This is the main reason why the number of suppliers as massively dwindled: Large upfront investments are needed and only recouped if you manage to sell 10s if not 100s millions of units. reply binary_marbl 14 hours agoparentprevWhat does it require? reply Havoc 10 hours agoprev [–] There are also some 4G dongles with known broken debug modes that can be used to extract info reply jakeogh 9 hours agoparent [–] Not easy to search for...

    "originBody": "Lock them up T-Mobile, AT&T oppose unlocking rule, claim locked phones are good for users Carriers fight plan to require unlocking of phones 60 days after activation. Jon Brodkin – Oct 21, 2024 8:16 PM196 T-Mobile and AT&T say US regulators should drop a plan to require unlocking of phones within 60 days of activation, claiming that locking phones to a carrier's network makes it possible to provide cheaper handsets to consumers. \"If the Commission mandates a uniform unlocking policy, it is consumers—not providers—who stand to lose the most,\" T-Mobile alleged in an October 17 filing with the Federal Communications Commission. The proposed rule has support from consumer advocacy groups who say it will give users more choice and lower their costs. T-Mobile has been criticized for locking phones for up to a year, which makes it impossible to use a phone on a rival's network. T-Mobile claims that with a 60-day unlocking rule, \"consumers risk losing access to the benefits of free or heavily subsidized handsets because the proposal would force providers to reduce the line-up of their most compelling handset offers.\" If the proposed rule is enacted, \"T-Mobile estimates that its prepaid customers, for example, would see subsidies reduced by 40 percent to 70 percent for both its lower and higher-end devices, such as the Moto G, Samsung A15, and iPhone 12,\" the carrier said. \"A handset unlocking mandate would also leave providers little choice but to limit their handset offers to lower cost and often lesser performing handsets.\" T-Mobile and other carriers are responding to a call for public comments that began after the FCC approved a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) in a 5–0 vote. The FCC is proposing \"to require all mobile wireless service providers to unlock handsets 60 days after a consumer's handset is activated with the provider, unless within the 60-day period the service provider determines the handset was purchased through fraud.\" When the FCC proposed the 60-day unlocking rule in July 2024, the agency criticized T-Mobile for locking prepaid phones for a year. The NPRM pointed out that \"T-Mobile recently increased its locking period for one of its brands, Metro by T-Mobile, from 180 days to 365 days.\" T-Mobile's policy says the carrier will only unlock mobile devices on prepaid plans if \"at least 365 days... have passed since the device was activated on the T-Mobile network.\" \"You bought your phone, you should be able to take it to any provider you want,\" FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said when the FCC proposed the rule. \"Some providers already operate this way. Others do not. In fact, some have recently increased the time their customers must wait until they can unlock their device by as much as 100 percent.\" T-Mobile locking policy more onerous T-Mobile executives, who also argue that the FCC lacks authority to impose the proposed rule, met with FCC officials last week to express their concerns. \"T-Mobile is passionate about winning customers for life, and explained how its handset unlocking policies greatly benefit our customers,\" the carrier said in its post-meeting filing. \"Our policies allow us to deliver access to high-speed mobile broadband on a nationwide 5G network via handsets that are free or heavily discounted off the manufacturer's suggested retail price. T-Mobile's unlocking policies are transparent, and there is absolutely no evidence of consumer harm stemming from these policies. T-Mobile's current unlocking policies also help T-Mobile combat handset theft and fraud by sophisticated, international criminal organizations.\" For postpaid users, T-Mobile says it allows unlocking of fully paid-off phones that have been active for at least 40 days. But given the 365-day lock on prepaid users, T-Mobile's overall policy is more onerous than those of other carriers. T-Mobile has also faced angry customers because of a recent decision to raise prices on plans that were advertised as having a lifetime price lock. AT&T enables unlocking of paid-off phones after 60 days for postpaid users and after six months for prepaid users. AT&T lodged similar complaints as T-Mobile, saying in an October 7 filing that the FCC's proposed rules would \"mak[e] handsets less affordable for consumers, especially those in low-income households,\" and \"exacerbate handset arbitrage, fraud, and trafficking. \" AT&T told the FCC that \"requiring providers to unlock handsets before they are paid-off would ultimately harm consumers by creating upward pressure on handset prices and disincentives to finance handsets on flexible terms.\" If the FCC implements any rules, it should maintain \"existing contractual arrangements between customers and providers, ensure that providers have at least 180 days to detect fraud before unlocking a device, and include at least a 24-month period for providers to implement any new rules,\" AT&T said. Verizon, which already faces unlocking rules because of requirements imposed on spectrum licenses it owns, automatically unlocks phones after 60 days for prepaid and postpaid users. Among the three major carriers, Verizon is the most amenable to the FCC's new rules. Consumer groups: Make Verizon rules industry-wide An October 18 filing supporting a strict unlocking rule was submitted by numerous consumer advocacy groups including Public Knowledge, New America's Open Technology Institute, Consumer Reports, the National Consumers League, the National Consumer Law Center, and the National Digital Inclusion Alliance. \"Wireless users are subject to unnecessary restrictions in the form of locked devices, which tie them to their service providers even when better options may be available. Handset locking practices limit consumer freedom and lessen competition by creating an artificial technological barrier to switching providers,\" the groups said. The groups cited the Verizon rules as a model and urged the FCC to require \"that device unlocking is truly automatic—that is, unlocked after the requisite time period without any additional actions of the consumer.\" Carriers should not be allowed to lock phones for longer than 60 days even when a phone is on a financing plan with outstanding payments, the groups' letter said: Providers should be required to transition out of selling devices without this [automatic unlocking] capability and the industry-wide rule should be the same as the one protecting Verizon customers today: after the expiration of the initial period, the handset must automatically unlock regardless of whether: (1) the customer asks for the handset to be unlocked or (2) the handset is fully paid off. Removing this barrier to switching will make the standard simple for consumers and encourage providers to compete more vigorously on mobile service price, quality, and innovation. In an October 2 filing, Verizon said it supports \"a uniform approach to handset unlocking that allows all wireless providers to lock wireless handsets for a reasonable period of time to limit fraud and to enable device subsidies, followed by automatic unlocking absent evidence of fraud.\" Verizon said 60 days should be the minimum for postpaid devices so that carriers have time to detect fraud and theft, and that \"a longer, 180-day locking period for prepaid is necessary to enable wireless providers to continue offering subsidies that make phones affordable for prepaid customers.\" Regardless of what time frame the FCC chooses, Verizon said \"a uniform unlocking policy that applies to all providers... will benefit both consumers and competition.\" FCC considers impact on phone subsidies While the FCC is likely to impose an unlocking rule, one question is whether it will apply when a carrier has provided a discounted phone. The FCC's NPRM asked the public for \"comment on the impact of a 60-day unlocking requirement in connection with service providers' incentives to offer discounted handsets for postpaid and prepaid service plans.\" The FCC acknowledged Verizon's argument \"that providers may rely on handset locking to sustain their ability to offer handset subsidies and that such subsidies may be particularly important in prepaid environments.\" But the FCC noted that public interest groups \"argue that locked handsets tied to prepaid plans can disadvantage low-income customers most of all since they may not have the resources to switch service providers or purchase new handsets.\" The public interest groups also note that unlocked handsets \"facilitate a robust secondary market for used devices, providing consumers with more affordable options,\" the NPRM said. The FCC says it can impose phone-unlocking rules using its legal authority under Title III of the Communications Act \"to protect the public interest through spectrum licensing and regulations to require mobile wireless service providers to provide handset unlocking.\" The FCC said it previously relied on the same Title III authority when it imposed the unlocking rules on 700 MHz C Block spectrum licenses purchased by Verizon. T-Mobile told the FCC in a filing last month that \"none of the litany of Title III provisions cited in the NPRM support the expansive authority asserted here to regulate consumer handsets (rather than telecommunications services).\" T-Mobile also said that \"the Commission's legal vulnerabilities on this score are only magnified in light of recent Supreme Court precedent.\" The Supreme Court recently overturned the 40-year-old Chevron precedent that gave agencies like the FCC judicial deference when interpreting ambiguous laws. The end of Chevron makes it harder for agencies to issue regulations without explicit authorization from Congress. This is a potential problem for the FCC in its fight to revive net neutrality rules, which are currently blocked by a court order pending the outcome of litigation.

Subsidized phones are like monthly car payments drive up costs and are targeted at people bad at math. If consumers paid out of pocket for their phones then they would be more picky about upgrading and plan prices. It would also make upselling shitty plan features harder so the carriers would loose a lot of money. reply MarkusWandel 20 hours agorootparentI've had a couple of people who are decidedly good at math (engineers) explain to me that, at least here in Canada, for at least one carrier, for at least one kind of phone (recent, high-end model iphones) if you get out of the carrier contract the moment you can (2 years I think), you do get the phone for less than if you bought it outright and went on a market rate prepaid plan right away. Not even considering the interest free \"instalment plan\" that they are essentially buying it on. I guess the carriers still make money because once habituated, especially if they've never done the port-number-to-new-carrier thing, people stay in the high priced plan longer than necessary. Like the three years until they've truly paid the above-market price for the phone, and are now eligible for another \"free\" phone which they may not even take advantage of. For what it's worth, carrier locking phones has been illegal here for some years (and any phone from the locked era had to be unlocked for free for the asking after the law was changed) and it hasn't changed anything in terms of these rent-to-buy type carrier plans. So I don't know what the fuss is about. A contract is a contract. reply aceofspades19 16 hours agorootparentYeah as a fellow Canadian, I agree. When the unlocking policy was first discussed here, people had the same fears and that people would just run off with the phones. It turns out that people generally don't like being banned from a carrier or getting the hit on their credit. I don't see why its different than a car really. While some dealerships are adding GPS trackers nowadays, there is nothing stopping you from buying a car on credit and driving it to Mexico and hiding it in a locked garage. It's going to be very difficult to buy another car if you do that though, and that's enough of a deterrence for most people as they have to continue living their lives and eventually buy a new car. reply simfree 15 hours agorootparentCanada is also a much smaller market that has minimal competition with unique cellular bands preventing reuse of said phones outside of a handful of other countries (without severe breakage of VoLTE, or missing low band coverage). reply aceofspades19 14 hours agorootparentThat's not true, it may have been true at one point in time like 20 years ago. Even Bell Canada says you can use your Canadian phone in most countries in the world: https://support.bell.ca/mobility/network_coverage/where_can_... (obviously not super authoritative but they wouldn't tell people their phone worked in a country if it did not.) It's possible there are some obscure features that may not work properly but for general usage as far as phone calls, texting, data usage, I've never heard of anyone having any issues with their Canadian phone internationally, besides maybe the cost of roaming.If you have a source from recent times that says this, I'd like to see it. As far as minimal competition goes, there is not an infinite amount of cellphone carriers in the US either that will give you a phone on credit, especially if you have bad credit. I'm sure there are existing ways you can scam phones out of carriers too if you are fine with being banned from the carrier and/or torching your credit. reply ac29 3 hours agorootparentprevAccording to a quick look at frequencycheck.com, of the 14 LTE bands used in Canada, all but 2 of them are also used in the US. reply sourcepluck 19 hours agorootparentprevYeah, just like the supermarket club cards are good for shoppers. A similar psychological thing is going on in both cases I feel - some minority will manage to emerge winners due to a mixture of persistence, intelligence, luck, greed, etc. And the majority will get squeezed, or else how would such large percentages of marketing budgets continue to be pumped into club card and subscription schemes. reply afavour 20 hours agorootparentprevIt's a little more nuanced than you're making out. I spent way, way too long working out the totals from the various methods of getting a new phone and getting the free phone as part of a 24/36 month agreement ended up being cheaper than many alternatives, primarily because you're paying the monthly plan amount whether you take the free phone or not. I personally think upgrading my phone after three years is a reasonable timeframe, but of course everyone is different. It wasn't cheaper than all alternatives. There were a bunch of virtual operators offering better monthly rates than the big networks but I've personally had bad experiences with network deprioritization on them. Depends very much on your individual circumstance, I'm in NYC and the network is clearly pretty saturated. reply 1800throwaway 19 hours agorootparent> getting the free phone as part of a 24/36 month agreement ended up being cheaper than many alternatives This is generally strictly true, but most people don't move on to the next deal once they've paid off their device, and end up paying more than they would have had they bought the device outright, device+plan cost considered. reply nothercastle 20 hours agorootparentprevTry att prepaid.

Everything else is ridiculously priced compared to Mint. reply nothercastle 18 hours agorootparentIf their plan works in your area absolute steal reply grepfru_it 18 hours agorootparentAs soon as I drive outside of city limits I lose all practical cell coverage. One of the main reasons I stick to Verizon reply simfree 15 hours agorootparentVerizon is really thin on the ground out West, their coverage just keeps shrinking as their LTEiRA partners shut down or get bought out by T-Mobile and AT&T. Between Reno and Las Vegas it's pretty stark, huge holes in Verizon's coverage and a few 3G CDMA only towers, while AT&T has strong band 14 coverage, and T-Mobile has slightly better coverage than Verizon but also lets you roam onto AT&T. Meanwhile in the San Juans the situation is dire on Verizon, with only one tower just on Orcas Island. AT&T has a handful of towerd, two on Orcas and then they force roam everyone onto T-Mobile who has dozens of local towers. So long as you are on AT&T or T-Mobile with roaming you'll have the best coverage possible, but if your stuck on Verizon it seems your in for a rough ride these days. reply Drew_ 17 hours agorootparentprev> I spent way, way too long working out the totals from the various methods of getting a new phone Did you add this time you spent into those totals? I think if you did, your math would come out differently. Personally, if I even feel the need to do any math like this, the answer is already \"no, I can't afford this\". reply ThunderSizzle 8 hours agorootparentHow can comparing different methods for a couple minutes be charged? Or rather, would it not be charged evenly to multiple options since multiple options are being researched, including the proposed \"default\" of buying a phone outright and then finding a plan that will actually provide suitable service while saving money. To your credit, just stick with the subsidized phone deal, and then don't upgrade when it's paid off. At that point, your phone is now technically unlocked reply Drew_ 5 hours agorootparent\"I spent way, way too long\" sounds like a lot more than \"a couple minutes\" to me. My point is that there is no research cost for buying outright. You just buy the phone and then you pick whatever service and plan you want. If I have to spend significant amounts of time penny pinching on \"deals\" and contracts that probably means I'm trying to buy something I can't afford. Moreover, this tendency definitely leads to _more_ spending in the long, not less. reply krageon 8 hours agorootparentprevI've done the same thing as you and buying the phone separately was cheaper every time. In a normal jurisdiction the phone payment is a clear component of your bill and it is patently clear you're borrowing the full sale amount and paying back a higher amount of money. If this isn't obviously the case, the \"normal\" plans are subsidizing phone sales. This means that you're almost certain to be better off with a vendor that doesn't offer this or at least offers it in a way that isn't dishonest. At the end of the day, even if what you say is true making use of this deal makes things worse for everyone because it is part of a larger strategy. Inevitably you will be squeezed for more money than you otherwise would, sometimes it just takes a while. reply mattmaroon 21 hours agorootparentprevI don’t know, my phone carrier charges me zero interest to “buy” my phone on a 36 month loan because of it.

AT&T’s prepaid plans start at is 25$/month for unlimited calls & text, “Unlimited” data (After 16GB it degrades to 1.5mbps) + 10Gb tethering. Meanwhile their cheapest regular plan is 50$/month for worse service (4GB data). Sure they don’t offer the best plans prepaid, but that’s basic price discrimination. reply nine_k 20 hours agorootparentHey, it's the cost of credit. With a prepaid plan, you credit the operator, because you pay upfront, and the service is rendered after it, and ceases if your balance goes below zero. With regular plans, the operator credits you, and you can be late with your payment for many days before the operator ceases servicing you. So it's a month worth if credit, plus a different risk profile. Also, it's market segmentation: the prepaid plan is the gateway drug %) reply gruez 19 hours agorootparentThere's no way the credit risk on the post paid plans are anywhere high enough to justify the higher prices. reply actionablefiber 21 hours agorootparentprevMy family (parents, siblings) are asking me \"How did our T-mobile phone bill balloon so much in the past decade?\" and I can point to the slow creep and the plan changes they made that (without them knowing or anyone telling them) un-grandfathered them out of a favorable promotional plan. For instance my sister needed to increase her data cap about a few months before they moved our data to unlimited. It pushed her out of the promo and now the family plan costs $35/mo extra even though her line is getting the exact same things as mine, which is still on the promo pricing. Then I tell them they'd be better served by switching to an MVNO offering significantly better rates and they come back and tell me they're locked in for a while because they just financed new devices.

I chose a midrange Samsung for its practical customization options over stock Android, plus it comes with 4 promised updates.

We should insist that companies support their phones longer or unlock and completely open source them at the EOL. reply unsignedint 10 hours agorootparentWe’re likely talking about a small subset of users for whom open sourcing or similar efforts would be worthwhile. The bigger issue these days is that phones aren't designed to last. We've seen this trend ever since batteries became non-removable, and I doubt EU regulations will make a significant difference. Most users either dispose of their phones when they stop working or trade them in for a newer model. This is especially common with premium phones, while mid-range models might only fetch you $10 on a trade-in if you’re lucky. Some companies do better in this regard. For example, Samsung provides four major updates, whereas the last mid-range Motorola I owned only gave me one. By the time I receive the fourth update on my current phone, I'll probably be dealing with bigger issues, like the battery not holding a charge—or worse. I wish phones were more serviceable, but that’s just not the case. Still, at mid-range prices, I’m fine with replacing it when it’s on its last legs.

A better distinction is not small vs. large, but appreciating assets vs. depreciating. Houses tend to increase in value, so it's usually okay to finance (pandemics and market crashes are the exceptions) because you often make a profit when it's time to sell. Phones tend to decrease in value after purchase, so financing it just means you're losing even more money at the end.

Arguably, a phone company can offer loans on a locked phone for lower interest rates than anyone else could, because they can cut off service if the loan isn't paid, which is an incentive to actually pay it. I'm not all sure this is a good thing, but I can see the argument for why it might result in lower interest rates on phones. None of this is going to matter to people with good credit. reply marinmania 19 hours agorootparentprevEven if that's true it's still a less accurate headline. The rule is about unlocking, not deals.

Network locking still exists, but unlock codes need to be free after you've paid off the phone. This leads to a situation here (Ireland) where some people are billed monthly for their phone itself, but the have a pre-pay plan on the sim card inside. I thought the US had made a similar change banning that kind of co-mingling of charges. reply crazygringo 21 hours agorootparentprevI have to assume that you ultimately pay more in the UK then, because what prevents users from stopping paying after the first month, and switching to a cheaper plan with another provider, and keeping the phone? Companies aren't going to repossess your phone the way it's worth it to repossess your car or house if you stop repaying your loan. So it raises the overall price because the companies charge more in order to offset the losses of people who effectively steal the phones they never finished paying for. reply paranoidrobot 20 hours agorootparent> because what prevents users from stopping paying after the first month, and switching to a cheaper plan with another provider, and keeping the phone? Same as what stops you breaking a contract and not paying any other debt: They'll start the collections process on you. reply lbourdages 20 hours agorootparentYep, same in Canada. A phone contract shows up on your credit report (since you pay at the end of the month for the service received during the month) and if you were to not pay the penalty, the outstanding debt would show up there. reply crazygringo 18 hours agorootparentprevBut the reality is that people who don't pay their phone contract tend to be the kinds of people who just ignore collections anyways and have a bad credit score to begin with. That's the problem with small debts, and why phone locking was a clever solution -- if the phone becomes useless when you stop paying, people will actually pay it off when they wouldn't have before. reply paranoidrobot 16 hours agorootparent> and have a bad credit score to begin with. If they already have a bad credit score, then the carrier giving them an expensive phone without upfront payment is kinda on the carrier. I think there's probably a significant net benefit to society from forcing carriers to unlock phones by default. If you're overseas, or need to temporarily use another carrier - you can. If a carrier is not willing to carry the risk that someone who has bad credit might break the contract for an expensive phone - then I think perhaps that's not such a bad thing. reply IshKebab 16 hours agorootparentprev> and have a bad credit score to begin with.

It's a fairly short response this time as well. ---- >handsets that are free or heavily discounted off the manufacturer's suggested retail price. You do it by increasing contract prices and being able to collect a phone if you don't stay with the often 2-year contract for stuff like this. The final price is also much more expensive than buying outright. This is a bit silly in am age where phone tech has plateaued and you can often get last year flagships for half the price at launch. Consumers don't need the newest phone at all. >T-Mobile’s current unlocking policies also help T- Mobile combat handset theft and fraud by sophisticated, international criminal organizations. All androids and iphones have built in find - my - phone features these days, as well as the ability to wipe remotely. Phones are one of the least useful things to try and steal these days as a result, up there with a credit card. You can still get info and pawn off a wiped phone, but I don't see what T-Mobile does to prevent that further. >because the proposal would force providers to reduce the line-up of their most compelling handset offers.

Libertarian arguments only make sense if you don't think about it too much, or are ignorant about the context and details, or you have a vested interest. You can compare phone prices with countries where there is healthy competition and there is no or very limited blocking (France is a good example - you can buy phones outright, or get them on a payment plan that locks you on a more expensive monthly payment compared to the classic 20€ everything included including 20-150GB internet depending on the provider plan; after the initial period is over, you can do whatever you want). If you bother to look into the topic a little bit more than surface level, libertarian arguments usually fall apart easily. reply reissbaker 21 hours agorootparentFrance allows companies to have more onerous locking policies than the U.S. is proposing. French telecom companies are allowed to sell locked phones, require customers to request unlocks (rather than auto-unlocking, like the U.S. proposed rules), and the companies are allowed to take up to 3 months to respond to unlock requests, rather than requiring immediate unlocks after the first 60 days pass. I like unlocked phones, and I buy my phones unlocked. But I agree with the sentiment here that we already know what the prices are for unlocked phones: manufacturers will sell them to you at that price, and telecom operators in the U.S. will universally allow you to bring your own, unlocked device free of charge. What the companies offering locked phones offer is an optional subsidy in exchange for a locked phone; while I'm sure there are reasonable arguments around e-waste that result in wanting some limits to locking, there is an obvious tradeoff in that the value of the subsidy diminishes as the allowed lock time diminishes. Mandating short limits to phone locks raises prices for poor people who can't afford unlocked phones. It's not always bad to do that — sometimes companies are taking advantage of poor people — but it's pretty true that will happen. reply makapuf 21 hours agorootparentKeep in mind that prices in France are WAY lower than in the US according to this site. https://www.cable.co.uk/mobiles/worldwide-data-pricing/ (edit: bad autocorrect) reply reissbaker 19 hours agorootparentWe are discussing the price of smartphones, not the price of data plans. The infographic also seems pretty wrong, FWIW, especially considering that many US plans are uncapped and thus price/GB depends on usage. (There are sometimes, but not always, throttles past large amounts of usage eg 50GB/month, but since most of these plans cost less than $50/month, it seems extremely unlikely that most people are paying $6/GB as the website is claiming.) Verizon's \"Visible\" brand, for example, offers plans for $25/month with \"unlimited\" (soft cap at 60GB) data, for an effective $0.41/GB assuming you use up to the throttle limit. Even non-unlimited plans can be quite cheap; T-Mobile, for example, offers prepaid data plans for as little as $1/GB. reply makapuf 12 hours agorootparentThe site may be wrong and thanks for the inputs. However you can compare it to a French plan of 14€ per month for 140GB (and then throttled) by example and there are maybe cheaper prices per gb. reply pkaye 21 hours agorootparentprevAre people paying $6/GB on average in the US? reply reissbaker 19 hours agorootparentNo, the UK-based website is wrong.

Fast forward to a couple months ago, I happened to notice while browsing my TMobile account that my phone was being reported as \"Carrier Locked\" with subtext that said \"This phone is not eligible to be unlocked\". Not my wife's though, hers was listed as \"Unlocked\". It took over a month of being yanked around by TMobile reps telling me they had to \"escalate but the issue will be fixed within a week\". It never was. They would ask me why I wanted it unlocked. I would just respond something respectful but firm along the lines of \"Because it's my phone. I paid for it. You have no business locking my device\" The way I see it, it was either theft or false advertising, plain and simple. Either they stole the phone from me after I bought it. Or, they sold me a device as unlocked but never realized that promise. It should have NEVER been locked. It makes me mad just thinking about it. I don't understand why a carrier even has the power to remotely lock a phone that was never theirs to lock in the first place. This is all to say: I agree with your observation. They deserve heavy handed regulation because they have proven they will abuse any inch you give them. reply irunmyownemail 20 hours agorootparentThis made me nervous, I used their web site under accounts check unlock status.

That 6s is still locked, T-mobile is scummy. reply kelnos 20 hours agoprevI generally don't have a problem with the trade where a customer gets a free or subsidized phone, and the carrier gets a more-or-less guaranteed customer for some agreed-upon time period. But: * The phone needs to unlock the instant the agreement/deal ends. Automatically, without the need to phone home to the carrier to get it done. * If the phone is on a payment plan, that shouldn't have anything to do with this; it should be unlocked from day one, and if the customer decides to switch carriers, they're still on the hook for paying out the rest of the payment plan, just like any other credit arrangement. * Carriers must be agnostic to the devices on their network. They should not be permitted to refuse to allow you to bring your own phone, as long as that phone has been certified by whatever relevant regulatory body as being compliant with the various mobile radio standards. I don't really get why there's so much consternation around this. If people want free or reduced-price things, sometimes they have to give something else in return. If they don't want to, they can buy a full-price, unlocked phone. As long as that option remains, I don't see the problem with carriers offering alternate terms. But I still don't get why the carriers are upset. They can still pair a free/subsidized phone with a 1- or 2-year service contract, with early termination fees that recoup their loss on the phone. Sure, having the phone locked is an incentive to either stay or pay the termination fees, but do enough people to matter actually manage to avoid paying the termination fees? Seems unlikely. reply sixothree 15 hours agoparent> I don't really get why there's so much consternation around this.

Before the auction and before the FCC finalized the rules that would apply to the spectrum the FCC commissioners were circulating drafts of rules they were considering. One of the drafts was proposing open access rules. Google wrote to the FCC and made a binding commitment to bid at least $4.3 billion if the final rules included certain open access rules. The FCC then included those rules, thus guaranteeing they would get at least $4.3 billion. Verizon outbid Google and so got that spectrum along with those open access requirements, which included no SIM locking. In 2018 Verizon, citing fraud concerns, asked the FCC to relax the no locking rule.

They could offer phones on installment plans conditional on an N-month contract. The buyer could switch carriers and keep the phone, but be on the hook to pay off the rest of the contract term. The only reason to use technological locks is to further trap a customer into a carrier relationship beyond the legal terms of their contract.

Instant money. Meanwhile the telecom company has to sell the debt at a massive discount to a collections agency or spend a ton of money collecting on it. That's assuming it can be collected on at all from someone that might just be running a scam. With a locked phone, the phone just stops working and loses most of its value. A rule forcing carriers to unlock phones after the term is up is fine. Forcing them to do it before is illogical. How many people are going to pay for two plans on one phone because they didn't like the first plan? I doubt it's more than those who will immediately abuse this rule and stop paying for the phone.

The kinds of people who skip paying their cell phone bill generally have bad credit to begin with and couldn't care less if it goes to collections. The recovery rate for collections is pennies on the dollar. And you know who will suffer if more people are able to basically keep phones for free? Not the carriers.

It's not like they are mandated by law to provide everyone the latest iPhone regardless of credit score. I worked in customer support for Rogers(A Canadian phone carrier) for a very short period before it was mandated to have unlocked phones and people still stopped paying their bill even if the phone was locked. The vast majority of people want to pay their bills on time especially for something as critical as phone service.

Because phone locking means they're much more likely to pay it off, and so an unprofitable customer segment becomes a profitable one. Everybody wins -- the carrier doesn't lose money, and more people get phones. > The people who don't, are going to not pay their bill no matter what sort of rules in place That's simply not true. If it were, then carriers would never have bothered with the administrative overhead of locking phones in the first place.

Plus, mixing-and-matching plans can be advantageous to the user in certain situations even within one country. For example, data-only plans are typically cheaper than data+calls, but one might still want a very modest calls plan for infrequent use - sometimes, better value can be attained by combining two separate contracts. Of course, whether or not telcos ought to allow such use of their contract handsets is another question entirely! reply neodymiumphish 20 hours agorootparentIf there’s a big enough market for this use case, I suspect at least one carrier would do so.

The sooner their anticompetitive behavior backfires on them the sooner they'll stop doing it. reply FireBeyond 20 hours agorootparentprevSimple. Since the major carriers these days offer \"interest free installments\" on phones, with subsidies or billing credits to make the TCO cheaper... then when this happens, the carrier: 1) loses no interest payments, 2) may lose installment payments, but this is a credit risk anyway - onus is on them to assess risk to a point of acceptability to them, and 3) get to not pay out the subsidies or billing credit. All this amounts to is an additional layer of securing a loan. And pre-emptively so. \"You cannot unlock this device because others may abuse this.\" Assess identity and credit risk better. I have little sympathy for the carriers, after having to fight Verizon over the claim that I, living in Seattle, and being an AT&T customer for a decade with 4-6 lines and devices, somehow decided to go to El Paso and buy a phone at a Walmart on Verizon, run it up making international calls and let it go to collections. After supplying their (onerous, tbh) info around identity, police report, current utility billing and such, VZW said \"We are still satisfied that the debt is valid and belongs to you, after reviewing your documentation with documentation that was supplied when the account was opened\". When I said \"well, given that you have verified my identity, and given that you state that the documentation you have from the account says that it was I who opened the account, I'd like to see that documentation\". Verizon: \"We cannot provide that data to you as it may violate customer privacy\". Schrodingers account holder.

Because you’re on this plan, the carrier offers $600 off the phone price, paid in account credit over 24 months ($25/month), so your total monthly bill becomes $67/month for 2 years, then $50/month at the end of 2 years. If, 3 months in, you find yourself unhappy with your carrier, you can still pay the remainder of your phone cost ($875) to own your phone outright and walk away. In that time, you’ve saved $75 off the full price of the phone. Arguing that US carrier prices are exorbitant is not relevant to whether carrier locks and phone discount credits are worthwhile or cost effective. reply happymellon 4 hours agorootparentI'm not sure what that has to do with locking your phone. If you have a line of credit for the cost of a phone, then you have a line of credit for the cost of a phone. If you have a contract for service, them you have a contract for service. If you try and terminate either then they will reclaim based upon your contract with them. reply neodymiumphish 2 hours agorootparentAnd the lock is collateral against a small, high-demand object that can easily be fenced. The phone lock is essentially the same as a hold against a car title until it’s paid off. This would only be a real problem if there were no options to buy phones direct/outright without the lock. Instead, we’re likely to end up in some situation where carriers work with phone manufacturers to implement a sort of higher-level device lock feature that stipulates the device “belongs” to the carrier and can be functionally locked (a la the stolen device lock features that currently exist) if they ever go unpaid. reply iluvcommunism 21 hours agoprevI used to have ATT for a little over ten years.

They're pricing the subsidies into their carrier rates. If this went through, they'd likely have to cut the subsidies and engage in pure competition on pre-paid mobile rates. I know some HN readers read that last line and go, \"good,\" but the fact of the matter is that people who are buying subsidized phones on pre-paid plans are generally poor credit risks generally and phones lose a huge amount of their value the second you open the shrink-wrap so they're not very worthwhile as security for a secured loan, so by unbundling these two, T-Mobile starts to compete with everybody else on rates for service and somebody else steps in to handle the leases on phones, and if you look at that market segment, the answer in the US as to who is most prepared to take over that business, the answer is _Rent-A-Center_. The total cost to buy a PS5 Slim is $500, the total cost to get a PS5 Slim through my nearest Rent-A-Center is $1,349.50. Again, I am sure that T-Mobile is not advocating for this out of charity, but I'm not as convinced as some around here that this form of unbundling would be an unmitigated good thing. EDIT: And to your point of, well wouldn't pre-paid operators all switch to a contract model, I don't think \"you can't get phone service without a contract\" is what people who are advocating for this reform want, and the primary customer for a pre-paid plan is someone who is too large a credit risk to get a 12-month contract through someone else. I said primary customer, if you want to tell me you're a great credit risk but you're on prepaid as an ideological stance, just pretend I already know that about you. reply jacobr1 21 hours agorootparentprev>Is there a reason if it was unlocked you would immediately switch?

Data Formulator blends UI interaction with natural language so that you can create visualizations with AI much more effectively! You can: * create rich visualizations beyond initial datasets, where AI helps transforming and visualizing data along the way * iterate your designs and dive deeper using data threads, a new way to manage your conversation with AI. Here is a demo video: https://github.com/microsoft/data-formulator/releases/tag/0.... Give it a shot and let us know how it looks like! d_watt 2 hours agoSome of the metaphors for interacting with the models, and visualizing as threads are interesting. Definitely does a good combination of ease of prompting + interogatability of the generated code. I quickly ran into a wall trying to do interesting things like \"forecast a dataset using ARIMA.\" On the surface it just does a linear prediction, seeming to ignore me, but under the hood you can see the model tried importing a library not actually in my environment, failed, and fell back to linear. Given that you're approaching this in a pythonic way, not sql, my default way of working with it is to think about what python stuff I'd want to do. How do you see handling these things in the future. Go the route of assuming anaconda, and prompt the model with a well known set of libraries to expect? Or maybe prompt the user to install libraries that are missing? reply chenglong-hn 2 hours agoparentThat's a cool example! You are right, GPT-4o is much more powerful than we allow it to perform in Data Formulator, and our current design is to restrict it to a point that the model behavior is more or less reliable. While we design it targeting more end-user analysts scenarios (thus much simpler UI and function support), we see the big value of \"freeing\" GPT-4o for advanced users who would like to have AI do complex stuff. I guess a starting point could be having an \"interactive terminal\" where AI and the user can directly communicate about these out of the box concepts, even having the user instruct AI to dynamically generate new UI to adapt to their workflow. reply zurfer 9 hours agoprevAnthropic recently released something that looks more polished but follows the chat paradigm. [1] As a builder of something like that [2], I believe the future is a mix, where you have chat (because it's easy to go deep and refine) AND generate UIs that are still configurable manually. It's interesting to see that you also use plotly for rendering charts. I found it non-trivial to make these highly configurable via a UI (so far). Thank you for open sourcing so we can all learn from it. [1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41885231 [2] https://getdot.ai reply flessner 5 hours agoparentThe future in this space will probably stick to what IDEs have done from the beginning: Leaving the \"core platform\" unchanged while providing additional AI powered features around it. Microsoft Office, VS Code, Adobe Photoshop and most other large software platforms have all embraced this. I have genuinely not seen an AI product that works standalone (without a preexisting platform) besides chat-based LLMs. reply zurfer 9 hours agoparentprevHere is the link to one of the prompts. It seems like all the LLM tasks are in the agents directory: https://github.com/microsoft/data-formulator/blob/main/py-sr... Some of these \"agents\" are used for surprising things like sorting: https://github.com/microsoft/data-formulator/blob/main/py-sr... [this seems a bit lazy, but I guess it works :D] reply chenglong-hn 1 hour agorootparentyou find it! you can't imagine how often I'm annoyed when see April being ranked before March due to alphabetic order... Thus the sorting agent, and now running by default in the background! reply DeathArrow 8 hours agoparentprevIf you look in the video from OP, you can see that chat is still used at some point. reply chenglong-hn 1 hour agorootparentyes! chat is still a necessary component, since it's sometimes the only way for us to communicate unstructured information to the system. reply zurfer 7 hours agorootparentprevhmm there is a follow up to show the difference in percent instead of absolute values, which is similar to the type of interaction you can have in chat and there is a sort of history on the left side, so things are chat like to some degree. reply gourabmi 1 hour agoprevI just tried this out on a bunch of log files that were lying around. Excellent! I would love to connect this to a SQL database through ODBC/ JDBC and ask questions about the data. Does anyone have a tool that they use already for this usecase ? reply chenglong-hn 29 minutes agoparentI'm tempted to add a button to support connecting data from/to ODBC/JDBC but at same time worried about security stuff... maybe there could be some intermediate layer to support this :) reply paddy_m 5 hours agoprevI have a tool [1] that is tackling some of the same problems in a different way. I had some core views that shaped what I built. 1. When doing data manipulation, especially initial exploration and cleaning, we type the same things over and over. Being proficient with pandas involves a lot of recognition of patterns, and hopefully remembering one with well written code (like you would read in Effective Pandas). 2. pandas/polars is a huge surface space in terms of API calls, but rarely are all of those calls relevant. There are distinct operations you would want on a datetime column, a string column or an int column. The traditional IDE paraidgm is a bit lacking for this type of use (python typing doesn't seem to utilize the dtype of a column, so you see 400 methods for every column). 3.It is less important for a tool to have the right answer out of the box, vs letting you cycle through different views and transforms quickly. ------ I built a low code UI for Buckaroo that has a DSL (JSON Lisp) that mostly specifies transform, column name, and other arguments. These operations are then applied to a dataframe, and separately the python code is generated from templates for each command. I also have a facility for auto-cleaning that heuristically inspects columns and outputs the same operations. So if a column has 95% numbers and 1% blank strings, that should probably be treated as a numeric column. These operations are then visible in the lowcode UI. Multiple cleaning methods can be tried out (with different thresholds). [1] https://github.com/paddymul/buckaroo [2] https://youtu.be/GPl6_9n31NE?si=YNZkpDBvov1lUYe4&t=603 Demonstrating the low code UI and autocleaning in about 3 minutes [3] There are other related tools in this space, specifically visidata and dtale. They take different approaches which are worth learning from. ps: I love this product space and I'm eager to talk to anyone building products in this area. reply chenglong-hn 2 hours agoparentthis is really really cool! directly working with table is sometimes the only way to clean the data as well :) I wish multiple ways of interacting with data can co-exist seamlessly in some sort of future tool (without overwhelming users (?)) :) reply paddy_m 2 hours agorootparentTo your point about LLM based approaches have the huge adoption advantage in that you don't need to understand a lot to write into a text box. A tool like buckaroo requires investment into knowing where to click and how to understand the output intitially. reply goose- 12 hours agoprevSince Data Formulator performs data transformation on your behalf to get the desired visualization, how can we verify those transformations are not contaminated by LLM hallucinations, and ultimately, the validity of the visualization? reply larodi 11 hours agoparentWe can’t. Without the driver this car runs on probability. And that all. A capable operator is still needed in the loop. reply DeathArrow 8 hours agoparentprevYou can see the generated code. reply croes 6 hours agorootparentDo you think the people who this is made for can grasp the code? reply chenglong-hn 2 hours agorootparentthis is constant challenge! code is the ultimate verification tool, but not everyone gets it. sometimes reading charts help, sometimes looking at data helps, other times only code can serve the verification purpose... reply croes 6 hours agoprevThe problem with AI is still, how confident can we be the result isn’t wrong? reply nerdjon 4 hours agoparentWe still really should not be confident. We have seen this time and time again that the output cannot be relied on. People keep trying to downplay the problem as \"not a big deal\" or that it happens rarely, but that is kinda the problem. It is right enough times that people get confident in it and we stop double checking the work. When it is manipulating data that makes it even more problematic. Now if what is happening here is the AI is generating the code that makes the visualizations and that code is still working in a traditional way (accessing the data directly), than I think its fine. Sure maybe some of the code may be wrong, but at least it is not manipulating the data and coming up with wild conclusions. reply chenglong-hn 2 hours agoparentprevI'm not very confident either -- some of users in our user study also reports the same. :) We are recently thinking about how to have AI provide more information in ways we can interpret. For example, might adding some feature to hint if AI's computation use a specific formula that users didn't mention. I feel working with AI is like the first week working with a someone we never met before. reply monkeydust 5 hours agoparentprevThis is something I constantly struggle with. Its fine for some generative sales, marketing language but for data analysis wearing the risk that the output is even 0.1% wrong is not an option for many. So you end up checking what the AI does which negates the productivity argument entirely. Curious how others deal with this dilemma reply paddy_m 5 hours agorootparentI would love if we could seed LLMs with specific books, or give our own weightings to sources. I'm sure most books are in there already, I would happily pay extra (and want it to go to original authors) for known provenance of advice. Even pass royalties back to the original authors. For PyData code, I'm always looking at Effective Python/Polars. reply chenglong-hn 2 hours agorootparentprevthis is a big challenge! the more complicated the code generated by AI, the more likely is going wrong and harder to verify. (more magic == more risk) I'm curious how to really restrict what AI is generating each step so it is simple enough to verify and edit, yet not making it seems too verbose and slow reply paddy_m 5 hours agoprevThis looks good, especially the data ingest. A couple of questions: What type of data person are you aiming this tool to be useful for, data analyst, data scientist, or data engineer. I'm guessing data analyst who wants to use PyData instead of Tableau? How data aware is your system? Is it sending dtypes of columns, and maybe actual values to the LLM? How do you deal with python code gen and hallucinations? Do you plan to make a jupyter extension with this tech? reply chenglong-hn 2 hours agoparent1. when started out, we have Tableau/PowerBI users as the main audience in mind, hoping to grant them the power of data analysts who program in python to create charts requiring data transformation. but as we are building the tool, data formulator more or less are most powerful for people work with python data as you mentioned, since they can more easily issue instructions, verify results and followup. from our user study, it seems like experience with data analysis (i.e., know how to explore is the most important skill) either they know programming or not, software engineers without data analysis experience sometimes struggle using it. 2. check out how it's build in our paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16119)! but generally data types and sample values 3. hallucinations is unfortunately a big challenge! our main strategy is to (1) restrict the code space that AI can transform data so it's less likely to go wild, and (2) provide much information to the user as possible (code + data output + chart) to let them discover and (3) let them easily refine using data threads 4. yes! we have some plans in the bag and about to figuring it out! reply matt3D 11 hours agoprevAfter giving it a whirl I'm a little underwhelmed, but maybe I'm using it wrong. I'm getting less consistent results than if I prompted GPT4-o for a Vega graph after providing it with the documentation. reply chenglong-hn 2 hours agoparentpotentially! I myself as an experienced programmer finds directly chatting with GPT-4o much easier, since I have full control. But Data Formulator only transforms data in the back and GPT-4o don't do anything with charts (sometimes we want it!) We are wondering how to really achieve flexible chat experience with UI at the same time, right now it's quite a research challenge! reply data_ders 17 hours agoprevway cool! I hope to take it for a spin tomorrow! Q: Does your team see potential value in a DSL for succinctly describing visualizations to an LLM as Hex did with their DSL for Vega-lite specs [1]? [1]: https://hex.tech/blog/making-ai-charts-go-brrrr/ reply chenglong-hn 16 hours agoparentWow, that's pretty cool! I think there are potential -- current LLMs are not that good on VegaLite when I ask it to edit the script :) reply marktl 15 hours agoprevDefinitely looks like something that could save me, and others, allot of time. Thanks for sharing! reply hggigg 10 hours agoprevI rather like this idea. Apologies however for my cynicism in advance. I suspect it'll die due to human concerns. I've seen many reports recently which are just plain and utterly wrong written in dashboards by vendors and internally. The veracity of the results is mostly based on the human driving it and validating the methodology and the competent ones are apparently rather rare. This serves to give it to humans who are even worse at the job than the current ones. reply donq1xote1 12 hours agoprev [–] Thanks for sharing and provide open source version!

    "commentBody": "Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK) v4.0 is out [pdf] (computer.org)188 points by beryilma 23 hours agohidepastfavorite123 comments 0xbadcafebee 19 hours agoThere appears to be a lot of hate towards this in the comments (because it's not perfect?), but I feel strongly that we need explicit bodies of knowledge, along with certifications for having been trained on it. Every company I go to, the base of knowledge of all the engineers is a complete crapshoot. Most of them lack fundamental knowledge about software engineering. And they all lack fundamental knowledge about the processes used to do the work. That's not how engineering should work. If I hire an architect, I shouldn't have to quiz them to find out if they understand Young's Modulus, much less teach them about it on the job. But that's completely normal in software engineering today, because nobody is expected to have already learned a universal body of knowledge. I get this thing isn't perfect. But not being perfect isn't a rational argument for not having one at all. And we certainly need to hold people accountable to have learned it before we give them a job. We need a body of knowledge, it needs to be up to date and relevant, and we need to prove people have actually read it and understood it. If this isn't it, fine, but we still need one. (this is, by the way, kind of the whole fucking point of a trade school and professional licensing... why the fuck we don't have one for software engineers/IT, boggles my fucking mind, if this is supposed to be the future of work) reply creer 16 hours agoparentYou are under this illusion about other fields like architects because you don't work there and you can't tell. You don't know how the sausage is made. Historically I have tended to learn about a new field WAY too much before I tried to hire people in these fields. The truth is, that makes it hard to hire people (but for good reason - depending on your needs, you need to pass on a lot of people). More recently I have tried to pay very close attention to how people do their work (about whose field I am building an interest). The sad reality of the world is that most people and businesses stay in business entirely through dumb luck and because the world is not usually THAT demanding. And if you have a specific requirement, they won't be able to help \"out of the box\". You are imagining this competence. It doesn't exist in most people. And to compound this, to me, the characteristic of an engineer is that they are capable of learning about a specialty discipline. If you hire an engineer and they are incapable of learning something that's needed in your project, THAT is where their problem is (and yours for not hiring to that.) Engineering is not a trade. Certifications are usually about selling them or gatekeeping. I wish it were possible to certify \"engineering progress mindset\" - no, it doesn't have an ISO number. reply 0xbadcafebee 3 hours agorootparentOn the contrary, I am fully aware that there exists no field where a test or piece of paper guarantees excellence. But I am also aware what the lack of it does. It leads to buildings falling down or burning up [with people in them]. This was a common occurrence 100+ years ago. You know what made it less common? Standardization. Building codes. Minimum standards for engineers and the trades. Independent studies have all concluded that real world outcomes improved across the board because of these things. No formal certification or standard will lead to perfection. That is obvious. But what is also obvious, from actually looking at outcomes before and after their introduction, is that having them leads to better outcomes. You have to stop thinking about individual engineers, and start thinking about the much, much larger picture. What changes will have a positive effect on the larger picture? You can only have an effect on the larger picture if you enforce a change across the board, and then look at the aggregate results. That can not happen without a mechanism to enforce the change. We can't pray our way to better results, or just sit around hoping people magically get better at their jobs, because that clearly has not happened for the last few decades that I've been working. The more we depend on technology, the more we see the failures of a lack of rigor. Probably every single person with an address and social security number in the United States has had their personal information leaked, multiple times over, by now. Lives are ruined by systems that do not take into consideration the consequences of a lack of safety, or the bias of its creators. Entire global transportation systems are shut down because nobody added basic tests or fail-safes to critical software infrastructure. This shit isn't rocket science, man. It was all preventable. And just like with building codes, standards, licenses, etc, we can put things in place to actually teach people the right way to do things, and actually check for the preventable things, by law. If we don't, it's going to keep happening, and keep happening, and keep happening, and keep happening, forever. We can do something to stop it. But we have to pound our fist on the desk and say, enough is enough. We have to put something imperfect in place to stem the tide of enshittification. Because there are consequences if we don't. We have seen some of them globally in the form of warfare, but nothing compared to the devastation when the gloves come off. We have not yet seen an entire country's hacker resources attack the water, power, sanitation, food, and other systems of its enemy, all at once. But it's going to happen. And it's going to be devastating. Millions of people are going to die because some asshole set a default password on some SCADA systems. But it should have been impossible, because no SCADA system should be allowed to be sold with default passwords. That's the kind of thing we can prevent, just like you can't build a building today without a fire exit. That's the really big obvious impact. The impact nobody sees are from tiny decisions all the time, that slowly affect a few people at a time, but on the scale of millions of businesses and billions of people, add up to really big effects. We can make a huge difference here too, which will only be visible in aggregate later on. Like public sanitation, clean water, or hand-washing with soap, nobody thinks about the dramatic effect on public health and longevity until it's clear after decades what kind of impact it made. Technology is everywhere, in every home, affecting every life. The more we improve it [as a standard], the more we will see huge positive impacts later. reply creer 2 hours agorootparent> It leads to buildings falling down or burning up [with people in them]. This was a common occurrence 100+ years ago. You know what made it less common? Standardization. Building codes. Minimum standards for engineers and the trades. To me, this is a more interesting comparison. Is it PE certification and contractor licenses that led to this or is it building codes, construction inspectors, occupancy permits? I will argue that it's inspectors, NOT PE or contractors. And I will argue that the buildings codes have major negative consequences also. We all know of constructions methods that would have great benefits but have to be abandonned because they don't easily fit the current code. We all know of buildings that are to-code and yet ridiculously noisy and cheaply built. I will also argue that there are building code equivalents already in software and system architecture. There are several for \"certifying\" system or site security and systems that host credit card payments. And we all know how well they work. So I agree with you that there is room for progress there, but I will also argue that the approach NEEDS to be different. The current security or payment checklists are bureaucratic, CYA nonsense which discourage thinking and encourage bureaucracy and CYA specifically in place of actual security. The only thinking they encourage is creative writing to twist reality into the proper buzzwords. There may be a way to specify practices and security but we sure have not discovered it yet. So, a research question rather than already a standardization question? I will point out also that there WERE directions that did work in the past. For example, Dan Farmer and Wietse Venema's SATAN (and the several descendants since then) was bureaucracy-free: the test showed specific rubber-meets-the-road issues with your system that you could either fix or defend. No bullshit about using a firewall(tm) \"because that's best practice\". I also don't say that it's bad to publish books. I will say that it is bad to push \"best practice\". \"Best practice\" is precisely bureaucracy and CYA in place of thinking. To the point of site owners defending their lapses in the name of \"best practices\". What else currently goes in the right direction? Pen testing. Bug rewards. Code reviews. reply pnathan 16 hours agoparentprevI'm more than happy to sign onto a reasonable certification. Many good reasons for it. I am, personally, fond of the idea that an ABET certified BSCS should be ground floor level. Other ideas have been floated... But this particular work is really, really, really awful. For reasons that are well documented. In the most fundamental sense, the IEEE doesn't understand what professional SWEs need, in appropriate portions. It confuses SWE with PM, badly. And it has done so, historically. To the point of wide condemnation. reply nradov 15 hours agorootparentWhat exactly about the SWEBOK is awful? Could you give us a link to the documentation of reasons? Which sections of the SWEBOK cover topics that professional SWEs don't need to understand, and which major topics are missing? It isn't possible to be a competent engineer, beyond the most junior levels, without having a pretty solid grasp of project management. You might not need to be a good project manager but in order to make competent engineering decisions you have to understand how your tasks fit into the whole. reply pnathan 5 hours agorootparentThe basic problem is you're wrong and also right: it all depends. That is widely understood as the senior+ swe mantra. The SWEBOK, on the contrary, asserts \"it does not depend\" and that in a sense is the core problem. For a detailed takedown, the ACM's is the most famous, there are others that v3 sparked. I'm sure v4 is sparking it's own detailed analysis ... I'm bowing out to go do my day job now. :) reply mixmastamyk 13 hours agorootparentprevSE is not CS of course. Very few of us will write compilers, for example. reply osigurdson 15 hours agoparentprevWhat are you hoping professional licensing might do for you? I can attest that outside of traditional engineering fields, licensing is completely useless and confers roughly the same level of prestige as a Costco membership. I'll send you my engineering ring in the mail if you like (Canada's cheesy contribution to engineering culture). reply globular-toast 12 hours agoparentprevI completely agree. The trouble is we're so far away from this that all the people who learnt from a few tutorials and never read any books will try to defeat it at every step. They're here in these very comments. I get that it's possible to build working software without a certificate, in much the same way as someone can do their own electrics. But is it up to standard and safe for the next guy to work on? This is why we have standards. reply rockemsockem 18 hours agoparentprevEvery time I see someone post this line of reasoning they talk like this, as if other engineering disciplines all have some cert that is the god-tier cert. While this is true for some engineering fields it's mostly not true and I think that's a good thing because credentialism is bad actually. Also, architects are not even engineers. reply Arainach 17 hours agorootparentCredentialism is good. It provides both a trustworthy reference point and a method for punishment. If I want someone to do work, I want them to be licensed/certified. If they are flagrantly unsafe, I want a licensing board or similar to be able to strip that person of their ability to practice that profession. This raises public perception of the profession as a while, avoids a market for lemons, and gives some baseline. There are too many decisions in life to be able to spend an hour (or more) researching every option. Credentials allow a framework of trust - I don't have to decide if I trust every single engineer; if they have passed their PE exam and not had their certification taken away that is a starting point. reply rockemsockem 17 hours agorootparentCredentialism creates a false basis of trust and an arbitrary reference point. You're just arguing that you want to outsource your own decision making. You actually should interview your candidates before hiring them, whatever credential they have, because it actually is your job to ensure you work with high quality individuals. Credentialism basically allows the sort of low effort that you're describing and causes many places to rely solely on the credentials, which are obviously never sufficient to find high quality individuals. What are the jobs you're day dreaming about that require PE exams? I'd bet that requirement is much less common than you think. reply Arainach 17 hours agorootparentCredentialism is for more than employers. When I need an electrician or other tradesperson to work on my house, credentials are beneficial. When plans are drawn up for a deck or extension to my house, credentials are beneficial when getting an engineering signoff. Knowing that the local medical facilties employ credentialed doctors is great when I need something done. Etc., etc. reply tomasGiden 6 hours agorootparentI think complexity frameworks (like Cynefin) describes it pretty good. When the complexity is low, there are best practices (use a specific gauge of wires in an electric installation in a house or surgeons cleaning according to a specific process before a surgery) but as the complexity goes up best practices are replaced with different good practices and good practices with the exploration of different ideas. Certificates are very good when there are best practices but the value diminishes as the complexity increases. So, how complex is software production? I’d say that there are seldom best practises but often good practices (in example DDD, clean code and the testing pyramid) on the technical side. And then a lot of exploration on the business side (iterative development). So is a certificate of value? Maybe if you do Wordpress templates but not when you push the boundary of LLMs. And there’s a gray zone in between. reply creer 16 hours agorootparentprevIsn't the reality of things that credentials are a low bar. Yes, even with the legal bar exam, or the PE engineer, etc? When you are hiring, are you really hiring JUST based on that low bar? No! That wouldn't make sense! For example if you have a specific problem, most of the time you are looking for a lawyer who has already worked for a while in THAT specific field. The bar exame is not enough! I feel that's usually the case. And that makes sense. Why just specify \"PE engineer\"? When there are lots of them who have at least some specialization in the direction you want? reply eacapeisfutuile 16 hours agorootparentprevIt would have zero value in every process of vetting someone.

There's a lot of infrastructure that we take for granted because it always works (water purification and distribution, bridges and roads, electrical generation and transmission, automobile engines, the quality of gasoline, the safety of food, etc). You trust that these things will work the way you expect, because they don't change very quickly. Is that stagnation or stability? reply rockemsockem 17 hours agorootparentSo I don't know about you, but I live in America where roads, electrical generation and transmission, water purification, and bridges are all in subpar shape. That's super broad and I think there are complex reasons why each of these has failed, but it's pretty clear that stagnation hasn't helped and has probably actively caused harm by letting incompetence become too common in these areas. reply patmorgan23 16 hours agorootparentThis is just not the case. The US has lots of infrastructure that needs repair or replacement, but there are very few areas that do not have clean water, or reliable electricity (Sans extreme weather which causes disruptions in every country), and roads and bridges are all safe to drive on (when was the last time you read about a bridge that collapsed from lack of maintenance?) The US has its issues, but it does actually have a huge amount of superb, world class infrastructure. reply shiroiushi 13 hours agorootparent>reliable electricity (Sans extreme weather which causes disruptions in every country) Freezing temperatures do not cause widespread outages in properly-run countries. >roads and bridges are all safe to drive on (when was the last time you read about a bridge that collapsed from lack of maintenance?) 2022, when the President was in town in Pittsburg and the bridge there collapsed. reply Jtsummers 16 hours agorootparentprev> when was the last time you read about a bridge that collapsed from lack of maintenance? 2022. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fern_Hollow_Bridge reply patmorgan23 17 hours agorootparentprevCode that changes introduces new bugs, new bugs can be new security issues. A lower velocity would hopefully mean less changes but higher quality, more thoroughly tested changes. reply Arainach 17 hours agorootparentprevLet's start by fixing the language. It's not stagnation, it's predictability. Civil and mechanical engineering are not static fields. They come up with new materials, new methods, new ideas. They have tooling to understand the impact of a proposed change and standard ways to test and validate things. It is much easier to predict how long it will take to both design and build things. These are all good things. We would all benefit from fewer cryptoAI startups and frameworks of the week and more robust toolchains tested and evolved over decades. reply rockemsockem 17 hours agorootparentWhy do you think such wrong things about civil and mechanical engineering. Tell me about all the on time and under budget civil/mechanical engineering projects that are happening. Do you think that just because they have physics to lean on that they can just like press solve and have accurate estimates spit out? Edit: I totally agree that more long-lived battle tested software toolchains and libraries would be great though reply mckn1ght 16 hours agorootparentHow do you know things wouldn’t be much much worse if there were no standards for being a civil/structural engineer or architect that have been refined over long periods of time? Imagine municipalities taking the lowest bids by far thrown out there by any rando that decided they can make a few bucks by welding together the supports for a bridge or designing a really interesting building that will just cave in on itself a decade hence. reply webmaven 2 hours agorootparentIt's not common anymore (like, in the past three decades), but \"taking the lowest bid from some rando\" is definitely still a thing. reply rockemsockem 13 hours agorootparentprevThere are tons of physical engineers working on safety critical hardware that are not required to have some BS piece of paper that says they're safe. You do not need a credential to work on EV charging infrastructure, rockets, crew capsules to ferry astronauts to the ISS, or many, many other things. That's how you know, because those fields are not less safe. It's an easy comparison. reply mckn1ght 2 hours agorootparent> work on EV charging infrastructure Could you expand on that? Are you saying that you don’t need a licensed electrician to connect a new EV charging terminal at installation time? reply Arainach 17 hours agorootparentprevSuch delays are overwhelmingly political, not engineering.

And this particular document will never be up to date. SWEBOK gets updated on the order of every 5-10 years, so it's always going to be dated. This is one reason it's a poor document for its purpose. If they want it to be relevant it needs to be continuously developed and updated. Hire active editors for the different \"knowledge areas\" (consider even losing that notion, it's very CMMI which is not something to aspire to) and solicit contributions from practitioners to continuously add to, remove from, correct, and amend the different sections. Build out the document they actually want instead of wasting 5-10 years publishing an updated, but still out-of-date, document. reply nradov 15 hours agorootparentI think you missed the purpose of the SWEBOK. It is intended to cover basic fundamentals which don't change much decade by decade. Not the latest JavaScript framework or whatever. Just about everything in the previous version from 2014 is still relevant today. reply Jtsummers 14 hours agorootparentThey took 10 years since v3 (over 20 if we count from the start) to include security in their discussions. This is my primary issue with the text: It should be a living document. Choosing a dead document or \"mostly dead\" if we're generous (with a new version every decade) for a body of knowledge that is constantly growing and developing makes no sense. If you want to publish it as a PDF that's ok, but it needs continuous updates, not decadal updates. In 2014 Agile barely got a passing mention in the book, 13 years after the term had come into existence and a decade after it had already made major waves in software engineering (many of the concepts that fell under Agile were also already published in the 1990s or earlier and barely mentioned or not mentioned). OOP gets a more substantive section in the 2024 version than the 2014 version when OOP languages had been out for decades before the 2014 one was published. In their added chapter on security they don't even have references for any of section 6. All of these are things that can be addressed by making it a living document. Update it more regularly so it's actually relevant instead of catching up on ideas from 2009 in 2024 (DevOps as a term dates at least back that far) or ideas from the 1960s and 1970s (OOP) in 2024. Practitioners are better off reading Wikipedia than this document. It's more comprehensive, more up to date, and has more references they can use to follow up on topics than this book does. reply eacapeisfutuile 14 hours agorootparentprevI don’t think anyone mentioned JavaScript frameworks. Yes everything is perpetually relevant if it is made generic enough, but it is harder to be actionable and truly useful. reply eacapeisfutuile 15 hours agorootparentprevThat made me curious, is there a changelog somewhere on changes between editions? reply Jtsummers 15 hours agorootparenthttps://www.computer.org/education/bodies-of-knowledge/softw... - shows a comparison of the TOCs of version 3 (2014) and version 4 (2024).

As every touch of his hand, every heave of his shoulder, every move of his feet, every thrust of his knee — zip! zoop! He slithered the knife along with a zing, and all was in perfect rhythm, as though he were performing the dance of the Mulberry Grove or keeping time to the Jingshou music. “Ah, this is marvelous!” said Lord Wenhui. “Imagine skill reaching such heights!” Cook Ding laid down his knife and replied, “What I care about is the Way, which goes beyond skill. When I first began cutting up oxen, all I could see was the ox itself. After three years I no longer saw the whole ox. And now — now I go at it by spirit and don’t look with my eyes. Perception and understanding have come to a stop and spirit moves where it wants. I go along with the natural makeup, strike in the big hollows, guide the knife through the big openings, and following things as they are. So I never touch the smallest ligament or tendon, much less a main joint. “A good cook changes his knife once a year — because he cuts. A mediocre cook changes his knife once a month — because he hacks. I’ve had this knife of mine for nineteen years and I’ve cut up thousands of oxen with it, and yet the blade is as good as though it had just come from the grindstone. There are spaces between the joints, and the blade of the knife has really no thickness. If you insert what has no thickness into such spaces, then there’s plenty of room — more than enough for the blade to play about it. That’s why after nineteen years the blade of my knife is still as good as when it first came from the grindstone. “However, whenever I come to a complicated place, I size up the difficulties, tell myself to watch out and be careful, keep my eyes on what I’m doing, work very slowly, and move the knife with the greatest subtlety, until — flop! the whole thing comes apart like a clod of earth crumbling to the ground. I stand there holding the knife and look all around me, completely satisfied and reluctant to move on, and then I wipe off the knife and put it away.” “Excellent!” said Lord Wenhui. “I have heard the words of Cook Ding and learned how to care for life!” reply mbivert 20 hours agoparentI'm convinced slowing feeding students, and having them produce good low-level codebase(s) (e.g. OSs, compilers) is a great Way to \"holistically\" teach them CS, much better than what's happening usually. \"C is a razor-sharp tool\"! reply numbsafari 21 hours agoparentprevEven he admits, he had to start somewhere. reply pnathan 20 hours agorootparentThe Master might say something like this, if translated crudely - Software engineering is programming professionally, with a dialogue on quality. Everything else is details. The IEEE has been riding this horse for a very long time, in the face of very serious criticism (see the ACMs comments from a quarter century ago). The presentation of it is _not even wrong_. It reads like a mid level manager at a very old enterprise firm wrote out what important at their firm, and took no material care for other ways. The SWEBOK has been that way for as long as I can remember ( an aside: my experience of Software Engineering academia has been so deeply negative to the point I wrote the field off in 2013. Decoupled from reality, PM oriented, toy studies- irrelevant. The SWEBOK is an artifact of that world. I should dip back in... Maybe Google & MS Research have done the real work here...) There's a body of _practice_ that is mildly incidental. Most acronyms are fads. Lots of ephemeral technologies that only exist as painful grimaces. IE- CORBA- SOAP, etc... Project management and quality management are also essentially contingent. One company does this. One that. Waterfall here. Agile there. Whirlpool the other. What you're left with as non contingent and timeless is in the area of compilers, algorithms, etc. Which is not SWE at all.

You're supposed to be riding an ox. All this talk of oxen and horses got me curious about the PDF, so I went and took a look. It's really far worse than you've described. I couldn't stomach it for too long, but here's some highlights: (1) The first ~65 pages are about \"requirements gathering.\" Page 60 offers up this gem of insight: Priority = ((Value * (1 - Risk)) / Cost (2) The next hundreds of pages go through topics in sequence, like \"Architecture\" and \"Design\" (who knew they were different?). Naturally, \"Security\" is slapped on several hundred pages later. I couldn't make it through the whole PDF, in all honesty.

The ACM canceled its involvement for excellent reasons which are worth reading: https://web.archive.org/web/20000815071233/http://www.acm.or... It's probably also worth reading Dijkstra's assessment of the \"software engineering\" field (roughly coextensive with what the SWEBOK attempts to cover) from EWD1036, 36 years ago. > Software engineering, of course, presents itself as another worthy cause, but that is eyewash: if you carefully read its literature and analyse what its devotees actually do, you will discover that software engineering has accepted as its charter \"How to program if you cannot.\". https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/ewd10xx/EWD1036.PDF The ACM's criticisms, however, are much harsher and much more closely focused on the ill-conceived SWEBOK project. The IEEE's continued involvement calls the IEEE's own credibility and integrity into question—as do its continued opposition to open-access publishing and its recent history of publishing embarrassingly incompetent technical misinformation in IEEE Spectrum (cf., e.g., https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41593788, though there are many other examples). What is going on at IEEE? reply TrueDuality 21 hours agoparentWanted to call out the specific requirements for what the ACM wanted out of their participation in creating a core body of knowledge (from the linked reasoning): * It must reflect actual achievable good practice that ensures quality consistent with the stated interest; it is not that following such practices are guaranteed to produce perfect software systems, but rather that doing so can provide reasonably intuitive expectations of quality. * It must delineate roles among the participants in a software project. * It must identify the differential expertise of specialties within software engineering. * It must command the respect of the community. * It must embrace change in each and every dimension of its definition; that is, it must be associated with a robust process for ensuring that it is continually updated to account for the rapid change both in knowledge in software engineering and also in the underlying technologies. It then details exactly how SWEBOK fails to meet those (which all still seem to be relevant) and comes to the following scathing conclusion: Overall, it is clear that the SWEBOK effort is structurally unable to satisfy any substantial set of the requirements we identified for bodies of knowledge in software engineering, independent of its specific content. I haven't read the SWEBOK but some spot checking and a review of the ToC seems to indicate they have not meaningfully taken that criticism into an account. reply nradov 15 hours agorootparentThe ACM's insistence on clearly delineated roles and specialties seems so bizarre and misguided. Having defined roles necessarily implies some rigidity in allowed process and organizational structure, which seems out of scope for an engineering body of knowledge. If you insist on defined roles then you end up with something like Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) or Large Scale Scrum (LeSS). Which aren't necessarily bad methodologies if you're running a huge enterprise with a complex product portfolio and need to get productive work out of mediocre resources. But not good approaches for other types of organizations. The SWEBOK, for better or worse, largely steers clear of those issues. reply kragen 5 hours agorootparentThis is actually a general problem with the SWEBOK: it isn't an engineering body of knowledge. It's a set of management practices like the ones you describe. It doesn't steer clear of those issues, at all. reply nradov 4 hours agorootparentOnly a small fraction of the SWEBOK covers management practices and it doesn't dictate any particular methodology. Competent engineers might not need to do management but they have to understand at least the basics of the management context in which they operate. reply kragen 1 hour agorootparentI agree with your second sentence, but your first sentence is pretty profoundly incorrect. Each of its 413 pages is divided into two columns. I generated a random sample of 10 page numbers associated with column numbers as follows: >>> import random >>> r = random.SystemRandom() >>> [(r.randrange(1, 414), r.randrange(1, 3)) for i in range(10)] [(299, 1), (164, 2), (292, 1), (246, 2), (205, 2), (113, 1), (167, 2), (393, 2), (16, 1), (129, 2)] Page 299/413 column 1 contains: part of a confused description of mathematical optimization in the sense of finding infima, incorrectly conflating it with space-time tradeoffs in software, which is at least a software engineering topic; and the beginning of a section about \"multiple-attribute decision making\", which is almost entirely about the kinds of decision-making done by corporate management. Though software design is given lip service, if you dig into the two particular \"design\" approaches they mention, they turn out to be about corporate management again, with concerns such as brainstorming sessions, identifying business cost drivers, staff headcount, presenting ideas to committees, etc. Conclusion: project management, not software engineering. Page 164/413 (6-12) column 2 is about corporate operations (for which telemetry can be used), corporate operational risk management, and automating operational tasks to improve corporate efficiency. Conclusion: project management, not software engineering. Page 292/413 (15-3) column 1 is about software engineering economics, specifically proposals and cash flow. Project management, not software engineering. Page 246/413 (11-12) is a table summarizing chapter 11, which contains both project management and software engineering elements. I'm going to eliminate this point from the sample as being too much work to summarize fully and too hard to avoid interpretation bias. Page 205/413 (9-13) column 2 is about software engineering management issues such as the difficulty of estimation, the project risks posed by the rate of change of the underlying technology, metrics for managing software, and what software organizational engineering managers should know. Project management, not software engineering. Page 113/413 (4-14) column 1 is about what a platform standard is, TDD, and DevOps. Mostly software engineering, not project management. Page 113/413 (6-15) is another summary table page similar to page 246, so I'm eliminating it too. Page 393/413 (A-5) column 2 is about the SWEBOK itself and the documents it draws from and contains no information about either project management or software engineering. Page 16/413 (xv) is part of the table of contents, so I'm eliminating it as well. Page 129/413 (5-12) column 2 is about random testing (software engineering), \"evidence-based software engineering\" (an utterly vapid section which contains no information about software engineering, project management, or anything else, as far as I can tell), and test cases that force exceptions to happen (software engineering). Conclusion: software engineering, not project management. So of the seven non-eliminated randomly sampled half-pages in the document, four are about project management, two are about software engineering, and the seventh is just about the SWEBOK. I guess my declaration that it's just a set of management practices was incorrect. It's only mostly a set of management practices. It's not at all only a small fraction. reply nradov 27 minutes agorootparentYour analysis doesn't support your claim. Just to point out one basic flaw, real engineering always has to account for financial realities including cash flow as a constraint or optimization parameter. I don't think you even understand what software engineering is. If we want to limit the discussion to just software development as a craft and take out the engineering aspects then you might have a point, but that's not what the SWEBOK is about. And in fairness, most real world software projects can produce good enough results without applying real engineering practices.

I understand the importance of learning formal methods (discrete math, logic, algorithms, etc.), but they are not nearly enough to help someone get started with a software project and succeed at it. So, if not \"software engineering\", then what should we teach to a student who is going to be thrown into the software world as it exists in its current form? reply kragen 5 hours agorootparentMaybe if developing large-scale software starting with the formal methods we have today is just a fantasy—and that's plausible—we shouldn't be trying to formalize \"software engineering\". Imagine trying to formalize medicine before Pasteur, motor engineering before Carnot, mechanical engineering before Reuleaux, or structural engineering before Galileo. Today, we do have relevant bodies of formal knowledge that are enough to help someone get started with a project in those areas and succeed at it. As you say, that knowledge doesn't exist yet for software. So what would you teach an architect in 01530 or a mechanical engineer in 01850? In addition to the relatively sparse formal knowledge that did exist, you'd make them study designs that are known to have worked, you'd apprentice them to currently successful master architects or mechanical engineers, and you'd arrange for their apprenticeship to give them experience doing the things people already do know how to do. reply numbsafari 21 hours agorootparentprevSince we’re talking Dijkstra, perhaps “structured programming” is a starting place. reply nradov 15 hours agorootparentprevFormal methods have advanced enough now that any competent software engineer should know that it is at least an option. It's obviously not practical or necessary to apply everywhere but in any sufficiently large piece of software there are likely a few modules where applying formal methods would allow for faster, higher quality delivery at lower cost. Making those trade-offs and selecting appropriate approaches is the fundamental essence of engineering as a profession. reply Niksko 22 hours agoparentprevVery interesting. Particularly their notion (paraphrasing) that SWEBOK attempts to record generally recognised knowledge in software engineering while excluding knowledge about more specific subdomains of software. That over-deference towards general knowledge coupled with some sort of tie to a similar Australian effort probably explains why the software engineering degree I began in Australia felt like a total waste of time.

More HR handbook than blood-red manual. For example, project management. The book covers this but does the usual wrong headed way of imagining there are executives with clear eyed Vision and lay down directives. This is of course not how most projects in most companies are started. It’s a mess - reality impinges on the organisation, pain and loss and frustration result in people making fixes and adjustments. Some tactical fixes are put in place, covered by “business as usual”, usually more than one enthusiastic manager thinks their solution will be the best, and a mixture of politics and pragmatism results in a competition to be the one project that will solve the problem and get the blessed budget. By the time there is an official project plan, two implementations exist already, enough lessons learnt that the problem is easily solved, but with sufficient funding all that will be abandoned and have to be rebuilt from scratch - and at a furious pace to meet unrealistic expectations that corners will be cut leading … That manual needs to be written. reply epolanski 19 hours agorootparentYou know that you could be speaking about mining operations or building highways in your post rather than software and everything would apply the same? I really don't see the argument against the book here in your comment. reply kragen 4 hours agorootparentThere are three absolutely key differences here. The first is that, if you get a four-year college degree in mining or civil engineering, you will not spend much of those four years studying management practices; you will spend it studying geology, the mechanical properties of rocks and soil, hydrology (how water flows underground), and existing designs that are known to work well. You probably will not build a mine or a highway, but you will design many of them, and your designs will be evaluated by people who have built mines and highways. The second is related to why you will not build a mine or highway in those four years: those are inherently large projects that require a lot of capital, a lot of people, and at least months and often decades. Mining companies don't have to worry about getting outcompeted by someone digging a mine in their basement; even for-profit toll highway operators similarly don't have to worry about some midnight engineer beating them to market with a hobby highway he built on the weekends. Consequently, it never happens that the company has built two highways already by the time there is an official project plan, and I am reliably informed that it doesn't happen much with mines either. The third is that the value produced by mining operations and highways are relatively predictable, as measured by revenue, even if profits are not guaranteed to exist at all. I don't want to overstate this; it's common for mineral commodity prices and traffic patterns to vary by factors of three or more by the time you are in production. By contrast, much software is a winner-take-all hits-driven business, like Hollywood movies. There's generally no way that adding an extra offramp to a highway or an extra excavator to a mine will increase revenue by two orders of magnitude, while that kind of thing is commonplace in software. That means that you win at building highways and mining largely by controlling costs, which is a matter of decreasing variance, while you win at software by \"hitting the high notes\", which is a matter of increasing variance. So trying to run a software project like a coal mine or a highway construction project is a recipe for failure. reply fragmede 19 hours agorootparentprevYou seem to have quite a bit of lived experience with that particular version of project management.

It’s been around for a while and represents a formal, structured, and rigid approach to software development. Historically, it reflects the 1990s era, when waterfall was the preferred method, and there was a push to make software engineering a licensed profession. At the time, we were also in a “software crisis” where large, expensive projects with extensive documentation and formalized planning often failed. Today, we have quicker releases, faster feedback, and more direct user communication (what we now call extreme programming or agile). However, this has also led to too much cowboy programming.

All in all it looks like a dictionary/checkbox built by a comittee rather than a consistent perspective on software.

The programs must be thoroughly tested for various types of inputs (valid data sets, invalid data sets and boundary value data sets) and conditions to identify these errors. Once identified, runtime errors are easy to fix. Embarrassing horseshit. reply dustfinger 22 hours agoparent> or tries to access a library I had to open the PDF and find this line to confirm. It really says that. It reads as if claiming that any program that accesses a library will then have a runtime error. That is obviously not what they intended, but I have read it over a few times now and cannot see another interpretation. reply TrueDuality 22 hours agorootparentThat line is referring to shared libraries linked to a dynamic executable. If a shared library isn't installed or available you will receive an error similar to the following: $ ./main ./main: error while loading shared libraries: librandom.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory Which is indeed a runtime error. There is also the common use case of hot-reloading compiled code which dynamically loads and unloads shared libraries without restarting the entire application. It needs to be done carefully but you've likely used an application that does this. Failure to load a library, or loading an incompatible one will also create a runtime error. Looks like there is a lot of bad generalizations in here, but they are technically correct on this one. reply dustfinger 21 hours agorootparentI understand that is what they meant, but it is not what they wrote. They should have qualified the statement as you did, with the conditions that yield a runtime error. Even if they generalized those conditions that would have been fine. for example: or tries to access a library that it is unable to for some reason without handling the resulting error. reply eacapeisfutuile 17 hours agorootparentSo… most likely it is a “typo” or edit-mistake or similar.

So not having it is an unexpected condition. reply stonemetal12 21 hours agorootparentprevPerhaps if they said \"tries and fails to access a library\". Merely attempting to access (possibly successfully) a library is not an error. reply prewett 20 hours agoparentprevI suppose, yeah, when I figure out the exact reason why the error occurred, fixing it is often easy. The finding, however, can often take a long time, which leaves me feeling \"once you have driven across the continent, finding your desired endpoint is a quick process\". \"Once constructed, installing the door on your new house is a simple and easy task\". Well, sure, if you take out the time-consuming parts, it's quick and easy. Except for all those runtime errors where the fix required major refactoring, or the problem is in a third party library, the OS, or some other unchangeable component. reply wakawaka28 19 hours agoparentprevWhat exactly is wrong with it? That is a definition fit for someone who does not have prior knowledge of what a runtime error is. It might be boring to us, and I might word it a little different, but it's fine. reply miffy900 18 hours agorootparentFor me it's the last sentence: \"Once identified, runtime errors are easy to fix.\" Well no not really - it depends on the issue; sometimes a solution isn't 'fixing' it, sometimes choosing what to do next after identifying the root cause is it's own task. Maybe it's working around it, like amending the return value with amended data, or patching the API itself by wrapping it in an intermediate API and swallowing exceptions. Guidance on addressing runtime errors should never presuppose that 'fixing' it will be easy - it will always depend on the context. Just get rid of that last sentence and it's a better statement. Imagine instead it's for criminal defense lawyers: re-word it to be advice for attorneys defending their client against a prosecution. \"Once [all exculpatory evidence against your client] is identified, defending them against a guilty verdict is easy to do\" It sounds like it's written by someone who has never practiced in the real world. reply wakawaka28 17 hours agorootparentI think it should say runtime errors \"are usually easy to fix\" because they are usually a result of simple logical errors or technical issues. But you're right, it does not account for all possibilities. reply kragen 2 hours agorootparentprevA lot of things are wrong with it. > Runtime errors surface when a program runs into an unexpected condition or situation such as dividing by zero, This implicitly asserts that dividing by zero is always unexpected, that all runtime errors are unexpected, and that dividing by zero always causes a runtime error. None of these are true. Dividing by zero is very frequently not unexpected (it's utterly commonplace in 3-D graphics, for example, when a vertex happens to be in the camera's focal plane) and in floating-point math (standardized by, ironically, the IEEE) it doesn't generate runtime errors by default. Moreover, there are certain applications where runtime errors are also expected, such as in fuzzers. Some languages frequently use their runtime error mechanism to convey perfectly mundane conditions such as not finding a key in a hash table or coming to the end of a sequence. And it's fairly often a useful mechanism for terminating a recursive search procedure. > memory overflow, There's no such thing as a \"memory overflow\" on any platform I'm familiar with. This might have been intended to reference any of five things: stack overflows, buffer overflows, heap allocation failures, resource limit exhaustion, or OOM kills. The stack is an area of memory, and a \"stack overflow\" is an attempt to put too much data in it, usually due to an infinite recursive loop. Stack overflows do often get detected as runtime errors, but many platforms fail to detect them, causing incorrect program behavior instead. A buffer is also an area of memory (an array) and a \"buffer overflow\" is an attempt to put too much data in it, usually due to an omitted check on input data size. Buffer overflows do sometimes get detected as runtime errors, but often do not, because the most popular implementations of many popular programming languages (notably C, C++, and Pascal) do not do automatic bounds checking. Heap allocation failures are attempts to dynamically allocate memory that are denied, often because too much memory is already allocated, so in a sense your heap memory has \"overflowed\". Some programming languages handle this as a runtime error, but the most popular implementations of many popular programming languages (notably C, C++, and Pascal) do not. Resource limit exhaustion is a condition where a program exceeds operating-system-imposed limits on its usage of resources such as CPU time, output file size, or memory usage, in response to which the OS raises a runtime error. On Unix this manifests as killing the process with a signal. OOM kills are a Linux thing where the OS starts killing resource-intensive processes to attempt to recover from a memory overload condition that is degrading service badly. In a sense the computer's memory has \"overflowed\", so Unix's runtime error mechanism is pressed into service. (Something very similar happens if you press ^C, though, so describing this as a \"runtime error\" is maybe not defensible.) > or addressing a wrong or unauthorized memory location or device, The standard verb here would be \"accessing\", not \"addressing\", but I don't want to make too much of the use of nonstandard terminology; it's not always an indicator of unfamiliarity with the field. And there are indeed machines where there are kinds of \"wrong\" other than \"unauthorized\"—that's why we have SIGBUS, for unaligned access exceptions on CPUs that don't support unaligned access. But \"device\" is, as far as I know, wrong; I don't know of any platform which raises a runtime error when you try to access the wrong device. There are a number of platforms that have I/O instructions which will raise a runtime error if you try to use them in unprivileged code, but that doesn't depend on which device you're accessing. Usually in small microcontrollers there isn't any kind of runtime-error mechanism, and when there is, it generally isn't invoked for I/O instructions. Sometimes you can set up the MPU so that certain code can't access devices—when they're memory-mapped, in which case \"memory location\" would have covered the case. Even if there is some platform where it's possible to get a runtime error accessing the wrong device, it's far from the kind of common case you'd want to include in such an abbreviated list of typical causes of runtime errors \"for someone who does not have prior knowledge of what a runtime error is\". Much more typical would be illegal instructions, attempts to access privileged state from unprivileged code, null pointer dereferences, runtime type errors such as ClassCastException, and array bounds violations, none of which are mentioned. It seems like someone who doesn't know anything about software was trying to imagine what kinds of things might, in theory, cause runtime errors, but the kinds of protection mechanisms they imagined were completely different from the ones used in actual existing computers. > or when a program tries to perform an illegitimate or unauthorized operation As a simple matter of logic, this subsumes the previous item, and \"illegitimate\" in this context means the same thing as \"unauthorized\". So this list is not just comprehensively wrong at a technical level, but also so badly written as to be incoherent. > or tries to access a library, for example. This is completely wrong. Of course a program can get a runtime error when it tries to load a library, just as it can get a runtime error when it undertakes any other task, but there is no platform that raises a runtime error whenever you try to access a library. > The programs must be thoroughly tested for various types of inputs (valid data sets, invalid data sets and boundary value data sets) and conditions to identify these errors. This statement, in itself, only contains a couple of slight factual errors. First, it says that the inputs to programs are data sets. This is probably something that someone who doesn't know anything about software copied from a 60-year-old textbook, because at that time, the inputs to programs were data sets (now more commonly known as files). In fact, the more important inputs to programs nowadays are things such as user interactions, data received over a network, and data received in real time from sensors such as microphones, oxygen sensors, and accelerometers. But this statement is stuck in punched-card land, where programs punched into card decks ran in batch mode to process some input data sets and produce some output data sets. The second factual error is that it implies that runtime errors result primarily from inputs and how the program responds to them. And, of course, there are runtime errors that are determined by the program's handling of inputs; typically type errors, null pointer exceptions, array bounds violations, etc., can be reproduced if you run the program again with the same input. But large classes of runtime errors do not fit this profile. Some are errors that depend on internal nondeterminism in the program, such as nondeterministic interactions between different threads (we would say \"scheduler interleaving order\" back in the single-core days), or nondeterministic timing. Others depend on runtime conditions like how much memory is available to allocate or how full the disk is (writing to a full disk in Python raises an exception, though not in many other languages). Others result from hardware problems such as overheating. The statement does, in passing, say \"and conditions\", but these are given short shrift. The much bigger problem with this statement, though, is that it's in the middle of a paragraph about runtime errors. But everything it says is equally applicable to logic errors, the subject of the next paragraph; indeed, much of it is more applicable to logic errors. Putting it in the middle of this paragraph misleadingly implies that things like testing with invalid input files (or the other, more important, invalid inputs it failed to mention) are uniquely or primarily applicable to runtime errors. > Once identified, runtime errors are easy to fix. This statement is also wrong in a multidimensional way. First, although this is in the \"debugging\" section, many runtime errors aren't bugs at all. A program crashing with a MemoryError or OutOfMemoryError when it is run with insufficient memory available to allocate is, in general, desired behavior. It's also often the desired behavior when it's applied to a too-large input, though obviously that's not acceptable for games or avionics software. The same is true of permission errors, out-of-disk-space errors, etc. These are specifically the kind of runtime errors that most commonly result from the \"and conditions\" in the previous sentence. Second, while it's usually easier to debug a segfault or exception than silently incorrect output, it is often far from trivial to track down the runtime error to its ultimate cause. Third, even when you have figured out what the ultimate cause is, fixing it is sometimes not easy, for example because other people's deployed software depends on interfaces you have to change, or more generally because it is difficult to understand what other problems could be caused by the possible fixes you are considering. By my count, that's 12 significant factual errors in 86 words, an average of 7.2 words per error. This is an error density that would be impressive in any contexts, although I've occasionally seen expert liars exceed it somewhat. In the context of an official publication purporting to establish standards for professional competence, it's utterly horrifying. So this is not a definition fit for anyone, least of all someone who does not have prior knowledge of what a runtime error is; it is very far from being fine. It's embarrassing horseshit. And it's not just this one paragraph. Virtually the entire document is like this. Occasionally you'll find a paragraph that's mostly correct from beginning to end, but then it'll be followed by the cringiest idiocy you can possibly imagine in the very next paragraph. With respect to this paragraph in particular, an even worse problem than its unreliability is emphasis. This is from §4.6, \"Debugging\", which is 189 words, about a quarter of p. 16-13 (p. 326/413). Debugging is arguably the central activity of software engineering; about a quarter of the effort† spent on software engineering is spent on debugging, an amount which would be larger if we didn't spend so much effort on avoiding debugging (for example, with type systems, unit tests, version control, and documentation). Any actual software engineering body of knowledge would be largely concerned with knowledge about debugging. But the IEEE relegates it to 0.2% of their document. ______ † in https://www.quora.com/In-a-typical-software-engineering-comp...

It reminds me of the phrase \"If all you have is a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a nail..\" But in the case of a thick design patterns book, it amounts to giving the junior dev a whole toolbox... The junior dev tends to assume that every problem they'll ever face requires them to use one of the tools from that toolbox... But reality isn't so neat; you rarely use a specific tool in its native form as it's described. They are conceptual tools which need to be adapted to various situations and they are only really useful in highly complex scenarios which can often be avoided entirely. The one piece of advice which is closest to 'universal' which I can give about software development is this: \"You should be able to walk through and describe any feature provided by your code using plain English, in such a way that a non-technical listener would gain a complete understanding of what the code is doing but without having to dive into functions whose implementation details would exceed the listener's mental capabilities.\" When someone talks me through some feature they developed and they start jumping around 10 different files 80% of which have technical names which they invented and they keep having to define new concepts just to explain what the code is doing at a high level; this is a red flag. It shows that their code is over-engineered and that they haven't fully made sense of what they're doing in their own mind. My philosophy is basically a variant of \"Rubber duck debugging\" as proposed in the book \"The Pragmatic Programmer\" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas... But you imagine the duck to have the intellect and knowledge of a non-technical middle-manager, and you use the approach during design and development; not just debugging. reply aste123 20 hours agoprev [–] Yes reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
