It sounds like it's a resourcing issue, not a change in philosophy. It doesn't change the fact that it won't be happening though. reply toomuchtodo 19 hours agoparent> It sounds like it's a resourcing issue, not a change in philosophy. Yes. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41920127 (\"HN: The Forest Service Is Losing 2,400 Jobs–Including Most of Its Trail Workers\") Relevant comment by S201: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41922195 \"The overall Forest Service budget has indeed been increasing, but it's nearly all going to wildfire fighting. I recently wrote about the state of forest road funding and went in depth on this here: https://ephemeral.cx/2024/09/losing-access-to-the-cascades > Overall, in 1995 16% of the Forest Service budget was dedicated to wildfires. By 2015 it was 52% and by 2025 it’s projected to be upwards of 67%. Without large amounts of additional funding it is virtually guaranteed that the Forest Service’s budget will continue to be siphoned away by firefighting needs.\" reply Ajedi32 3 hours agorootparentDon't \"prescribed burns\" fall under the category of firefighting? That's the whole reason you do controlled burns in the first place, right? To prevent a larger fire later? reply leeter 3 hours agorootparentSadly no, and (IANAL) the law here is clear AFAIK. Money cannot be spent outside of what it was allocated. Firefighting I'm given to understand explicitly excludes prevention. This might be one of the most short sighted budget allocations I've ever seen. As a dollar spent on prevention easily covers 10 on fighting. reply JumpCrisscross 19 hours agorootparentprevCan the Forest Service make this up with use fees? Like, could California pay the Forest Service to take care of its land surrounded by California? reply akira2501 18 hours agorootparentI think the issue is that it's federal land. They would just have to authorize California to do it on their behalf. reply solardev 3 hours agorootparentHere in Oregon (and elsewhere), we have multi-agency partnerships between governments, different federal agencies, local tribes, homeowners, etc.: https://www.conservationgateway.org/ConservationPractices/Fi... https://firenetworks.org/ I'm not sure how it works in California, but wildfires don't really care about our jurisdictional boundaries... reply scythe 18 hours agorootparentprevIt could possibly be managed by the state by placing a tax on fire insurance which would basically be a workaround to Proposition 13. That would probably be about as popular as a Chinese \"weather\" balloon but it does have a certain poetry of having the people who use the forest — by living in it — pay to manage it. reply bragr 17 hours agorootparentThe fire insurance that is unaffordable or just straight not available anymore to those same people? reply crooked-v 16 hours agorootparentIf the fire insurance is just straight not available, that is probably because people should not be living there. reply bragr 29 minutes agorootparent>people should not be living there How do people afford to move and start new lives when you can't sell your property because it is uninsurable? reply rrix2 0 minutes agorootparentperhaps we should not treat systemic social failure as individuals' responsibility to resolve on their own without support of the State jdasdf 10 hours agorootparentprevThere is only one reason why insurance straight up isn't available somewhere, and the reason is regulation. I can assure you that no matter how high the risk of fire, insurers will be willing to provide insurance on that so long as they are legally allowed to charge the appropriate premiums. reply Aeolun 8 hours agorootparentThat would be the part of the grandparent where the other option is ‘unaffordable’ yes? reply jjk166 2 hours agorootparentprevNo one is going to spend $10 a month to insure a paper plate. If no one is going to buy a policy, it doesn't make sense to have the infrastructure in place to sell that policy. Thus no one offers insurance policies on paper plates. reply bell-cot 5 hours agorootparentprev> There is only one reason why... Not true. Assume for the moment that you're the CEO of Golden Insurance Co., and you're still writing fire insurance policies in Burn County, CA. After Yet Another massive fire - and loads of \"100% loss\" payouts - from your balance sheet - the experts in your Risk Estimating Dept. say the premium to insure a $600K house in Burn Co. needs to be $200K/year - because they expect to pay out to replace that house ($600K) every 4 year ($150K/year), and they need the other $50K for overhead and temp. relocation benefits and rebuilding-cost inflation and a bit of hedge - just in case they're wrong, and things burn down even more often. Now - if the fire insurance for a $600K house costs $200K/year, how many of the homeowners can and will actually pay that much for fire insurance? Perhaps a number that's falling like a rock? Meanwhile, Wall St. is howling about the horrible risk that your balance sheet is facing, if there's another big fire season. And the 99% of homeowners who can't afford those premiums are bitterly angry, and in a mood to string up the bearer of bad news (meaning you) from the highest tree still standing. SO - why wouldn't you, as CEO, make the unfortunate decision to just stop writing fire insurance policies for properties in Burn Co., CA? reply scythe 16 hours agorootparentprevMost California landowners are hardly poor. We're talking about a state with more than double the GDP per capita of Japan. And the property taxes are in some cases among the cheapest in the world. We're talking about just over a million homes in fire zones, while the total budget for the Forest Service is about $10 billion per annum. That's $10k per year per house to fund the financial equivalent of the entire Forest Service — for roughly a third the rent I pay on a studio apartment in Bergen County. I'll try to find a small enough violin for these landowners. Yes, there are some people who are asset-rich and liquidity poor, but we are not talking about West Virginia. Effective fire prevention will also make fire insurance cheaper and reducing development in fire-prone areas will reduce the cost of forest management. reply WalterBright 16 hours agorootparentCalifornia has already taxed everything that can be taxed, and raised taxes to the point that further tax increases are likely to result in a decline in tax revenue. reply shkkmo 10 hours agorootparentprevI'm a little consfused what point you are trying to make with those numbers. I don't get how comparing the nation budget of the USFS against homes in California on fire zones is an argument for anything. California spends a roughly an order of magnitude more per acre they are responsible for, when compared with the USFS so I don't think underspending by California is the issue here. The problem seems to be the lack of authority for CalFire to manage fire risk on federal land. reply seadan83 13 hours agorootparentprevWere the camp fire or the town of paradise burning down counter examples to your points? IIRC those were not terribly wealthy towns. Could you clarify? Second, how do you know it is just one million homes? I'm interested to learn more there reply pkaye 19 hours agorootparentprevThey can use the lumber fees from the forests to pay for the cost. reply hwestbrook 2 hours agorootparentThis would be true if the federal allowed more than a nominal amount of logging. Most trees and logs come from private land. See page 8: https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45688 reply m0llusk 17 hours agorootparentprevThat is much more complicated than it appears. Cutting and transporting trees is not easy or free, and there is already a huge glut of wood caused by the die off from phytophthera.

Most wood, particularly from die offs, is curvy branches that may be useful when ground up for wood based products like pellets, MDF, or paper. reply wbl 19 hours agorootparentprevNot without Congress doing something to enable it. reply JumpCrisscross 18 hours agorootparent> Not without Congress doing something to enable it Why? We played with the farfetched hypothetical of California unilaterally acting on federal land. But if the Forest Service says “come on in” and they do, I’m struggling to see who would face any real consequences given the Congress’s power of the purse isn’t being touched. reply wbl 18 hours agorootparentOP is talking about CA paying money to the park service. Different than them handing over a license to burn. reply JumpCrisscross 17 hours agorootparent> OP is talking about CA paying money to the park service Sure. I don’t see how the Congress stops that if the USFS (not Parks) and Sacramento strike a deal. reply jwlake 18 hours agorootparentprevIf they stopped funding that completely it would halt the problem. Fire is part of nature. reply akira2501 18 hours agorootparentSo is death. Interestingly we've responded by trying to minimize it where rational. Part of preventing fire is preventing death. Fires also shut down roads which can be a major problem where alternative routes don't exist. A wholesale \"do not prescribed burn\" is not sensible. Determining which areas are high and low value and then concentrating what resources you have on the highest value areas is. reply jwlake 18 hours agorootparentNo my point is stop overfunding firefighting. Over fund forest management. reply irjustin 18 hours agorootparentAt the risk of being an idiot, is the problem firefighting? Is the problem that we're continuing a losing battle? That, even when we had proper forest management, the costs were still shifting towards firefighting? Warming making everything drier on average? In the end though the only one we're truly hurting is ourselves and our desired life style when it burns out of control. reply jwlake 17 hours agorootparentFirefighting makes the next fire worse. You need to have a theory that doesn't involve more expensive fire fighting every time someone builds a new house. This is general means defending towns and letting the mountainside burn. reply ethbr1 17 hours agorootparentThis is an insurance problem more than anything else. If insurers were allowed to and incentivized to price accurately, homes in dangerous areas (flood plains, fire hazards) would be too expensive to buy, and people... wouldn't. Especially given that if you can't get insurance, you can't get a mortgage, which drastically limits your buyers. reply jwlake 17 hours agorootparentI 100% agree with that, but the way pricing works is generally not sufficiently granular. You either get underpriced government backed plans, or a plan that does not take into account your actual circumstances. Eventually sufficient big data might be able to solve the pricing problem. Defensible construction will have cheap insurance and indefensible buildings will not be economically insurable. The problem is insurance is by county (lol) or by \"city\". Neither work in CA mountains. reply fn-mote 16 hours agorootparent> the way pricing works is generally not sufficiently granular Is this caused by regulations or the insurers approach? Genuinely ignorant here. reply WalterBright 16 hours agorootparentprevLegislation generally opposes granular insurance policies, as it is discrimination. reply ethbr1 14 hours agorootparentBut in the case of home insurance, unlike health, people actually have a choice: build there or do it somewhere else. Artificially forcing blended home insurance rates lessens the pricing signal that this particular area might be too risky to build in. At the end of the day, it's developers and the city/county making money while offloading the risk to insurance companies and government mortgage buyers. reply WalterBright 13 hours agorootparentThere have been endless lawsuits by homeowners alleging discrimination in their insurance rates. All this impairs granular risk assessment and insurance rates. A recent WSJ article was about lawsuits from homeowners who were quoted higher insurance rates because their roof was rotten and/or there were trees that could fall on their house. The same has happened with auto insurance rates (men and women have different accident rates, so used to have different rates), and, glaringly, medical insurance rates. reply amanaplanacanal 5 hours agorootparentMost medical insurance isn't really insurance, it's more prepaid health care. reply gottorf 2 hours agorootparentI've seen people asking why car insurance doesn't cover oil changes the same way dental insurance covers cleanings, so be careful what you wish for, I guess. reply nradov 17 hours agorootparentprevIs that even feasible? How exactly would firefighters defend towns from large wildfires. They can't cut an effective fire break around an entire town. reply jjk166 2 hours agorootparentThe cost of a fire break is proportional to the perimeter, the value is proportional to the area. reply jwlake 17 hours agorootparentprevThe bigger the town the easier it gets. Towns have roads and parking lots and cmu commercial buildings that are mostly non-flammable. They also have water supplies and logistics infrastructure. Centralized defense is very feasible. Mountain roads and poor communications cause an underutilization of resources. reply nradov 2 hours agorootparentThat doesn't seem accurate. Commercial buildings aren't necessarily in the outskirts of town. And while the buildings themselves might be slightly more fire-resistant than typical wood frame houses, they're full of flammable materials. Look what happened with the Camp Fire in 2018. reply imoverclocked 18 hours agorootparentprevUnfortunately, it's not a binary tradeoff. reply seadan83 13 hours agorootparentprevYour point of stopping fire suppression has something to it. Though, 3 issues I see with complete disengagement: (1) there are whole towns that would burn down, avoidably so if some fires were not suppressed (2) modern fires are rangers and turn the landscape into Savannah. This is not necessary. Healthy forests would be fire resistant and more fires could just run their course (in other words, not suppressing fires can lead to CA forests being removed) (3) kinda related to (2), the wet/dry seasons creates a lot of burnabke grasses and bushes that pop up. Prescribed burns would tamp that down, giving forests more time to age and be fire resistant reply tacocataco 10 hours agorootparentprevThey're still going broke despite using prison labor to fight the fires? https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/31/us/prison-inmates-fight-calif... reply shkkmo 10 hours agorootparentThe state of California and its consevation core is not the USFS. reply Hilift 6 hours agoparentprevThe USFS (Department of Agriculture) never had enough resources. The amount of land is almost unprotectable: California: 20 million acres Idaho: 20 million Oregon: 16 million. Fighting fires really should be a state job. I think Idaho delivers much better results for resources spent, in areas that are more vulnerable. California is dysfunctional when it comes to multiple teams and agencies working together, and making decisions that could be controversial. I suspect USFS is relieved to interact less. reply billjings 19 hours agoparentprevThe real philosophy is in the budget. reply doctorpangloss 16 hours agorootparentTrees and empty land cost nothing.

The way we chose to do this is by saying it was PG&E's fault, and in exchange, PG&E gets to recoup those payments via permanently higher rates. It is a little complicated, but it isn't that complicated. The simple question is, should the government pay a safe home's price for a burnt down home? reply deepsun 11 hours agorootparentNo. Let owners exercise owner's responsibility (e.g. insurance, and if insurance is too expensive -- well, the risk is too high). PS: I heard the thing California does, however, is putting a cap on insurance premiums, so insurers just avoid some regions, and owners cannot find insurance to buy. It's kinda the same thing -- owner's responsibility. reply culi 18 hours agorootparentprevBad philosophy. Less prescribed burns mean more uncontrollable wildfires which means in the long term costs are even higher. Prescribed burns are expensive now because we haven't done them for so long. California banned the indigenous practice of cultural burns before it was even a state! But the more we work on restoring this practice the cheaper it'll be for everyone in the long term reply zo1 11 hours agorootparentEnshittification strikes again. In this case, fees and costs go down by virtue of being pushed out into the future as even higher costs as a result of lack of fees being paid now.

Bonus points if they tie it into Socialism/Communism because I'd bet there is a high degree of overlap between the two in terms of failure modes. reply culi 1 hour agorootparentThis comment is particularly funny because the neologism \"enshittification\" was coined by an outspoken anti-capitalist AS a criticism of capitalism reply mistrial9 4 hours agorootparentprevamazing mental gymnastics, describing how western-markets-failure-mode is directly tied to fictional-enemy-politics .

Through changes in the climate, anthropogenic climate change has the potential to alter fire dynamics. Here we compile satellite (19 and 32 years) and ground-based (90 years) burned area datasets, climate and weather observations, and simulated fuel loads for Australian forests. Burned area in Australia’s forests shows a linear positive annual trend but an exponential increase during autumn and winter. The mean number of years since the last fire has decreased consecutively in each of the past four decades, while the frequency of forest megafire years (>1 Mha burned) has markedly increased since 2000. The increase in forest burned area is consistent with increasingly more dangerous fire weather conditions, increased risk factors associated with pyroconvection, including fire-generated thunderstorms, and increased ignitions from dry lightning, all associated to varying degrees with anthropogenic climate change. The \"usual suspects\" here being the journal Nature publishing analysis of thirty-two years of satellite data and 90 years of ground-based datasets performed by Australia's national scientific body the CSIRO. Multi-decadal increase of forest burned area in Australia is linked to climate change, Nature, Nov 2021, https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-27225-4 https://www.csiro.au/en/news/all/news/2021/november/new-rese... reply twelve40 17 hours agorootparentThis is a very convenient global scapegoat for those responsible for mismanaging the forests here and now. Nobody is disputing these studies. But then Newsom comes out and instead if saying \"it's my fault for underinvesting in fire prevention, i will personally see that prevention (not just fighting) gets funded properly today\", he says \"too bad, it's all climate change's fault\", how does that look? reply defrost 17 hours agorootparentLanguage usage wise, something (or someone) is not a scapegoat if it shares responsibility. Has he come out and blamed everything on climate change and not invested in both prevention measures (better management, backburning, etc.) and fire fighting? That's poor policy regardless of underlying causes. Here in Australia there are multiple causes driving bushfires, the single largest cause related to frequency and intensity increases is far and away AGW. This doesn't result in Land Management agencies rolling up shop and giving up. reply amanaplanacanal 5 hours agorootparentprevNot sure what the governor has to do with the USFS. reply monomyth 16 hours agorootparentprevit looks like he is not fit for the office, which we know since his days in San Francisco :) reply _bin_ 17 hours agorootparentprevThis isn't actually a very good attribution to specifically anthropogenic global warming. But it is a decent one to anthropogenic factors broadly. The metaphor of laying a fire is quite literal here: if global warming increases the number of sparks, that's actually the smaller piece of the problem. The bigger one is mismanagement of forest and ecological disruption leading to more and bigger fires laid for those sparks to catch. My guess is there could be future impacts around the condition of forests that leads to susceptibility. Drought comes to mind as a serious risk. But a forest of dry trees is still a much harder environment for wildfires to form and spread than a forest of dry trees and no proper forestry to manage it. reply imoverclocked 18 hours agorootparentprev> ... to blame the conflagration on 'climate change' ...

Famously, Donald Trump initially said \"let it burn\" when prompted for what to do about California wildfires.

You could have just asked about rates of fires in other states and asked if it was a common problem. reply princearthur 9 hours agoprevCalifornia is in the middle of a huge fire insurance crisis. It started with the intentional housing supply restrictions that drove up property prices and rents. In suburban areas, rebuilding costs were mostly increased indirectly through higher wages (as tradespeople and laborers have to make rent.) This sent insurance rates through the roof and caused a wave of policy cancellations. Many insurance companies exited the market altogether [1]. Climate change is also to blame. The firestorms of 2017, 2018 and 2020 broke all records, and were insanely expensive to rebuild after. The typical trigger is a katabatic wind event [2] after a long dry spell. This massively reduces relative humidity (often to 5-10%,) making ignition much easier. Once a fire starts, the wind spreads it extremely quickly. Sustained wind speeds of 50-60mph are not uncommon near mountain peaks. In 2017/2018/2020, the precipitating events were so intense that the initial responses focused exclusively on helping the residents out. By the time the actual firefighting began, the fires were already enormous. It's surprising to me that we haven't seriously looked into large-scale sprinkler systems, such as this one deployed in Spain [3]. These could take a major bite out of the initial uncontrolled stage. They could either be deployed in the wild along naturally defensible lines, or at the perimeters of inhabited areas. They're expensive upfront, but not as expensive as the alternative. They might also reduce the need for prescribed burns. [1] https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/10/home...

This turned into a big wildfire in my area and they spent ~$100m putting it out. You may have been able to get away with burning during the summer in the 90's here, but not anymore. I'm not opposed to prescribed burns, either, I think they are totally necessary. But do them in the fall, when you've got nothing but rain and cool temperatures for the next 6 months, instead of weeks before the hottest and driest stretch of the year. As to why they burn in early summer, they said at a community meeting it's because it requires fewer people to manage the fire. reply Sn0wCoder 13 hours agoparentPrescribed burns do more than just burn up the dead wood to prevent forest fires. One of the other main goals is to kill invasive trees / plants while they are young. Doing burns in the fall after they have already spread their seeds for the next season would do nothing to prevent this. Another goal of spring burns is to stimulate the germination of specific tree species like the Giant Sequoia, Closed-cone coniferous, and some berry trees (maybe others). Most prescribed burns are done in early to late spring, not sure about summer burns. If the only goal is to prevent forest fires, then in theory you could just send a hoard of people in to gather up all the dead wood at the end of each season, pile it up and have some nice fall bonfires, which might be fun. The main issue is the terrain harsh and would be very time-consuming. reply seadan83 13 hours agorootparentTo your last paragraph - it's not just dead wood that is the issue - right? In CA, there is a lot of shrubbery that turns brown and grasses. Second, (west coast) forests that have not burned in a while look like a big brick of plant matter. Mostly living, dense, from ground to 30 feet high of plant matter that will combust when it is dry, windy, and a fire that is plenty hot to even burn the roots several feet deep. reply Sn0wCoder 3 hours agorootparentYou are correct that there is typically more to wildfires than dead wood, as in they typically start with dry pine needles, leaves, tall dry grasses, and spread quickly via slightly taller vegetation up to the trees. There is a science to when a prescribed burn can happen, and there are seasons that will not be right for any given location, so the burn is a no go. The conditions need to be just right (wind so it does not cross a highway / blow into a farmer’s livestock, humidity, time since last rain fall. This has a lot to do with the rate at which the fuel will burn. Fuel less than 0.25 inches will burn within an hour of the last rain and may burn for an hour after igniting. 0.25 – 1 inch 10-hour, 1 - 3 inch 100-hour, 3 – 8 1,000 hour. So, the smaller stuff burns quickly but may or may not start a larger hour fuel. Once the larger fuel starts is when it becomes a serious problem since now it’s hotter and hotter and eventually starts the living trees on fire. If you were to manually remove the 100 – 1000 hour fuels, some of which are dead trees still standing or held up by living trees (unable to fall / stuck sideways). The risk of an all-out forest fire starting would go down, but still not be zero (like you say in a drought / super dry conditions). In the end you can only reduce the risk, never eliminate it (short of clear cutting). reply JumpCrisscross 19 hours agoprev\"scenario shows what happens when Congress is less committed than California to tackling forest management. With wildfire management funding constantly tied up in unpredictable budget debates, the current state-federal partnership is fragile and based on the whims of the legislative and executive branches, which can withhold funding based on which political party is currently in power.

(The Biden administration increased the amount of logging in the last few years from a historic low. But the goal is still only to log up to 4 billion board feet next year.)

We clearcut all the ancient tress, so what's left is secondary growth. The huge old trees cut out the light reaching the forest floor, so there was less underbrush to burn. It absolutely did burn, regularly, but did little damage because the fire never got hot enough to burn the trees. But with the secondary growth, it's vulnerable to fire. So we have to burn it often to clear the fuel load before it gets too much. But there's a lot of opposition to this kind of preventative burning, and then the fuel load builds up until we get a monster bush fire, everything burns down, and it all has to start again. We need about 100 years with no major bush fires, and no logging, to regenerate the first-growth forest that evolved here.

Kat Anderson. I learned about this book here on HN and it has transformed the way I think about this topic. I particularly recommend the superb audiobook. Through a series of interviews, this book makes the case the practice of basketweaving by indigenous people living in present-day California - and the massive and well-organized trade of hundreds of different types of baskets - is/was not merely a mechanism of subsistence, but actually a brilliant wildfire control strategy. Anderson and her many stunning interview subjects - indigenous people recalling the practices of grandparents and their siblings - make a compelling case that by encouraging the hundreds of different species which went into the creation of baskets to grow in certain places and not others, ancestors sculpted the landscape into one in which fires burned out in predictable patterns rather than scorching a significant portion of the continent. reply Aloisius 18 hours agoparentEh. There's not much evidence that indigenous Californians were doing any kind of fire management in the California coniferous forests - which is largely what the US Forest Service manages and have been in the news for megafires. Indigenous Californians lived, overwhelmingly, in chaparral and grasslands near coastal areas and foothills rather far away. There is evidence that burns happened there (mostly burn scars in nearby coastal redwood forests, but also various written accounts by the Spanish). That said, an estimated 4.5-12% of California land burned annually prior to the Spanish getting here - so whatever wildfire management practices happened still resulted in far more land burning than today and months of smoke filled skies - which matches up with early written accounts. reply biorach 8 hours agorootparent> That said, an estimated 4.5-12% of California land burned annually prior to the Spanish getting here What's the source for that?

It's common enough for indigenous people to burn off dry grass ranges every year or two, often in chequered patterns to lessen the chances of wind picking up and fanning a full front across unburnt grasslands. That's likely the 10% referred to, repeated burning of grasslands along with the livable fringes and common paths of forrest areas. Add onto that \"natural\" fires from lightening strikes, etc. Some of these would start in ares with little human management and years of built up leaf litter leading to big burns that reduce large areas to ash on the ground and a few scattered trunks .. many would start in areas that have had fires in past five years or so and would result in \"cool burns\" through leaf litter, some tree trunk climbing, but essentially leave big trees standing and alive with clear floors for new growth. reply seadan83 12 hours agorootparentprevInteresting.

Tomato yields are a very small part of the price of ketchup. And ketchup prices in the U.K. also increased. Are U.K. supermarkets colluding with American supermarkets? Energy costs along with increased demand has a huge impact on prices. There are vast microeconomic factors but also macroeconomic factors as well. For instance, a declining economy (or more accurately, increased inflation ,) means that more people buy cheaper food. And most fast food features — ketchup. Higher demand + increased fuel costs + same sized harvests = higher ketchup prices. I am highly simplifying the ketchup market but the Democrat talking point of “supermarket collusion” is absolute nonsense and not based on any evidence. Supermarkets buy their products from distributors — do you know the price of ketchup from a distributor? If the distributor price remained exactly the same, and supermarkets operate on similar financial models, then the price at the shop will be very similar. That isn’t collusion, that’s how commodities get priced at the retail level. As far as the “billionaire class” — who gets rich from Chinese SOEs? (Hint, it isn’t the workers who are paid effectively slave wages with no recourse to move to another employer because those SOEs are, by the very definition of SOE, in collusion. The wealth inequality gap in China is massive. You have the Audi class, and the bicycle class — and not much in the middle. The other interesting factor about Chinese economics is their currency manipulation. But that’s a topic for another day.

You clearly haven't seen the political scene in the past decade. Both democrats and republicans have gone 180 on several issues. Democrats, supposedly the stalwarts of bodily autonomy, fully embraced mask/vaccine mandates.

United States, 243 U.S. 389 (1917) says the state can not seize federal lands. There’s the Supremacy Clause and the Constitution specifically spells out that the (US) Congress has authority over the federal lands. A state could apply for a license from the Department of the Interior, but no, a state can’t take federal lands via eminent domain. This is long-settled and even a plain English reading of the Constitution makes this pretty clear. There are mountains of cases on the Supremacy Clause that support this. If California were to use a hypothetical eminent domain to seize U.S. land, they’d have already done it with Moffett Field if only to get the property tax revenue from the Google Gulfstreams parked there. reply anon291 5 hours agorootparent [–] So the great thing about American politics is that the states can do whatever they want and the feds can do whatever they want and then we can see who did what legally after the fact.

Also you can't expect terrorist organizations to behave rationally (on a state/geopolitical level) and pretty much all Middle Eastern countries (besides Iran and they aren't 100% committed either) came to terms with the fact that Israel does and will continue to exist. Did that happen due to ideological factors? I'd say that Russia is the only actual valid example and the economic outcome remains to be seen (unfortunately Russia has been doing remarkable well economically so far..). reply spwa4 9 hours agorootparentIf that's your measurement stick why aren't Iran and Afghanistan counted? You can't dismiss whole countries as terrorist organizations, no matter how they behave (China is at least as bad as Iran, for example, they also run a hostage taking business, and only difference in weaponry is that China actually rapidly succeeded in their nuclear program, which the world then proceeded to totally ignore and refuse to discuss. In Iran there seems to at least be the option of preventing them from going nuclear). Also in both countries both the people that got into power created an economic disaster coming into power, including for 99% of their own faction (everyone except the leadership). Even their competitors, in both countries I believe that means communists, would have created an economic disaster.

It's good to remember that Taiwan's adoption of multiparty democracy is very recent, and that a one-party dictatorship preceded it. And of course the PRC has always had lots of reasons to want to take back Taiwan, regardless whether it fears that mainland Chinese might see the Taiwanese system as preferable to their own. But the gp's statement that Taiwan's example today threatens the raison d'être of PRC authoritarianism is also quite valid. PRC's authority does not rest alone on a monopoly of force and surveillance, but also reputation for stability and for organizing economic growth. Now PRC population is aging, growth is slowing and suffering from serious structural problems, economic management is becoming more centralized/ideological/less effective.

The reason why it happened in Hong Kong was that the political movement was out of control, you have some members of the parliament saying \"fuck China\" when they swear to service during the ceremony. It is more about how Hong Kong sees China, not how China sees Hong Kong. China would be very happy to see Hong Kong works in the two system model.

You can wreck production yields by using the wrong color of paint in the break room or running a fan outside the building, no that is not an exaggeration. But, maybe there's some economic value in invading Taiwan. What's the economic cost, though? Well, besides the collapse of the semiconductor industry that China is quite reliant on. What else? Sanctions up the wazoo. Sanctions from the US, sanctions from Europe and from major US allies, sanctions from anyone in the South China Sea most likely. Taiwan doesn't have any natural resources, their knowledge workers can just leave (and the US will offer green cards and evacuation to everyone involved in the chips needed by the US army, if China tries to invade), their economy will plummet when imports drop from sanctions, and also China will be at war, and war is terrible for the economy. reply maxglute 2 hours agorootparent>\"we're going to blow up TSMC\" No, only US writings have suggested TW should blow up their fabs, or threatened that US would. To which TW media has told US chuckle heads to knock it off because they're clearly not going to destroy their golden goose that can lay eggs for PRC or US. Economic value is also denying US who is even more disproportionately affected by removal of 90% of high end nodes, which are already largely denied to PRC. I wouldn't expect any TW knowledge workers to be able to leave, the runways are going to be cratered, the ports and coasts saturated with mines and overwatching drones. PRC going to make sure their only future is going to be tied to mainland prosperity. PRC trade to west bloc in general like 5% of GDP... it's not nothing but it's not substantial. If you told Xi he could renunify with TW in exchange for 5% of GDP, he would have loled and smashed that button yesterday. War is bad for the economy, but it could be even worse for your adversaries.

What is the incentive? If China invades, anyone involved in destroying that asset will have a huge problem for themselves afterwards, China won't forgive. On the other hand, see what happened in Ukraine, where in the initial invasion there was quite a bit of collaboration of some Ukrainians, for example Antonov leadership (\"Antonov's leadership sabotaged defense of Hostomel airport\" -- https://english.nv.ua/nation/antonov-s-leadership-sabotaged-...). If they will have to live under China's rule, the incentive for the individuals is to cooperate with them and be richly rewarded for it. Who wants to sacrifice themselves - and likely their families too - to benefit some outsiders? Who are leaving you behind to fight for yourself? Which at that point is against your own interest if you don't think you can win.

Can I ask what led to you generating this idea? As someone in Taiwan it really stood out to me as an odd take. First, considering Taiwan to be a democratic society of \"Chinese\" people is odd. The vast majority of Taiwanese wouldn't use the English word \"Chinese\" to define themselves. There's interesting wordplay happening in Mandarin for a lot of words that the CPC now translates to \"Chinese,\" such as 漢人 華人 vaguely for \"ethnicity\" and 中文 or 漢語 for language. There's a long conversation to be had there about the CPC engaging in cultural imperialism and Han supremacism as an alternative means of imperializing Taiwan and elsewhere, but I want to stay focused on your message. Second, the CPC of course doesn't think their model is authoritarian or bad, so what do they have to fear from Taiwan? Propagandic messaging regarding Taiwan is, depending on your level of engagement with \"Communism with Chinese Characteristics,\" either \"Taiwan separatist and bad enemy\" (low engagement) or \"Chinese people on the Taiwan island are enslaved by capitalist overlords and being used as western pawns\" (high engagement). I really doubt that the CPC feels \"challenged\" by Taiwan, their language never speaks to it. reply InkCanon 13 hours agorootparentFrom the perspective of a third party and trying to understand things in a way that separates politics from reality (like PG says arguments involving identity are impossible to resolve), both Taiwanese and what might be called CCP-ese are largely political. Chinese has the rare quality of historically referring to ethnicity, language and culture to a degree not seen in most other peoples. There's also a final and most abstract concept, which is self identity. It is also the main lever of politics because it is almost impossible to change the other three. Both the citizens of the CCP and ROC are (virtually all) ancestry, linguistically and culturally Chinese. But politics has grabbed the stick of self identity and tried to steer it in different ways, leading to many contradictory results. From the CCP's destruction of culture during the cultural revolution, down to things like how (iirc) Confucianism is still taught in Taiwan as part of the curriculum but not China. Edit: changed ethnicity to ancestry to be more precise. reply komali2 12 hours agorootparent> ethnically, linguistically and culturally Chinese Again I ask - where is this impression coming from? And for what definition of \"Chinese?\" Can you please write the specific term you're thinking of in Mandarin to be more clear? In English \"Chinese\" means too many things, especially with the CPC changing the definition over the last 50 years or so. To be fair, the same thing is happening in Mandarin, so it would help if you could clarify. Regardless, for most of the definitions of \"Chinese,\" the theory doesn't seem to match reality, nor is the framing correct. First of all, regarding an ethnological and linguistic concept of \"Chinese\" (translated many ways), we should reject efforts by the CPC to claim to speak for people that have this identity - which is exactly what they're trying to do. Reject CPC cultural imperialism. Such a claim to Taiwan (and Singapore, Malaysia, New Zealand, Australia, etc places containing many \"Chinese\" people) should be rejected out of hand. Second of all, Taiwan is not ethnically or culturally \"Chinese\" for basically all definitions of \"Chinese.\" It so happens that Mandarin is the language written on government documents, true, though... that's not really \"Chinese,\" is it? It's the language of the Empires of Beijing. There are many other languages that existed in the history of Chinese empires. And throughout that whole time, Empires would choose, based on their convenience, who is \"Chinese\" and who isn't. Sometimes a lot of languages would get amalgamated into that convenient descriptor to serve imperial purposes. The CPC are the latest to do this, this time in the name of \"global Chinese communism.\" Regarding culturally, Taiwan really isn't culturally \"Chinese,\" in fact over the last few decades Taiwan has engaged in that process by which a culture develops itself in opposition to another one. See masculine and feminine cultures over the years, the Greeks and the Turks, the Brits and the French, etc. Much of Taiwanese culturally identity specifically forms around rejecting whatever the CPC claims, or riffing on whatever cultural heritage was imported by the Qing or KMT. Sure, some of the same holidays are celebrated, but are all cultures that celebrate Christmas, British? (or, white?) (or..... arabian? considering the origin of christianity) Not to mention the history of Taiwan as a colonized place has injected a wide diversity of cultures. Portuguese, Japanese, etc. There's also indigenous culture which is actively uplifted and many Taiwanese celebrate these holidays, eat indigenous food, etc. Indigenous art emblazons basically every single retaining wall in the country. Ethnically, there isn't necessarily a \"Chinese\" ethnicity, again a term invented to describe all the people ruled by a given empire. Of course there's \"Han\" but that is \"Han,\" not \"Han Chinese,\" a new word used to engage in ethnonationalism. And, it really doesn't describe Taiwan all that well, since again, it is a wildly colonized and immigrated place. The CPC is attempting to soft-power claim Taiwan through Han ethnonationalism and so I'm quite prickly about this subject. reply rfoo 10 hours agorootparentThere definitely is a Chinese ethnicity. What you are talking about sounds like claiming that the US is not a country built by immigrants because there are Indians. I can understand why you insist on such ideas if you are, well, the so-called \"Taiwanese indigenous peoples\". If you are not and your family was largely brought to Taiwan in 1940s with KMT then idk, maybe think harder? Either way, I don't believe it's wise to continue the talk as your view - The only connection between Taiwan and whatever definition of China was, Taiwan was occupied by Qing, and then KMT - isn't popular or accepted at all outside Taiwan. Not even in the anglo-sphere. Citing a lot of facts while conveniently leaving out others does not help, too. reply InkCanon 6 hours agorootparentprevThe impression and definition come from anthropology and history. In this case Chinese means 中华 and there's the Chinese language, race, and culture or 华文, 汉族, 中华文化. I apologise if I don't grasp some nuance from the words in Chinese I chose but from an objective, historical point of view, these terms are consistent. The lineage and changes (or lack of changes) of these has been established with varying levels of definitiveness. The most definitive is the ancestry Han. DNA tracing has established the genetic continuity of a Han race going back thousands of years, with an extremely homogeneous genetic profile between members of the race. 95% of the population of China and Taiwan belong to this race, with a 5% of minorities. Next most definitive is the language. The modern form of what is called regular script (I am unsure if what it is called in Chinese but it is traditional Chinese today), was the predominant form since about 250 AD. Certain words have become archaic and literary allusions might be lost. And aside from the changes in word order, you could read texts from this period onwards (with some difficulty). The governments of China all used this script, with certain governments also using additional languages like Manchu. The way it was spoken did vary a lot even till today, but there definitely is the Chinese language that both Taiwan and China uses. The fact that people from these countries can converse in their native tongue is basic empirical proof you speak the same language. Culture is the least definitive concept, but it's very plain you have a shared culture. It's not exactly the same (and culture varies within a country too) but historically it is very clear it comes from the same culture. Frankly it's quite a basic fact that the people on Taiwan and China have historically been part of same people. I'd like to emphasize what the CCP says does not change anything about the history and anthropology of it. I'd I'm being blunt, both what might be called the \"CCP Han identity\" and \"Taiwanese identity\" are political movements. In the case of the CCP to associate themselves with the history of China (which has swung wildly given their behavior especially during the cultural revolution) and in the case of Taiwanese identity (which has intensified in recent decades because of the geopolitical situation). reply komali2 6 hours agorootparentWell, specifically regarding 華 and 華人, if you want to watch something interesting, ask a group of Mandarin speakers that aren't PRC citizens whether they're 華人. 9/10 times they will immediately begin arguing with eachother about the answer. That's basically my point: 華人 and similar concepts in English described as \"Chinese\" have been historically defined by empires, written about by empires, etc, and modern anthropological techniques are finally teasing apart that this concept isn't necessarily natural but more derived from the efforts of any given empire in Chinese history - all building on eachother and legitimizing their given rule using these historical concepts. I certainly don't disagree with you that there's a lineage of these concepts! > DNA tracing has established the genetic continuity of a Han race going back thousands of years, with an extremely homogeneous genetic profile between members of the race. This seems to me to be an oversimplification of even the \"well accepted standards,\" such as for example there's a clear delineation between northern and southern \"Han.\" You can subdivide Han even further purely genetically. Furthermore, at the end of the day, defining race by genetics is always a bit of a rabbit chase since it's a relatively meaningless distinction without considering culture, and culturally, the group most call \"Han\" is extremely diverse, much moreso than portrayed historically or in the modern era. I won't go into the trouble of listing the distinctive ethnic groups, many of whom aren't even recognized by the CPC, but suffice to say basically every province has one or more distinct ethnic groups normally described simply as \"Han,\" and that's before counting what the CPC (and others) designates as \"aboriginal.\" > Next most definitive is the language. I would say this is the least definitive! The unique nature of a morphosyllabic language is many languages can be written with it. Yes, definitely the various languages of the cultures within the PRC's modern territory are unarguably similar, but that's a feature shared with various languages in other parts of the world. Take a look at India! So, for that reason, just because many different people throughout history could read what was being written by whatever Chinese empire, doesn't mean they were all Han via language. Further to that, the reason that people in Taiwan, the PRC, Singapore, Malaysia, and throughout history Korea and Japan, could speak what we today call Mandarin, is because it was the language of an Empire. Of course one would speak the King's language in the King's land. I mean, in the PRC they call every language \"Chinese\" when speaking about them in English - Shanghainese, Ninghainese, Ningbonese, everything. So it's just another empire doing empire stuff. > Culture is the least definitive concept, but it's very plain you have a shared culture. It's not exactly the same (and culture varies within a country too) but historically it is very clear it comes from the same culture. Frankly it's quite a basic fact that the people on Taiwan and China have historically been part of same people. With all due respect, just saying this doesn't really refute my argument. > both what might be called the \"CCP Han identity\" and \"Taiwanese identity\" are political movements. Yes, this is an overall point I have, that these concepts are difficult to divorce from politics, since politics has such a strong effect on what these are. E.g. if it weren't for the politics of the early United States, many indigenous languages in north america would be much more widely spoken (a recent news item I learned about, it's on mind) - regardless of the initial conquering, it was specifically the political policy of reeducation that ensured the basically permanent demise of these cultures. reply gwervc 9 hours agorootparentprev> Second of all, Taiwan is not ethnically or culturally \"Chinese\" for basically all definitions of \"Chinese.\" That's factually wrong.

It's not like you can walk in and press a button and start making chips (not to mention the whole supply chain for the materials necessary for manufacturing). It's not a turkey operator... If China somehow captured the facility without severe damage, do you really believe those engineers are just going to do the work? Or rather, do it to their best abilities? Typically people are not very happy when their country has been annexed. It's very easy to slow down production, to introduce error, and it doesn't take very many people resisting to shut down the whole operation, especially if many people are willing to at least \"look the other way\". All the while the US and others will happily the providing support and be trying to extract those engineers and they're families.

Trump did the right thing for the wrong reasons. It's not a \"substantial number\", it's the bi-partisan consensus across both parties. I find that the people who downplay the threat of China tend to rely on arguments of isolationism and assured implicit continuity of the values of the liberal international order, that they can continue to remain naval gazing at problems at home rather than realizing the world has changed. As the Chinese themselves argue, it's a \"multipolar\" world order. Their explicit ideological commitment to Schmittian realism, the rejection of hetegenerous plurality is a direct acknowledgment of fundamentally adversarial nature that governs the relationship between groups. That's what Wang Huning is saying, that's what they're talking about in Zhihu and Weibo. To reject that China is an adversary is to paradoxically deny what the Chinese (and much of the rest of the world) believes in favour of a overly myopic Eurocentric view.

The US stopped any formal defense of Taiwan in 1980, not to the 1990s. During the period it did have a defense treaty it was within the context of creating an anti communist bulwark, and such defence treaties (even with highly suspect partners) was the bread and butter of geopolitics in the Cold War. It was not because of some deep love of Taiwan or democracy, in fact Taiwan would only become a democracy after the defense treaty was terminated. And \"ardent supporter\" is a very tricky term, the US signed a declaration for the One China policy, which is completely against the idea of Taiwan as a separate nation(although at the time the KMT and people largely did not view Taiwan as an separate nation). The silicon shield is undoubtedly a significant part of the calculus around Taiwan, especially wrt direct military intervention.

As for the silicon shield, yes it’s probably a major factor, but not close to the only factor.

And of course there's a non stop stream of such political speak, which is a red herring for the whole issue. Beyond minor changes to wordings, the main things the US did that screwed over Taiwan: 1) Revoking the mutual defense treaty which legally bound the US to defend Taiwan, replacing it with a more vague law where military intervention was not clear. 2) Recognizing the PRC as the legitimate representative of China. To align your claims slightly, Taiwan also claims the same section of the SCS (actually it claims a slightly larger part), so strictly speaking it is what happens if the \"Chinese claims\" are realised (Taiwan and China work jointly to support their claims, ironically enough). In real terms the economic effects of China with respect to the SCS are greatly exaggerated for a number of reasons. First being that shipping can be routed through Indonesia. It is not a chokepoint, it just happens to be the shortest route. Second, blockades have little to do with recognising swaths of ocean as territory. These are enforced by navies, and most blockades in history have not happened within the blockaders' own waters (for obvious reasons). It is no easier for China to blockade trade in the region if it claims the SCS. And third, of all the major economic powers, China has historically been the least likely to enact economic warfare like blockades or sanctions. There is also a fourth aspect where in the current political environment, the globalised, trade based economic order is the least popular in the US and assorted European states, not China (who in fact desperately needs trade). reply voidfunc 14 hours agorootparentprevThe politics of the US are very different from the 40's to 90's.

Second, it creates a scenario in which China would take military action on Taiwan if they fall behind too far in AI due to the lack of the most advanced chips.

The fact that you think more demand doesn't increase revenue is just mind boggling. Short term sales never negate long term consequences of golden handcuffs at the cost of freedom and democracy. This has nothing to do with freedom and democracy. It has everything to do with the US wanting increase its competitiveness in high tech over China. It's all socioeconomics.

The executable should authenticate as a user or account using details provided by the person. In cases like telemetry these endpoints usually accept unauthenticated or lightly authenticated data and perform layers of validation to prevent abuse (and are usually write/append only) reply gruez 9 minutes agoparentprev>I'm under the impression an executable binary shouldn't be easily read to find such credentials It's hard but not impossible. It's more annoying than trying to extract strings out of a minified js file, but far from impossible. There are tools for it (eg. IDA), so you're not searching for credentials amongst anything that vaguely looks like a string. >and I don't know what else a game dev is supposed to do if their executable needs to authenticate itself with a remote server. The problem isn't that that the binary has hardcoded credentials, it's that the credentials are privileged. reply rubendev 42 minutes agoparentprevIf the program has access to the credential, and the program is running on your computer, you also have access to the credential no matter how they try to obfuscate it. What the game dev is supposed to do is have an account system on their backend, and ask the player to enter their credentials in the game. The game can then identify itself as this player to the backend servers. That way any actions on the backend can be attributed to a particular player and you have a good basis to make security decisions on. reply NikkiA 43 minutes agoparentprev> I'm under the impression an executable binary shouldn't be easily read to find such credentials Why would you assume that? binaries are perfectly easily readable on non-locked-down platforms. You'd have to have a system where the executable is encrypted and a secure part of the CPU die handle decryption against a private key, and even then it'd probably be only a matter of time before someone delidded the chip to get the key. reply jfactorial 23 minutes agorootparent> Why would you assume that? I thought too highly of modern compiler string literal obfuscation. reply nijave 18 minutes agorootparentConsider the string needs reversible obfuscation or it won't be usable. The only secure way is encryption but you'd need to properly secure the key (probably using some hardware facility that's physically locked down) reply mmsc 4 minutes agorootparentprev> modern compiler string literal obfuscation the what now? reply johnny22 16 minutes agorootparentprevIf they used any open or even popular compiler, then that wouldn't solve anything. Folks would have already figured out how it works, since such encoding would have to be deterministic. reply CyberDildonics 15 minutes agorootparentprevWhat obfuscation? Do you think that is happening automatically? If you compile literals into your program they are sitting in the data section of your binary verbatim so they can be read directly once the binary itself is memory mapped. reply hobs 46 minutes agoparentprevThe strings command is pretty old can do it if you're naive enough to embed a username and password into the game client. The main thing is that its privileged - having a token shouldn't let you do anything besides say, report your game stats to a central server or enumerate the server lists, things like that. reply NikkiA 41 minutes agorootparentTBF strings might not trivially show up the password if you took the most basic of provisions (a non-ascii password, not stored right next to the username separated by a \\0), but most programmers likely wouldn't even bother with that. reply nijave 16 minutes agorootparentEven then you can MITM if you have elevated access to the platform and can tinker with the certificate store. Games like Pokemon Go use a highly obfuscated algorithm to sign requests which makes it much harder to actually use the key if you can retrieve it reply klaussilveira 1 hour agoprevIs there a best practices guide somewhere on how to setup a bug bounty program? reply echoangle 2 hours agoprev> It's also disappointing that EA has yet to start a bug bounty program. Without any real incentive to report vulnerabilities, I know people who have instead chosen to keep them to themselves. I would love to see EA follow the rest of the industry's lead here. Does that mean the author got nothing for reporting this? reply jandrese 1 hour agoparentIt's not true that they got nothing. There's always the possible threat of legal action against them for reporting the vulnerabilities. reply gchamonlive 1 hour agorootparentI mean, after all, that's what we are all here for right? Fish and legal liability. reply acheong08 1 hour agoparentprevIt's disappointing how many companies don't offer a bug bounty. I have a hoard of vulnerabilities I've found over the years just sitting in my head. It doesn't help that there are legal risks with reporting them & they can technically sue you to hell (EU/UK) reply gosub100 46 minutes agorootparentIt's probably the result of some very backward-thinking rationale: \"If we get hacked by the bad guys, our shareholders will point to these bounties and say 'wait, you're activetly paying people to hack you and now they did and you're going to have to write down and additional $X Million?'. \" Execs afraid of having egg on their face, perhaps. reply richbell 2 hours agoparentprev> Does that mean the author got nothing for reporting this? Correct. reply Fokamul 1 hour agoprevIt's ridiculous EA didn't pay any bounty for this reply qmarchi 1 hour agoparentBattleDash - \"Here's XSS, Account Takeover, Ban Reversal, and a heads up before I publish it\" EA - \"So here's $0.\" If anyone is at EA, this man just saved the integrity of your entire empire, you might want to give him at least a token amount. reply londons_explore 1 hour agorootparentMy experience with big companies is even if the whole IT security team thinks this is worthy of a bounty, and the team has plenty of budget they could allocate to it, the process of giving money to an individual is frequently so difficult to get through the bureaucratic purchase order system that it's basically impossible to do unless you are contractually obliged to pay. reply nijave 9 minutes agorootparentProbably easier to hire them on as a consultant than \"give them money\" reply JohnFen 1 hour agorootparentprevEA is a famously horrible company. I don't think they care much about the \"integrity of their empire\" because their customers don't care. reply foobranded 1 hour agorootparentWhen I was in college, I once found some bad exploits in the sims social on Facebook, the subsidiary (Playfish?) behind it asked me for my address and which console I owned and then unexpectedly sent me a huge number of games and goodies. It was great. Better than money, I think (I sold some of those games anyway). I reached out to employees via unofficial channels. I'm sure if I had spoken to some exec I'd be in jail right now. reply boomchinolo78 1 hour agoparentprevUntil we see something like this, The company is liable for $10 per hacked user minus 100X the bounty spend for that year. reply Perz1val 1 hour agoparentprevWould it be legal to publish any future vulnerabilities without giving them heads up? reply sailfast 2 hours agoprevWait this person didn’t get paid for finding this?

This could have been exploited to just unban every account that has ever been banned. This guy would have made a fortune selling just that exploit to cheaters. reply ronsor 2 hours agoparentSelling the exploit? No. What you do is offer an unban API and charge $1 per call. reply edm0nd 1 hour agorootparentYou would be able to charge much more than $1 per call and the real $ wouldn't come from unbanning but banning instead. Think about being able to empower a kid to ban anyone they want. It would turn into chaos but I do not think such a service would be long lived as it would generate so many support tickets and issues that EA would start looking into how it was happening. reply jerf 31 minutes agorootparentIf someone was out to maximize chaos and not just make money, this is in all seriousness in the class of problems that someone intelligent could have used to all but destroy EA. You don't offer an API with targeted usage, and you sure don't ban everyone. There's lots of fun ideas you can go for here, but just as one, suppose I spend a month banning accounts that haven't played much, but more than zero. Then go quiet for a couple of weeks. EA frontline support notices but if you play your cards right they don't put the pieces together and nobody is quite roused to investigate. Then you start up again, somewhat faster, spend a couple of days banning a good chunk of medium sized accounts. Then maybe at the end you ban the biggest accounts as quickly as you can. Now the bannings are news. EA's PR is probably completely blown out by the crisis and starts saying contradictory things. (My guess is that initially they end up backing their right to ban people and releasing statements to the effect of how right they probably are; this is, in the end, a huge mistake on their part.) Gamers can be reliably expected to start a ton of rumors, take them in the worst way possible, and antagonize EA, and EA is pretty likely to make at least one class-A error in being antagonistic back. (The hackers could even supply some of the rumors and some bots to get them going, though I doubt it'll be necessary. The gamer community is pretty well primed to turn on EA.) A ton of people who are curious but figure this can't be affecting them because they hardly use the service log in and discover they've been banned despite not having done anything on EA in six months. The fire rises as they post to reddit and hundreds of people chime in with \"WTF, me too!\", even if it's only a small percentage of the total people who check. Several days later, EA puts all the pieces together confidently enough to be sure that they can announce it's a hack. They're right. Nobody cares. Half of the gamer community doesn't even believe their defense. It's hard to guess what the upper bound of damage is on this scenario. reply edm0nd 18 minutes agorootparentI think you are right, banning would cause too many issues and be loud. I think the real quiet $ maker would be stealing usernames instead. Like if you wanted the EA gametag of jerf but someone else had it, you could steal it using OPs method if it was still unpatched. A pay service for this would be viable in low volume and on the EA side it would just look like the user did it. The seller of service would have to implement some kind of checks to make sure for example they weren't stealing the username of a top streamer or etc which would bring heat. reply tomschwiha 1 hour agorootparentprevYou could turn it into a simple subscription based service: pay to stay (unbanned). Pretty sure \"price restructuring\" (price increases) will be paid by most users (cost sunk fallacy). reply darkwater 1 hour agorootparentYeah, if Alice and Bob are at war, accept a huge payment by Alice to ban Bob, and then ask Bob a small recurrent fee to unban his account til the next payment.

    "commentBody": "Albertsons kills rural grocers with land use restrictions (thebignewsletter.com)268 points by unpredict 21 hours agohidepastfavorite287 comments TulliusCicero 20 hours agoThese sorts of land use restrictions should be illegal. It's basically a corporation trying to act as a pseudogovernment, enforcing regulations on land that they no longer own themselves. One could argue that HOAs are kind of a similar issue, acting like a pseudogovernment, with restrictions on housing passing on down indefinitely, even to new owners who may not have wanted to agree to them (but with housing being as constrained as it is, you may not always have a realistic choice). As a general rule, prior owners probably shouldn't be getting a say in what future owners do with land. Why? Because land is inherently limited in a way in which most other property is not, which reduces the ability of new entrants to 'disrupt' the market by offering people more choice. If my town only has one car dealership with shitty business practices, no biggie, it's not too hard to go to another town and buy a car, then bring it back. But I can't buy land and bring it back to use it, I'm stuck with whatever's already there. reply elihu 19 hours agoparentIt seems they already are illegal, at least in some jurisdictions. > \"In June, for instance, Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson, who is also litigating against the merger, fined Albertsons $25,000 for imposing a land use restriction on a store it sold in 2018 in a low-income section of Bellingham, Washington.

There doesn't necessarily need to be any underlying logic or consistency, so a very tailored legal interpretation could be formed in theory. That said, I think I'm much more practical solution is to focus on the buyer's rights and non-competitive behavior then limiting sellers rights. It makes intuitive sense that people would be able to option or sell indefinite use rights if they own the thing itself. It is less intuitive that individuals have a right to aggregate such options for Monopoly. Now that I think about it, it seems there could be some comparison to the corner crossing cases that are being litigated too reply chis 18 hours agorootparentI think a really natural solution would be to tax these sort of land restrictions for as long as someone is actually willing to pay. Just assess the value with the restrictions vs without and then tax it at the standard property tax rate.

On a more serious note, I think tax is a terrible solution. Who is going to value all of these use rights, restrictions, and options on an ongoing basis. Why punish everyone with any kind of good faith contract to deal with an extremely niche issue, which may not even be a problem. Seems like the current solution is best. If someone is bothered, they can complain and the AG investigates. If someone is engaging in anticompetitive action, they get fined. It amounts to the same thing without screwing everyone over. reply kilotaras 13 hours agorootparentThere's a reasonably simple change that would allow application of Harberger's taxes. 1. Restrictions have to have a \"controlling party\": a dedicated party that controls the restrictions and can agree to lift it. Classical example would be HOA, but it can also be a seller if they want to sell property with additional restrictions. 2. The controlling party sets the price of a restriction 3. Restricted party can remove the restriction paying price set in 2 to controlling part. 4. The controlling party pays tax as percentage of price set in 2. reply s1artibartfast 12 hours agorootparentSo you still have renters paying property taxes. Renters are the controlling party.

I could be wrong, but I think property use restrictions are actually more of a socialist concept. When done right, they're meant to protect others (aka society, in general - not some businesses that don't like having competitors across the street) from various harms, such as emissions, noise, overcrowding or things like that. In other words, not about what goes on at some property, but what happens to the outside because of it. But as the uncontrolled abuse grew unchecked, it became something else entirely. This stuff, together with non-competes and exclusivity agreements is something different. I don't know what it is, but it's neither capitalism nor socialism \"as they were well-meant\", but rather a weird amalgamation of perverted concepts from both, leading to both erosion of healthy markets (so, harming capitalism) and degradation of life quality (so, harming socialism). reply deprecative 17 hours agorootparentNoncompetes are capitalistic. Property use restrictions aren't inherently capitalist but how they're used in most cases, particularly within the US, they almost always are.

If Microsoft made secret backroom deals that gave them an unfair advantage, the FTC would and did go after them. If you don't like competition, having the government come in and say you're the only one that can do that just isn't how American is supposed to work.

That depends, really. If the unpaid HOA fine was disclosed during the buying process, and the buyer didn't make it a condition of sale that the seller had to cover it, then the buyer is responsible. If the seller didn't disclose it, then the buyer can of course sue the seller, but depending on the magnitude of the fine, it might be easier and less stressful to just pay it. > HOA's are agreed to by the owners and they preserve the value of everyone's property and enforce common decency. In theory, yes. In practice, many HOAs are full of busybodies who enjoy the power trip and love to meddle in how other people live their lives. Even in the absence of that, like any institution, the people who are a part of them and subject to them often disagree on the fine details. For example, I'm not convinced it's fair that an elected board of homeowners gets to decide things like what color the curtains on the inside of your windows facing the street are allowed to be. But many HOAs have restrictions on that. I suspect you might think that such a restriction is fine, but that's exactly the point I'm trying to make: people don't always agree, but everyone ends up being subject to whatever the board/majority decides. I don't think we should allow these mini-governments to be able to enact property restrictions that actual governments wouldn't be allowed to do. My latest fun letter from our HOA was that the paint on some air vents on our roof had faded and no longer matched the color of the roof, and we'd be fined if I didn't have them repainted. What a huge waste of time and money, both for me and for whatever busybody was paid (yes, paid) to drive around the neighborhood looking for these things. As an amusing aside: not long ago I read of a case where a homeowner had been parking his boat in his driveway for some very long time (like more than a decade), but suddenly the HOA decided to enforce a provision about that not being allowed. Boats had to be put behind some sort of opaque fence or partition, so they're not visible from the street. So he built the fence, parked his boat behind it, and had an artistic neighbor friend paint a mural... of his boat... on the outside of the fence. Loved that. reply ttyprintk 6 hours agorootparentBut other HOAs pave the roads, chlorinate the water, and put out the fires. And decide how to pay for that.

Alas, a portion of the progressive left was co-opted by the housing barons many decades ago. I believe California voters would be more progressive otherwise. Here in SF, a good example is the leading progressive mayoral candidate, Peskin. He's basically a housing subversive. He'll pay lip service to it, then sabotage YIMBY efforts. Earlier this year he sponsored an ordinance blocking higher density in parts of his district. The current mayor vetoed it [1] but he got the board to override the veto [2]. The barons originally sold suburban supply restrictions as anti-sprawl measures, co-opting the greener factions of the left. Then they sold density restrictions as anti-traffic measures. No suburbs + no density = no new housing. Luckily this unholy coalition has started to crumble a few years ago. A large majority of Democrats is now in favor of more housing.

To reach utopia - the fantasy goes - we must first travel through a dystopia in which the poor are enserfed by the housing barons, paying upwards of 70% of their income in rent. Unfortunately the dystopia never ends in practice. Then there's the perplexing question of how real estate taxation got to this point.

Then it might just essentially boil down to democracy issues. Companies on the other hand don’t get a vote. So if all grocery companies banded together and voted for a law to allow monopolies then it wouldn’t be the same thing as if all the humans voted for it. Companies do love to lobby though, but lobbying and voting are still two different things. So if all the people in California banded together and voted to allow grocery chains to collaborate and split up areas to avoid competition, then I guess that would be mostly fine too. reply epistasis 18 hours agorootparentIt's certainly not the majority of people that want it this way, and poll after poll shows that. The local decisions on zoning are not made democratically, there's layers of representatives, and the representatives that get elected are some of the least reported-on and discussed elections in our society. Land use decisions are made by small numbers of highly motivated people, that already have housing, and benefit financially from a shortage of housing. Just like the grocery stores here. At the state level, regulation of land use is far more similar to poll results, and that regulation is reining in the abuses of local land use policy, forcing local decision makers to allow for more housing. reply jandrese 20 hours agorootparentprevOne caveat is that these decisions are local, so people who have not had a chance to move in because there is no housing don't get a vote. Thus over time the law increasingly favors existing homeowners to the point where it completely fossilizes the community. It's a good deal for the people who live there, but a bad one for the population as a whole as all of the prime real estate is taken and they're pushed out to places that nobody previously wanted to live. If I had a good or easy solution I would offer it, but this is just a fundamental problem with democracy. Maybe if there was a fairly hostile state zoning board that vetoed most of the laws that prevent new construction, but there is almost no way to prevent that sort of position from being captured by the local interests and it would be very hard to staff since the person would be under both intense pressure and hate from nearly all communities in the state.

If Alice owns land and sells to Bob with some restrictions, that means Alice is still maintaining some ownership of the land. And the price that Bob pays is discounted from the otherwise fair market value, because it has those restrictions on it. Then, if Bob sells it to Charlie, Alice still has an ownership stake (logically speaking) from the restrictions (whether it is land use, or mineral rights, or whatever). That is what keeps Charlie bound by those same restrictions. And again, the land isn't worth as much to Charlie as unrestricted land would be. Now since Alice still has what could be considered ownership in the land (via the restrictions), then Alice should be paying some property tax based on that value she is retaining. And since taxes can be assessed based on the nature of how the property is used (such as granting a homestead exemption/discount for example), then if the current situation isn't benefiting the county or city, they can redefine their tax code to raise the portion that Alice would have to pay based on the ownership type. I understand that the above is an ideal situation, and if Alice isn't getting a tax bill then that should probably be addressed by the local government. reply s1artibartfast 19 hours agoparentI don't buy your property tax rationale.

You buy a standard city lot, you have the right to build a house on it and to keep others off your property. If Alice still has some say over what can be done with a property, even if it is through a contract with Bob, then how is Alice able to tell Charlie what he can do with the property once Bob sells it to Charlie? When Charlie never signed any paperwork with Alice? That sounds like something that comes with still having some level of ownership, even if the law that enables the restrictions to be enforced don't word it that way. And that is where I'm saying that the county can write into the tax law that this type of control is taxable with property tax (because even if it isn't technically ownership of the land, the right of enforcing the restrictions is still something that Alice owns). I'd also like to see taxes on property that is underutilized (for the zoning that it is in). For example, some landlords would prefer to not rent out units rather than lower the rent to market rates (either housing or storefront properties), contributing to a constrained supply. If property taxes are raised on a unit that is unoccupied for a specific length of time, that would encourage the owner to rent it out at what the market is willing to pay instead of artificially keeping the rent higher and therefore the building empty. reply sooheon 17 hours agorootparentprevThis is a distinction without a difference if those rights constrain what can be done with the land. reply ttyprintk 5 hours agorootparentShe has a good posture in court; or in mediation or arbitration.

Most people in a position to start up new grocery stores barely have enough capital to start one store, and cannot afford to tie it up in litigation for the next five to ten years. 3.

My first suspicion is that the story is simply wrong: generally, when you read something that's so comic-book-villain evil, something about the story is being misrepresented or is just wrong.

Because I feel like land use restrictions are antithetical to a free market. Depends, should you be \"free\" to offer terms on land you own, and to \"free\" to accept those terms when purchasing? Whenever people talk about \"free markets\", it often embeds a sneaky internal contradiction between (A) the freedom to operate without worrying about secrets and strange restrictions, versus (B) the freedom to create secrets and strange restrictions on others. That pattern is a pet-peeve of mine: People will celebrate a \"free market\" as being theoretically optimal when everyone has perfect information about prices and deals... Then the next day others will pooh-pooh concerns over cartels, because a \"free market\" enables defectors to make secret deals with hidden prices. I wouldn't be surprised if in some cases they ended up being the same people. reply mullingitover 20 hours agorootparentprevThe restrictions are contracts between two parties, not the state imposing them, so it's 100% the free market.

And the word unrestricted is underlined. It seems to me that land use restrictions (I mean, it's literally in the name) are directly working against this philosophy. reply dghlsakjg 20 hours agorootparentUnrestricted in this sense means that both parties are able to deploy their capital as they choose, and specifically without outside requirements. In this case someone took a piece of capital (land), and traded most of the rights, but not all to someone else. The buyer took the deal knowing that they hadn't purchased unrestricted use of that land, but instead a limited use of the land. Both parties agreed to the deal, and no other party restricted their actions, or unfairly restricted competition. No party was coerced, and they could have negotiated for different terms.\\ An example of a great non-market restriction would be: you can't enforce any land use restriction covenants. reply aliasxneo 20 hours agorootparentThat is interesting; I can see it from that perspective. I suppose when I read \"unrestricted competition,\" I infer it to mean that any contractual agreement created for the purpose of limiting competition would be regulated to maintain the free market. I'm under the impression that this is the reason for most of the anti-monopoly regulation that currently exists. Outside of regulation of anti-monopolistic regulations, I don't think a free market (where competition isn't hindered) could develop? Alas, I could be in over my head, but I guess I don't interpret \"free market\" to mean anarchy (no regulation). reply dghlsakjg 19 hours agorootparentFree markets don't necessarily lead to the best outcome, and certainly not to the best outcome for a society. If you go read the actual invisible hand quote from Adam Smith, that so many people are fond of quoting, he is pointing out that the free-market leads to unintended outcomes and side-effects: \"By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention.\" His argument is basically that sometimes merchants accidentally do things that benefit society. The unstated opposite is the issue. The concept of free-markets is nebulous, and thus more of a political football than a serious thing. Every culture has limits on what it will allow of the market, and what is considered not allowed. A monopoly that harms the consumer is not allowed, but we do allow monopolies in circumstances where it would be massively inefficient not to operate as a monopoly (utilities is the most common one, e.g. only one company is allowed to own power lines in your neighborhood). reply kmeisthax 3 hours agorootparentprev> No party was coerced, and they could have negotiated for different terms This is my pet peeve with certain forms of right-wing libertarianism.

It's an agreement between two individuals or corporations on land usage as part of the sales agreement. Imposing a restriction on this means that the government is saying that these two individuals cannot conduct private business in a certain way. Now do I agree with this? Hell no, land use restrictions should be legislated into oblivion and companies should not be able to make flagrant abuse of monopolistic behavior to destroy essential businesses for towns.

And a market with a sole provider isn't a market in my books, and is in fact kind of the antithesis of a market. That's why we have anti-monopoly laws, so that we can have markets. In recent decades, the interpretation of anti-monopoly has transitioned a bit to focus more on consumerism rather than markets, and the definition of monopoly has shifted from \"is there a sole provider\" to \"is the dominant market player causing consumer harm.\" But originally, before that shift, anti-monopoly laws were in favor of markets. reply alistairSH 20 hours agoparentprevAlso, behold a market failure. Edit - we’re talking about two markets - groceries and land. Rules in one market (land) are being used to create a monopoly in the other (groceries).

I know that Saudi Arabia and other gulf states abuse foreign workers horribly, but can the death tool really be that high? That works out to 3,000 per year. That seems incredibly high. How can that only be coming out now? That is way more than the number of Chinese deaths building Canada's railway, which I always thought was a poster child for immigrant abuse: https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/canadian-p.... Turns out that 30% of the population in Saudi Arabia is foreign workers, so 10M or so, thus 21,000 is roughly one dead per 500 foreign workers: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_workers_in_Saudi_Arabi... This 21,000 deaths, is it including natural deaths or something other than dying as a result of the job? If it is true, then we need intervention as the death toll is approaching what one would expect in war zone. reply wormlord 3 hours agoparent> 21,000 people seems like a massive amount of dead. I know that Saudi Arabia and other gulf states abuse foreign workers horribly, but can the death tool really be that high? That works out to 3,000 per year. That seems incredibly high. How can that only be coming out now? Enormous numbers of people die very frequently without coverage from mainstream corporate media. Your surprise is mostly from the fact that whatever outlets you would expect to be the watchdogs for this sort of thing, haven't been barking. There have been guerilla documentaries on slave labor in the gulf for years. I believe the one I saw was Vice. They had people working 12 hour days in the sun with no breaks and sleeping in metal shacks with no A/C in the desert. I think something like 5,000 civilians have been killed in Myanmar with very little western coverage. Not sure how many have been killed in Sudan in the last year but it is in the tens of thousands. Both of these cases have millions of displaced people as well. I get that those are wars and this is just slavery, but I'm just trying to make the point that unless you go out of your way to consume media outside the mainstream you'll probably miss a lot of this stuff. It is incredibly shocking when you first hear about it. reply hn_throwaway_99 2 hours agorootparentI don't buy this \"blaming the mainstream media\" for the upteenth time. First of all, looking at your other examples of Myanmar and Sudan, there have been tons of coverage in the mainstream media about those issues. What the OP is saying about 21000 laborers dying in Saudi Arabian is that huge number would have been noticed by lots of people - and a lot of these people would have had huge incentive to get the word out, and then the \"mainstream media\" would have had huge incentive to get the word out as well. E.g. wouldn't this have been gigantic news in places like the Philippines and India where many of these laborers come from? As OP points out, I think the bigger problem is separating out on-the-job deaths from \"natural\" deaths. I.e. how many deaths would you normally expect from 10M people over 7 years? My guess is that it's some combination of (a) truly awful slave-like conditions, (b) just general \"lack of safety culture\" conditions (e.g. ~100 people died building the Hoover Dam - I don't think people considered them slaves but they definitely weren't following OSHA rules), (c) accidental deaths that happen in any large project over this amount of time, and (d) natural deaths. The journalistic challenge is that it's difficult to tease out these different causes. reply mtalantikite 2 hours agorootparent> What the OP is saying about 21000 laborers dying in Saudi Arabian is that huge number would have been noticed by lots of people - and a lot of these people would have had huge incentive to get the word out, and then the \"mainstream media\" would have had huge incentive to get the word out as well. Well, it's more complicated than that. Take Bangladesh. Most of the people dying are extremely poor young men from the gram (village), whose families are not going to have the power to get their stories in the newspapers, which are owned by ruling class families. Some of these papers even have sibling businesses in their parent conglomerates that actively recruit workers to go to SA, UAE, etc. [0] Also, the political system is desperate for Saudi investment [1][2], so they aren't necessarily going to make a huge public fuss about it. It's certainly in the news though [3][4]. That's all to say that families absolutely know about this, talk about it on social media groups, and nothing happens.

Saudi Arabia population is ~35M with ~120K deaths per year. 10M immigrants is ~32K deaths per year. reply wormlord 1 hour agorootparentprevNot trying to be an asshole, I think you should genuinely ask yourself why your first reaction is to try and justify/intellectualize the deaths of literal slaves from the third world who are enslaved by an actual monarch. reply changing1999 1 hour agorootparentBecause jumping to emotionally driven conclusions is not a healthy reaction and usually leads to bad outcomes. reply wormlord 1 hour agorootparentHow do you know my analysis is emotionally-driven? One might argue that your analysis is driven by the need to justify the atrocities you witness-- an emotional reaction. > usually leads to bad outcomes Citation needed. reply changing1999 1 hour agorootparentIt's a fact that strong emotions can cloud judgment and result in cognitive biases. See my comment above in the same thread, the data suggests that OP's view is not unreasonable. Your comment uses charged language like \"asshole\", \"literal slaves\", \"justify/intellectualize the deaths\", etc and you are not providing data to support your claims (only an appeal to emotions). reply wormlord 47 minutes agorootparent> the data suggests that OP's view is not unreasonable The data uses a relative comparison of migrant deaths to overall death rate for Saudi Arabia. You are looking for something to console you that \"actually the slaves aren't dying at high rates\". I'd like to see this death rate for the subset of the SA population that matches migrant demographics, ex: age and gender. Then we can see what the comparable death rates are for healthy young men. > Your comment uses charged language like \"asshole\" I said I wasnt an asshole to preface that I genuinely meant what I said. > \"literal slaves\" They are literally slaves this is factual. > \"justify/intellectualize the deaths\" Again, factual. You yourself claim that you are trying to be unemotional and analyze the situation as I described, \"academically\". reply changing1999 17 minutes agorootparentNone of that is factual. If it is - present evidence that: 1. all workers involved in this project are slaves, i.e. trafficked and sold into slavery and are owned as property. 2. OP justifies the deaths and not merely tries to add context and find a reasonable explanation for some of the deaths (which does not exclude possible human rights violations). reply wormlord 0 minutes agorootparentI like that you ignored my first point where I pointed out that your objective, rational analysis failed to account for basic variables like age and sex. 1. I don't need to prove \"all workers\" are slaves, that is an arbitrary burden established by you. I can provide links for you to educate yourself about the Kafala[0] system however. Here is an excerpt from the section on Saudi Arabia: \"an employer assumes responsibility for a hired migrant worker and must grant explicit permission before the worker can enter Saudi Arabia, transfer employment, or leave the country. The kafala system gives the employer immense control over the worker.\" Sounds like ownership to me. You can dispute that if you want but I don't think it is a meaningful distinction to make, personally. 2. > My guess is that it's some combination of (a) truly awful slave-like conditions, (b) just general \"lack of safety culture\" conditions (e.g. ~100 people died building the Hoover Dam - I don't think people considered them slaves but they definitely weren't following OSHA rules) OP is trying to contextualize the deaths in a way that makes them \"cleaner\" or \"more acceptable\" instead of just reading the damn articles that actual investigative journalists have written which would prove to them that YES this is slavery and YES these are human beings that are being worked to death. If all your objective, rational analysis has wrought is a shitty half-assed statistical comparison in an attempt to justify slavery, on an internet forum, what good was it to begin with?

I think that's the tool that many people struggle to understand here. If you have the desire to learn more, how do you get there? reply Out_of_Characte 2 hours agorootparentYou dont. People all around the world are in various ways economically enslaved. Its just that in western countries we have rules in place to limit what you could contractually mandate from an employee. You can report unsafe working conditions, long hours, unreasonable pay or discrimination based on immutable characteristics. Usually you report this to your boss, if he doesn't listen then you report it to an independent organisation to arbitrate, if this doesn't work then you have courts, social media and governments to rely on. If all else fails you could quit your job at no repercussions and find a new one. its just that all of methods above are useless if the organisation has close ties to all of these pathways of resolution. reply wormlord 2 hours agorootparentprevI like many of the journalists from The Intercept[0].

So 3k per year is for 10M workers is twice as deadly for a less dangerous profession, but with worse safety standards, poor treatment, and inherent risks from extreme heat it doesn’t actually sound unrealistic. reply mmmore 2 hours agorootparentNot to justify Saudi Arabian conditions, but if you're more granular than I assume that release is, there are a few professions in the US that have higher yearly fatality rates than 3k/10M = 30/100k including roofers, fishing/hunting, and aircraft pilots. \"Helpers in construction trades\" have a fatality rate of nearly 40/100k.[1] Now I don't think 10M is the correct denominator. It's unlikely all those workers are in construction where a lot of the deaths are presumably concentrated. According to this[2], there were around 4.4M foreign construction workers in 2016. 3k/5M (assuming numbers have increased) is 60/100k, so around as dangerous as the most dangerous professions in the US. But this also doesn't account for the alleged missing. [1] https://www.bls.gov/charts/census-of-fatal-occupational-inju...

I remember reading about Indonesia being pissed off at Saudi Arabia because many of the Indonesian workers died after going there, and Saudi government didn't seem to really give a crap about the workers.

If you're curious how this could happen, there's a simple explanation, IMO: these countries are some of the small handful of non-republics left in the entire world. There's lots of authoritarian republics, but true totalitarian systems are another beast entirely, just from a cultural perspective alone. Here's a semi-outdated map that I'd argue Afghanistan has earned a place on, and also doesn't shout out The Holy See, which is also a theocratic monarchy: https://i0.wp.com/mattdallisson.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/...

They’re just labeling ostensible governmental systems, not trying to characterize relative levels of freedom. And y’all kiwis deserve derision until you manage to kick the old buffoons to the curb! At the very least you can do what India did and stay in the Commonwealth for economic/geopolitical signaling reasons, but declare sovereignty from the crown itself. EDIT: and tbh you still got em lurking. AFAICT the monarch has the power to dissolve parliament at any time and start new elections, and could exercise the power of veto? The Constitution Act 1986 is the principal formal statement. The Act first recognises that the Queen - the Sovereign in right of New Zealand - is the Head of State of New Zealand and that the Governor-General appointed by her is her representative in New Zealand. Each can in general exercise all the powers of the other… The Governor-General has the power to summon, prorogue and dissolve parliament… a Bill passed by the House becomes law when the Sovereign or Governor-General assents to it. There’s always the chance that trying this in practice would lead to an uprising, but as the US has recently taught us, polite conventions are a weak foundation for a democracy… imagine what a conspiracy theorist monarch could do if they worked with domestic fringe politicians! https://web.archive.org/web/19991009163331/http://www.dpmc.g... reply StefanBatory 2 hours agorootparentprevI'm not sure how correct that map is - i.e I always heard Poland being described as having semi-presidential republic system. reply bunderbunder 2 hours agoparentprevFor what it's worth, that number isn't terribly far off from the roughly 1 in 200 worker fatality rate for the construction of the Hoover Dam in the USA.

Media/Citizens also align themselves with the foreign policy. reply kragen 1 hour agoparentprevAccording to the article, this is 21000 deaths over 7–8 years (\"According to the exposé by ITV, more than 21,000 Indian, Bangladeshi, and Nepalese workers have died in Saudi Arabia since 2017\"), and these are probably almost entirely young working-age men, because in most places (I don't know specifically about Saudi Arabia) migrant workers are almost entirely young working-age men. In the US, looking at the Social Security Administration's actuarial life table at https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html, 18-year-old men have a death probability of .0011 (0.11%) per year, and 28-year-old men have a death probability of .00233 (0.233%) per year. 0.11% of your number of 10 million people per year, over 7 years, is 77000 deaths, and at 0.233%, it would be 163100 deaths. These numbers are many times higher than the 21000 deaths actually reported here. So, on that basis, we would conclude that not only is it not \"approaching what one would expect in war zone\", it's one third of the death rate for young men in one of the world's richest countries, one which has virtually no slavery problem. That is, it's three times safer to be a migrant worker in Saudi Arabia than to be an average young dude in Springfield. So, yes, the death [toll] really can be that high. In fact, it could be many times higher without any job-related deaths at all. However, your number of \"10M or so\" is all foreign workers in Saudi Arabia, not just the ones working on Saudi Vision 2030. So, on that basis, it's entirely possible that the number of workers working on Saudi Vision 2030 is much smaller than this 10 million. Maybe we're talking about 3000 deaths per year out of only 1 million workers, or 0.1 million, which would be really alarming! reply karel-3d 3 hours agoparentprevHow is this death rate compared to Qatar and Dubai death rate?

The people you are pleeding to to do the \"intervention\" clearly don't care about human lives, so I'm not sure what you are hoping to accomplish. reply tzs 1 hour agoparentprevThere were similar reports during Qatar's construction of facilities for the 2022 World Cup. Digging into the sources of the numbers in those reports though showed that they were (1) for the entire population of foreign workers in Qatar rather than just those working on the World Cup projects, and (2) counted all deaths rather than just work related deaths. The death rate for those foreign workers turned out to less than the death rate for 15-34 year old males in the US. I compared to 15-34 year old males because I figured that foreign workers in Qatar, especially those working on World Cup construction, would tend to be male and younger. I'm going to take the number of foreign worked in Saudi Arabia as 6 million. That's lower than the number you cited from Wikipedia, but that number is a few year old and has been going down. 6 million seems closer to the current number. I'd rather be low than high because being low on the population size gives a higher death rate. Too high is better than too low when you are trying to check if a death rate is worrisome. If that 3000 per year turns out to be among all foreign workers and for all causes, like the Qatar numbers, that would give a death rate of 50 per 100k per year. That would be pretty low. For comparison US death rates for males 15-24 and 25-34 are 127 and 251 respectively, and for females in those age groups they are 49 and 109. That's low enough to be hard to believe, so a more detailed look into the data is called for. I haven't found any more easily Googled data, so what just follows is speculation. One possibility is that unlike the Qatar numbers the Saudi numbers actually are only for workers actually working on Saudi Vision 3030 and/or only includes work related deaths. That would lower the denominator and raise the calculated death rate. Another possibility is that the numbers are like the Qatar numbers and workers there really do die at a lower rate than do young people in the US. Offhand I can think of a couple things that might contribute to this: 1. Many of the jobs for migrants are known to be physically hard. Maybe it is mostly only people who are in very good health who take those jobs. 2. Saudi Arabia greatly restricts alcohol and enforces this with very harsh penalties. Same with drugs. A significant chuck of the US young person deaths are alcohol or drug related and those kind of deaths should be almost entirely absent among the foreign workers in Saudi Arabia. reply soco 1 hour agorootparentHow about gun-related deaths?

Now if there was some reason to suggest the 21000 was fabricated or off by enormous margins, sure, that would be worth discussing. But nobody has brought up something like that. reply elashri 1 hour agorootparentThe problem is that you are saying death rate is so high but neither you or the article gave a rate. The number 21000 is not a rate and even if we forget about denominator. We still don't know how this number is constructed (might be lower or higher). What does the count process and how the data is collected. And as I asked before does this count family members or not (happened with many reports regarding world cup in qatar) Now to construct rate you will need to say even if this number is correct (which we don't know) against what denominator especially if people want to compare it against death rate in different countries like some people did with US.

We were told that 6500 guest workers had died in workplace accidents building the stadiums, and everyone got very upset. But that was very misleading. 6500 was the number of deaths for any reason among ~1M guest workers. That is a perfectly normal death rate in a population that size. The official Qatari statistics was that 37 world cup construction workers died, and only 3 of those were work-related accidents. This info was of course reported far less. reply snakeyjake 1 hour agoparent> That is a perfectly normal death rate in a population that size. That is a mortality rate of 650 per 100k. That is not normal. That is horrific. That is irrefutable, unquestionable, evidence of systemic abuse and/or neglect. That is double the mortality rate in US federal prisons more than double the mortality rate of the US state prison population. That is roughly double the typical mortality rate of US adults aged 25-64. (~340 per 100k) and due to a variety of reasons (e.g. obesity, lack of access to healthcare) the US's working-age mortality rate is among the worst in the industrialized world. \"Roughly double\" of \"among the worst\" is not \"perfectly normal\".

How many years did the Qatari World Cup stadiums take to build? The implications are different if the answer is \"⅓\" or if the answer is \"3\". 650 deaths per 100k over 3 years would be only 220 deaths per year per 100k.

Considering Saudi Arabia’s immigration system, or lack thereof, practically everyone who’s not a citizen is a foreign worker, and South Asians make up the lion share of the 10 million foreign workers. Are we looking at 21k dying out of a 6 million+ population over 7 years, or 21k dying out of a much smaller construction pool for a few projects?

This might be the most misunderstood aspect of what a free market means. It does not mean that you're free to violate freedom of others. It means that everyone is free to buy and sell any product or service while consenting to do so under full information symmetry. You're not allowed to violate others right to do so; using violence, lying or any form of dishonesty, which happens in this case. I'm not saying that free markets solve everything. For example, a worker might accidentally sign a contract which turns out to be exploitative. Which means that the laws about exploiting or harming anyone must override any free market contracts. reply wormlord 2 hours agorootparentThe real free market is a fiction which could never exist.

Doesn’t change the facts though reply wormlord 2 hours agorootparentI am of the opinion that the Free Market is a fiction which has never existed and can never exist. The belief in a fictitious \"Free Market\" which is just a platonic ideal, is equally as ideological as a Marxist belief in a \"new man\" that arises from living under Socialism, however one of these ideas is considered hocum and the other is orthodoxy that is taught in elite universities. People who defend capitalism will point out that \"well there is some market inefficiency (government interference, authoritarianism, subsidies) that actually makes this not real capitalism\". In this example Saudi Arabia is a monarchist petrostate spending government money on stupid projects, so that's actually \"not capitalism\". This is the same as the meme of people saying \"not real communism\" when someone asks how they feel about Lenin murdering a bunch of people. Instead we should understand that capitalism is about private ownership of property, NOT a fictitious \"Free Market\" as Milton Friedman tried to re-center the conversation around. Understanding that capitalism is about ownership, and not markets, makes it clear that authoriatrianism and capitalism go hand-in-hand, as a strong and violent government exists to enforce the property rights of the owning class. The power structure of Saudi Arabia is fully compatible with capitalism as it exists throughout the \"west\" or the \"free world\". reply animal_spirits 2 hours agorootparentPublic ownership or private ownership, the capital owning class is going to fight for power. The difference is, almost all societies put the power over military and laws and taxation in the hands of the state. With public ownership (read state ownership) the incentives for the capital owning class is to control the state and the means to force (tax) people to pay for ridiculous projects like this Saudi line city in order to save their asses.

What's stopping them from hiring a private military and enslaving you? Who will stop them? The government which they control in this scenario? Power is power, whether it is private or public. The main reason I argue with people on here and come across as annoying is that the reflexive defence of capitalism by people living under it is conditioned into them by society. I would like for people to recognize that \"our guys\" do a just as much harm as \"the bad guys over there\" instead of rushing to justify some atrocity because well, it's our atrocity. reply animal_spirits 1 hour agorootparent> Who will stop them? The government which they control in this scenario The private sector does not control the government in this scenario. That is the difference. The private sector only controls its own property. Now if there is public ownership of property, then yes the capital owning class will resort to controlling the state to control the property, and thereby controlling the military to enforce the rules the capital owning class wants. reply animal_spirits 1 hour agorootparentprevWhere I live, the U.S. Military (and the constitution by which they swear an oath to defend) is stopping them. That is the importance of the word “legally”. There is a role to play for state governments, and that role is solely to protect the individual liberties of its citizens. Not to provide services or products. Tesla doesn’t send policemen to my door to intimidate me to buy their cars. But if I don’t pay my taxes… reply wormlord 1 hour agorootparentI agree with a lot of what you're saying. I don't think private firms need to be as ham-fisted as sending cops to your door though. If Tesla wants to increase car ownership, they just need to control a few key politicians to dismantle alternative forms of transporation. In an ideal world, liberal democratic governments would keep corporations under control while ensuring our individual rights, and corporations would provide goods and services at the lowest, most efficient rate. This is not the case in reality unfortunately. reply animal_spirits 51 minutes agorootparentThe only way politicians have the power over dismantling alternative forms of transportation is if the government has any control over building and maintaining transportation infrastructure, idk something like a Department of Transportation. Same goes for agriculture, finance, labor, healthcare… When we provide the government with these powers, it is within the self interest of corporations to control the politicians.

You'd need like 3.9 barrels of oil to make that plastic. Both a gas car and an EV will need this plastic. You're going to use almost 100x as much oil driving the car around than the plastics in the car. A 100x reduction in oil use is significant. Quit pushing lies about how EVs still use a significant amount of oil, as if they're pretty much the same. Either you should be aware of the falsehoods you're suggesting or you need to be informed. And no, the energy generation for an EV isn't anywhere near as significant as the oil use for burning in an ICE.

    "originBody": "Netflix Europe offices raided in tax fraud probe IMAGE SOURCE, GETTY IMAGES Image caption, French investigators raided Netflix's Paris offices on Tuesday morning Robert Greenall BBC News Published 5 hours ago Offices of streaming giant Netflix in Paris and Amsterdam have been raided by the French and Dutch authorities as part of an investigation into tax fraud, French judicial sources say. Officials from the two countries have been co-operating on the case since the investigation was opened in November 2022. Netflix has not as yet made any specific comment on the raids, but insists it complies with tax laws wherever it operates. The Amsterdam office is the headquarters of the company's operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The French investigation is being carried out by the National Financial Prosecutor's office (PNF), a special unit used for investigations into high-profile white-collar crime. It relates to suspicions of \"covering up serious tax fraud and off-the-books work\", according to the PNF. The company is also under investigation for tax filings for 2019, 2020 and 2021. The French sources said authorities in the Netherlands were conducting simultaneous searches, and that co-operation between the two countries had been going on for \"many months\". Last year, French media outlet La Lettre reported that until 2021, Netflix in France minimised its tax payments by declaring its turnover generated in France to the Netherlands. After it abandoned this arrangement, La Lettre said, its annual declared turnover in France jumped from €47.1m ($51.3m; £39.6m) in 2020 to €1.2bn in 2021. However, the outlet says investigators are trying to determine whether Netflix continued to attempt to minimise its profits after 2021. Netflix arrived in France more than 10 years ago, opening its Paris office in 2020. It has some 10 million subscribers in the country, according to AFP news agency.

At that point, whether you are in contempt or not depends on the answer to the question \"did you know that the cops were entering to look for evidence before you threw the keys?\" Whether the judge holds you in contempt or not is a function of the free choice of the judge and is not related to the answer to the first question (though whether or not the judge should hold you in contempt is a function of what the judge believes about what you believed). reply mewse-hn 47 minutes agorootparentprevThat metaphor doesn't seem directly applicable to cutting off cloud access. If we're trying for a metaphor that would be a similar situation pre-digitization, the cloud servers containing business documents could be considered head office, and the office being raided would be the branch office. The branch office would continually be communicating with head office for their operations, and that communication would be shut down during the raid. This isn't a great metaphor because the \"head office\" has become sort of stateless and ephemeral with digitization, but that's part of the interesting question the OP was posing, how does law enforcement collect evidence when that evidence is hosted on cloud servers in nebulous datacenters? reply eastbound 19 minutes agorootparentBy creating a law for seizing the IT system of a company. “Provide everything”, and if we later find that any other document existed back at that time, then it’s contempt of court. reply telotortium 27 minutes agorootparentprevThe keys still exist and are accessible.

Especially in the case of uber which is essentially using public infrastructure to make their money having them pay taxes should be normal. I agree that customer data needs to be protected, but it is bold to assume that is the case at all with these powerful corporate entities: if they lie to the state when filing taxes what makes you believe they are ernest when it comes to the protection of their users privacy? Maybe it is a weird ideology I am holding here, but the more powerful an entity is, the more transparent it should become — nowaday we got this completely reversed with poor people being naked in front of the state and big corps literally fooling everyone. Edit: some also seem to think the state is the behemoth that jumps on the poor little companies here.

Despite being the same company. (If it's in the parking lot then it's a maybe.) reply _bin_ 1 hour agorootparentprevNot necessarily. Depending on how the org's set up, the system may be permissioned to access too much stuff. I think justice systems should lean less on a general warrant - too much of a fishing expedition - and instead focus on subpoenas specifically related to their area of investigation. E.g. if they seize the CEO's computer on accounting or tax concerns, I sincerely doubt they showed a judge probable cause to seize, I don't know, new product designs. As such they should not be able to access them. reply sidewndr46 1 hour agorootparentThe point you're making is valid, but also exposes a common theme in litigation against big tech. It's pretty common to hear something like \"company XYZ used data ABC to train a model about their users and is court ordered to delete it\". It's unlikely that anyone in the justice system has even the slightest clue how to ascertain if this actually happened and certainly no way to prove it has been deleted. The court gives the order, the company says they have complied, & everyone pretends to go back to the way things were before hand. reply sidewndr46 1 hour agorootparentprevlet me just extrapolate this out a bit for you. I live in the US (yes I visited France once long ago, it was nice). I use Uber.

They'd have a pretty hard time proving destruction of evidence if 1. they didn't know for sure evidence was on that specific computer and 2. it was destroyed rather than just that the decryption key was removed from memory. Regardless, the government violating an individual's rights doesn't mean we should yell at uber, it means we should yell at the government. reply chollida1 1 hour agorootparentThese two issues are very far apart. Ross could argue he forgot his password to unlock the data in a single users case. In the corporate case it would be hard for Uber to argue that the entire company now has no access to any of the subpoenaed data. reply staticautomatic 2 hours agorootparentprevUnless it wasn’t destroyed, in which case it might be interring with an investigation, which is probably also illegal in France. reply Algent 1 hour agorootparentIt's definitely interference/obstruction at least of the raid itself yeah, but looking at the text and not being a lawyer I have a feeling it may be extremely hard to prosecute for something more substantial than a fine low enough for a french exec have it a as a guaranteed expense (bn€ in tax fraud vs a few k€ in fine).

Both the legal landscape and the moral landscape wrt it are very different in Europe, and trying to willingly evade taxes for example is tended to with a very heavy hand.

They pretend it's a simple marketing agency and that the real value is provided by the irish entity reply thrw42A8N 3 hours agorootparentDoesn't matter - you can't make any judgement without knowing these numbers. They may have actually paid a higher tax rate than previously - we don't know. reply lm28469 1 hour agorootparentFunny how it works, they lose money everywhere but one of the smallest country they operate in banks 50% of their worldwide revenues, it probably is just a coincidence that this is a tax heaven... we just don't know I guess The French branch made 160k of profit while the Irish branch made more than all the other EU countries combined FYI: france is the second market for airbnb after the US... do you really think they would even bother if they did make 160k there when they make 300m+ per year globally ? Do you really think their second market nets them So my effective tax rate on consumption is indexed on my ability to hide my assets? Where are you getting this from? Sales tax has nothing to do with one's assets. Also, land value taxes make hiding assets moot, since all real assets have to be stored on land.

If you are referring to purchasing it with cash and committing tax evasion, the same is possible with income tax today. >or maybe they lease it to me. Renting something is still considered a sale. You get charged sales tax at hotels. Renting apartments is not usually subject to sales tax, but that is a policy choice. reply thrw42A8N 3 hours agorootparentprevRevenue tax? We had that before the fall of the wall - not again please. The VAT system works well and should be used more. reply scotty79 3 hours agorootparentPurchase tax would work like reverse VAT. Companies could be awarded tax credits for their sales (not 100% though) and pay tax on their purchases. This would be harder to evade and additionally incentivise companies to do more with less which might be good for environmental transition. reply thrw42A8N 3 hours agorootparentWhy not 100%? How is that even supposed to work in low-margin markets like construction, where the profit is 100x less than the costs, so even 1% tax would erase it? But any markets really, this makes innovation and business so risky that I'd probably close down my IT company too. reply scotty79 3 hours agorootparentThe strength of markets is that they adjust to environment. Taxation is a part of the environment. Taxation would be just priced in. Why would it be risky to pay some percentage more on what you spend but not pay income tax at all? reply thrw42A8N 3 hours agorootparentMarkets will adjust, sure. It will be priced in, but that's the problem. They will become less efficient, quality will be worse, everything will be slower, more risk averse, and thus more expensive to the customer - that is necessary to survive in this new environment. That also means that people's income gets lower and grows slower. It'd be risky because I have no idea if I'm actually going to make money or not. European states set very draconian rules like 1% daily interest on unpaid taxes - no way I'm taking this shit on. Just do the same thing but with VAT... reply immibis 1 hour agorootparentprev... prices would increase to cover the tax? reply Aunche 2 hours agorootparentprev...or you can just use a VAT, which are also paid at purchase. Tech companies have high margins and low expenses, so if the point is to tax tech companies, taxing purchases and giving a credit to sales is literally the exact opposite of what you want to do. reply kbolino 4 hours agoparentprevIt's hard to accurately measure secretive crimes like this, but the estimates seem to put corporate tax evasion by percentage of GDP at either similar levels between the EU and US or actually higher in the EU. reply kranke155 3 hours agorootparentThe EU is just as corporatist as the US. The corporations just aren’t as big, but they control their local/national politics effectively. reply marcinzm 4 hours agoparentprevGiven Wirecard I wouldn’t assume the EU equally prosecutes or tracks crimes for EU and non-EU companies. reply DanielHB 3 hours agorootparentThey obviously target the companies the highest revenues. Also you would be suprised. For example Klarna, a Swedish company, is often in trouble with the Swedish tax authorities. A few years ago they had to pay huge amounts of money to the Swedish government because of some tax-dodging loophole was deemed illegal by court-order. So Klarna went into a desperate attempt to last-minute cut costs to not tank the stock value due to much lower expected returns that quarter. It was kinda funny because the employees of Klarna are unionized they couldn't just fire anyone on short notice like that, but they did let go pretty much all consultants in one swoop. If this was the US the CEO would have just fired a bunch of people because the CFO f-ed up. For a few months there was a major glut of former-Klarna consultants around in Stockholm, two of them ended up at my company at the time. I couldn't find details about this tax dodging online (it was around 5 years ago), but here is another article about Klarna being in trouble over GDPR violations: https://www.reuters.com/technology/swedens-klarna-fined-7330... reply Hamuko 3 hours agorootparentprevIsn't the Wirecard case still pending with execs in jail waiting for trial? reply lifestyleguru 5 minutes agorootparentThe protagonist vanished in Russia. reply marcinzm 2 hours agorootparentprevOnly after it all imploded did the government go after them.

Long time ago France Telecom bought Polish top phone network. Immediately rebranded it to Orange (despite the fact that the company had one of the strongest brands on market where it operated). Unsurprisingly the licensing fees for using Orange brand that the Polish company had to pay to France Telecom amounted to large percentage of taxable profits that the Polish company had. Overt theft from Polish company and Polish taxpayers. reply lifestyleguru 14 minutes agorootparentOhhh the memory of their atrocious and extortive services still raises my adrenaline.

Because that's how you get euroscepticism. reply mort96 4 minutes agorootparentI don't understand the problem honestly. I'd understand it if Poland stepped in and didn't let the company be bought out, but this just seems like bog standard normal globalized free market stuff? It would be extremely weird for France to step in and prevent a French company from buying a Polish company due to fears of stoking Euroscepticism among the polish population wouldn't it? And I don't even know what this has to do with the EU, companies have been buying up companies from other countries both in and out of the EU forever? reply yunohn 4 hours agoparentprevLiterally every single company that can afford to setup things like tax transfer schemes, are actively evading taxes. It’s mind boggling how widespread it is, how accepted (legal) it is, and how it will seemingly never be fixed. https://www.somo.nl/the-netherlands-still-a-tax-haven/ reply diggan 4 hours agorootparent> Literally every single company that can afford to setup these tax transfer schemes, are actively evading taxes. Yeah, but I think that's different than what happened in this case with Netflix. Declaring earnings from one country in another country is not just \"tax optimizations\" but straight up illegal. It's not using/abusing legal loopholes like most larger companies do, but going against the law. reply yunohn 4 hours agorootparentHonestly, I’m not sure. I find the premise of such tax laws to be illogical at a basic level. There are apparently always multiple ways to create legal loopholes. If we consider the Irish sandwich mechanism that was recently “stopped”, somehow that hasn’t materially affected any of the innumerable companies that were using it. As we saw in the Apple vs EU case, most practices might’ve never been actually legal either. So my personal opinion is that (almost) all tax “optimization” is at the minimum immoral, but most likely illegal too. Edit: This reminds me of the idea of temporarily embarrassed millionaires. Your personal optimization is not what I’m talking about - corporations have legal teams the size of SMBs lobbying/creating/looking for secret loopholes, and people are talking about public self service methods. reply sokoloff 3 hours agorootparentI'm sorry for my immoral behavior of generally holding investments for more than a year, contributing to my 401(k) and HSA accounts, buying an EV, and installing energy efficiency upgrades in my house, all of which are driven by tax optimization (at least in part). reply marcinzm 4 hours agorootparentprevIf a government says do X and I will cut your takes by Y then is doing X immoral? reply DrillShopper 3 hours agorootparentIt depends on what X is.

If X is \"lie to us about where your revenue came from\" then X is very much immoral. reply bryanrasmussen 3 hours agorootparentno government says \"lie to us about where your revenue came from and we will cut your taxes\" reply przemub 3 hours agorootparentprev@bryanrasmussen I wouldn't put it past the Irish one! reply yunohn 3 hours agorootparentprevIf a government “says”? These large companies actively campaign, draft, and lobby for the legal frameworks and loopholes that they exploit. The government and the companies are the same and are fighting for the same pot of tax money. reply seanhunter 3 hours agoparentprevYeah there's the so called \"Dutch Sandwich\"[1] which is a well-known tax \"planning\" methodology that corporates use with the so called \"Double Irish\" being another one. There's also a slightly less-well known one involving Mauritius and India. They're all ways of moving profits between companies in order to exploit tax treaties that countries put in place. In the case of the Dutch sandwich I think the Netherlands has a treaty with the Netherlands Antilles or something so people have a company in the Netherlands which then shifts things off-shore to the Antilles and avoids tax that way. It's nonsense of course. Companies should (in my opinion) shoulder their fair share of tax because otherwise that burden falls disproportionately on individual income tax. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Sandwich reply s_dev 3 hours agorootparentYour information is outdated -- Double Irish is no longer applicable according to your own source since 2010. reply yunohn 3 hours agorootparentNo, it’s much more complicated than that. If you scroll a bit further: > After pressure from the EU,[22] the Double Irish BEPS tool was closed to new users in 2015,[citation needed] however, new Irish BEPS tools were created to replace it:[23][24] Not only do the original evaders get to continue doing it, they’ve also found new loopholes already. reply Muromec 2 hours agorootparentIt's like eruv. The loophole was planted there for us mortals to find and use it reply tiahura 3 hours agorootparentprevWhat’s the rationale for double taxing corporate profits vs other types? reply seanhunter 3 hours agorootparentNo rationale for that, but likewise no rational reason that corporates sholud be able to use multinational structures to completely avoid tax, which is what these planning structures are all about. Typically there are inter-company transfer pricing arrangements that mean that the companies in the taxed jurisdictions pay fees to each other so their profits are minimised and as much profit as possible is expatriated to low- or no-tax jurisdictions. reply _ink_ 3 hours agoparentprevIs it illegal, tho? reply salawat 4 hours agoparentprevIt isn't really accepted anywhere, but there is a group of people who will make it their goal in life to get up to any shady practice to try to shortchange or dodge their local host polity to their ultimate advantage. The tax dodge, if you will, becomes something of a pass time and point of pride for them. This becomes more difficult as more tax authorities better integrate with one another, which admittedly, is something many in in the U.S. fidget over, even if it is realized that the need for it is almost entirely a byproduct of these types of people's actions that necessitate that happening. reply orangepanda 4 hours agoprevIs a mini-series about this already greenlit? reply 23B1 4 hours agoparentyes but it was cancelled after becoming too popular reply I_am_tiberius 2 hours agoprevI know I'm likely alone in this opinion, but corporate income tax seems like a poorly designed tax to me. Why should companies pay taxes in a year with high profits, even if they face losses for the next ten years? Why should I pay corporate income tax when dividends and income are taxed anyway? Corporate income tax also seems to heavily influence business strategies as a consequence, which wasn't its intended purpose. reply aithrowawaycomm 0 minutes agoparentAny corporation uses roads, mail, police, courts, and other public services, and this usage is not offset by individual income taxes on that corporation's employees, since the employees also use these things. In fact I suspect more resources are spent on serving corporations than serving individual taxpayers - with the important caveat that I am specifically excluding government social insurance programs. But those are often a totally separate tax system. It is baffling to think that for-profit corporations should be allowed to use public services without paying for them: before a company makes further internal investments with new revenue, it should chip in to society for building the infrastructure that made the revenue possible. A corporate income tax is perfectly natural way. reply tnolet 2 hours agoparentprevThe world of tax is complex. Business exist in many shapes and sizes. So... - because companies heavily use government resources like roads and stuff. - because losses can be offset against profits. These tend to be middled out over multiple years. You can port losses to other years. - a lot of companies (holdings etc.) don't pay out income tax and are basically just letterbox companies. These companies need to pay tax on dividends otherwise they would literally pay zero tax. reply I_am_tiberius 1 hour agorootparent> - because losses can be offset against profits. These tend to be middled out over multiple years. You can port losses to other years. These losses expire (different from country to country)!! Plus, inflation is not taken into account. > a lot of companies (holdings etc.) don't pay out income tax and are basically just letterbox companies. These companies need to pay tax on dividends otherwise they would literally pay zero tax. Tax on dividends is not corporate income tax. Dividend tax is classified as capital gains tax, which is entirely separate. My point is that anyone taking out money must pay taxes through personal income tax or dividend tax. So corporate income tax is just money that would be taxed anyway - or invested/used by the company. So no real purpose other than producing another cash inflow for the government. reply sensanaty 2 hours agoparentprevWhy shouldn't companies pay taxes? Especially since income is taxed already and your average Joe gets screwed way more than the poor downtrodden billion dollar companies. reply I_am_tiberius 1 hour agorootparentBecause a company just invests the money. You can't take out money from a company as an owner without taxing it anyway (because you anyway have to pay capital gains tax / personal income tax). My point was that I don't see a point in having corporate income tax (that's just an additional tax that prevents companies from investing in the business and employees). reply immibis 1 hour agorootparent\"Invests the money\" means it sits in their bank account until they've convinced enough politicians that the money should be taxed as it comes into the company, not when it goes out, and then they issue a massive dividend. reply closeparen 2 hours agoparentprevWhether you earn and save a given dollar as a W2 worker or through a business you own seems pretty incidental, right?

Last year, at a Panera-catered “new faculty appreciation” luncheon, the Dean of my college told me—as I folded my hands across my seven-months-pregnant belly—that I should look for long-term academic employment elsewhere. My research and practice was not centered enough on “AI” and “emerging technology” to fit within the institution; they wanted someone with more of an explicit emphasis on tech. My work in publishing, writing, web-design—and even my reproductive state—couldn’t possibly be separated from these things, but, more than any other effects AI may have on humanity in the future, this is one of the main effects now: people feel compelled to talk about it, and it’s a good way for sclerotic institutions to feel like they’re keeping up with the times. I smiled, thanked him, and left with an M&M cookie. Earlier this month, at the recommendation of a colleague, I registered to attend a Zoom seminar that boasted a discussion on “the future of design education and academia.” As the Zoom window expanded, I was met with a looping Pornhub threesome montage next to a side-screen grid of six or so designers front-facing the camera. The hosts clicked around, grunting and gasping as the camera cut to new angles and positions. I opened my department group chat and texted my colleagues OH NO. DO NOT JOIN THE CALL. The colleague who recommended the talk echoed me: DO NOT LOG IN! SOMEONE Hacked their Zoom. The hosts spoke to each other saying things like: I think it’s you. Wait. Oh wait. No. This type of thing happened all the time during Covid. So annoying. Who is *bot-generated-username*? It was a long two minutes before someone finally had the sense to end the call. A few hours later, a nearby university, who employs one of the guest speakers, posted a carousel of screenshots on their Instagram page from the talk, which had apparently reconvened. The description read Thanks to our Program Director ************** for an amazing panel discussion on the future of design education & academia today! 🚀 I tried to follow up with the panel about what happened, and received no reply. The way this talk was handled reminded me that technology, for all its promise of connection and innovation, can have real and tangible repercussions if we’re not careful—it illuminates our fundamental responsibility to one another. In “A Rant about Technology,” Ursula K. Le Guin says that technology is how a society copes with physical reality. That it is the active human interface with the material world. Technology is also a spoon. Technology is also language. Yet, I am shocked when AI does not stop Outlook Messenger from bursting confetti across my desktop in response to the Congratulations reply I receive when HR misreads my email about both adding and removing our late son from my health insurance. As a 6th grader in a Dallas suburb, I attended a school assembly where a traveling speaker talked to us about sex. He said that sex was like fire. It was a life force. The discovery of fire sparked a massive advance of civilization. He told us that if we were not careful with fire, if we did not watch it closely and respect the power that it held, we could burn down a whole village. He told us to start a fire someday, but only with someone who you trusted to tend to it while you slept. I believe now that this same sort of diligence must also be extended to our use of technology. This year I experienced many technological interventions to my body, as many do when they become pregnant. Of all the new ways to be measured and monitored, my favorite was when my sister-in-law, due just a few weeks before me, guessed my midsection's exact circumference with a piece of string. My least favorite was the transvaginal ultrasound. My OB in Virginia had a sort of nonchalance and slapstick humor to him that initially made me feel comfortable in his office. The temperature changed during my nine week appointment when he, quite unexpectedly, shook the ultrasound wand inside of me (with vigor!) in an attempt to wake the baby for the pictures. He mutter-yelled Move little bugger. Move! I looked to the nurse witness, who looked forward at the door. We received a letter in December that his practice would be closing in April. We received another at the end of summer telling us that he had died. During this same pregnancy, another doctor does imaging on me, externally. With the wand in his hand in the almost pitch black room he tells us that there are two small and one moderate-sized holes in our son’s heart and that he will need to be rushed to surgery as soon as he is born. I am still fully reclined and covered in gel. He tells us to come back in two weeks. On his walk out of the room he hands us an information pamphlet where he drew on the back two versions of the human heart—one normal, one our situation. Because of this experience, we transfer care to Massachusetts, where my husband’s family lives and works in the medical field. We navigate this with someone who is known as “The worldwide head of second opinion.” At the new hospital the gel is cleared off my belly each time. I cry in the ultrasound room as the video of the baby in my belly is labeled “practice breathing.” The sonographer walks us to a conference room where we’re met with cardiac specialists, social workers and obstetrics. Our meetings are prefaced with This is going to be a hard conversation and when we stand up to leave the room, we are encouraged to take the entire box of tissues with us. Someone even goes to the cupboard to get us a new box, of superior quality and softness. We are told that we may not get to meet him, but we do. The windowless OR looks perfectly encapsulated in pure even daylight. We have a team of thirty people and everyone knows the choreography. The anesthesiologist tells me that I may feel a shock of sorts before she administers a liquid into my spine. I am beaming. I feel strong and I wait for the shock. I squeal. The staff echos my laughter when I tell them that it feels like I sat on a firecracker. They had not heard that one before. The team yells out Happy Birthday Henry! as he is lifted from my abdominal cavity, screaming and alive. The anesthesiologist tells us with urgency to touch him and she guides our hands to meet his head through the dividing screen. I keep my fingers at the place he fogged the plastic as he is carried away to receive care. While my layers are being stitched up, my husband notices that the TVs near the ceiling are screening the surgery from above. When a nurse sees him watching, they switch off the monitors. The birth was photographed by our social worker, who printed and laminated the images. A whole stack is waiting for us in our room on the meal tray when we return. When I see him next, there is a whole room dedicated to beating his heart. I am wheeled to his side and told not to worry about the beeping, it is just an indication of a new switch to flip. That it is not as time sensitive as it sounds. Henry wraps his hand around my finger, then around the beak of his woodpecker Jellycat. He is on a high platform and adorned in wires and tubing like some sort of cybernetic king. One part of the room-machine spins constantly. It whirls and re-oxygenates the donor blood that has exited him in a slightly less vibrant shade of red than what entered. He fights for two days. On his third, when he chooses peace, it is the quietest room I have ever endured. The cardiologist encloses us with the curtain and lets us stay as long as we can. We have a mass in Henry’s name. Afterward, family comes over. They bring food and two new pink babies. I hold my niece and keep checking that my hair does not wrap around her fingers. Our dog screams in the face of the two-year-old cousin, who seems completely unaffected. He says “dog” and pats him. He points to the angel on the mantle and says “Amen.” We set up a small box in the living room with photographs printed out from the hospital. As his mother, I feel protective of his image. I do not want people to look at him on their phones. I want to be in control of how he is seen in his corporeal form. I want people to sit on the couch and hold him, looking together at the same time and passing him around as they would any other baby. I become upset when I log in to Facebook for the first time in years, to sell a lamp, and see that some of our pictures from the hospital were posted to the family’s facebook group. I stew on this for a while, then release it when my husband reminds me about when they were posted, his first good day on the ECMO machine. We were two proud normal parents. They were asking the family for prayers. During the next three months, I look at his pictures for fifteen minutes every three hours to trigger a milk letdown. I imagine kissing his head and can still taste his baptismal holy water on my lips. Smell the perfumed oil. I nurse a small machine all summer and a refrigerated car comes by to pick up the milk that will be processed, divided, and sent off to babies I will never know. My husband wakes up in the middle of the night to wash the flanges, label the bags, and place them in the freezer. At home, we keep a white noise machine of the ocean waves playing in the bedroom at all times. We have done this for years, but I only just now am paying attention to it. When my dog unplugs it, I notice its absence. Earlier this spring my department chair threw me a baby shower. My students ate cupcakes and giggled as we failed to answer baby related pop-culture trivia from the 80’s. At the end of summer I send them a sad email to thank them for their patience last year and I ask for it again. This fall I sit in class with them, smiling as laughter bubbles from the corners of their mouths in response to the recording I play of Richard Brautigan reciting this poem: Text within this block will maintain its original spacing when published I like to think (and the sooner the better!) of a cybernetic meadow where mammals and computers live together in mutually programming harmony like pure water touching clear sky. I like to think (right now, please!) of a cybernetic forest filled with pines and electronics where deer stroll peacefully past computers as if they were flowers with spinning blossoms. I like to think (it has to be!) of a cybernetic ecology where we are free of our labors and joined back to nature, returned to our mammal brothers and sisters, and all watched over by machines of loving grace. I took part in another Zoom call this week. Henry’s cord blood was collected for research and after five months, the results came back. They were able to find the exact single gene mutation that caused his condition, and explained everything. They assured us that it was not our well water, or the time I had a fever for 15 minutes, or leptospirosis from cat-sitting, or that I ate an underdone yolk. The doctors said that with the variation he had, they were surprised that he was able to make it to two days old. My friend Mary texted me a message her late father used to say about heaven. We are there before we’re born and God asks us if we want to come down to Earth even though it will be painful and hard. Seems Henry wanted badly to be yours and to meet you if only for a single shining day. Neither my husband nor I carry this gene. And the doctors tell us that the same thing is unlikely to repeat. They clear us to try again this year. Lately, my husband and I have been watching a lot of TV together. Football when we’re grading so we don’t have to see the Patriots lose. And movies at night. There is a scene in the film Magnolia by Paul Thomas Anderson where frogs begin falling from the sky. They drop to the pavement violently, cars crash, and there is a little boy sitting in a library at a desk looking out the window cracking a half smile in wonder. Shadows of amphibious bodies cast on the wall behind him as he says out loud This happens. This is something that happens.

Power accumulates quietly to the people who know the rules and can bend them often. In those situations the powerless are even more vulnerable to the powerful because of the lack of an explicit power structure with rules that would usually require checks and balances in order for people to opt into the system. reply kreyenborgi 8 hours agorootparent> In a community that has no explicit rules, implicit rules emerge This is The Tyranny of Structurelessness: https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm reply mjburgess 11 hours agorootparentprevAnd how often do we hear a demand to 'direct' democracy, egalitarianism, the end of policing, and so on.. from those with a-little-to-much but clearly not-enough, power? There's rarely anything more in people's political prescriptions other than, \"I do not have enough power, and I want more\" -- and there's nothing inherently wrong with this demand. Only that when it is disguised by the false promise of power for everyone, it means power for almost no one. reply soco 9 hours agorootparentNow now, let's not forget that there are already direct democracies at work in the world ahemtzerland and the general inland consensus is that they work. reply dbspin 7 hours agorootparentYes - and there are hundreds of thousands of small groups applying principles of direct democracy in practice, from democratic schools to consensus based art centres. People have been collectively organising movements and spaces for many decades now, and the processes are pretty well worked out. Comparing utopian dropouts in the 60's running farms on vibes to dedicated activists establishing and maintaining consensus based social contracts is disingenuous. There's plenty to be criticised in terms of the practical aspects of these systems - from implementation to scalability, and good luck to the folks doing the hard work of improving them. But dismissing them out of hand is an argument from ignorance. reply Nevermark 6 hours agorootparent> small groups applying principles of direct democracy Small groups. That is the problem. It can work but doesn't scale. As the number of people go up, the need and benefits of more complex coordination go up. People's interactions, dependencies, needs, understandings and problems multiply in quantity, complexity and diversity. People O(n). Decisions O(n^2). Direct coordination becomes too costly in time and effort. And people get asked to make decisions in areas where they have no skin in the game, so put little care into their decisions, or seek selfish benefits opportunistically. Things get difficult and ugly. The default is a descent into anarchy, which gets counter weighted by emergent initiatives that centralize decision making around people who care, have expertise, are good at taking power, etc. Acknowledged or not, \"direct\", as the universal principle of decision making, no longer works. Better to see it coming and as directly and openly as possible, prescribe how indirect governance is to be done. As openly and accountably as possible. Organizations and societies, like computer memory and and processing cores in server centers, need to bifurcate and modularize into different levels, types and policies, to remain efficient and reliable at scale. reply soco 6 hours agorootparentOnce again for the last row: Switzerland. 9 millions inhabitants, 5.5 millions with voting rights, 0 anarchy. Is that still not big enough for the no true scotsman? reply Nevermark 6 hours agorootparentThey have councils and parties, classic institutions of centralization and decision delegation. The people in those organizations, especially the leaders, have tremendous outsized power to decide and frame what issues and candidates are exposed to votes by the democracy as a whole. And of course, in the best position to maintain their own positions or set up their successors chances. So no - they are not a direct democracy. For the unavoidable reasons I gave. However yes, they are doing a fantastic and inspiring job of maintaining as much directness as possible. And at keeping the centralized and indirect processes formalized, open and accountable. Vs. the US, where even the president isn't elected directly; lower offices are heavily controlled by whoever draws district maps, often the incumbents; only two parties have much power, and conspire together to maintain that - reducing citizen choices to only two preset menus of policies & governance styles; parties enforce litmus tests on their own candidates at all levels of office, vastly increasing party leadership power at the expense of eliminating 99% of potential alternative views. The result of all this power hoarding are many laws in significant opposition to majority views, and an institutionalization of two way service and influence with the rich. The highest court nomination process and members of the highest court have become aggressively politicized and brazenly unethical. Overall, the US system has become increasingly dysfunctional, corrupt, divisive and dystopian.

Right wing ideologies are almost entirely based on which group should obey which other group and why. The term left-wing has gotten a little vague recently, but I think you could say that the common premise of most of their political theory is that there's already/always going to be a powerful government that everyone has to obey so we might as well make that government the best it can possibly be for as many people as possible.

That seems to me something academic departments interested in AI research need now more than ever.

Neither I nor anyone in my immediate bubble go along with the fanaticism, it's an exciting new tool with lots of potential, but a tool among many nonetheless. I want to prevent everyone else from getting distracted by the shininess of it all, because the world really needs all these scientists and organizations to keep progressing the substantial work they are best at. The recent Nobel in physics was the perfect example, and I think HN echoed the general feeling that we mightily respect the field, probably above what we are doing, and that it is an outrage for it to get overshadowed like that. It's also weird to see how not being focused on AI is disrupting so many people, but being focused on AI doesn't help you that much either. It is definitely not the trump-card people think it is with investors, and even less with the market. Sometimes it is better not to emphasize it because it cheapens the whole thing!

And I think people underestimate the amount of control a donation to an educational institution gets the donor, unless they are very cynical. I do not claim or believe that \"AI\" is useless. I do firmly believe that on top of the foundation of useful stuff that it can do, some of it if anything underutilized and understudied (I agree with an article in HN a few days back that embeddings are really underutilized and studied versus all this generative stuff which is a lot less interesting than meets the eye), there is a staggeringly enormous bubble. And with that bubble, a lot of well-resourced people motivated to keep it inflated, as there always is.

    "title": "Blog Writing for Developers (2023)",
    "originLink": "https://rmoff.net/2023/07/19/blog-writing-for-developers/",
    "originBody": "Writing is one of the most powerful forms of communication, and it’s useful in a multitude of roles and contexts. As a blog-writing, documentation-authoring, twitter-shitposting DevEx engineer I spend a lot of my time writing. Recently, someone paid me a very nice compliment about a blog I’d written and asked how they could learn to write like me and what resources I’d recommend. Never one to miss a chance to write and share something, here’s my response to this :) To begin with I want to cover briefly the motivations behind writing. Why Do I Write? 🔗 Firstly, I like to share information. That could be a new tool or technique that I’ve learnt, a clever trick I’ve discovered, or sometimes away from the technical and into the realms of life pondering and navel gazing. In the case of this very blog, it’s to share my thoughts on something that interests me. I could have written some notes and sent them directly back to the person who asked the original question, but if it was useful to them it’s hopefully useful to others—so therefore it’s worth writing up and publishing. The second reason that I’ll write is to learn about something. It’s one thing to hand-wave one’s way through a presentation. It’s another to commit pen to paper (well, bytes to disk) and explain something. Quite often I’ll realise that there’s a gap—or gaps—in my knowledge that I need to explore first before I can properly write about something, and that’s the very reason that I do it. There are several pleasant side-effects from writing too. Anything in the public domain (such as your blog, but also open-source project documentation, etc) helps establish your credibility in an area and awareness by others of you. We may never reach the stratospheric heights of someone such as Kelsey Hightower, who has wowed a generation of developers with their Tetris-playing skills, but being known as that guy who wrote a really useful blog that helped others is still a really nice feeling :) HOW do I Write for Developers? 🔗 🛑 STOP! Watch This First 🎥 🔗 Go and watch this excellent lecture called The Craft of Writing Effectively. It’s given by Larry McEnerney who is the Director of the University of Chicago’s Writing Program and knows a thing or two about writing. There are direct parallels between his observations on how and why academics communicate, and communication between developers. 👉🏻 I’ve seen it recommended several times but to my embarrassment, the length put me off—but I wish it hadn’t as it’s superb. If you’d rather listen instead of watch you can use yt-dlp to download it as audio (--extract-audio --audio-format mp3). So, how do I write for developers? 🔗 Each writer will have their own approach to writing, and it will vary based on the audience and purpose too. A report for publication in an academic journey will have a different structure to a shitpost on Twitter. A blog aimed at developers will read very differently from the documentation from the depths of a product manual. Each medium and audience is valid; the knack is making sure that your writing lines up with it. When I write I try to write for myself—a developer, interested in a thing. That could be a new technology, an in-depth explanation, a random musing on life, or anything else. Would I like to read the thing I’ve read? Does it avoid the pitfalls that plague the soulless bland crap that some companies churn out, stick an emoji on, and call developer marketing? There are three key dimensions that it’s useful to consider here: clarity personality (also called voice) uniformity of content. You can roughly overlay these dimensions across the range of written materials that we might write: Things aren’t always so simple, and for some platforms in particular there’s quite a range: What do these different dimensions mean in practice? Let’s explore that. Clarity is Key 🔗 The first of these dimensions is pretty straightforward and shouldn’t really vary. Whatever you write, for whomever you write it, it has to be clear. Writing clearly means everything from sentence construction and paragraph breaks through to the structure of your article. It can be surprisingly hard to do but is crucial if you want to write material that people will want to read. One neat trick when it comes to clarity is to remember that what you leave out is as important as what you leave in. This is going to be very context-specific. Documentation, by definition, should be comprehensive. A blog, on the other hand, might want to get to the point sooner and just provide a link to background material for the reader should they want it. Less is often more, as they say. Some types of writing are going to have greater scope for individuality than others, but all have the potential to at least be accessible and clear. For example, just because you’re writing documentation doesn’t give you a pass to copy and paste the requirements doc in all its generic and obscure complexity. Write documentation that you as a developer would like to read. It can be complex and precise, yet still accessible. Personality and Voice 🔗 Should the ‘voice’ of the author be allowed to come through in the writing? This is very much a sliding scale. I’ve jotted down some of the characteristics you might associate with either extreme of the scale. This is not to say that by definition you’d put cuss words into a blog so as to convey your voice—but as an example of something that you might see at that end of the spectrum and definitely not at the other. How you decide where to pitch your voice on this scale will come down to your preference, audience, and general area and discipline. If you spend much time on Twitter you’ll notice that InfoSec Twitter is different from DevOps Twitter, which is different again from DataEng Twitter. Each has its own cliques and customs, and also a varying range to which an author’s voice shines through in published writing. You’ll generally find that generally writing mediums such as a project report to stakeholders or product documentation requires a neutral voice. That’s not to say boring, but it is to say that a certain uniformity is required. In the case of a project report, the message mustn’t be obscured by colloquialisms and the such. And can you imagine the cognitive dissonance if a set of documentation were written by multiple writers each looking to stamp their personality on the pages? When we get to things like blogs and other types of writing we deliberately want to include some personality. How much is up to you to calibrate with your audience and yourself. There is a “Goldilocks” zone here—enough personality and genuine voice coming through to convince the reader that they are reading something that was written by someone who is actually interested and informed on the matter, but not so much that it gets in the way of the content. Uniformity and Standardisation 🔗 This has a strong relationship with personality and voice but relates a lot more to the structure and content of the material Using the example of blogs, you’ll find that blogs for a company or project are going to have a strong focus on the consistency of messaging and structure. There’ll be an introduction, there’ll be context; it’ll be comprehensive. Compare that to a personal blog that may sometimes be not much more than the gutterings of a developer wanting to log an error message and solution for future Googlers. They might flesh it out into a longer article, but that’s not necessary for it still to have value. A Holistic View 🔗 It may seem like there’s going to be a linear relationship between the two dimensions. As we decrease the amount of personality coming through in an author’s writings, we’re also going to move towards a much more standardised set of writing. I’d suggest that it’s not always the case. A startup may value personality much more over standardisation, perhaps only really dropping the voice when it comes to something like documentation (and even then, perhaps not entirely). At the other end of the scale, some companies—usually large corporations—have the habit of squeezing the last inch of life out of any kind of writing, making the relationship a much different one. Here there’s little voice even where you might hope to find it, and that rapidly drops off into nothing very soon after: The wildcard within this is the social media teams of large companies who are given the remit to be Funny and Engaging, but this is usually outside the scope of developer writing and more into the field of condiments and fast food chains Structuring your Blog Writing 🔗 Like a favourite pair of jeans that’s well-worn, comfy, and slightly saggy round the arse, I have a go-to structure for writing. Come to think of it, I use it for lots of conference talks too. It looks like this: Tell them what you’re going to tell them Tell them Tell them what you told them What this looks like in practice is something along these lines: An intro What is this thing, and why should the reader give af be interested? This could be a brief explanation of why I am interested in it, or why you would want to read my take on it. The key thing is you’re relating to your audience here. Not everyone wants to read everything you write, and that’s ok. Let people self-select out (or in, hopefully) at this stage, but make it nice and easy. For example, if you’re writing about data engineering, make it clear to the appdev crowd that they should move on as there’s nothing to see here (or stick around and learn something new, but as a visitor, not the target audience). The article itself A recap Make sure you don’t just finish your article with a figurative mic drop—tie up it nicely with a bow (a 🙇🏻 or a 🎀, either works). This is where marketing would like to introduce you to the acronym CTA (Call To Action) 😉. As an author you can decide how or if to weave that into your narrative. Either way, you’re going to summarise what you just did and give people something to do with it next. Are there code samples they can go and run or inspect? A new service to sign up for? A video to watch? Or just a general life reflection upon which to ponder. ✍🏻 The Physical Act of Writing: JFDI ;-) 🔗 At the risk of repeating the owl meme I would give the following advice: just start writing! I don’t mean just go write an article. I mean start writing something, anything. Some notes, some snippets, some whole paragraphs. It might even look like this The point is you now have something. The sections and threads of a story start to fall out as you write more. What starts as one section perhaps becomes two as you realise there are individual elements to tease out. Iterate, iterate, and then iterate some more. That random link you made a note of, where does it fit in what you want to say? Is it pushing the need for a new section or tangent, or is it actually not so relevant and you can park it? Not sure? Well just leave it there and think about it again on the next pass round. I’ve recently found that using a Pomodoro timer is an effective way of getting me to focus, and to take a break. Instead of staring at a screen, descending into a pit of despair at the stagnation of an article, you spend a chunk of time and then step away. Perhaps you come back to it after the break or maybe wait longer. Like many problems in life, things resolve themselves given time to marinade in the recesses of one’s brain. That paragraph that just wouldn’t write itself will come spilling out of your eager fingers onto the keyboard. The section you thought you’d nailed—turns out you didn’t and it needs a rewrite. But all these things come with time and iteration through the text. Find a really good reviewer and copyeditor 🔗 You might think you’re good at writing. You’re probably not that good at writing that the eye of an excellent copyeditor won’t improve it, nor the tactful input of a good reviewer enhance it. Good copyeditors will respect the voice that’s present in your writing and work to preserve it whilst improving the clarity and grammatical accuracy of what you’ve written. Good reviewers will grok what you’re saying and help distil and mould it into a better shape. Tools 🔗 Ah, the meta-blog post about tooling. Each to their own, but here’s my stack: Obsidian for authoring CleanShot X for screen grabs and markup Grammarly for proofreading (and please, for the sak of your readers, profread, noone wnats to red a baydly writen blog) Hugo and GitHub Pages for publishing and hosting Resources 🔗 A useful list of resources from Gareth Dwyer 📧 An email-based course called Blogging for Devs. It’s quite focussed on the mechanics of a blogging but has some useful nuggets - and it’s free 📕Technical Blogging, by Antonio Cangiano Avoiding Anti-patterns in Technical Communication - good conference talk from Sophie Watson A nice blog from Dmitry Kudryavtsev on Why engineers should focus on writing Technical Writing Courses - Google Developers Footnote: What Should I Write? 🔗 We’ve covered the why and the how - but what about the what? What to write will often come from the “Why” above, but let’s imagine that the creative juices aren’t flowing and you still really want to get a blog written. A really excellent place for ideas is the community around the thing you want to write about. Go and lurk (or even better, join in) at StackOverflow, Twitter, Slack, Discord…wherever the community is: What questions do people repeatedly ask? What are the anti-patterns and misunderstandings that you see? What are the new trends? What cool things can you do with $THING In short, if it would be interesting to me then I would write about it. Make sure to also watch this lecture in which the concept of value and ideas is discussed. tl;dr if you aren’t writing about something interesting to the reader, it has no value, regardless of its value to you. What Not to Write? 🔗 This is a very personal preference. I’m not keen at all on growth-driven blogging styles. You know the sort: listicles, SEO bait, etc. It’s low-grade, developers see through it, and it tarnishes the blogger’s image IMHO. That said, if you write a good blog, there’s no reason not to structure it such (“Top Five Tips for Successful Developer Writing”) but put the horse before the cart, not the other way around. Recap 🔗 To summarise this whole article, bear in mind that these two statements are not mutually exclusive: Write for yourself. Work out what you would like to read, and write it. Think of the reader and what value you’re providing to them in your writing. That’s because as a developer writing for developers, you are the reader. Oh, and did you watch Larry McEnerney’s lecture yet? 😊",

A really big point Larry tries to make during his lecture is that there are 2 types of writing. One you do for yourself (to help clear your ideas) and the other and the other one is designed to valuable to the reader. And he is pretty obsessed with the idea of writing valuable text. He even says that if your text isn't valuable there is no point in making it persuasive, organized or clear. For me this was a pretty interesting revelation. For most of my life I had this idea that the quality of the content and the quality of the writing were tightly related. And this idea made me believe that if you have good content, good writing should follow naturally. After watching this lecture I realized that content and writing are separated axis, and you can definitely have one without the other. LLMs are pretty good at writing without content, for example. reply kkdai 14 hours agoprevI’ve been writing a technical blog for over 20 years, and I believe that each blog post helps me think more deeply, examining every source and related code carefully. This process has been incredibly valuable to me, and even in the LLM era of 2024, I still enjoy blogging. Often, the primary user of my blog is myself; I go back to my past entries to help guide further research and exploration.

Don't hold onto a piece until you think it's good enough - always publish when you know that there are improvements you could still make. The alternative is a folder full of drafts and never publishing anything at all. With the exception of egregious errors none of your readers will ever know how much better your piece of writing could have been. reply kstrauser 2 hours agoparentprevThat tracks for me.

To get over this I just made simple personal blog/site using GH pages/jekyll/markup that doesn't have 1. A marketing version of a \"publish\" function and 2. the posts are perpetually in DRAFT.

However, something to remember is that, even when you're right, you'll still be wrong to many people on the internet. My biggest barrier to getting back into blogging is the low return on investment.

Everyone seems to rely on YouTube/TikTok, ChatGPT, mainstream news articles, and maybe whatever blogspam The Google decides to surface.

Do not skip the lecture video! reply Syonyk 22 hours agoprev> The second reason that I’ll write is to learn about something. It’s one thing to hand-wave one’s way through a presentation. It’s another to commit pen to paper (well, bytes to disk) and explain something. Quite often I’ll realise that there’s a gap—or gaps—in my knowledge that I need to explore first before I can properly write about something, and that’s the very reason that I do it. This is a very good reason to write - I've learned about a ton of topics over the years at depths I wouldn't have bothered with if I weren't going to write blogposts about it. I really didn't need to spend a year chewing through other people's PhD work to understand some of the quirks of lead acid battery behavior I was seeing years back (Steve on IRC's description covered the details well enough to work around it), but if I was going to write it up[0], I wanted to actually understand it. And that took time. But it misses one of the most important reasons I write: To force myself to finish projects and document things, so I can fully offload it from my brain. I'm very prone to \"90% done, eh, good enough, I'll finish it later...\" sort of projects, and they take up a lot of mental space because I still have to (or, at least, try to...) remember state on the project. Before I write about something, I want it fully done, and then as part of writing it up, I trust myself to document anything weird, any odd findings, etc. Once I've done that, then I can entirely forget the details of the project, teardown, or whatever, knowing that if I need to do it again, I can go reference my old writeup and I'll know what I need to do! Once written, I can just clear the brain-space out, and not worry about forgetting about it, because it's been written up, by me, in my style. Also, copy editors and reviewers start to sound more like professional writing than \"blogging,\" at least to me.

There's so many articles in tech where the writer probably has less experience with something than literally anyone who will read their post, and it means there's effectively a content farm of what a new software engineer will learn in their first few months (if not years) on the job, written by software engineers in their first few months, with effectively no net information. reply simonw 18 hours agorootparentI'll offer the opposite perspective. People writing about stuff that they are currently learning is often better, because they have a much clearer model of what's obvious and what isn't. Someone with 20 years of experience with a technology will usually have a much harder time re-connecting with that beginner's mindset and doing a great job of providing the information that other newcomers most need to understand. That's not to say that there isn't plenty of junk content out there, but I blame that more on inexperienced writers than on people who are writing about technology that they don't have a great deal of experience with. A great writer should be able to write about something while they're learning while still producing content that's genuinely useful. reply Groxx 16 hours agorootparentBut they should still present themselves accurately, because at that stage they don't know what they don't know and they may be misleading people without realizing it. reply simonw 6 hours agorootparentThis is why I like the TIL format.

    "originBody": "Pagination widows, or, Why I’m embarrassed about my ebook 15th October 2023 Web standards, Browsers, Typography, CSS techniques, Apple The physical copies of my book on Web Typography sold out quickly. I self-published, and print runs are expensive when you’re funding them yourself, so numbers were limited. However it was always my plan to publish an ebook at the same time, and that has out-sold the hard copy by an order of magnitude. I set myself some pretty stiff criteria for the ebook – it needed to replicate the design of print edition as far as possible, adapting to the medium when required. To this day I’m proud of the result. I completely hand-coded the ePub (meaning it’s mostly HTML and CSS under the hood), and I believe the effort paid off. If you’ll forgive the rather un-British boasting, I still think it’s one of the more advanced ebooks out there: with embedded fonts, SVG images, alt text, bold typographic heirarchy, Javascript-driven syntax highlighting and what I hope is a nuanced, highly readable overall design. Not bad for an ebook anyway, although I’ll grant you the bar is not set high (notable exceptions include A Book Apart publications). All hubris aside, I am still frequently embarrassed by how the ebook renders, particularly in Apple Books. Like a well structured webpage, my book uses a lot of headings and subheadings – I wrote it to be referenced as much as to be read, so this helps the scanability of the text. However Apple Books, and other WebKit, Gecko, or old Blink-powered ebook readers will happily do this to headings: Notice the orphaned heading “Lean on six centuries of typesetting experience” with its following paragraph out of sight on the next page. This is a typographic no-no, and has been for – um – six centuries. Far better for the reader to have the heading attached to its paragraph on the next page, even if that means leaving some redundant whitespace in its place. Since 1997(!) and the early drafts of CSS2, there has been an easy way to tell browsers not insert a page break directly after, or in the middle of, a heading: Copy to clipboard h2 { page-break-after: avoid; page-break-inside: avoid; } Nowadays the modern way to do that is defined in the CSS Fragmentation Module Level 3 even more simply as: The more generic break- properties apply to both multi-column layout and paged media. Copy to clipboard h2 { break-after: avoid; break-inside: avoid; } However 26 years later, break-after:avoid is still not supported by either Safari or Firefox, and was only introduced to Chrome 108 in December 2022. I’ve put together a test for support of break-after and break-inside in multi-column layout. Have a play with it in Chrome – try removing break-inside:avoid and then break-after:avoid from the h2 rule in the CSS and you should see how the subheadings end up at the bottom of a column, or worse still, split over two columns. Browser support for CSS properties tends to follow demand from web developers. Unlike in 1997 – or indeed 2017 – there is now an annual Interop arrangement between browser rendering engine makers in which they agree a common list of priorities for CSS and other web technologies. Interop 2024 has just closed for new proposals. Unfortunately I didn’t manage to submit a request in time for breaking controls to be universally implemented. Thankfully Scott Kellum of Typetura did put in a proposal for advanced multi-column layouts to be improved, and this included support for break- properties. Sadly there’s little to no clamour for it from other developers – the blog post you’re reading probably doubles the published demand, and that’s just for within columns. Update: Annoyingly the proposal was not selected for Interop 2024. I'll just have to keep prodding the bug reports and keep my fingers crossed they are fixed soon – these bugs are older than some of my colleagues! Paged media is very much a forgotten aspect, and it’s probably true that web pages are rarely printed in the grand scheme of things, however ebooks are definitely a popular form of paged media and deserve attention. I’d certainly like to read ebooks without failed typographic fundamentals.

Not only for epubs, for everybody who actually wants to print to real paper, too, ideally with a working cross browser solution. Mistake is largely not in the specs, but in the lack of support for them. Page breaking controls, weirdly breaking tables, lack of access to area outside the page box to influence headers/footers without weird hacks etc. etc. For printing, the 1990ies never ended. This leads to the bizarre situation where basically everyone who has semi complex printing needs in web applications will create PDF and then print that - and for creating those PDFs, often HTML to PDF conversion is used, just with actually implemented CSS for paged media. Which again proves that the spec is at least 99% there, if somebody would just kindly implement it in a browser, too. Won't be more complex than having the latest WebGL whatever thing in your browser engine ;-) reply wakeupcall 6 hours agoparentSome months ago I wanted to format/print some documents, and given the existing tooling I had I decided to try the html->pdf route. I fully agree is a shitshow. The way things break across pages is hard to fix even when hand-tuning the html itself (not just by working it around with css) to avoid content being cut across margins and pages no matter what. I've found chrome to be \"less bad\", but still unusable. Column handling is even a bigger joke. In the end I exported the document to libreoffice, and got something way more usable in a few hours just by editing the styles than whatever I was able to do in days of fiddling with html+browser. iBooks on apple might get a pass as it doesn't need to paginate, but truth be told it seems that epub/ebooks and ereaders in general are being targeted at novels and romance, where form factor, typesetting and formatting doesn't matter that much. I have access to ebooks through my local library and there's no way I would use, let alone buy, any technical ebook. Not to mention, I've seen a steady average decline in the quality of printed media in general over the last ~15 years. A lot less attention is put in the typesetting and layout. Even the print quality itself is lower, which I think is due to the smaller and cheaper print runs being done now also for more popular titles. reply PaulHoule 3 hours agorootparentI thought book quality started going downhill circa 1990. I am a fan of the old mass market paperbacks. These had a reputation of being low quality books back in the day because they are cheap and not super-durable but I think they are high quality from a Deming point of view because they are made by a process that is highly repeatable. Circa 2000 I thought my 1970s paperbacks were in great shape, but 2010 they were seriously yellowing. I just looked at my bookshelf and found a '59 James Blish anthology that I bought for 50 cents maybe ten years ago, it is in \"poor\" condition and will probably crack if I read it without taking great care. Next to that I found a copy of Galbraith's The Affluent Society from 1958 which is perfectly usable except I'd be worried about the cover coming off. A Frank Herbert book from '68 is stained but in great shape other than the cover also being at risk. A '74 Herbert book is a touch discolored but has no problems at all. (My collection includes not just science fiction of that era but also both self-help and serious books on psychology as well as books about science, politics, social sciences, etc. Government reports about inflation or race relations would be published as mass market paperbacks. You could get Plato and Sartre and Freud and the rest of the Western literary heavyweights) The construction, materials, process, and such were repeatable enough that they even fail consistently. Not permanent, but 50 years is not bad. The right size to go in a purse or side pocket of a backpack (e.g. part of the loadout of a bibliomaniac who has 12 books in his backpack) I've got to find a good way to reinforce the cover (adhesive tape?) Those are no longer produced, today it is trade paperbacks. There is wide variation in the dimension, construction, materials and processes for these. You sometimes find a trade paperback that is beautiful, strongly constructed and printed on acid free paper. Others you pay $50 for and the binding breaks the first time you lay the book open on the table. reply spookie 6 hours agorootparentprevPaper quality in general has seen quite a decline as well. reply onetokeoverthe 6 hours agorootparentSuggestions for better quality paper providers? reply zargon 10 hours agoprevAnother frustrating thing with ebooks is that you can't get them in PDF format any more. So much time is spent making a nicely fomatted hardcopy edition, then the ebook is only available as a terribly auto-converted epub that throws away all the layout and style. Particularly cookbooks, as well as anything technical, I just can't stand how lazy, ugly, and difficult to read the epubs are. All the tooling already exists to produce PDFs identical to the print version, but no, we can't have those. reply Tepix 10 hours agoparentFor me, it's the opposite. Whenever i have the choice, i want EPUB, not PDF. The problem with PDFs is that you don't have a device that is the same size as the original page size in most cases. reply Paul_Clayton 17 minutes agorootparentAnother problematic aspect is if one has poor eyesight and wishes to use a larger font size. One ends up having to scroll horizontally for each line of text for single column pages. For two-column pages, one has to scroll back a page after reading the first column. Sometimes one can use a landscape-oriented display to avoid horizontal scrolling, but even if the same word count fits on the screen I seem to be annoyed by the low line count. Providing large type and huge type PDFs would not entirely solve this problem as sometimes even one with poor eyesight might prefer a smaller font for scanning/skimming. Having to acquire two PDFs and switch between them based on mode of use seems suboptimal. Fixed paged presentation has significant advantages for familiar reference material; some people seem to have a spatial memory that makes finding specific content by flipping pages faster than trying several search phrases (with the occasional benefit of serendipity). Poetry often benefits from not reflowing lines and page breaking within a stanza is often more jarring than within a paragraph of prose. Yet a reader might prefer inferior typography over having to use a magnifying glass or carry a very large display. One might be able to get some of the advantages of paged media for figures and tables by having header (or footer) pop-up links to such content when it is on the same \"page\" as the displayed text. This is not as low effort as moving one's eyes, but it might be better than inlined presentation on a small (relative to font size) display. Even with print, there would be times when breaking the text to fit a figure is more disruptive than having the figure on a separate page. There would also be times when all the relevant figures would not fit on the same page as the related text. Having a separate booklet of illustrations might make going back and forth between text and illustration easier, similar to having a lexicon or commentary open while reading. However, that also introduces position tracking in another book and other inconveniences. Even when my vision was better, reading academic papers distributed as PDFs (usually 2-column) on a computer screen was less enjoyable than reading similar material in a reflowable format. Academic papers also do not seem to benefit as much from pagination as other writings. reply Ma8ee 9 hours agorootparentprevIt depends on what kind of book it is. Fiction EPUB all day.

Also: What did people screw up with HTML in your opinion? reply TeMPOraL 8 hours agorootparent> Also: What did people screw up with HTML in your opinion? The problem with PDFs is that you need to create multiple layouts to make them look good in print and on a variety of commonly used screen sizes; all those layouts is extra work. HTML, by its very nature, doesn't have this problem, and yet somehow today we still have to design multiple layouts to support print and common screen sizes. And in practice, we usually don't - instead, we design one layout optimized for mobile phones, and ignore how bad lit looks on desktop or in print. \"Responsive web design\" turned into forcing HTML to behave like a PDF, except using \"iPhone\" instead of \"A4\" as the size. reply carlosjobim 2 hours agorootparentIf you make your PDFs in A5, you can print two of them on an A4 paper and read the paper in landscape orientation. For the same reasons the size fits well for displaying on a computer screen and on a tablet/e-reader. It's still a bit too big to squeeze down to a cell phone, but at least better than A4/Letter size. As for responsive HTML, it's the responsibility of the designer to make it work if he/she is worth their salt. Like you say, HTML without CSS is already responsive. If businesses understood that there are a big segment of customers who will always use their computer and never their phone when it's time to make a purchase, perhaps they'd be better at it. reply messe 8 hours agorootparentprevWhat's even worse is the PDFs in Letter format. reply eleveriven 6 hours agorootparentConstant zooming and scrolling just to read a single page reply ileonichwiesz 9 hours agorootparentprevSurely the only difference between an A4 PDF and an A6 one would be text size? reply rjmunro 9 hours agorootparentI think the point is that if you are designing with that size in mind you may make different decisions about the column layout etc. I would have thought that a PDF of a book would normally be made in the size of the physical book, which could be A4, but usually isn't (at least not when I look at my bookshelves). reply Maken 8 hours agorootparentprevText size decides everything: paragraph size, heading breaks, figure placement, etc. reply SAI_Peregrinus 2 hours agorootparentprevProbably also column layout. 2-column documents are fine for A4 sizes, but terrible for A6 or most e-reader screen sizes.

You could shrink your text and keep the layout and page count or keep your text size fixed and increase the page count.

Fortunately, some folks did work to preserve the craft and beauty of books --- Dr. Donald Knuth taking a decade off from writing _The Art of Computer Programming_ to create TeX (though initially he thought he'd do it over a sabbatical) is one shining example. Robert Bringhurst's authoring _The Elements of Typographic Style_ also made a huge difference (I've lost count of how many copies I've given as gifts to folks). A further issue is that doing a good page layout over an entire chapter (or book if the pagination is continuous) is an NP-hard problem --- I've had a chapter come out correctly on a first pass exactly once in my career (fastest 40 minutes of my life). The usual work-flow is something like: - check all characters to ensure that hyphens are properly set, en and em dashes replace them where appropriate, and correct the setting of any instances of what should be special characters such as prime or double primes - assign all formatting and ensure that all heads and paragraphs have settings which will forbid widows/orphans and verify that the callouts for all figures/photos/tables are correct - review the entire chapter from beginning to end, page by page, verifying that each ends as it should at the bottom of the page, and that a referenced element shows on that page spread - for instances where things don't work out, check to see which paragraphs can be adjusted to run longer or shorter by one or more lines, adjusting this until one finds a set of adjustments which results in a proper appearance for the page/spread --- repeat for all future pages --- if a particular spread/figure placement is a problem, back up and see if changing previous pages will fix it --- check the last page to ensure that it is full enough, if not, adjust previous spread, if that doesn't work, see if running the entire chapter long or short by a line will fix it. - review the entire chapter again to ensure that there are no bad breaks or stacks, add discretionary hyphens or non-breaking spaces or adjust paragraph settings as necessary, ensuring that pages still base-align If someone wants to write an ePub reader or page formatter which can do that, I'd be glad to see it. reply fn-mote 44 minutes agorootparentFascinating, but as an ebook consumer my standards are quite a bit lower.

If no vector formats are supported, use PNG, or another \"lossless\" format not JPEG. JPEG's compression is designed for photos where the probability of 2 neighbouring pixels being the same is tiny. Note that PNG doesn't have to be lossless - if you want to shrink the file size you can reduce the resolution or the colour space. Even GIF is a much better choice than JPEG for a diagram, mathematical formula or logo with hard edges and a small number of colours.

Common problems are: - It almost impossible to align the baseline of the formula to the baseline of the surrounding text. - Often, images are only used for \"complex\" formulae, while simple ones are implemented using normal typesetting. This resolves the baseline issue for simple formulae, but now the fonts between simple and complex formulae don't match.

A string set in a given font at a given size won't always render as a fixed pattern of pixels. The font describes the curves of the letter forms and how that's rasterized depends on lots of factors such as the zoom level, exactly how the font rendering engine is implemented, whether or not anti-aliasing is turned on which is further complicated by the fact that the text can be set in any color with any other color as a background, etc. And there are a LOT of fonts. Lastly, OCR is not just about recognizing letter shapes but has to contend with how the text flows.

Kindle, the reading device with by far the largest market share, is basically the IE6 of ereaders - too big to ignore, and at the same time dragging down the entire ebook ecosystem with its crappy renderer. Amazon has shown little interest in improving it for over a decade now, while simultaneously fragmenting its own ecosystem with a variety of different proprietary formats that support different CSS and features. ADE, while less common in new devices, is still very common in much older devices - B&N's eink Nooks were based on ADE at least as late as a few years ago. (Perhaps they still are?) ADE is closer to IE5 in terms of CSS support! At Standard Ebooks we're often hamstrung in our attempts to make beautiful ebooks by these big players refusing to improve their renderers. We're forced to dumb down our CSS and use outdated techniques (like occasionally having to use tables for layout!) because ebook renderers are so bad. iBooks is the top tier renderer, because as far as I can tell it's basically a wrapper for an up-to-date Webkit; next is Kobo - also Webkit-based - along with other Webkit-based indie apps. The rest of the big players are far, far, far distant. reply shermp 12 hours agoparentThe most frustrating thing is that in some areas ADE (also known as RMSDK) still has some of the best typography amongst ebook rendering engines. Kerning? Yes. Ligatures? Of course. (Adjustable) hyphenation? Absolutely. Line breaking that's more complex than the first-fit that web browsers use? Well, yes, I think they may have borrowed it from InDesign. And then it's let down by it's awful CSS support. No `font-variant: small-caps` for you. And your CSS had better be valid, or it will be completely ignored - that includes `!important` by the way. Adobe essentially abandoned the RMSDK renderer, which is a real shame, because with better CSS support, it would still kick-ass.

None of the ereaders I know of do this. 1. Have a background image that looks like paper. No, a solid white or tan background doesn't look like paper. Paper has imperfections in it, dirt, a grain, and you can faintly see the other side of the page. Except for the latter, this is easy to achieve. Simply scan a bunch of blank pages, and use the scan for backgrounds! 2. No, having a background with a fake coffee stain ring doesn't work, because it's the same on every page. You need a few dozen pages, each with a different stain. 3. A printed page is imperfect. The letters can be uneven and blotchy. No, don't have a blotchy font. Have maybe 20 slightly different versions of the same font, and randomly select a glyph from one of them. 4. Books open to two pages. Not one. Two. The ereader should show two pages side by side, like a book. 5. Book fonts tend to look better than ereader fonts, though I cannot explain why.

    "originBody": "PC Components CPUs FFmpeg devs boast of up to 94x performance boost after implementing handwritten AVX-512 assembly code News By Anton Shilov published yesterday AVX-512 can benefit the average Joe, it appears. Comments (48) When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. (Image credit: Panasonic) Contemporary high-level programming languages and advanced compilers greatly simplify software development and lower its costs. However, this way of programming can hide the performance capabilities of modern hardware, partly due to inefficiencies of application programming interfaces (APIs). Apparently, a good old assembly code path can improve performance by between three and 94 times, depending on the workload, according to FFmpeg. The hardware this multiplied performance was achieved on was not disclosed. FFmpeg is an open-source video decoding project developed by volunteers who contribute to its codebase, fix bugs, and add new features. The project is led by a small group of core developers and maintainers who oversee its direction and ensure that contributions meet certain standards. They coordinate the project's development and release cycles, merging contributions from other developers. This group of developers tried to implement a handwritten AVX512 assembly code path, something that has rarely been done before, at least not in the video industry. The developers have created an optimized code path using the AVX-512 instruction set to accelerate specific functions within the FFmpeg multimedia processing library. By leveraging AVX-512, they were able to achieve significant performance improvements — from three to 94 times faster — compared to standard implementations. AVX-512 enables processing large chunks of data in parallel using 512-bit registers, which can handle up to 16 single-precision FLOPS or 8 double-precision FLOPS in one operation. This optimization is ideal for compute-heavy tasks in general, but in the case of video and image processing in particular. The benchmarking results show that the new handwritten AVX-512 code path performs considerably faster than other implementations, including baseline C code and lower SIMD instruction sets like AVX2 and SSE3. In some cases, the revamped AVX-512 codepath achieves a speedup of nearly 94 times over the baseline, highlighting the efficiency of hand-optimized assembly code for AVX-512. This development is particularly valuable for users running on high-performance, AVX-512-capable hardware, enabling them to process media content far more efficiently. There is an issue, though: Intel disabled AVX-512 for its Core 12th, 13th, and 14th Generations of Core processors, leaving owners of these CPUs without them. On the other hand, AMD's Ryzen 9000-series CPUs feature a fully-enabled AVX-512 FPU so the owners of these processors can take advantage of the FFmpeg achievement. Unfortunately, due to the complexity and specialized nature of AVX-512, such optimizations are typically reserved for performance-critical applications and require expertise in low-level programming and processor microarchitecture.

Reply AdelaideSimone ex_bubblehead said: Hand optimization has always created faster executing code than relying on the compiler/assembler. Wrong. This hasn't been the case in at least ~20 years. There are very few places left where manual assembly code is still desireable. In fact, it prevents the compiler from making most optimizations to anything using the assembly code, and it provides no latency information, essentially ruining scheduling pipelines. In the majority of cases, code like this would likely be much more performant if it were written using intrinsics (or generic SIMD or a combination thereof) instead of assembly.

Our Goals: Make integrated circuit prototyping as fast as 3D printing Make DIY version of every nanofabrication tool Get there with collaborative open source hardware Right now we use factories and tools that are optimized to manufacture at scale to do our integrated circuit prototyping. There does not exist a set of machines that enable rapid tape-out of semiconductor devices on a budget, nor are there sufficient resources to make/modify fab tools from the ground up. Nanofabrication is often communicated as complex magic, where every machine is immutable. We believe that innovation in the industry requires a thorough understanding of these machines from first principles, which will lead us to simpler solutions. Even on machines and processes of magnitudes less complexity than modern industry, there are designs worth sharing. The use of low-cost, abundant, and fast-turn-around hardware serves a larger purpose than making the fab cheaper.

Nobody's doing 4nm fabrication in their garage, I reasoned, but surely we could get to ~10um. As I read more about the dark art of IC fabrication, though, I realized that even this was a faint dream. I had imagined a world of lasers carving troughs, and print heads carefully placing down the lines and doping the silicon, an elegant symphony of modern technology. But the real world is much messier -- every stage involves dangerous and toxic chemicals, processes that are spoiled by a spec of dust in the wrong place, either causing a cascade of reagent failures or a physical impediment to correctness; distressingly analog and oh so messy and built by trial and error and refined by domain experts in ways that are intensely hard to replicate because all the same lessons need to be learned again each time. I'm glad to see the work being done here for hobbyist fabrication, but barring huge leaps and bounds, the gap between the neat lines in Magic and the shiny silicon discs is a vast chasm owned by the material scientists, not the electrical engineers or the software engineers. reply duped 2 hours agoparentUniversity labs (with the right funding) can totally do this, it's just not cheap. My university sold all its fab hardware to another university the year before I was able to take a VLSI class which at the time, had a practical lab. * > As I read more about the dark art of IC fabrication I want to push back on this being a \"dark art\" - there is no magic in engineering (nb4, any sufficiently advanced technology etc etc). It's a skillset that requires education, experience, and expertise on par with anything we do in other areas of engineering. The stakes are just a little higher than software because you're dealing with the physical world and physical things have tangible costs and/or danger. The thing that may trip people up is that IC fabrication is one of those things that doesn't really have a hobbyist tier. Anything beyond a toy requires multiple people and support staff in addition to gear and raw materials that are hard to get as any old civilian - in addition to the clean room facilities. Like the reason my university closed their lab was partly because the grad/PhD students and professors had moved on, and partly because it was becoming more difficult to source wafers for research institutions that they could actually use (everyone got hired by labs in industry, where they were making their own wafers or buying them wholesale afaict). * iirc only the penultimate project got taped out and fabbed with terrible yields due to time contraints reply jancsika 1 hour agorootparent> I want to push back on this being a \"dark art\" - there is no magic in engineering (nb4, any sufficiently advanced technology etc etc).

The stakes are just a little higher than software because you're dealing with the physical world and physical things have tangible costs and/or danger. I think \"engineering\" in software generally means optimizing a path to a targeted set of behaviors so that the piles of garbage underneath don't end up blocking their execution for eternity. Our starting point is therefore different. You ought to somehow be working around all the physical piles of dust and patchwork of fires that must be constantly igniting inside your laser machinery. I picture it something like the mad surgeon in Minority Report, creating a small transient sterile environment to do illegal eye surgery in a room full of filth. In that light your \"art\" looks \"dark.\" reply bob1029 14 minutes agoparentprev> oh so messy and built by trial and error Not only built by trial and error, but also continuously adapted in near real time to deal with new sources of error. The most complicated aspects of semiconductor manufacturing utilize statistical process control to determine the best course of action by relying on large sample sizes. You probably couldn't start up a modern manufacturing line without already having a manufacturing line due to this. Finding viable \"hyperparameters\" for a photo tool makes training an LLM look like a tutorial.

It fulfills that rapid prototyping itch.

But I think 3D printing is the wrong comparison -- the much closer example is PCBs, and while we can DIY PCBs (I did this in college) it's not even necessary as they're just so cheap because of the rise of aggregators and high volume scaling in China. I have to wonder if there's not more that can be done on this front for low cost IC prototyping. I don't think the fixed infrastructure is necessarily the problem (i.e. building the fab) as there's enough capacity for cheap chips in volume, meaning each additional wafer isn't the cost limiting factor. There are multi-project wafers (like PCB aggregators), but my understanding is that the hard cost limit currently is the NRE of making the mask set, which isn't getting amortized over a sufficient number of devices in a prototype run. So cheap masks (or fewer masks) would be an area I'd be interested to see development. reply Tepix 2 hours agoprevLooks like it costs slightly above $50,000 just in hardware devices to setup such a Hacker Lab.

I recently learned about DNA-directed crystal growth and was excited by the idea that it might be a more tractable approach to being a big thing and making a small thing (like an integrated circuit). I'm not sure how one would go about it in their garage, but programming the fine-control-needed steps into the chemical rather than into the machine feels like a win. reply Joel_Mckay 4 minutes agoparentOne has to admire their efforts, as the upfront costs of a fab lab are ridiculously high. As with any technology the Metrology becomes the predominant problem domain. i.e. Answering the question \"Where do we get the repeatable precision?\" There are low-volume lab processes around that can hit belowThen once you have a design you have one of the big players manufacture it in the traditional manner. Why? Assuming this is ignoring a good chunk of individual interest. It's similar to people mentioning ordering PCBs instead of making your own: sure, making a thousand copies of a PCB is now cheap enough on the margin to be accessible. But what about making five? Or just one? Not every human sees a hobby as an investment into business. Not everyone does projects with a sellable product in mind. Many just want to test their ideas, have fun, scratch their own itch, build something so it exists, and not to sell it. The primary value of a home fab to me would be to enable fabbing a single task-specific chip (or a tiny amount of them) for any random need I have, whenever it occurs. reply eschneider 26 minutes agoparentprev [–] FPGA is clearly more _practical_ if you're trying to bang out some commercial functionality.

While so far aging cannot be prevented, recent research from an 18-month dietary intervention offers hope that lifestyle and dietary changes can slow brain aging. A new international study, led by Ben-Gurion University of the Negev as part of the DIRECT PLUS Brain MRI trial, has brought to light how blood sugar control can significantly impact brain health. Brain age, as evaluated by MRI measurements of the hippocampus and lateral ventricles, reflects the biological aging of the brain, which can differ from a person's chronological age. Chronological age is the number of years lived, while brain age indicates the brain's actual health. Typically, as we age, the hippocampus shrinks and the lateral ventricles expand, serving as markers of brain aging. Some individuals have a brain age younger or older than their chronological age. A younger brain age suggests better cognitive health, while an older brain age may indicate accelerated aging and increased risk of cognitive decline. The study, which was published recently in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 2024, was conducted by an international team of brain and nutrition experts, including researchers from Ben-Gurion University, Harvard University, Leipzig University, and more. The research was primarily carried out by PhD student Dafna Pachter and overseen by Prof. Iris Shai, along with several international collaborators. A previous study published two years ago (American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 2022 ), reported that Mediterranean (MED) and green-MED diets significantly attenuated age-related brain atrophy by ∼50% within 18 months. In the current study, the researchers aimed to understand the mechanism by which the slowing of brain atrophy occurs. The study found that a decline in HbA1c, and key markers of long-term blood sugar levels, are associated with significant positive changes in specific brain regions commonly affected by age-related atrophy. Brain MRI results showed that lower HbA1c levels corresponded to greater deviations in the thalamus, caudate nucleus, and cerebellum – areas crucial for cognitive function, motor control, and sensory processing. The study suggests that improved blood sugar control could be one of the most important factors in slowing down age-related brain changes. The Green Mediterranean Diet Shows Promise Earlier research has highlighted the benefits of the Green Mediterranean (Green-Med) diet, including better blood sugar control. The Green-Med diet is rich in polyphenols from plant-based sources like Mankai (a high-protein aquatic plant) and green tea, while being low in red and processed meats. The current study further strengthens this connection by suggesting that the Green-Med diet may not only support metabolic health but also exert protective effects on brain structure and function. DIRECT PLUS Trial – One of the Largest Brain MRI intervention Studies in the World The DIRECT PLUS trial, one of the longest and largest brain MRI studies conducted to date, involved approximately 300 participants who were divided into three dietary groups. Whole-brain MRI measurements were taken before and after the 18-month trial to track changes in brain health. The researchers used Hippocampal Occupancy (HOC), as a proxy for brain age which predicts future risk of dementia. HOC typically decreases with age. Interestingly, some participants exhibited a brain age either younger or older than their chronological age. Using NeuroQuant, an FDA-authorized fully automated tool, the research team quantified and segmented the brain MRI-derived data. The study aimed to examine whether improved glycemic control and specific dietary components could slow down brain aging. The results indicated that participants who managed to improve their blood sugar levels and achieve normal glucose status experienced a more pronounced attenuation of brain aging. Notably, those who consumed higher amounts of green tea and Mankai duckweed shakes demonstrated the most significant improvements in both blood sugar levels and brain health. Prof. Iris ShaiPhoto: Dani Machlis Glycemic Control and Polyphenols: The Key to a Younger Brain Age? The study’s lead researcher, Prof. Iris Shai, from Ben-Gurion University, an adjunct professor at Harvard University, and an Honorary Professor at Leipzig University, explains, “Maintaining low blood sugar levels, even within the normal range, shows promise for preserving a younger brain, especially when combined with a healthy diet and regular physical activity. Specifically, polyphenols found in plant-based foods may cross the blood-brain barrier and help reduce brain inflammation, which is crucial for memory”. Dafna PachterPhoto: Courtesy Dafna Pachter, a PhD student and the first author of the paper, adds, \"This trial offers a safe approach to potentially slow down our brain aging—by adopting the components of a green-Mediterranean diet.\" A Pathway to Reducing Age-Related Cognitive Decline This study is one of the first large-scale trials to directly link dietary changes, particularly those associated with the Green-Med diet, to improved glycemic control and slower brain aging. While further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms at play, these results suggest a potential avenue for reducing the risk of age-related cognitive decline through relatively simple dietary adjustments. The DIRECT PLUS trial was funded by grants from the German Research Foundation (DFG), Israel Ministry of Health, Israel Ministry of Science and Technology, and the California Walnuts Commission. None of the funding providers were involved in any stage of the design, conduct, or analysis of the study, nor did they have access to the study results before publication.

I quite liked the Freestyle Libre 3, which you can buy online without a prescription. The software is rudimentary but it'll give you the information that you need. A single device will last for (up to) 2 weeks, which is better than the alternatives I looked at, hence my recommendation. IIRC from Peter Attia's book Outlive, you are aiming to keep blood glucose at an average of 100, with very few spikes above X (I think he said 160, but would need to check). He does suggest once you have measured for a few days to push the envelope with carbs, sugars, etc and see how your body reacts. reply kyriakos 5 hours agoparentIs there something similar available in EU/or Europe in general? reply beAbU 8 hours agoparentprevCare to share a link with a \"buy now\" button?

A huge chunk of the planet eats it in significant portions... ? reply fredrikholm 8 hours agorootparentIn an otherwise healthy adult, no. In diabetics, maybe. Your body adjusts its insulin production to match the food you're digesting. Diabetics need to calibrate this manually, which is error prone as there's more variables than just what you ate (stress, sleep, hormone cycles, prior meals...). The problematic aspect of foods with large amounts of easily digested carbohydrates is that the immediate demands for insulin are higher which might pose a problem in diabetics (unless they are treating hypoglycemia, in which its desired). reply maxerickson 6 hours agorootparentYour body produces insulin exactly to stimulate absorption of the increased glucose. Your blood sugar won't stay high if you are healthy, but there is certainly sugar digested from the rice entering the bloodstream. reply officialchicken 8 hours agorootparentprev> In diabetics, maybe.

Is this good for you? reply rickyc091 6 hours agorootparentIt would be eating smaller portions and less throughout the day. It'll spike anytime you have a meal, however, any five minute activity that cause sweat will significantly drop your blood glucose levels. Eating fiber, then protein, followed by carbs will flatten and slow down the curve. reply sabbaticaldev 7 hours agorootparentprevNope, it is impossible to flatten the curve of insulin spike and that is actually quite damaging, you will be releasing insulin the whole day, the hormone that signals energy storing mode which also makes it more difficult to burn it reply FooBarWidget 6 hours agorootparentThen how is eating low-glycemic index food different from eating high-glycemic index food slowly/in a spread out manner? reply sabbaticaldev 6 hours agorootparentthey aren’t that different in the end, just a measure of digestion reply FooBarWidget 5 hours agorootparentI asked Claude what's going on, and she said that the main difference lies in the fact that low-GI food naturally contains fiber and other stuff that slow digestion, and that merely spreading out the consumption of high-GI food cannot replicate the same effect. reply snvzz 4 hours agorootparentprev>through the day Means the body always has some available. Or, in other words, it does not get a chance to burn fat. And eventually the mechanism itself degrades, becoming unable to burn fat. Keep in mind that our always-available food supply situation is very recent in our species history. Intermittent fasting is what the human body has evolved to do, and how we can get our health back. reply jasonpeacock 1 hour agoparentprevBlood sugar is not affected by only \"sugar\" (sucrose). All carbohydrates are converted into sugars by your body, thus potatoes, grains (rice, bread, pasta, etc), fruit (and juice) also cause your blood sugar to spike. It's not only people who drink lots of soda and eat candy, sweets, and desserts...it's also people who have a carb-heavy diet with lots of bread, pasta, tortillas, chips, etc. The advantage of those foods over sugar is they usually come with fiber, which buffers their absorption and reduces the blood sugar spikes & insulin response. I can eat a bagel with cream cheese and see a massive blood sugar spike in my CGM, it's definitely something to be avoided or moderated. reply phito 8 hours agoparentprevFor me, I'm not overweight at all (quite the opposite, actually), but I'm totally addicted to sugar. To the point that food other than carbs/sugar is really uninteresting to me. Doesn't help that I don't like meat. What else can I eat? I can't survive on just vegetables reply pas 8 hours agorootparentwhole wheat pasta is much better than a cake. eating chips (fat/oil, salts, carbs) is also better than sugary stuff, it's just very easy to overeat by snacking (and then usually people still go and have full meals) reply dangus 8 hours agorootparentprevThere are a whole bunch of sources of vegetable protein, and carbs/sugar for that matter. It’s actually quite easy to survive on just vegetables. If you don’t eat meat then your sugar and carbs probably are processed from a vegetable in the first place. reply liendolucas 8 hours agoparentprevI think is not about accepting that fact. They probably know this. It's all about palatability. Once you taste something sweet and like it, you remember that and come back to it. An icecream, a soda, a croissant, chocolate, cookie, donuts. You name it. Is simple as that. You barely think about that the soda you drink is bad a thing, you like it and you drink it. Some people do think about this though and refrain from making sugary food a habit and I think that's the key. Making any of those sweet things an exception and not a rule. reply Etheryte 9 hours agoparentprevBecause as stated, it's not true. As with most things in diets, it's about what amounts you eat, not so much what you eat. In other words, this is a good example of how oversimplifying your argument makes it weaker. Similarly, lactose is a sugar, yet it has numerous health benefits, especially in young kids. I think a better wording of what you mean would be to say that consuming too much sugar is bad for your health, because that is both more accurate and has less holes you can poke in it. reply Hikikomori 8 hours agorootparentPoisons are not deadly, it's the amount of poison that is. reply Etheryte 8 hours agorootparentWell, you say that as a rebuttal, but that's literally true. Alcohol is a known carcinogen, it causes cancer in humans without a shadow of a doubt and there is no disagreement on this matter. Medical professionals and government agencies worldwide agree on this fact. But we still drink alcohol, whether for the taste, to unwind, or for other reasons, because we accept that so long as it's not excessive, it's not too bad. reply kranner 8 hours agorootparentprevhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_dose_makes_the_poison reply ekianjo 8 hours agorootparentprevFructose syrup and that kind of shit, not so beneficial for your health and it's in everything you buy reply Broken_Hippo 8 hours agorootparentIt is also in honey, maple syrup, agave nectar, some fruits, and some vegetables. In otherwords, it is pretty available in healthy foods. Fructose itself isn't unhealthy. It also isn't unhealthy if there is a little in most things you eat - assuming you are eating healthy amounts of fruits and vegetables, you'll wind up eating fructose. Like a lot of things, overconsumption is bad and adding sugars to everything isn't the best thing. reply sabbaticaldev 6 hours agorootparentFructose is unhealthy literally the same way as alcohol. It’s the only carb that needs to be processed in the liver because it’s toxic and the excess is converted to visceral fat which is damaging and causes nonalcoholic fatty liver reply soco 9 hours agoparentprevIt's also so very difficult to avoid. I opened yesterday a can of tuna and beans salad - it tasted almost like dessert. Are the producers really crazy? Or are they onto something?

Ew. reply frereubu 8 hours agorootparentThis was an interesting film that talked about how fat was demonised in the 1960s(?) so food companies started taking it out as much as possible but replacing it with sugar to retain taste: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That_Sugar_Film It certainly matches your experience. reply soco 8 hours agorootparentRetain taste? Fat doesn't taste sweet, at least not to me... the only reason I can imagine is they do it to mask a bad taste, or just to hide that the ingredients are bland (and/or low quality). That, I can understand - although still not approve as it's even worse, lying under the guise of sweetness. reply frereubu 4 hours agorootparentYeah, \"retain\" was the wrong word - what I meant was that it replaced one thing that tastes nice with something else that tastes nice. But like GP I find almost every processed food too sweet these days. reply ekianjo 8 hours agorootparentprev> fat was demonised in the 1960s(?) Still nowadays.

The original study on this is full of flaws. reply tux3 8 hours agorootparentYes and no, docs are taught that LDL and HDL are not the targets themselves, it's possible to move those numbers without actually improving outcomes at all (especially improving HDL doesn't seem to really do anything). Docs are _basically_ taught to just put everyone on Statins. On as high a dose as people will tolerate. There's fairly good evidence that statins work, the problem is more than people don't like taking them. reply Etheryte 8 hours agorootparentprevOne of my least favorite games to play these days is trying to find ham that doesn't have glucose or its relatives added to it. My understanding is that it's added simply because it makes the product more addictive, gives bigger spikes of energy which many people enjoy, but it's the polar opposite of what I'm trying to find. reply soco 8 hours agorootparentSpeaking of that energy spike, is it something you would get from sweetened ham? Does it have that much sugar oh my... Isn't the spike rather coming from a piece of cake, which happens also to be the proper way to consume sugars? That or fruit, also good. reply Ringz 9 hours agorootparentprevSugar is a popular (because it’s inexpensive) preservative. reply ekianjo 8 hours agorootparentThey add a lot more than sugar as preservative nowadays.

As a real addicted to sugar (but under control), I prefer to eat a lot of sugar intentionally, a proper dessert. Nothing is more waste of biological clocks than added sugar. reply blitzar 8 hours agorootparent> but under control I could quit at any time, I just don't want to. reply meiraleal 8 hours agorootparentI mean, RIGHT NOW, I'm not eating every candy or chocolate I see in front of me (last time I ate a chocolate was one month ago). reply Eumenes 6 hours agoparentprevI've seen this discourse all over the internet and IRL. People are simply not honest with themselves. Take for example that the US government essentially cuts a check every year to the tune of billions to soda companies via EBT/food stamp programs. Whenever this comes up, \"let poor people enjoy things\" is the general consensus. They have such poor quality of life that a little soda here and there is an enjoyment that we cannot take away. Imagine if we allowed people to buy cigs or booze on government assistance.

The more frequently a person eats, the less likely his body is to enter ketosis. Until it becomes unable to; it just gets hungry every few hours instead, where the person just feeds and perpetuates the cycle of not entering ketosis. reply sneak 2 minutes agorootparentThe naturalistic fallacy doesn’t explain away the simple fact that when I haven’t eaten for 12 hours I’m slow and stupid and hangry. You can invoke “working properly” and “naturally” but I think my body is working properly when I can code, and isn’t when I can’t, and unless I’m keto-adapted (48-72h since carbs) I can’t without blood sugar. shadow28 9 hours agorootparentprevYup, I've had the same experience and found that 2MAD works a lot better for me. reply snvzz 9 hours agorootparentprevI was a 2MAD (18:6) before, and it worked well but I was trying to lose weight, and hit some sort of barrier. After almost a year of that, I switched to OMAD, broke through it, and it's been over a year now. Now I have good BMI, not overweight at all, and good energy levels through the day. I do not get hungry, and eating once saves me a lot of time and effort I can direct towards more interesting endeavors. Edited parent from \"and OMAD\" to \"or OMAD\", because either method works. Ultimately OMAD is just the form of intermittent fasting that seems to work best for me. reply FooBarWidget 8 hours agoparentprevBut what do you do about bread, rice, noodles and pasta? Kinda hard not to eat those. reply sabbaticaldev 7 hours agorootparent100g of carbs a day is easily burnt. That's about 4 breads, or 300g of cooked pasta, rice. Eating OMAD, that's enough for a satisfying meal (with lots of protein). That's been my main diet for the past 3/4 years and I have a very easy time keeping lean mass and lowering my bodyfat %. reply getshadowai 9 hours agoprevBlood sugar monitoring is the latest craze in the dieting scene in Asia. You can not buy the little monitors online and people are doing it because they believe that a blood sugar spike is what is tied to obesity. reply esperent 9 hours agoparentBeing able to know your blood sugar in reaction to the things you eat in realtime is simply incredible. Diabetes starts years or even decades before people have bad enough symptoms to get a diagnosis. If you are aware of which foods cause blood sugar spikes and learn to avoid them, you're doing something amazing for your future self. Of course, you don't necessarily need a device to know that it's going to be mostly high GI sugary foods that do that, but it does seem like this is more of a personal thing than people used to think, and the data from thousands of people without diagnosed diabetes will be highly useful. And who knows, there might be some surprises for you in there. reply pastage 8 hours agorootparentBlood sugar monitoring with CGM is extremly expensive and potentially flaky. When you use it to monitor your blood sugar for medical reasons you still need to do professional controls. Diabetes Type-1 is an autoimmune disease it kills beta cells in the pancreas. They are slowly or quickly killed in the span of weeks or sometimes a couple of years. AFAIK once it has started it is impossible to stop at the moment. With type-2 I have no knowledge of a way to do a diagnosis decades before you get it, considering how different diabetes is between people I am sure you can catch some people. I have a hard time believing that CGM data will be usefull without deep context. I think the suppliers of these peripherals are way to good at sales pitch to be trusted. reply esperent 7 hours agorootparent> Blood sugar monitoring with CGM is extremly expensive I did check the prices before, it's about $100 a month (although I'm not in the US, maybe it's more there?). But you don't need to do it forever. A couple of weeks is probably enough to learn which foods to avoid. $100 on preventing yourself from getting diabetes later in life is a steal, and for many people seeing the proof that yes, chocolate cake really does spike your blood sugar to dangerous levels, might be the final push to make real lifestyle changes. > potentially flaky Why do you think that? All the ones I've seen are advertised as FDA approved devices. I expect that in another few years smartwatches will be able to mention it and suddenly it won't seem weird at all, everyone with a watch will be doing it. reply vasco 8 hours agorootparentprev> and the data from thousands of people without diagnosed diabetes will be highly useful What data? Presumably this is all private in each person's device. You make it sound like they also fixed compliance and privacy of collecting and analyzing all the data, which is a big deal. reply blitzar 8 hours agorootparentOne example - https://zoe.com/our-science A constant glucose monitor & diet app & membership which is also a \"clinical trial\". reply vasco 7 hours agorootparentThat company has existed for a few years and the challenges I mentioned are exactly the challenges they are trying to solve. Sharing medical data is a hard space. reply sabbaticaldev 9 hours agoparentprevthanks god the latest craze is that in place of binging eating fast food and be proud of that reply closewith 9 hours agoparentprevNot just Asia. Limbo are selling this in the US, Ireland, and UK. reply cies 8 hours agoprevI feel that we should distinguish between: sugar -- refined sugar (crystaly power, or syrup) sugar -- as part of a fruit/cane/beet The first is much more dangerous than the latter. The latter in many cases --when eaten with the fruit that it was produced in -- is very healthy! reply aniviacat 8 hours agoparentWhy would it? Is it not just more difficult to reach the same dosage when consumed in the form of fruits/vegetables? reply cies 6 hours agorootparentWhen it is \"part of the plant\" you consume it together with fibers and vitamines etc. It is part of living cells. reply EColi 8 hours agoparentprevCane sugar is the same as refined sugar.

It became clear shortly after the Arecibo Telescopeâs collapse that the zinc used to anchor the steel supporting cable wires into their sockets had allowed the failed cables to slip out of their sockets, known as spelter sockets. The sockets slowly lost their grip on a critical number of the cable wires via slow zinc âcreep,â a process where the zinc deformed slowly at a load below half the socketâs nominal strength. Although the committee agrees with the conclusions from other forensic reports regarding zinc creep at the connection being the failure mechanism, the baffling question was, âWhy was there excessive zinc creep at such loading?â Such a failure had never been reported previously in over a century of widespread zinc spelter socket successful use. Fortunately, the committee had the benefit of the detailed analysis and well-documented reports from NASA; Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates, Inc.; and Thornton Tomasetti, Inc., without which it could not have completed its task. Building on their work, the committee presents a clear and plausible explanation of why the telescopeâs sockets failed when no such sockets have ever been reported to have failed before. Unfortunately, there was not enough data available to prove our explanation. It is simply the most plausible hypothesis based on the data we do have. Without the depth and breadth of expertise on the committee, its task would remain uncompleted. I think I speak for everyone on the committee when I say that none of us could have done this alone. I want to thank my colleagues for their unwavering dedication to the task. Their professionalism and competence made my job an enjoyable one. Roger L.

    "commentBody": "Failure Analysis of the Arecibo 305 Meter Telescope Collapse (nationalacademies.org)129 points by mhb 5 hours agohidepastfavorite53 comments magicalhippo 4 hours agoIn the summary they state: All the reported experimental zinc electroplasticity (EP) data were developed at current densities orders of magnitude higher than those possibly present in the Arecibo Telescope but measured in laboratory experimental periods that were orders of magnitude shorter than the telescope's socket zinc service. There are no reported experimental data concerning low-current, long-term EP, which the committee has lumped together under the term \"LEP\", affecting zinc's creep mechanisms over decades. The timing and patterns of the Arecibo Telescope's socket failures make the LEP hypothesis the only one that the committee could find that could potentially explain the failure patterns observed. Accelerated aging is, as far as I know, pretty much standard in the industry. Nobody can wait 20 years to find out if a certain material is good enough or not. However, the real failure seems to be the lack of urgency when they signs started to show up: Upon reflection, the unusually large and progressive cable pullouts of key structural cables that could be seen during visual inspection several months and years before the M4N failure should have raised the highest alarm level, requiring urgent action. The lack of documented concern from the contracted engineers about the inconsequentiality of the cable pullouts or the safety factors between Hurricane Maria in 2017 and the failure is alarming. reply deskr 4 hours agoparent> The lack of documented concern from the contracted engineers about the inconsequentiality of the cable pullouts or the safety factors between Hurricane Maria in 2017 and the failure is alarming. This is crazy. Basically cables were pulling out for months and years and no one raised the alarm? In many industries that could be a criminal or career ending malpractice. Are the \"contracted engineers\" liable? reply magicalhippo 2 hours agorootparentIn chapter 5 they go into how the ownership was transferred to the University of Central Florida (UCF) at the start of 2018, after the hurricanes in 2017. It seems unlikely that UCF had adequate time and resources to review and understand the Arecibo Telescope's original 1963 design, the 1974 upgrade, the structural inspection and maintenance records produced for nearly 50 years, [...] and the key factors, such as the wire breaks and cable pullout of the sockets and their significance on the strength and integrity of the structure. The measured cable pullout may have appeared \"normal\" to [the UCF staff] and was not on their radar as signs of structural distress. The lack of concern may be because a small cable pullout was present from the beginning, and no one in authority had previously raised an alarm But yeah, seems weird no-one of the contractors tried to raise an alarm. reply hinkley 9 minutes agorootparentI bet there’s a r/MaliciousCompliance in Spanish out there somewhere about how UCF cancelled existing maintenance contracts and hired new companies to keep an eye on the equipment, and did it so rudely that the old company didn’t hand over important warnings like this. Discontinuity could explain problems like this readily. reply renewiltord 2 hours agorootparentprevnext [11 more] [flagged] feoren 1 hour agorootparentAs someone who works in a company with 10,000+ professional engineers: yes, yes they do make mistakes. Despite what you seem to think, they are actually human beings. Good processes understand this and have multiple layers to catch and correct mistakes. But it's hard to fight limited data. Plenty of engineering decisions are still made based on numbers in photocopied tables from two or three studies from 50 years ago, each having a dozen or two data points.

The committee, therefore, disagrees with the suggestion made in the Thornton Tomasetti, Inc.

They're relatively new, they're relatively expensive (which saves them from being used in the worst of the applications) and like most things inherent to steel cable and whatnot they tend to get employed in situations where safety factors are generous. Don't count your chickens before they hatch. reply nick3443 50 minutes agorootparentI am not an expert, I read this in the report: The long-term zinc creep failure of the Arecibo Telescope sockets and the subsequent cable pullout has never been documented elsewhere despite a century of zinc-filled cable spelter sockets use. 17 The type, size, length, and fittings of the cables used in the Arecibo Telescope (whether the original cables constructed in the 1960s or the auxiliary cables installed in the 1990s) were catalog-selected items, not at all unusual, with decades of proven performance. Exten-sive structural modeling of the Arecibo Telescope, independently confirmed by laser cable sag surveys, validated that under all static and cyclic loading conditions, the cable loads barely exceed half the nominal cable strength. While PLC can occur at stresses well below yield, such a creep failure has never been reported in spelter socket zinc. reply hinkley 4 minutes agorootparentI think we might need to send some microbiologists to do their own forensics. You have a mechanical failure that can’t be seen in the labs and isn’t reproducible at other sites. Suggests something environmental. Like when natural fiber army gear starts dissolving in the jungles of Vietnam. Could be direct action, or a side effect of a chemical in plant or animal detritus. Like pigeon poop on car paint. reply Wololooo 3 hours agoprevEven if I am not a radio astronomer, this instrument was unique in nature and still in use for very specific observations and until the very end of its operation was able to deliver data. It is disheartening to learn that it was indeed due to gross maintenance negligence (as assumed originally by many) that the final fatal failure occurred, when potentially the structure could have been salvaged. reply magicalhippo 2 hours agoparentLosing Arecibo was, as I understand it, a big blow to the NANOGrav experiment, which is looking for very low frequency gravitational waves by measuring pulsar timing variations[1]. Albeit having limited field of view the Arecibo Telescope was very sensitive[2], and so could see pulsars that the other telescopes they used could not. And the longer they could collect data from a set of pulsars the lower frequency waves they could probe.

It was well known to the scientists and onsite engineers that a collapse was imminent, for years. Ironically, prior to the collapse the agency responsible for funding performed a study to see would need to do to stop supplying money to the observatory, and found that due to environmental impact, it would actually be more expensive to stop funding. After that study we all suspected that the agency was just waiting for decay or a natural disaster to do the dirty work for them reply WillPostForFood 33 minutes agorootparentprevThat's not what the report says. There was ~$14 million allocated for repairs in 2-18 after Hurricane Maria, but the cable sockets weren't identified as needing repairs until the first one failed. The problem wasn't the money, it was the failure to identify the problem.

FAST is not capable of transmit (it was not designed for it and the suspended receiver mass is much lower). Also, FAST has a RF-noise emitting theme park built just outside of it's grounds. The uniqueness of Arecibo was this transmit coupled with such a large aperture (so small pattern on sky). reply dylan604 1 hour agorootparent> Arecibo did high power transmit for radar imaging of the Sun? that's something I never thought about, and now that I'm thinking about it, still seems very interesting.

The Arecibo Telescope cables were suspended across the beam of \"the most powerful radio transmitter on Earth.\" The other investigations failed to note several failure patterns and provided no plausible explanation for most of them. To answer these questions with empirical evidence instead of only the inferences that can be made from the existing data, a more comprehensive and widespread forensic analysis of \"good\" and \"bad\" socket workmanship and the low-current, long-term effect on zinc creep is required. reply shagie 4 hours agoparent(There was a comment that I was replying to about the realization that this was a transmitter and not just a receiver that was deleted ...)

Yes 10GB of data is cheap. If they were serving off EC2, then after the first 100 GB of the month it's 9 cents/GB or 90 cents per 10GB, which is absurd, but still not terribly expensive in the grand scheme of things: what would be a surprise lesson-teaching bill, $90 after a TB / 10,000 visitors? I'm surprised some users think it's a lot on an individual scale. Consider an ideal persona for this submission: query some movies, then go stream several GBs for one. The 100 MB payload isn't much in comparison. I admit it is kind of bad form for mobile users who might be on metered data plans, and a warning and trigger for manual action for those devices would be kinder. One thing that might help reset your notion of what a lot of bandwidth is would be to browse around with your network tab in the developer console open for a day. nytimes home page is 14 MB and they get a ton of traffic. Even a corporate blog on the HN front page right now that could just be the tiny compressed text is 2 MB. Single image loads on many pages can be 1 MB or more. Glancing at the submission, the response headers indicate it seems they're serving from S3 Cloudfront, which is free for the first TB per month, though after that it gets back to absurd pricing.

Secondly I had to find a spare working laptop since iPad is my primary off-work computing device as of late. Finally the schema is not so intuitive - I need to look up things like region/language codes. I want something I can just leave unattended but still be able to use a few months later without going through a dev-env set-up. A static website with all the data is one potential way of avoiding maintaining it as it should keep running, just like an exe would keep running on Windows in the past. I avoid maintaining personal projects as my software job requires me to maintain software and I don't find it enjoyable to do the same in my spare time. reply cranberryturkey 9 hours agorootparentprevoh i thought you were convert html to sql. nevermind. reply Crazyontap 6 hours agoprev [–] One neat trick I discovered for finding good movies on IMDb is to delve into the review history of users who share my unique tastes, especially when they diverge from mainstream opinions. For example, I found \"Paris, Texas\" to be pretty disappointing, yet most reviews were overwhelmingly positive. So, I sought out others who also didn't enjoy it and explored their review history to find movies we both agreed on. Occasionally, you'll hit the jackpot and find an avid reviewer whose taste aligns perfectly with yours, providing a treasure trove of excellent movie recommendations. I like to call these users my \"IMDb doppelgangers.\" reply munchler 6 hours agoparentThis is the premise of Criticker.com.

A potentially appealing alternative may be buying frozen produce, which on average has equal or higher nutritional content than fresh. This is because frozen produce is picked at peak ripeness then frozen shortly after, locking in most of the nutrients at the expense of appearance/texture/flavor.” reply aziaziazi 6 hours agoparentI read that high temperatures degrade some nutrients (vite ?), not all at the same speed/temp. What about frozen? I’m happy to know most of the nutrients handle it, is there known exceptions? reply chii 3 hours agorootparentPresumably, cooking/heat causes (or accelerates) some chemical reactions (like with enzymes) which turns those nutrients into something else, or the heat destroys the more complicated molecules, or allows the water to leech away dissolved stuff. Freezing generally means lowered rate of chemical reactions, water no longer flows, etc. So it makes logical sense that freezing keeps the nutrients intact. reply hansonkd 22 hours agoprev> That means it had been a year since the apples he bought were actually picked I've been saying for a while that instead of focusing on \"best by\" dates, food suppliers should be forced to put on the harvest or manufactured date. \"Fresh\" Apples being sold after a year is nothing compared to how old some of the food you by in the freezer, or boxed section. Manufacturers and store owners are the ones that benefit the most from keeping food on the shelves longer. > If you walk into a booth and that vendor is selling over 5 types of produce, there's no way they all ripened at the same time. They may not even all be grown by them. I noticed this also when i was buying a \"farmers box\" that promised to deliver fresh produce from a local farm. Upon closer inspection almost all of the organic farmers market type produce delivery services buy from other suppliers and sell as if they grew them themselves. reply hammock 22 hours agoparentFrozen vegetables are often blanched and flash frozen at the peak of freshness. In many cases they are “fresher” than what you find in the produce section reply red-iron-pine 21 hours agorootparentmany of the \"fresh\" verities are also grown explicitly for hardiness and transportability, and are often also not great in terms of taste or texture. freezing meanwhile can preserve them on the spot and ensure the less transportable types can make it to consumers. reply jiggawatts 10 hours agorootparentprevRory Sutherland makes this point, that because some products are cheaper to manufacture and keep in stock (like frozen veggies), they're perceived to be less healthy than \"fresh\". reply squidgedcricket 2 hours agoparentprevIf you want a real 'farmers box', look into Community Supported Agriculture (CSA).

They may not even all be grown by them. I’d like to know how authors make this conclusion. For my weak but real experience in the field: 1. Plants don’t fruits everything at once. Some pumpkins fruits spans during months 2. Wise farmers grow several time separated batches, precisely to space the harvests. Especially useful for not-fruits plants like leek and salads 3. Plant several species that don’t grow at the same time. Fresh tomatoes 8 month a year is real 4. Outdoor growing is not a lab and there’s chance a side of you field receive more/less sun, wind, moisture… so won’t grow at the same rate. Some farmers don’t harvest all at the same time but just what’s ripe at the time. 5. Probably even easier in a greenhouse, the most environment you control, the most precise can be the harvest date/range of your controlled batches. reply mapt 2 hours agoprevVitamin C sufficiency is very important to humanity, and freshly picked produce very expensive. Vitamin C seems to be largely unique among nutrients in how fragile it is, being destroyed with any significant storage or cooking. Supplementation with ascorbic acid in shelf-stable tablet form seems like a reasonable compromise. reply adrian_b 2 hours agoparentAn alternative to tablets is pure powder of ascorbic acid, which can be mixed in drinks or food, and which is also cheaper, while containing no excipients. While one can get enough vitamin C from one red bell pepper per day or from one or two kiwi fruits, depending on size, where I live, in Europe, the equivalent amount of pure powder of ascorbic acid is more than ten times cheaper. It also does not need frequent shopping. reply eltondegeneres 22 hours agoprev> If you walk into a booth and that vendor is selling over 5 types of produce, there's no way they all ripened at the same time. They may not even all be grown by them. Once, he actually saw a vendor at Boston farmers’ market selling carrots from Target! He could tell from the packaging because he used to work for them. I don't think this is true. In California and New York City, vendors at farmers markets can only sell what they grew themselves, unless they get an exemption for a specific product and prominently label the product as grown by a third party, specifying the third party (usually things like cranberries grown by one vendor in the fall). Very occasionally you'll see foods like apples in plastic bags with supermarket labeling, but that's because the farmer packages and sells the produce directly to the supermarket. reply tcfunk 21 hours agoparentMy wife ran a farmer's market for years, it can definitely be true. Vendors tried to sneak stuff in constantly, and unless you have a market manager who really cares and is constantly vigilant, vendors will resell stuff they have bought in bulk and are reselling at a markup. Not all vendors of course, but like anything else there's always a handful of bad actors. reply TaylorAlexander 21 hours agorootparentYeah I have seen a farm do this! They bought from other local farms at least, not Target. But the claim \"vendors at farmers markets can only sell what they grew themselves\" is only true to the extent that there is enforcement and sufficient oversight to find violators. reply afpx 21 hours agoparentprevIs this regulated by the state?

If the nutrient levels have really fallen so much, then, how come malnutrition isn't an epidemic? reply safety1st 6 hours agoparentA few remarks... * The general population does have a bunch of nutrient deficiencies in their diet - https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/7-common-nutrient-defic... as an introduction to the problem * The article is making claims about a 100 year timespan and I doubt we have comparable data on nutrient deficiencies which is that old * Daily calorie intake has probably doubled in that time period, so in theory you'd hope daily intake of all essential nutrients would double as well, but here we are with almost half of women and children having iron deficiency, with widespread deficiency in vitamins D and B12, half of the population not getting the recommended calcium intake etc. So I think as an example to start throwing some numbers out there. About 40% of Americans don't get the recommended amount of calcium. First chart in the article shows calcium in vegetables at retail declining by 90% in the last century. I think we have evidence establishing that nutrient deficiency leads to cravings - maybe declining nutrient density is a factor encouraging overeating and obesity? Pretty interesting topic reply lm28469 3 hours agoparentprevHalf of the western world is obese, eating double what you actually need in term of calories probably make up for a lot of deficiencies in micro nutrients Malnutrition isn't as visible as obesity though, you can be a fat fuck and still malnourished in some aspects, but if you're already fighting high blood pressure and diabetes these issues are way down your list of problems. It can be very subtle like micro gut health, teeth health, long term bone health, children not growing as tall as they could, &c.

For example, if you are deficient in magnesium, you could have reduced energy levels, poor sleep, anxiety, depression, heart issues, etc. If you have reduced calcium, you develop osteoporosis down the line. reply carlmr 6 hours agoparentprevDo we know this is not a problem? Maybe there are other health effects like people subconsciously eating more because the body is craving certain micronutrients, leading to getting fat from too many macronutrients. reply aziaziazi 6 hours agorootparentCould that hypothesis be proven wrong by finding a group that eat the same vegetable but don’t suffer the same craving? reply carlmr 5 hours agorootparentWe could do randomized controlled studies, where we first have a phase where everybody just eats what they eats, we record caloric intake and nutrition profiles of the food they eat. To be sure that price is not a factor we pay for all the food. Then in phase 2 we split into a control group that still buys from any store, a second group that only has access to foods with high nutrition content, and a third group that only has access to foods with low nutrition content. The same types of food should be offered just high and low nutrition options (e.g. zuchinnis, brocolli, tomatoes, apples, ...) We then check if there's any significant effect on caloric intake (given a certain time for them to adjust). reply port19 5 hours agorootparentprevNot really. You could create several cohort with different co-controlled fixes for each: more calories, more protein, more fiber, more nutrients. Then evaluate the percentage of successfully treated patients in each cohort. It's of course a difficult study, since someone with a bad diet will lack practically everything, so more things will work than not. I'd also be curious to see how you would design a real food diet high in micronutrients without accidentally adding a bunch of fiber in the process reply jdminhbg 21 hours agoprev> If you walk into a booth and that vendor is selling over 5 types of produce, there's no way they all ripened at the same time. This makes me think this person simply has no idea how growing food works at all. reply squidgedcricket 2 hours agoparentYeah, you could do that with a hobby garden, let alone a real farm. reply modeless 22 hours agoprevI thought it was a little weird that they start off talking about \"calcium, magnesium, and iron\" and then immediately switch to talking about how vitamin C degrades over time in produce. OK sure, vitamin C can enhance iron absorption, but it doesn't do that for calcium or magnesium and, being atomic elements, they assuredly do not disappear from food in storage. When an article conflates things like this without calling it out, I become suspicious of the rest of the claims. reply hansonkd 22 hours agoparentThe article doesn't say those minerals degrade, however it also fails to reiterate the linked paper's reason: > The high rate of magnesium deficiency now postulated [5–8] can be attributed in part to a steady decline in general magnesium content in cultivated fruits and vegetables, a reflection of the observed depletion of magnesium in soil over the past 100 years > Increasing demand for food has caused modern farming modern farming techniques to impact the soil’s ability to restore natural minerals such as magnesium. techniques to impact the soil’s ability to restore natural minerals such as magnesium. In addition, the use of phosphate-based fertilizers has resulted in the production of aqueously insoluble use of phosphate-based fertilizers has resulted in the production of aqueously insoluble magnesium phosphate complexes, for example, further depriving the soil of both components reply modeless 22 hours agorootparentIt does mention those reasons and others, however all those reasons directly contradict the article's next point \"If all you care about is nutrient content, SPEED is the only factor that matters\". Seems like all these other factors should matter too! Surely not every farm is equal in these respects... reply biot 22 hours agorootparent> Seems like all these other factors should matter too! The way I read it was that there are some minerals that are no longer there to begin with because they're simply not in the soil. For nutrients (like vitamin C) created as part of the growing process, speed is the only factor that matters. So yes, it does matter but unless you have a way of knowing which farm(s) the produce came from and what their soil mineral content is, that's not something you can factor into your purchasing decision. reply lm28469 3 hours agorootparent> The way I read it was that there are some minerals that are no longer there to begin with because they're simply not in the soil. For nutrients (like vitamin C) created as part of the growing process, speed is the only factor that matters. That's exactly the problem, fertilisers don't necessarily fully replenish the soil in every single micro nutrient so if you cultivate corn on the same parcel for 60 years you might very well have completely depleted the soil of some of them You can grow very nice fruits and veggies on NPK fertilisers alone without caring for any of the other nutrients, nobody buys tomatoes because they're nutritious, we buy them because they're big and red. And that's why most taste like water and have no nutritional values today reply ghostly_s 19 hours agorootparentprevBut you don't typically have any reliable info about how fresh produce is either? reply aziaziazi 7 hours agorootparentSmell, look and touch. You can even taste in some cases. reply modeless 3 hours agorootparentThe article explicitly dismisses those as unreliable reply hansonkd 22 hours agorootparentprev> It does mention those reasons whoops you're right, I somehow skipped that part. I guess it is kind of weird article with contradicting points of view and the author could have communicated that improving soil quality and pairing it with speed to consumption is the best combination. reply hirako2000 22 hours agorootparentMy read is that the author is taking the view of consumers. Not regulators and producers. reply paulgerhardt 22 hours agorootparentprevOne of my unorthodox views is that the popular blue light obsession is exacerbated by magnesium deficiency, given how hard it is to get enough in our diets. Yes, blue light disrupts melatonin and makes it harder to get to bed. But magnesium disrupts sleep quality and deregulates melatonin production in the first place and makes one particularly sensitive to blue light. reply manmal 21 hours agorootparentMelatonin production is influenced at least also by: Zinc, iron, calcium, copper, P5P (active B6), and tryptophan. Selenium, iodine, and manganese are involved in indirect ways. Many people are deficient in most, or all of those. To be fair, some of these, like iodine and selenium, have always been problematic in some regions, like Switzerland (lots of goiters). But I find it less than ideal that only some minerals are fortified in bread and milk etc, because their deficiency is very obvious. While all the other minerals are not fortified because their deficiencies are less obvious or less well understood. A healthy human body contains quite a few minerals in greater abundance than iodine: copper, bromine, strontium, rubidium, gallium, silicon, zinc, iron, and the electrolytes. Some of them don’t even have lab tests (not that blood tests work well for minerals, which is another issue - blood is short term transport for most minerals, not storage). reply fnordpiglet 11 hours agorootparentprevMagnesium is also a mineral that is under supplied by multivitamins due to the bulk required. This is why I take a magnesium supplement on top of a multivitamin. Given the state of vegetables today it seems wise and I feel much better with it. reply ivewonyoung 15 hours agorootparentprevAlso Lithium, proven in studies. reply solomonb 22 hours agorootparentprevWell that quote appears to contradict the article's claim that speed to market is the most important factor. Now I don't know what to think.. reply hirako2000 22 hours agorootparentHere is a way to look at it. You read the article, and by the end you have actionable items, that you can execute today, literally. Many piece published on the topic go on and on about how agricultural methods should do this and that. Sure, and in the meantime what do we do? reply derbOac 22 hours agoparentprevI had a similar reaction to the discussion of farmer's markets. Technically yes, I've been to markets where it's obvious some vendors are not selling local produce but in the vast majority of the markets around me it's equally obvious that they are (I actually think most of them have rules that the produce has to originate within a certain radius). And selling \"5 different types of produce\" all grown locally at the same time is hardly difficult to do. Different produce does in fact ripen around the same time. It made me wonder about the rest of it. reply giarc 22 hours agoparentprevIt's an odd article all around. Look at the first graph. It's an average mineral content of calcium, magnesium, and iron in 4 different vegetables, but only represented by a single line. Why isn't it broken out for each category (ex. iron in tomatoes over time)? reply miltonlost 21 hours agorootparentThe first graph is also 5 data points connected by a line and separated by decades and most likely differing methodlogies. And this footnote > \"The chart has unverified information \"The average mineral content of calcium, magnesium, and iron in cabbage, lettuce, tomatoes, and spinach has dropped 80-90% between 1914 and 2018 30,34,35,36,371. Asterisks indicate numbers could not be independently verified.\" What is this chart and data? It's meaningless and nonsensical. And so the rest of the article is suspect when based on unverifiable nothing. reply hammock 22 hours agoparentprevYou’re sort of mixing ideas I believe. The nutrient density (minerals etc) is declining because of the soil quality it is grown in, not because it is sitting on shelf. The vitamin C thing was about nutrient loss due to blanching (a processing step) I believe reply modeless 22 hours agorootparentThe article is mixing ideas, is the point. If soil quality matters, that seems to contradict the article's claim that speed is the only thing that matters. reply karldcampbell 21 hours agorootparentThe article is from the comsumer's perspective. For me, someone who doing my daily / weekly shopping, time-from-harvest is the only factor I can use in a purchasing decision. I can't rely on branding, source, grower etc as all that is a crap-shoot. Even if one grower has nutritious tomatoes this year, next year they might use a different field leading to worse nutrition. reply ghostly_s 19 hours agorootparentDoes your grocer label their produce with date of harvest? reply hammock 22 hours agorootparentprevWhen it comes to nationwide grocery chains, with limited transparency on their supplies, of what you can control, speed might be an important factor reply BizarroLand 21 hours agorootparentprevThey're saying how fast the food goes from farm to table is what matters. Doesn't matter if you grow old variety organic seeds the slow way in small batches on virgin soil if it takes 11 months for the food to get to your mouth. reply hirako2000 22 hours agoparentprevNot contradicting your view that the article isn't very diligent, but have you heard of oxidation? Atoms constantly react to the environment, they can bond with other atoms, form new compounds. Oxidation time varies, in the case of potassium it is very fast, the claims in the articles would stand. For vitamins, it also depends. I got into a rabbit hole a few years back, digging into numbers from multiple academic sources on the subject. They concur that fruits and vegetables have \"lost\" the majority of their nutrient density. The low end figure is (rather was) 70% loss, the high end 90%. The reasons are multiple like the article said. I recall reading a thorough and most backed paper explaining the main cause is the soil. We are over exploiting, not allowing the time needed for soils to recoup their content, in minerals in particular. We use fertilisers but these are to enable growth, not so that what end up in your dish is rich in nutrient. We could quite easily reverse the trend, even getting back to normal levels, but that implies a massive hit in production for several years, in a row. Some would call it greed, but can we even produce for the world's population if we did that... reply philipkglass 21 hours agorootparentNot contradicting your view that the article isn't very diligent, but have you heard of oxidation? Atoms constantly react to the environment, they can bond with other atoms, form new compounds. Oxidation time varies, in the case of potassium it is very fast, the claims in the articles would stand. Potassium, calcium, and magnesium are always fully oxidized in foods. These elements are very reactive with water and oxygen; on Earth they are not naturally found in less oxidized forms. reply hirako2000 7 hours agorootparentI will read up some more, thank you. reply krunck 21 hours agoprev\"It's a well-documented phenomenon that nutrient levels in produce have been declining for decades. ... There are several reasons for this, but most of them are due to modern agricultural practices. These reasons include: ... higher CO2 levels in atmosphere diluting nutrient content in plants, ... \" The author then links to an X post with a chart that shows relative carbon and nitrient levels and that says that \"exposure to high levels of CO2 reduces the nutritional value of plants\". It's not clear to me from the chart that spinach raised in high CO2 levels would contain less nutrients per kilogram than regular spinach. The chart only show proportions of the nutrients to carbon. Does the amount of carbon per kilogram of edible spinach stay the same or go down as CO2 increases? It's not clear. reply adrian_b 1 hour agoparentThe amount of carbon per kilogram of spinach is determined by its content of water. This is unlikely to change much. More CO2 that is captured is likely to stimulate the synthesis of more cellulose, i.e. of more cell walls, so the plants should grow faster, possibly also bigger. Even when grown in soil with the same amount of minerals, the plants that grow faster and/or bigger may be more depleted in anything else besides carbohydrates. reply robwwilliams 22 hours agoprevNutrients is a very broad term. This article seems to be focused on just three. Is there a good reason to restrict analysis to just three “minerals”? reply hirako2000 22 hours agoparentThere is a dozen commonly known vitamins and minerals. There are over a hundreds. Where should an article stop? reply adrian_b 2 hours agorootparentA human needs only around 50 chemical substances to stay alive in good health, which are composed of around 20 chemical elements. These approximately 50 include a little more than 10 amino-acids for providing both the essential amino-acids and the additional bound ammonia that is needed, 2 or 3 amino-acid derivatives, vitamin C, around 7 or 8 essential fatty acids and liposoluble vitamins, 8 B-complex vitamins, water, salt and about a dozen minerals. Besides these, there are a few additional chemical elements that might be needed, but if they are needed they are needed in quantities so small in comparison with their normal abundance as impurities in food that there have never been observed any cases where any harm could be attributed to their absence (e.g. silicon and bromine). There are also various substances from plants that may be beneficial for health, but which are not known to be strictly necessary for anything. reply port19 5 hours agorootparentprevhundrets is a bit bold unless you include phytonutrients and subtypes per mineral. twenty to thirty would be exhaustive. 5 minerals and 5 vitamins would be a good start reply ghostly_s 19 hours agorootparentprevSome number larger than three. reply cyberax 21 hours agoprevThis article smells like a fine bullshit.

My understanding is Waterwhen people consume carbohydrates as the bulk of their diet for length of time the gut microflora changes to species that prefer those This is fairly well supported by studies, it even affects oral health. Although the idea of \"good\" vs \"bad\" bacteria is more to do with displacing bacteria that processes food into undesirable compounds with something more inert, e.g in the mouth the bacteria that causes tooth decay processes sugar into acid, but in some people this is naturally displaced by another bacteria that when dominant will produce a compound that kills the acid producing bacteria while producing no acid or enamel eroding compounds itself - maybe the natural dominance of that bacteria is affected by absence of excessive sugar intake over ones lifetime, or maybe it's just luck, or a bit of both... but much like gut bacteria, to actively change the dominant bacteria seems to either require a persistent and gradual change in diet, or a shorter and much harsher measure to eliminate the existing population. reply mythrwy 19 hours agorootparentprevI don't know about the specifics of the article I see a lot of \"well, he doesn't cite sources!\" type of comments and this may well be, however, in the general or the abstract this article hits on a number of important points. It's not just missing minerals, phytonutrients in particular often degrade rapidly. Mineral depleted soils are a real phenomenon and a tomato isn't necessarily fungible. It's become a pet topic of mine and there is a lot more I could say about this (I have a bunch of theories) but will cut it short for now with this: I feel very healthy and I feel very happy. I wish others could experience the same type of things and I'd like to optimize it further. reply qwerpy 20 hours agoparentprevHow do you ensure the trace elements are present and available? I assume there's some testing you can do for both the soil and the produce, but how do you fix any deficiencies that you discover? reply mythrwy 19 hours agorootparentI keep the pH within ranges that plants can uptake nutrients and apply both mineral and trace mineral supplements in sufficient quantities. Azomite for instance which I apply to working compost and calcium magnesium supplements. Additionally I apply other supplements like organic acids (fulvic and humic acid) which aid in the transport. I also remove all minerals from irrigation water with RO and use an engineered growing medium rather than growing in native soil.

Yes, the amount of Vitamin C will reduce the longer you store a vegetable or fruit in a fridge, but the amount of calcium and iron does not change. Nor does the the density of other minerals.

What about the other factors like soil degradation etc., which reflect the amount of iron and other minerals? reply ec109685 22 hours agoparentDeep in the text they mention that a study looked at nutrient contents and Walmart was the best: “I learned this from talking to Brent Overcash, co-founder of a startup called TeakOrigin, which specialized in testing nutrient content in groceries from retail grocery stores.
