    "commentBody": "Arm is canceling Qualcomm's chip design license (bloomberg.com)515 points by necubi 18 hours agohidepastfavorite342 comments mushufasa 17 hours agoQualcomm is known for having a particularly aggressive & hardball-style legal department to enforce its patents on core telecom IP. I believe the most likely outcome is they just settle the dispute here. Arm fighting hardball with hardball. Which would not really affect the ecosystem of phones using Qualcomm arm chips, it would just change the margins / market cap of Qualcomm. Yes, longterm Q might invest in their own RISC implementations, but I don't see a viable business case for Qualcomm to just stop ARM development for the foreseeable future. reply fidotron 5 hours agoparentThe Qualcomm online defenders are something else too. Qualcomm have been acting badly for years, including attempting to turn RISC-V into Arm64 but without the restrictions. You cannot trust people that behave like this, where everything they do is important and everything you do is worthless. The funny thing is Qualcomm do have some wildly impressive tech which is kept secret despite being so ubiquitous, but they have had persistent execution failures at integrations which lead to them throwing their partners under the bus. Qualcomm have the same sort of corporate difficulty you see at Boeing, only in a less high profile sector. reply GeekyBear 2 hours agorootparent> throwing their partners under the bus I found it telling that every single smartphone vendor refused to license Qualcomm's proprietary tech for smartphone to satellite messaging. > In a statement given to CNBC, Qualcomm says smartphone makers “indicated a preference towards standards-based solutions” for satellite-to-phone connectivity https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/qualcomm-kills-its-c... reply xg15 1 hour agorootparent\"We're disinclined to acquiesce to your request.

At the same time, Qualcomm proposed a new RISC-V extension that was pretty much ARMv8-lite. This is enough of a philosophy change to break existing RISC-V software, and so is purely motivated by a desire to clone IP they supposedly licensed as honest brokers. reply hajile 16 hours agoparentprevQualcomm doesn't have nearly as much to lose as ARM does and they know it. Qualcomm is almost certainly ARM's biggest customer. If ARM loses, Qualcomm doesn't have to pay out. If ARM wins, Qualcomm moves to RISC-V and ARM loses even harder in the long-term. The most likely outcome is that Qualcomm agrees to pay a slight bit more than they are currently paying, but nowhere near what ARM is demanding and in the meantime, Qualcomm continues having a team work on a RISC-V frontend for Oryon. reply starspangled 15 hours agorootparentJust the impact of making this move will have a chilling effect, regardless of the long term outome. ARM Ltd wants to position itself as the ISA. It is highly proprietary of course, but the impression they want to give is that it is \"open\" and freely available, no lock-in, etc. This really brings the reality back into focus that ARM controls it with an iron fist, and they're not above playing political games and siding against you if you annoy their favored customers. Really horrible optics for them. reply markhahn 5 hours agorootparent\"Chilling effect\" implies that we should want ARM to succeed. IMO we need to question the premises of the current IP ecosystem. Obviously, the principles of open-source are quite the opposite to how ARM licenses IP. (Afaik, ARM also licenses ready-to-go cores, which is very different from what Q is getting.) It's easy to see how RISC-V avoids the conflict of interest between owning the ISA and licensing specific implementations. reply t43562 12 hours agorootparentprevQualcomm is slightly bigger than ARM so it seems like a fair fight to me.

Or put another way -- as they said in gawker[1] -- if you're in a lawsuit with a billionaire you better have a billionaire on your side or you're losing. In this case -- it's unlikely that qualcomm will have quite enough juice to just smoosh Arm, in the same way that they would be able to just smoosh a company that's 100th the size of arm (not just 1/10th), regardless of the merits of the case. [1]https://gawker.com/how-things-work-1785604699 reply starspangled 12 hours agorootparentprev> Qualcomm is slightly bigger than ARM so it seems like a fair fight to me. I'm not really sure what you're responding to. It's got nothing to do with size whether or not something is fair, it's what is in the contract. None of us know exactly what's there so if it becomes disputed then a court is going to have to decide what is fair. But that was entirely not the point of my comment though. I'm talking about how corporations looking to make chips or get into the ecosystem view ARM and its behavior with its architecture and licensing. ARM Ltd might well be in the right here by the letter of their contracts, but that canceling their customer's license (ostensibly if not actually siding with another customer who is in competition with the first) is just not a good look for positioning they are going for. reply t43562 7 hours agorootparentYou might be right, but they do perhaps also have to establish that their contracts are going to be defended/enforced. Otherwise they have nothing. reply CamperBob2 6 hours agorootparentprevDoes Qualcomm police it's IP at all? Traditionally they've been known as a tech company that employs more lawyers than engineers, if that tells you anything. I'd probably go up against IBM or Oracle before I tugged on Qualcomm's cape. Good luck to ARM, they'll need it. reply verditelabs 3 hours agorootparentI am an ex Qualcomm employee. We often called ourselves a law firm with a tech problem.

Qualcomm is more or less a research company, the main cost of their business is paying engineers to build their modems/SoCs/processors/whatever. They have been working with ARM for the last, I dont know, 20 years? Even if they manage to switch to RISC-V, and each employee has negative performance impact of like 15% for 2-3 years this ends up in billions of dollars, because you have to hire more people or lose speed.

I think long term is doing a lot of heavy lifting here. How long until: 1. Qualcomm develops a chip that competitive in performance to ARM 2. The entire software world is ready to recompile everything for RISC-V Unless you are Apple I see such a transition taking a decade easily. reply coder543 16 hours agorootparent> 1. Qualcomm develops a chip that competitive in performance to ARM Virtually all high performance processors these days operate on their own internal “instructions”. The instruction decoder at the very front of the pipeline that actually sees ARM or RISC-V or whatever is a relatively small piece of logic. If Qualcomm were motivated, I believe they could swap ISAs relatively easily on their flagship processors, and the rest of the core would be the same level of performance that everyone is used to from Qualcomm. This isn’t the old days when the processor core was deeply tied to the ISA. Certainly, there are things you can optimize for the ISA to eke out a little better performance, but I don’t think this is some major obstacle like you indicate it is. > 2. The entire software world is ready to recompile everything for RISC-V #2 is the only sticking point. That is ARM’s only moat as far as Qualcomm is concerned. Many Android apps don’t depend directly on “native” code, and those could potentially work on day 1. With an ARM emulation layer, those with a native dependency could likely start working too, although a native RISC-V port would improve performance. If Qualcomm stopped making ARM processors, what alternatives are you proposing? Everyone is switching to Samsung or MediaTek processors? If Qualcomm were switching to RISC-V, that would be a sea change that would actually move the needle. Samsung and MediaTek would probably be eager to sign on! I doubt they love paying ARM licensing fees either. But, all of this is a very big “if”. I think ARM is bluffing here. They need Qualcomm. reply shash 10 hours agorootparent> Virtually all high performance processors these days operate on their own internal “instructions”. The instruction decoder at the very front of the pipeline that actually sees ARM or RISC-V or whatever is a relatively small piece of logic. You're talking essentially about microcode; this has been the case for decades, and isn't some new development. However, as others have pointed out, it's not _as_ simple as just swapping out the decoder (especially if you've mixed up a lot of decode logic with the rest of the pipeline). That said, it's happened before and isn't _impossible_. On a higher level, if you listen to Keller, he'll say that the ISA is not as interesting - it's just an interface. The more interesting things are the architecture, micro-architecture and as you say, the microcode. It's possible to build a core with comparable performance - it'll vary a bit here and there, but it's not that much more difficult than building an ARM core for that matter. But it takes _years_ of development to build an out-of-order core (even an in-order takes a few years). Currently, I'd say that in-order RISC-V cores have reached parity. Out of order is a work in progress at several companies and labs. But the chicken-and-egg issue here is that in-order RISC-V cores have ready-made markets (embedded, etc) and out of order ones (mostly used only in datacenters, desktop and mobile) are kind of locked in for the time being. > Many Android apps don’t depend directly on “native” code, and those could potentially work on day 1. That's actually true, but porting Android is a nightmare (not because it's hard, but because the documentation on it sucks). Work has started, so let's see. > With an ARM emulation layer, those with a native dependency could likely start working too, although a native RISC-V port would improve performance. I wonder what the percentage here is... Again, I don't think recompiling for a new target is necessarily the worst problem here. reply cesarb 4 hours agorootparent> > Virtually all high performance processors these days operate on their own internal “instructions”. The instruction decoder at the very front of the pipeline that actually sees ARM or RISC-V or whatever is a relatively small piece of logic. > You're talking essentially about microcode; this has been the case for decades, and isn't some new development. Microcode is much less used nowadays than in the past. For instance, several common desktop processors have only a single instruction decoder capable of running microcode, with the rest of the instruction decoders capable only of decoding simpler non-microcode instructions. Most instructions on typical programs are decoded directly, without going through the microcode. > However, as others have pointed out, it's not _as_ simple as just swapping out the decoder Many details of an ISA extend beyond the instruction decoder. For instance, the RISC-V ISA mandates specific behavior for its integer division instruction, which has to return a specific value on division by zero, unlike most other ISAs which trap on division by zero; and the NaN-boxing scheme it uses for single-precision floating point in double-precision registers can be found AFAIK nowhere else. The x86 ISA is infamous for having a stronger memory ordering than other common ISAs. Many ISAs have a flags register, which can be set by most arithmetic (and some non-arithmetic) instructions. And that's all for the least-privileged mode; the supervisor or hypervisor modes expose many more details which differ greatly depending on the ISA. reply shash 1 hour agorootparent> Many details of an ISA extend beyond the instruction decoder.

Why not? MediaTek is very competitive these days. It would certainly perform better than a RISC-V decoder slapped onto a core designed for ARM having to run emulation for games (which is pretty much the main reason why you need a lot of performance on your phones). Adopting RISC-V is also a risk for the phone producers like Samsung. How much of their internal tooling (e.g. diagnostics, build pipelines, testing infrastructure) are built for ARM? How much will performance suffer, and how much will customers care? Why take that risk (in the short/medium term) instead of just using their own CPUs (they did it in some generations) or use MediaTek (many producers have experience with them already)? Phone producers will be happy to jump to RISC-V over the long term given the right incentives, but I seriously doubt they will be eager to transition quickly. All risks, no benefits. reply mazurnification 10 hours agorootparentprevI am fan of the Jeff Geerling Youtube series in which he is trying to make GPU (AMD/Nvidia) run on Raspbery Pi. It is not easy - and they have linux kernel source code available to modify. Now imagine all Qualcomm clients have to do similar stuff with their third party hardware, possibly with no access to source code of drivers. Then debug and fix for 3y all the bugs that pop up in the wild. What a nightmare. Apple at least have full control on hardware stack (Qualcomm do not as they only sells chips to others). reply coder543 5 hours agorootparentHardware drivers certainly can be annoying, but a hobbyist struggling to bring big GPUs’ hardware drivers to a random platform is not at all indicative of how hard it would be for a company with teams of engineers. If NVidia wanted their GPUs to work on Raspberry Pi, then it would already be done. It wouldn’t be an issue. But NVidia doesn’t care, because that’s not a real market for their GPUs. Most OEMs don’t have much hardware secret sauce besides maybe cameras these days. The biggest OEMs probably have more hardware secret sauce, but they also should have correspondingly more software engineers who know how to write hardware drivers. If Qualcomm moved their processors to RISC-V, then Qualcomm would certainly provide RISC-V drivers for their GPUs, their cellular modems, their image signal processors, etc. There would only be a little work required from Qualcomm’s clients (the phone OEMs) like making sure their fingerprint sensor has a RISC-V driver. And again, if Qualcomm were moving… it would be a sea change. Those fingerprint sensor manufacturers would absolutely ensure that they have a RISC-V driver available to the OEMs. But, all of this is very hypothetical. reply wang_li 1 hour agorootparent> If NVidia wanted their GPUs to work on Raspberry Pi, then it would already be done.

They have a line of ARM based SBCs with GPUs from Maxwell to Ampere. They have full software support for OpenGL, CUDA, and etc. For the price of an RPi 5 + discreet GPU, you can get a Jetson Orin Nano (8 GB RAM, 6 A78 ARM cores, 1024 Ampere cores.) All in a much better form factor than a Pi + PCIe hat and graphics card.

There must be less than 1 in 1000 (probably less than 1 in 10,000) apps that do their own ARM specific optimizations. reply coder543 15 hours agorootparentWithout any ARM specific optimizations, most apps wouldn’t even have to recompile and resubmit. Android apps are uploaded as bytecode, which is then AOT compiled by Google’s cloud service for the different architectures, from what I understand.

No, Android apps ship the original bytecode which then gets compiled (if at all) on the local device. Though that doesn't change the result re compatibility. However – a surprising number of apps do ship native code, too. Of course especially games, but also any other media-related app (video players, music players, photo editors, even my e-book reading app) and miscellaneous other apps, too.

Google Play Cloud Profiles is what I was thinking of, but I see it only starts “working” a few days after the app starts being distributed.

I had one pretty soon after their release. The vast majority of Android apps I used at the time just worked without any issues. There were some apps that wouldn't appear in the store but the vast majority worked pretty much day one when those phones came out. reply iggldiggl 3 hours agorootparentI'm not sure how well it fits the timeline (i.e. x86 images for the Android emulator becoming popular due to better performance than the ARM images vs. actual x86 devices being available), but at least these days a lot of apps shipping native code probably maintain an x86/x64 version purely for the emulator. Maybe that was the case back then, too, and helped with software availability? reply coder543 5 hours agorootparentprevYep!

With an ARM emulation layer, those with a native dependency could likely start working too, although a native RISC-V port would improve performance.

Microsoft identified that more than 70% of the top 100 apps on Google Play used native code at a CppCon talk. >I think ARM is bluffing here. They need Qualcomm. Qualcomm's survival is dependent on ARM. Qualcomm's entire revenue stream evaporates without ARM IP. They may still be able to license their modem IP to OEMs, but not if their modem also used ARM IP. It's only a matter of time before Qualcomm capitulates and signs a proper licensing agreement with ARM. The fact that Qualcomm's lawyers didn't do their due diligence to ensure that Nuvia's ARM Architecture licenses were transferable is negligent on their part. reply IshKebab 14 hours agorootparentprev1. That doesn't mean you can just slap a RISC-V decoder on an ARM chip and it will magically work though. The semantics of the instructions and all the CSRs are different. It's going to be way more work than you're implying. But Qualcomm have already been working on RISC-V for ages so I wouldn't be too surprised if they already have high performance designs in progress. reply coder543 14 hours agorootparentThat is a good comment, and I agree things like CSR differences could be annoying, but compared to the engineering challenges of designing the Oryon cores from scratch… I still think the scope of work would be relatively small. I just don’t think Qualcomm seriously wants to invest in RISC-V unless ARM forces them to. reply eigenform 12 hours agorootparent> I just don’t think Qualcomm seriously wants to invest in RISC-V unless ARM forces them to. That makes a lot of sense. RISC-V is really not at all close to being at parity with ARM. ARM has existed for a long time, and we are only now seeing it enter into the server space, and into the Microsoft ecosystem. These things take a lot of time. > I still think the scope of work would be relatively small I'm not so sure about this. Remember that an ISA is not just a set of instructions: it defines how virtual memory works, what the memory model is like, how security works, etc. Changes in those things percolate through the entire design. Also, I'm going to go out on a limb and claim that verification of a very high-powered RISC-V core that is going to be manufactured in high-volume is probably much more expensive and time-consuming than the case for an ARM design. edit: I also forgot about the case with Qualcomm's failed attempt to get code size extensions. Using RVC to approach parity on code density is expensive, and you're going to make the front-end of the machine more complicated. Going out on another limb: this is probably not unrelated to the reason why THUMB is missing from AArch64. reply sarlalian 14 hours agorootparentprevThe bigger question is how much of their existing cores utilize Arm IP… and how sure are they that they would find all of it? reply ajb 12 hours agorootparentprevNevertheless, several companies that originally had MIPS implementations did exactly this, to implement ARM processors. reply gardaani 13 hours agorootparentprev> That doesn't mean you can just slap a RISC-V decoder on an ARM chip and it will magically work though.

Raspberry Pi added entirely separate RISC-V cores to the chip, they didn't convert an ARM core design to run RISC-V instructions.

Just the instruction set or are they licensing full chips? Sorry for the dumb question / thanks in advance. reply coder543 15 hours agorootparentQualcomm has historically licensed both the instruction set and off the shelf core designs from ARM. Obviously, there is no chance the license for the off the shelf core designs would ever allow Qualcomm to use that IP with a competing instruction set. In the past, Qualcomm designed their own CPU cores (called Kryo) for smartphone processors, and just made sure they were fully compliant with ARM’s instruction set, which requires an Architecture License, as opposed to the simpler Technology License for a predesigned off the shelf core. Over time, Kryo became “semi-custom”, where they borrowed from the off the shelf designs, and made their own changes, instead of being fully custom. These days, their smartphone processors have been entirely based on off the shelf designs from ARM, but their new Snapdragon X Elite processors for laptops include fully custom Oryon ARM cores, which is the flagship IP that I was originally referencing. In the past day or two, they announced the Snapdragon 8 Elite, which will bring Oryon to smartphones. reply x0x0 14 hours agorootparentthank you for explaining reply dmitrygr 6 hours agorootparentprevA well-designed (by apple [1], by analyzing millions of popular applications and what they do) instruction set.

Once you've ported your app to ARM, you've no doubt made sure all the ISA-specific bits are isolated while the rest is generic and portable. This means you already know where to go and what to change and hopefully already have testing in place to make sure your changes work correctly. Aside from the philosophy, lots of practical work has been done and is ongoing. On the systems level, there has already been massive ongoing work. Alibaba for example ported the entirety of Android to RISC-V then handed it off to Google. Lots of other big companies have tons of coders working on porting all kinds of libraries to RISC-V and progress has been quite rapid. And of course, it is worth pointing out that an overwhelming majority of day-to-day software is written in managed languages on runtimes that have already been ported to RISC-V. reply NavinF 16 hours agorootparentInteresting, does anyone know what percentage of top Android apps run on RISC-V?

Companies pulled off leaving Alpha and Sparc but that was servers which has a different software landscape. reply hajile 15 hours agorootparentI don't believe any major company has done it. Even Intel failed numerous times to move away from x86 with iAPX432, i960, i860, and Itanium all failing to gain traction. reply MBCook 15 hours agorootparentFor Apple it was do or die the first few times. Until x86, if they didn’t move they’d just be left in the dust and their market would disappear. The ARM transition wasn’t strictly necessary like the last ones. It had huge benefits for them, so it makes sense, but they also knew what they were doing by then. In your examples (which are great) Intel wasn’t going to die. They had backups, and many of those seem guided more by business goals than a do-or-die situation. I wonder if that’s part of why they failed. reply hnaccount_rng 14 hours agorootparentIn a way that's also true for the x86->ARM transition, isn't it? I had an MacbookAir 2018. And.. \"it was crap\" is putting it very, very mildly. Yes it was still better than any Windows laptop I got since and much less of a hassle than any Linux laptop that I'm aware of in my circle. But the gap was really, really small and it cost twice as much. But the most important part for the working of the transition is probably that, in any of theses cases, the typical final user didn't even notice. Yes a lot of Hackernews-like people noticed as they had to recompile some of their programs. But most people :tm: didn't. They either use AppStore apps, which were fixed ~immediately or Rosetta made everything runnable, even if performance suffered. But that's pretty much the requirement you have: You need to be handle to transition ~all users to the new platform with ~no user work and even without most vendors doing anything. Intel never could provide that, not even aim for it. So they basically have to either a) rip their market in pieces or b) support the \"deprecated\" ISA forever. reply plorkyeran 13 hours agorootparent> Rosetta made everything runnable, even if performance suffered. I think a very important part was that even with the Rosetta overhead, most x86 programs were faster on the m1 than on the machines which it would have been replacing. It wasn’t just that you could continue using your existing software with a perf hit; your new laptop actually felt like a meaningful upgrade even before any of your third party software got updated. reply MBCook 5 hours agorootparentprevI don’t think so. I’ve got a 2019 MBP and yeah, the heat issue is a big problem. But they weren’t going to be left in the performance dust like the last times. Their chip supplier wasn’t going to stop selling chips to them. They would have likely had to give up on how thin their laptops were, but they could have continued on just fine. I do think the ARM transition wasn’t strictly good, it let them stay thin and quiet and cooler. They got economies of scale with their phone chips. But it wasn’t necessary to the degree the previous ones were. reply MBCook 2 hours agorootparent> I do think the ARM transition wasn’t strictly good That’s a total typo I didn’t catch in time.

Qualcomm, on the other hand, has everything to lose as most of their profits rely on the sales of high-end Snapdragon chips to Android OEM's. Qualcomm thought they were smart by trying to use the Nuvia ARM design license, which was not transferable, as part of their acquisition instead of doing the proper thing and negotiating a design license with ARM.

By using its dominant position in Smartphone chipsets, Qualcomm is in progress to establish a custom ARM-architecture as the new standard for several industries, fragmenting the ARM-ecosystem. For decades, ARM is carefully avoiding this to happen, by allowing selected partners to \"explore\" evolutions of the IP in an industry but with rules and methods to make sure they can't diverge too much from ARM's instruction set. Qualcomm acquired Nuvia and now executes the plan of using their restricted IP in a unrestricted fashion for several industries (\"powering flagship smartphones, next-generation laptops, and digital cockpits, as well as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, extended reality and infrastructure networking solutions\"). ARM has designed architectures which achieve comparable performance to Nuvia's IP (Blackhawk, Cortex-X), but Qualcomm's assumption is that they don't need it and that they can apply Nuvia's IP on top of their existing architecture without the need of licensing any new ARM design. reply neonsunset 9 hours agoparentLast time I checked, Qualcomm did not introduce any custom instructions into the ISA.

But from my understanding the article is only about their license to design custom chips with ARM IP, not about using ARM's designs. For example the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 uses 1 ARM Cortex-X2, 3 ARM Cortex-A710 and 4 ARM Cortex-A510, which are ARM designs. Their latest announced chip though, Snapdragon 8 Elite, uses 8 Oryon cores, which Qualcomm designed themselves (after acquiring Nuvia). So is Qualcomm not still able to create chips like the former, and just prevented from creating chips like the latter? Or does \"putting a chip together\" (surely there is a bit more going into it) like the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 still count as custom design? reply dagmx 12 hours agoparentThey’re only losing their license to make custom cores. They’re still free to use ARMs own cores. The reason being that ARM gave Nuvia a license to design cores at a specific rate, then Qualcomm bought them to use those cores. ARM claims that the license to design cores does not have a transferable rate to it. reply adrian_b 10 hours agorootparentNow Qualcomm does not want to continue to use any Arm cores, both because their own cores are better and because that would save them the cost for royalties. Obviously, Arm tries to prevent Qualcomm from using their own cores, because this time Arm would lose a major source of their revenue if Qualcomm stopped licensing cores. When Arm has given architectural licenses to Qualcomm and Nuvia, they were not worried about competition, because Qualcomm could not design good cores, while Nuvia had no perspective of selling so many cores for this to matter. The merging of Nuvia into Qualcomm has changed completely the possible effect of those architectural licenses, so Arm probably considers that giving them has been a big mistake and they now try to mend this by cancelling them, with the hope that they will convince justice that this is not illegal. For any non-Arm employee or shareholder, it is preferable for Arm to lose, unless the reduction in revenue for Arm would be so great as to affect their ability to continue to design improved cores for other companies and for other applications, but that is unlikely. reply dagmx 4 hours agorootparentThere’s a LOT of conjecture in your comment. Your very first line is one to begin with. ARM also doesn’t seem to care if QC design their own cores. They just care that they renegotiate the royalty agreement. This is clear if you actually read their statements. reply adrian_b 1 hour agorootparentBecause Arm wants to increase the royalties for the cores designed by Qualcomm, that is a pretty certain indication that these royalties have been smaller than for the cores licensed from Arm. Therefore Arm cares a lot if Qualcomm designs their own cores, because that would cause a smaller revenue for Arm. If Arm had not cared whether Qualcomm designs their own cores, they would have never sued Qualcomm. The official reason why Arm has sued Qualcomm, is not for increasing the royalties, because that has no legal basis. It is obvious that the lawsuit is just a blackmail instrument to force Qualcomm to pay higher royalties for the cores designed by them, but the official object of the lawsuit is to forbid Qualcomm to design their own cores, by claiming that the Oryon cores used in the new Qualcomm chipsets for laptops, smartphones and automotive applications have been designed by violating the conditions of the architectural licenses granted by Arm to Qualcomm and Nuvia, so Arm requests that Qualcomm must stop making any products with these Arm-compatible cores and they must destroy all their existing core designs. reply wmf 18 hours agoprevThis \"cancellation\" is likely to be paused until the lawsuit is resolved so it's hard to say what this means.

In reality the problems are where the same things don't exist. People don't view the world the same way and don't have an equivalent word. In Turkish it's very important whether your aunt is on your mother's side or your father's side so there are different words for each....but there's no words for \"he\" or \"she\" as they don't bother with gender in sentences. So for example every conversation converted from Turkish to English loses an important bit of meaning about relationships and the sex of a person has to be inferred from context which is not easy to do automatically.

I mean, it's most likely overlaps and not actually the same set of people, but I find it ironic and funny. reply t43562 8 hours agorootparentI suspect that it's an argument about nothing. e.g. I can think about my \"mother's sister\" but I don't care about it enough to invent a shortcut word for it like \"teyze\". To Turks I think it means something because in some families there's great emphasis on the connections with one or other side of the family. It's rather a brutal and dismissive attitude sometimes. So I personally think that groups of people have a common understanding and some commonly accepted attitude that make up their culture. The purpose of words is to reference those feelings. An outsider can understand to a degree because we are all human but they usually get the emphasis wrong and also tend to miss lots of implications. Of course you as an entrant to a culture (e.g. a kid) are going to get educated over time about what it all means and you're going to be discouraged from expressing alternate cultural values because overall not enough people feel like that to have invented convenient ways of expressing it. So language is going to affect you but as some idea becomes popular and needs expression people do invent new words. So you can affect it - if you can get enough people to pick up on your invention by adding a new idea to their mental model of life. reply creshal 13 hours agoparentprev> Or is an ISA more than just a different 'language'? It tends to be more like going from C89 to Haskell. You're not just switching the keywords around, but also fundamental architectural concepts.

That's the next problem. Kernels, device drivers, support hardware, a lot of low level stuff needs to be adapted, and even a company the size of Qualcomm doesn't necessarily do everything inhouse, there will be lots of external IPs involved and all those partners need to also be willing to migrate over to a different ISA. reply dzaima 12 hours agorootparentI'd perhaps put ARM vs RISC-V closer to like C# vs Java (or maybe JS vs Python) - on a high level rather similar, but a majority of the specifics don't really line up (especially at the uop level requiring dumping a bunch of previous optimized cases, and adding a bunch of new ones). reply adrian_b 10 hours agoparentprevDesigning a new clean and better ISA is easy. With the current existing experience that could be done in weeks or a few months at most, to allow for the simulation of how various variants run benchmarks, to determine the best variant. Nevertheless, designing the ISA is the only easy part. Then you have to write high-quality compilers, assemblers, linkers, debuggers and various other tools, and also good documentation for the ISA and all the tools. Developing such toolchains and convincing people to use them and educating them can take some years. Optimizing various libraries for which the performance is important for the new ISA can also take years.

The new apple chips are faster than desktop chips from a few years ago reply nashashmi 8 hours agorootparentprevI never thought I would hear MediaTek and top chip maker in the same line reply mdasen 4 hours agoparentprevThe issue is that Qualcomm wants to switch to ARM chips where they don't pay ARM much money. When you're making ARM chips, you can either license the instruction set or you can license whole core designs. Most people license whole core designs. You build a chip using an ARM Cortex X4 core, 3 Cortex A720 cores, and 4 Cortex A520 cores and call it a day. But when you're using ARM's core designs, you have to pay them a lot to license those core designs. But when you're licensing the instruction set (and designing your own cores), you pay ARM a tiny licensing fee. This is what Apple does. In this case, the story goes: A startup called Nuvia wanted to create custom ARM cores for servers and negotiated a deal with ARM that was very favorable since ARM would like to grow its server marketshare. The agreement included a stipulation that they couldn't sell their IP to another company for that other company to build ARM cores built on Nuvia IP (according to ARM). Qualcomm argues that they have an instruction set license so they're allowed to build custom cores based off that license. ARM says that Nuvia's instruction set license means that Qualcomm can't. I don't know what the cost difference is between core licenses and instruction licenses, but some places seem to think it's around 5x. Qualcomm has around 35% of the ARM chip market, but crucially a huge portion of the more expensive (and profitable for ARM) flagship cores. It's possible that Qualcomm is half of ARM's business (maybe more). If Qualcomm shifts to their own core designs and starts paying ARM 20% of what they're paying now, that could wipe out 40% of ARM's revenue. If Qualcomm can shift from more expensive core licenses to cheaper instruction licenses, it would wipe out a huge portion of ARM's business. Worse, if those cores are better and become the de-facto flagship cores, it'd wipe out even more of ARM's business as companies like Samsung and Google might feel the need to buy Qualcomm chips (with better cores) rather than buying ARM's Cortex X cores for their flagship phones. Likewise, Qualcomm is unlikely to stop at smartphones. They're already moving into laptops which will make it harder for any company using ARM-designed cores to get a foothold there. Qualcomm could move into servers in the near future and offer something better than the ARM Neoverse cores that are used by AWS's Graviton, Google's Axion, and Ampere. So it's an enormous threat to ARM's business and ARM feels like it gave Nuvia a sweetheart deal because they were a small startup looking to enter a mostly new market rather than disrupting their current business - and they gave them a license with restrictions on it. Then Nuvia sold to Qualcomm who is using that IP to stop paying ARM - and ARM thinks that goes against the restrictions that Nuvia agreed to. reply UltraSane 17 hours agoparentprevAWS has the Graviton ARM CPU that is pretty competitive but you can only rent them. reply seabrookmx 16 hours agorootparentGraviton is just an ARM neoverse core no?

Because nobody has released a RISC-V MPU comparable to what you perceive as \"moden\" arm64 MPUs. RISC-V is simply a ISA and not a core. The ISA affects some of the core architecture but the rest is also implementor specific. High-end cores will take time to reach market.

Current RISC-V chips are slower than high performance ARM ones, but that's because you don't start by designing high performance chips! You start with small embedded cores and work your way up. Exactly the same thing happened with ARM. It started in embedded, then phones, and finally laptops and servers. ARM was never slow, they just hadn't worked up to highly complex high performance designs yet. reply wmf 13 hours agorootparentyou don't start by designing high performance chips! You start with small embedded cores and work your way up. I disagree. For example, the first PowerPC was pretty fast and went into flagship products immediately. Itanium also went directly for the high end market (it failed for unrelated reasons). RISC-V would be much better off if some beastly chips like Rivos were released early on. reply snvzz 10 hours agorootparentThe high end requires specifications that were not available until RVA22 and Vector 1.0 were ratified. First chips implementing these are starting to show up as seen in e.g. MILK-V Jupiter, which is one of the newest development boards in the market. With the ISA developed in the open, the base specs microcontrollers can target would naturally tend to be be ratified first, and thus microcontrollers would show up first. RVA22+V were ratified November 2021. With the ISA developed inside working groups involving several parties, some slowness would be unavoidable, as they all need to agree on how to move forward. Thus the years of gap until RVA22+V from the time the privileged and unprivileged specs were ratified (2019). RVA23 has just been ratified. This spec is on par with x86-64 and ARMv9, feature-wise. Yet hardware using it will of course in turn take years to appear as well. reply bhouston 5 hours agorootparentIsn't the problem the lack of advanced features for executing the current ISA with speed? I thought RISC-V chips seen in the wild do not pipelining, out-of-order, register renaming, multiple int/float/logic units, speculation, branch predictors, multi-tier caching, etc. The lack of speed isn't really related to a few missing vector instructions. reply monocasa 1 hour agorootparentThere's a lot of cores that do all of that. Most cores are pipelined; it is RISC after all. There are quite a few superscalar cores, even a c906 is superscalar. The c910/c920 is an OoO, renaming core, with speculation.

Windows ran on Itanium, Alpha, and as pointed out ARM for over a decade. Without the ISVs, it’s a flop for consumers. MS has had an abysmal time getting them to join in on ARM, only starting to have a little success now. Saying “Ha ha, just kidding, it’s RISC-V now” would be a disaster. That’s the kind of rug pull that helped kill Windows Mobile. Emulators aren’t good enough. They’re a stop gap. Unless the new chip is so much better than the old it’s faster with emulation then the old one was native no one will accept it long. Apple’s been there, but that’s not where MS sits today. And if your emulator is too good, what stops ISVs from saying “you did it for us, we don’t have to care”? So once again they don’t have to do it at all and you have no native software.

You need native apps otherwise you’re always dealing with a ~20-30% disadvantage. The competition isn’t sitting still either and QC already hit this with Intel stealing their thunder with Lunar Lake. They’re efficient enough that the difference in efficiency is far overshadowed by their compatibility story.

Oct 7, 2024Katharine Miller https://twitter.com/StanfordHAI?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor https://www.facebook.com/StanfordHAI/ https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChugFTK0KyrES9terTid8vA https://www.linkedin.com/company/stanfordhai https://www.instagram.com/stanfordhai/?hl=en Image Rod Searcey In The Tech Coup: How to Save Democracy from Silicon Valley, Stanford institute for Human-Centered AI Policy Fellow Marietje Schaake aims to raise public awareness about a serious threat: the unchecked power of private companies. In addition to exerting vast economic power, tech companies are stepping into roles normally preserved for governments and wreaking havoc on the democratic rule of law in the process. From cybersecurity to systems used for policing, elections, and military defense policy, tech companies large and small are playing an outsized role. Her book illustrates this thesis with examples drawn from her experiences as a member of the European Parliament from 2009 to 2019 and as an engaged observer of tech culture while a fellow at Stanford’s Cyber Policy Center and Stanford HAI. Here, Schaake discusses why ceding power to tech companies hurts democracy and outlines a few solutions from her book. In what ways are private companies increasingly taking on functions normally assumed by states? In the digital realm, companies’ control of information, unfettered agency, and power to act have almost overtaken that of governments. For example, in the private intelligence sector, companies like NSO Group Technologies with its Pegasus spyware products are creating and selling the capability to hack into people’s devices. This means that anyone with the financial resources to purchase Pegasus spyware can access the capabilities of intelligence services and hack into the very private information of political opponents, judges, journalists, critical employees, competitors, and others. Another striking example is that of offensive cyber capabilities. In the name of defending their clients or their networks, companies are attacking hackers across borders, using “offense as defense.” And notice that I’m talking not only about big tech companies but also small ones, because there’s de facto power that comes from the development of digital technologies. Companies like NSO, or Clearview with its facial recognition software, or companies producing election technologies – these are not so-called Big Tech, but they are just as illustrative of some of the challenges that I’m pointing to, [such] as Elon Musk deciding who in Ukraine should and should not have access to Starlink internet connections. So, we see that these capabilities, these decisions, and these powers that used to be the exclusive domain of the state are now seeping into the hands of private companies, but without the checks and balances that we want in societies that function by the rule of law. What can be done to put democratic entities back in charge? First of all, there needs to be more awareness and understanding of the ways in which companies exert power over governance, democracy, and international law. And then we need to bring the same level of legal clarity, accountability mechanisms, and transparency measures to the digital realm that we expect around other innovations such as medicines, chemicals, foods, cars, or even processes such as the decision to engage in foreign conflict. Let’s compare how the U.S. responded to the Ukraine war in the physical world versus in the cyber domain. As part of NATO, the U.S. is clear: It doesn’t want to see boots on the ground. But in the cyber domain, the U.S.’s offensive activities are ongoing. That political discrepancy can continue because of the legal gray zone in the digital realm. So, I’m saying that the legal frameworks that we rely on in other industries – as well as the approaches we take to the physical side of foreign conflict – need to be on par in the digital realm and need to keep pace with where the technology has gone. It’s basically about catching up through international law, regulations, and enforcement, to make sure that the ideas that we have about what a democratic mandate looks like, what accountability looks like, and what oversight looks like are actually meaningful whenever activities happen in the digital sphere. To some extent, you’re calling for implementing traditional types of laws and regulations in the digital realm, but is there also a way in which you’re calling for something new – a reinvention of democratic governments to handle the challenges of digitization? Yes, there are a number of novel large- and small-scale changes I would recommend. For example, just as legislatures rely on independent legal teams to help draft legislation that will survive court challenges, they also need independent technology experts they can turn to for reliable information. Making tech expertise available to lawmakers would go a long way toward reducing lobbyists’ effectiveness and ensuring lawmakers understand how technology impacts issues like healthcare, education, justice, housing, and transportation. Because tech touches everything, lawmakers can’t get a handle on it by sitting in a single committee. They need to consult independent experts. Another example: Governments are increasingly outsourcing all kinds of processes to tech companies. And if a tech company operates in the name of a government, it should be as accountable as the government. I call this “the public accountability extension.” It sounds simple, but it would be a huge game changer. Right now, as governments outsource more and more critical governmental functions to tech companies, they also offload governmental accountability. For example, in many jurisdictions, the police are not allowed to hack into the devices of suspects. Instead, they engage a hacking company that will do it for them. The police can then say they don’t hack, but they actually gain access by alternate means. Similarly, state and local governments in the United States aren’t constitutionally allowed to discriminate between citizens on the basis of sensitive categories, but oftentimes the technology they use does exactly that without being held accountable. A third example: Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. Journalists have the right to know what the government does in citizens’ name, but sometimes governments hire private companies to do government work or to collect and store government information, and if the companies don’t keep the information at the standard required of public entities, or if the companies are reluctant to provide information due to proprietary concerns, then the effectiveness of FOIA erodes. So, there are many examples of how governments essentially hide behind companies, including tech companies, to avoid accountability, and the accountability extension would address that. In your book, you point out another tension: tech companies’ energy use in the communities they enter. You note that the public needs greater insight to provide greater oversight over the data centers underlying our digital lives. What do you mean? There are no standards or reporting obligations requiring companies to say how much energy or water they’re using or plan to use. We have estimates from individual cases, but we don’t know the sum of data centers’ energy use. And often, big tech companies seeking to build data centers in a community will bid for those projects under a pseudonym – a company name that hides the fact that Amazon, Google, or Microsoft is behind the bid. The lawyers and consultants that tech companies hire to make these bids often paint a rosy picture of all the economic benefits that will accrue to communities that allow data centers to be built. They do their best to hide critical information about who they are and the data centers’ energy needs. And this complete lack of transparency regarding the use of scarce resources hinders transparent and good governance. We had some cases in the Netherlands where this was a big problem. Part-time city councilors had to make decisions about whether or not to allow a hyperscale data center in their territories. And they were up against billion-dollar companies and all their lawyers, accountants, consultants, and PR firms. The power asymmetry was enormous, and I think by standardizing the transparency and reporting requirements – including who is behind the projects and the metrics of energy use – this could become a much more fair public debate about the types of data centers a community can feasibly host. This increased transparency doesn’t begin to address whether society even wants more of these data centers using up scarce energy resources in an era of climate change. But we can’t answer that cost-benefit question if we don’t know what the cost is and all we’re told is benefit, benefit, benefit in some shady presentation. And of course, the other real issue, especially in the U.S., is the capability of the power grids. In the Netherlands, which is an advanced economy, as in the U.S. and the U.K., we’ve already seen reports that the grids are functioning at near-emergency levels: code red. The grids are stretched to their limits. They break down and outages are more frequent. And yet there are many data centers in the pipeline that were agreed to years ago. When they come online in two or three years, we may face a wave of disaster. Can you talk about the precautionary principle that’s already part of EU law and how it might help rein in tech company power, especially AI? Basically, the precautionary principle requires a pause to assess the societal impact of an innovation when it is new and before it is widely deployed or implemented. It’s enshrined in EU law but hasn’t been invoked by the authorities for tech innovations like AI because there’s such a push to use AI and also because the EU has now passed a separate law that deals with AI. But I think the precautionary principle is a useful concept to address situations where tech company engineers are themselves surprised by the behavior of AI models, or where society and lawmakers and citizens don’t know or understand how a particular innovation will impact their lives. So we’d like to create processes that actually serve the public by using the precautionary principle to assess and research before unintended but still preventable problems spread too widely. Have Americans been slow to understand the threat that tech companies pose to democracy? Around the globe, there have been signs of the harms of tech companies’ power grab for a long time now, but Americans have tended to view them as distant events. People in Myanmar used Facebook to call for genocide in 2017. In 2018, we learned that Cambridge Analytica extracted and analyzed millions of Facebook users’ data and allowed political campaigns to use it for psychological profiling in ways that may have impacted the Brexit vote in the U.K. And then in 2020, there was the storming of the U.S. Capitol, which was in part fed by disinformation on social media that has led to tens of millions of Americans losing trust in the electoral process. So, some of the problems that people were facing elsewhere have come back to Americans quite late as a boomerang. You invite all of us as democratic citizens to help shape an agenda that puts the survival of democratic principles ahead of short-term economic benefits. What would that look like for an ordinary citizen? There are a lot of choices that consumers can make about how they want to use technology and services, but I don’t think that’s enough because there’s a huge asymmetry between the power of the individual internet or device user and the tech companies. If people understand that the companies that offer all these entertaining, efficient, helpful digital tools are also engaged in power dynamics that affect capital and national and global politics, then they will also understand the need for independent oversight and countervailing powers, just as we have in almost every other aspect of our society. And so I hope that people will bring their concerns to the political agenda and ask more from their leaders, especially in the U.S. I think a lot of people in the United States would like to see federal data protection law; protections for kids online; better cybersecurity; and an effective means of addressing disinformation about healthcare and elections, but there is no political majority in Congress to make these things happen. And the sad result is that people get defeatist and think it’s easier to just not raise these issues. But it’s important for people to keep raising their concerns. And doing so at the state level is an interesting option because many states are now taking steps to pass laws and regulations around technology, given that the federal government can’t or won’t.

They're different transactions that can benefit the different parties different ways in different situations. But if technological development lets the owner get the financial rewards of selling through \"licensing\" that's hardly a reduction in the owner's rights - and it's hard to make a \"pro-strong-property-rights\" argument that's based in \"people should be forced to sell on the buyer's terms, not their own.\" reply esperent 16 hours agorootparent> There's not an inherent privilege of purchasing over renting in property rights. In either case you're paying for something, it's just a different slice of that something I don't think there's anything inherently right about renting or owning. Rather, it's one of the things we need to learn about and decide which is better for our societies. Right now, we are far into testing the \"renting\" side, especially when it comes to housing and software, and it's very clear that, at least as currently implemented, this is creating an unhealthy society with massive wealth inequality. I don't have an answer to this, but the only people I see arguing for the status quo are the very few who have benefited from it - landlords, politicians, company execs etc. Or at least people who aspire to join those classes. If you do find yourself arguing for it, please ask yourself whether you're doing it for selfish reasons rather than looking beyond yourself. reply slg 16 hours agorootparentprev>from the point of view of the producers of those things. Fundamentally that's the question. Do we want a society from the perspective of \"the producers\" or the greater population?

This was a huge barrier of entry for a lot of people who now have the ability to afford it and can make a living using it. Today photoshop is $9.99 per month. Another example is video games. The average Nintendo 64 game used to be $75.99 in 1997 which is $150 in today's dollars. Today the average PS5 game price is $70. That's half the price.

If you have the physical media and the console, you can play the game. Although Nintendo 64 tried to push the envelope in what consumers would pay, the price of video games on the mainstream consoles has stayed in the $50-$75 since at least 1985. reply phyzix5761 15 hours agorootparentMost consoles and computers today don't even have a way to insert discs. You have to download the game which means you can't share or sell the game when you're done. That's why the price is lower. You license the software rather than own a copy. Also, $75 in 1985 is the equivalent of $224 today so even though the number has stayed the same the real cost is much lower now. reply cryptoz 16 hours agorootparentprevI don’t have a PS5 but my Xbox (my first one ever) is an absolute nightmare to play, even if I have the physical media. Still demands an internet connection. Still demands updates before I play. Typically I would expect to wait 2+ hours before I’m allowed to play a game I have on physical media. Often the estimated time is so long I just give up and don’t play. I let it update and then forget about it. Come back a week later and it says my system is out of date and needs an update before I play. Not the same experience at all compared to N64. reply realce 16 hours agorootparentprev> I think the reality is most people are ok with not owning things. > By removing ownership from the product offering the seller can reduce the price. The price of ownership is greater than the price of licensing, as it comes with additional rights and privileges than licensing. If a product or good is only offered and priced without ownership, how can you say that people \"are ok with\" not utilizing an option that's not provided to them? They cannot purchase ownership, by what means could they experience the difference? The products you use as examples were wildly successful under an ownership paradigm, what says that Photoshop or N64 games would have been somehow better if they were licensed goods? reply phyzix5761 16 hours agorootparentI agree \"The price of ownership is greater than the price of licensing, as it comes with additional rights and privileges than licensing.\" That's why it was more expensive to purchase a product with ownership rights. The reason I say people are ok with it is because the companies who didn't switch to a licensing model and kept their old prices either are no longer around or had to switch to a licensing model in order to stay competitive. If people were ok paying higher prices for the benefit of ownership then that's what we would see in the market today. reply ChrisMarshallNY 16 hours agorootparentprevI used to fork out $1200/year for just three apps.

That's pretty similar to scientific falsifiability at least! I think for topics that are not as easily provable as reproducible builds though, trust gets murky. There was something else I read (can't find it now) that made a similar analogy for a web of trust. A web of trust (e.g. PGP) will have de-facto authorities since there will be a tendency for more people to sign individuals presumed to be trustworthy based on their history. It follows that the system runs into issues if their key gets compromised or if a false individual is subject to a sybil attack, producing the illusion of trust.

But the two are often confused. When trust is lost, it takes 10x, sometimes 100x more effort to regain it. Sometimes, even with 100x the effort trust does not return. These are Life 101 basics. Pretending these laws don't exist doesn't make them disappear. From my perspective, the root problem is that institutions that want to be trusted - and traditionally were - don't want to make the effort to regain the trust they lost. The media and the government come to mind. Instead they waste energy shamelessly demanding to be trusted, which only widens the gap. They blame the violated, which only widens the gap. And into that void, the nefarious has rushed in. Until the institutions embrace \"true trust is earned\" the nefarious will thrive in the gap. reply ckemere 17 hours agorootparentI think earning trust often requires significant personal sacrifice.

The U.S. Congress used to have an Office of Technology Assessment.[1] It was abolished in 1995. \"House Republican legislators characterized the OTA as wasteful and hostile to GOP interests.\" The generic problem is monopolies, not \"tech\".

Smartphones have undoubtedly made interacting with government services more accessible and efficient - especially for marginalized communities, rural populations, and individuals with disabilities. That being said, I'm not convinced that access to government services has been \"completely privatized\" as you claim. Governments often partner with private companies to develop and provide these services, and there's usually some level of regulatory oversight in place. This collaboration has led to some really valuable innovations, like online portals for tax filing and telemedicine. The Benjamin Franklin quote about trading freedom for security is still relevant, of course. But maybe we should also consider the flip side: by resisting technological change, we risk getting left behind. Finding a balance between convenience, security, and individual rights is the real challenge. Rather than sounding the alarm about an \"insidious takeover,\" perhaps we should focus on the practical steps we can take to ensure our rights are protected. Advocating for open standards, strengthening regulatory frameworks, and investing in digital literacy programs would be a good start. Let's try to have a nuanced discussion about this, rather than resorting to hyperbole. reply smackeyacky 15 hours agorootparentI stand by the idea that it is insidious. It’s one thing for our governments to ensure access is secure, it’s entirely another to assume we all have smartphones and have aligned ourselves with Apple or Google. Being a digital serf is our new reality and we did it willingly. If we had to start up our Ford to access a government website it would be ridiculous but having to have your phone at hand is just as bad. Google and Apple both know exactly when and where you accessed a government service and stand as a gatekeeper to doing so. It is by definition insidious. reply majormajor 17 hours agoparentprevPlenty of people when I lived in Texas 25 years ago who would be pretty easy to get onboard with privatizing access to government services.

The hospitals do not attribute the rise of problems in these areas to long covid, so there is no news about long covid as the ultimate source of increases in childhood diabetes, the rise of autoimmune diseases, middle age heart attacks, a higher background death rate, decline in lifespan, availability of workers, etc. These are all reported as isolated mysterious facts that nobody understands. But just prior to the rises was a huge pandemic from a disease that causes long covid with many research reports of very long lasting damage to multiple systems in the body; maybe the cause is not so mysterious? Swiss Re the insurance company is certainly paying attention. And the pandemic is not over, more people are getting long covid right now and it's not just the old people. The main fear is that this is a slow moving crisis where 5% of all people lose _some_ capability every year, including the capability of fighting off other infections, and also including those who are reinfected.

And if a tech company operates in the name of a government, it should be as accountable as the government.

Right now, as governments outsource more and more critical governmental functions to tech companies, they also offload governmental accountability. reply miki123211 17 hours agoprevI think this \"problem\" stems directly from the fact that the geographic model of governments is extremely unsuited for governing on the internet. In times past, Governments could e.g. regulate the quality of coke, control election misinformation or forbid burglaries on their own soil, because they had law enforcement who could imprison people doing these things against the law. What happened outside of their borders was mostly of no concern to them. If Coca Cola wanted to sell their products in Germany, they needed people in Germany willing to sell it, and those people were directly vulnerable to imprisonment by German law enforcement, so they had to care about and follow German law. Even if the original corporation wasn't involved directly, there were always vendors, importers, store owners and such, and all of them could be targeted to some extend. Tech companies are different, you can make a product on the internet that interacts with the data of the majority of German citizens, without ever stepping foot in Germany or even realizing that a country called Germany exists and has laws. If Germany doesn't like the fact that this product exists, there isn't much they can do.

But in the cyber domain, the U.S.’s offensive activities are ongoing. That political discrepancy can continue because of the legal gray zone in the digital realm. Wikipedia has a good overview[0] but the basic debate was originally over funding of systems donated to replace a civilian communication network, and later over the use of the Starlink civilian communication system in attack drones, e.g. \"Starlink legal documents claim it is not for use in weaponry as a military use of Starlink brings it under US export control laws like the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) or the Export Administration Regulations (EAR)\" and \"Shotwell explained that her company agreed with Ukraine's military using Starlink for communications but never intended to have them use it as a weapon. She added 'But then they started putting them on f---ing drones trying to blow up Russian ships. I’m happy to donate services for ambulances and hospitals and mothers [...] But it’s wrong to pay for military drone strikes.'\" This author says \"we need to bring the same level of legal clarity, accountability mechanisms, and transparency measures to the digital realm that we expect around other innovations such as medicines, chemicals, foods, cars, or even processes such as the decision to engage in foreign conflict\" but uses as her case-in-point example the demand by a foreign military that a civilian communication system be enabled for use on novel drone weapons in a war where the United States is explicitly not a combatant. Certainly legal clarity could be helpful for a situation like this, but I would hope the clarity is that a private company intentionally building a product for purely civilian use cannot be forced to modify that system to enable its use as an offensive weapon in a foreign war. Her argument seems akin to saying \"Tim Cook arbitrarily decided Apple won't sell iPhones secretly loaded with remotely detonated plastic explosives for use by a foreign military - we need accountability here, this is destabilizing governance!\" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink_in_the_Russo-Ukrainia... reply gilbetron 18 hours agoprevEra of Cyberpunk is arriving!

I'm not a libertarian or an extremist, but I've had to reject some pretty simplistic views that businesses are evil.

Tech companies (in spite of all of their warts) are at least promoting the free flow of information. This (free thought and expression) is the bedrock of every successful culture in history. Moreover, loss of these has been the downfall of almost every one of these cultures.

No thanks! reply linguae 17 hours agoparentWill our tech industry in Silicon Valley remain awesome, however? I've been working in Silicon Valley for nearly a decade, and it seems to me that power in our industry within the past decade has consolidated to a small handful of companies. I'm hearing less these days about startups disrupting incumbents, and I'm hearing more about incumbents entrenching their gains. Even when it comes to career choices, it seems these days that more young people are opting for the Leetcode grind in hopes to join a FAANG or another high-paying Silicon Valley firm instead of starting a company. After all, it's hard to start a company in a garage when renting a home with a garage is prohibitively expensive for many people. My concern is that Silicon Valley could end up becoming a place where it's all about entrenched incumbents, where it would be too difficult for startups and small businesses to compete, and where those who'd otherwise be willing and ready to compete against the incumbents are stymied by extremely high housing prices that discourage risk-taking, not to mention regulatory capture from the incumbents. Silicon Valley could morph into a place that stifles innovation instead of encourages it. While I'm on this topic, it also seems to me that Silicon Valley collectively is losing the social goodwill it once had. I remember a decade ago people outside of the tech industry being very excited when they heard of one of their friends getting a job at a company like Google or Facebook. Google was still seen as one of the \"good guys,\" and Facebook was still seen as a tool people loved that allowed them to connect with their friends and family. Yes, there was discontent in some parts of the Bay Area about gentrification fueled by an influx of tech residents combined with long-standing restrictions on housing development, but the broader society still thought highly of the tech industry and Silicon Valley in particular. Today that goodwill has been eroded. There are many people who don't think highly of the current generation of tech leaders; Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, Tim Cook, Jeff Bezos, and Sam Altman seem to bring out different emotions than Steve Jobs and Bill Gates did during their heydays (and I know Jobs and Gates had their detractors). The difference, though, between Silicon Valley today and Silicon Valley in the past, however, is that Silicon Valley is a deeper part of our everyday lives today than it was in the past. The tech industry is bigger than personal computers and e-commerce; the tech industry today plays a major part of our lives. Tech has become vital infrastructure, much like how energy and telecommunication companies are. Maybe in the early days of electrification and telecommunications companies like PG&E and AT&T were better regarded, but eventually as these companies played an increasingly integral part of peoples' lives, these companies exploited this fact, and thus they lost their social goodwill. I can also think about how cars in American society undergone a transformation from being seen as a liberating force to being seen by some as an oppressive force (e.g., facilitating urban sprawl, car-dependent commuting, soul-crushing traffic congestion, etc.). Perhaps the tech industry has entered this life cycle, but I could definitely be wrong. reply FredPret 18 hours agoparentprevRight!?

Who benefits from the laws enacted? For example, do the laws enacted favor drug companies and help them charge $1000 per month, or do the laws help keep drug cost under control? Do the laws enacted ensure that workers earn a living wage, or do they ensure that corporations can charge whatever price they want and pay as little as possible? What is the federal minimum wage?

That's all that's happening here. There is a well understood principle hhere too called the alienation of labor [2]. To summarize, without pushback workers will become increasingly estranged from and unable to produce the products they produce. This is ultimately bad for the corporations that are exploiting them and the society as a whole because if nobody has any money, then there are no customers for your business.

That's all that's happening here. This is not an honest summary of the literature. Every recent increase in the minimum wage in America has produced zero to positive local employment effects [1][2][3][4]. Per your source, however, it also causes (non-monetary) inflation [5]. Moreover, we find in other countries that there is a limit to the tactic: in France, minimum-wage increases significantly decrease employment [6]. So no, people expressing scepticism towards minimum-wage increases are being duped no more than those being told it's corporate propaganda. They're asking legitimate questions that have nuanced answers. (It's also reasonable to ask if rural Alabama might have a different minimum wage from New York City.)

There are people trying to abolish the minimum wage in the US.[1] \"Abolishing the federal minimum wage would help small businesses. Some economic theory suggests it would lower labor costs, expand the worker pool, raise profits, and reduce costs for consumers, as businesses tend to pass off the burden onto them. Also, ending it would delay the automation revolution. At a time in which ChatGPT – the AI chatbot that answers questions – is all the rage, more jobs get lost to machines every day (Burton & Wolla, 2021). The first ones to go are minimum-wage jobs. “Increasing the minimum wage decreases significantly the share of automatable employment held by low-skilled workers,” according to Professors Lordan of the London School of Economics and Neumark of UC Irvine (Lordan & Neumark, 2015).

The FAA mandates that the jet broadcast its location over ADS-B, mostly to avoid being hit by other jets. There are fortunately many websites that aggregate data from honorable volunteers with ADS-B receivers. So much that it’s easy to determine Mark probably took a trip to Cabos in late September. I suppose it’s not explicitly public that it’s mark’s jet, the FAA has it registered to A7P TRUST CO INC TRUSTEE in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Another quick Google will lead you to an article that talks about how Mark’s last house was sold by an LLC managed by A7P (real estate transactions and their parties are also public data in most US jurisdictions). It’s not as if these accounts were revealing deep secrets, that were otherwise undiscoverable. I guess now he knows how the rest of us feel about be tracked? reply zitterbewegung 19 hours agoparentBezos stopped owning a jet and instead chartering flights which since the jets are owned by companies the Tail number is registered to them and they use what aircraft is available which can make the Tail number be different. reply zitterbewegung 35 minutes agorootparentI must have misremembered this and there are child comments that say that he owns two jets. reply shiroiushi 18 hours agorootparentprevProbably a smart move. Plus, it might have made sense financially: does the guy really fly around so much to make it financially worthwhile to own a jet, instead of just chartering flights as needed?

Maybe when he was younger and more active, but these days I don't believe he's flying somewhere every single day or so.

You understand the purpose of advertising is to attempt to manipulate you into spending money you wouldn't otherwise, right? Even if you enjoy the product, I too enjoyed smoking. A lot. I miss it actually. The point is that it's targeting your brain, and the monkey-brain of humanity in general, with the intention of siphoning money from you to them. Hyper-consumerism isn't a virtue, it's an addiction. Sincerely, I doubt you'd be worse off if you bought less stuff. Or, rather, considered your purchases in a less impulsive manner - buying from an ad is impulsive. I also struggle to understand how Facebook and Instagram have made anyone \"socially richer\". From where I'm standing, the proliferation of social media has greatly increased all the bad parts of human social nature. Competitiveness, insecurity, self-hatred. These platforms are designed for maximum engagement and as such they target your most sensitive emotion, particularly fear. It's gotten to a point where most people cannot even socialize in-person properly due to the fear. Everyone is hyper-aware of how they may be perceived, and everyone is constantly comparing themselves to others. In addition, fear about the state of the world has been on the rise for a while. There's 0 doubt in my mind that social media has been instrumental to this degredation. reply FredPret 1 hour agorootparent> buying stuff I was buying more generic stuff before, now I’m buying products that are tailor made for the very specific demographic I am.

People are only getting sucked into social media vortexes because of bad mental habits they had going into it. Banning social media for under-16’s and changing attitudes towards it will certainly help a ton. If you use it as a connection tool, it’s amazingly valuable and helpful. reply consteval 49 minutes agorootparentThe inherent problem is that what you want out of social media and what it wants after you are at odds. It's not intended to be a social tool; it's intended to keep your eyes on the platform as much as possible. Their goal is to incite an addiction in you, not unlike gambling. Naturally we can take measures to try to prevent ourselves from developing an addiction. But ultimately the product itself will always attempt to undo those. In my view there's two camps of people: those who have to recognize this reality, and those that haven't. I have seen many family members literally destroy their lives and relationships due to the dopamine addiction they've developed with social media. They now only respond to blatant lies, conspiracies, racism, homophobia, and the most extreme of emotions. The trouble is this is a unique addiction, one that does not rely on a substance.

Why do you think it's not OK to do this to the people who run such companies? reply csallen 18 hours agorootparentWhether you like Facebook or not, what they do at scale (tracking the online metadata of billions of people in order to generate ad revenue) is different in both subtle and obvious ways than following a single individual around in the real world from place to place. These differences are important. For example, following people around in the real world, aka stalking, is frequently accompanied by threats or acts of physical violence, especially for famous people. Even for normal people, being tracked in the real world frequently leads to theft, burglary, or harrassment. On the other hand, being tracked by social media companies does not commonly result in either of these outcomes. Why? Because our actual physical bodies exist in the real world, making it an arena with much higher stakes. Imagine if Facebook tracked everyone's physical location, saved it to a log, and then published that log to a public website, while keeping it updated in real time. Do you think people would find that an upsetting addition to what Facebook does now? Would you find that to be an upsetting addition? If so, you must admit there is therefore a difference between doing that and what they do now. If there was no difference, then there would be nothing additional to be upset about. This is not me defending Facebook's tracking. This is simply me refuting the numerous assertions you've made in this thread that Facebook's tracking is \"identical\" to real-world stalking combined with publication of that information. It's not. reply tzs 17 hours agorootparentprevI was responding to salawat's comment which has nothing to do with Facebook.

Yes - it's legal. reply Dalewyn 18 hours agorootparentprevIt's the context that is important. As an example: Shohei Ohtani bought a house in Los Angeles a while ago, this transaction is public information by law and anyone so inclined can query the applicable public databases for it. Two of the biggest Japanese media outlets (Fuji TV and Nippon TV) then sent crews out including helicoptors to film his house from all angles, declaring this house at so-and-so address is Ohtani's house on national television. The result? Ohtani and the Dodgers blacklisted them from the press corp[1][2], and for good reason because it became a physical safety concern. Ohtani subsequently sold the house since he couldn't practically live there anymore. The moral is, if you aggregate public information to track a specific individual or entity, don't be surprised when you get kicked out for stalking and invasions of privacy.

There's plenty of other cases not involving billionaires where this is so.

If someone made an account that announced the location of your car, minute by minute, I’m sure he would not allow that either. The argument that it’s really about CO2 emissions is not persuasive – you could track each billionaire’s total CO2 output without also broadcasting their location in real time. You can absolutely have a free speech position that supports a broad variety of political speech while disallowing the real time tracking of citizens – I see no hypocrisy there either.

That doesn't mean he has. But the number being four or five orders of magnitude doesn't strike me as damning. reply consteval 2 hours agorootparentThe key here is \"changed the world\". In a capitalist economy, there's no rule anywhere saying the change has to be good or productive. Often, the best way to make money is to do purposefully destructive things. For example, consider the Tobacco industry. While yes they did, and somewhat still do, make a lot of money, they did not create any value. They siphoned it - they exchanged the purchase of tobacco for the cost of healthcare. I'm speculating, but if you were calculating the communal cost, that is the profits of tobacco minus the healthcare costs, I'm positive it would be negative. Therefore, tobacco has a negative value onto the world, but it is profitable. The profit is a facade, that money is really stolen. This demostrates one of the core flaws with current economic systems - you can create profit without creating value. You can simply move money around and get some profit, and you can even destroy money and yet make money. Keep in mind Facebook gets it's profit via advertising. The money they make is due to manipulating people to spend their money on things they wouldn't otherwise buy. The analysis is difficult, and I'm not saying what they're doing is bad per se, but the actual value they create is certainly debatable. All that is to say, simply changing the world is a meaningless metric. Certainly, I can change the world for the worse, if I want, and profit in-between. In such a scenario not only am I not equivalent to a janitor, I actually create less value. While making orders of magnitude more money. reply worik 18 hours agorootparentprev> he's changed the world to within many orders of magnitude of that which the ... the average minimum-wage earner, does.

    "originBody": "The Forest Service is Losing 2,400 Jobs—Including Most of its Trail Workers In response to a shrinking budget, the land management agency is suspending seasonal hiring next year. Public lands will bear the cost. Published Oct 21, 2024 Nathan Pipenberg Repost Share Photo: USDA Forest Service A pack stock specialist uses a chainsaw to remove a tree Photo: USDA Forest Service Heading out the door? Read this article on the new Outside+ app available now on iOS devices for members! Download the app. The U.S. Forest Service is a federal agency that manages 193 million acres of land, an area about the size of Texas. Next year, the agency will have to manage that land without its seasonal workforce. In September, the agency announced that it would be suspending all seasonal hiring for the 2025 season, a decision that will cut about 2,400 jobs. Nearly all of those positions are field-based jobs, ranging from biologists and timber workers to trail technicians and recreation staff. In addition, the agency is freezing all external hiring for permanent positions. The only exception to the hiring freeze are the roughly 11,300 firefighters hired by the agency every year. According to the agency and its partners, the effects of these staffing cuts will be far-ranging and severe. In the September 17 all-employee call where he announced the hiring freeze, Forest Service Chief Randy Moore said “We just can’t get the same work done with fewer employees.” Though the Forest Service has been shedding jobs for decades—about 8,000 jobs in the last 20 years, Moore said—this will be the largest single-year staff cut in recent memory. Seasonal employees perform vital fieldwork and research that extends beyond what many Americans consider the jurisdiction of the Forest Service. Rangers patrol whitewater rivers, rock climbing crags, and dangerous alpine summits. Biologists staff critical salmon fisheries. Recreation crews maintain forest roads and clean camp latrines. Employees of all types chip in as emergency firefighters when required. According to the American Avalanche Association, the staff cuts could leave some avalanche centers, which rely on the Forest Service for funding, understaffed this winter. And then there are trails. According to the Government Accountability Office, the Forest Service has had a maintenance backlog for more than a decade, and oversees more miles of trail than it can maintain. Cutting the majority of its field-going trail staff will only make the issue worse. “This policy will result in a burgeoning of the trail maintenance backlog, both through lack of Forest Service staff attention to trail maintenance, but also through the loss of connection and relationships with partner organizations,” Mike Passo, the executive director of American Trails, a non-profit Forest Service partner, said in an email. Backpacker spoke to nearly a dozen permanent and seasonal Forest Service employees, most on condition of anonymity, about their experiences with the staffing cuts. Several expressed concern that trail crews would simply be unable to operate. They described crews of six seasonal employees disappearing, leaving one or two permanent crew leaders left trying to make things work. One intern in the National Pathways program, designed to automatically place successful interns into a full-time position with the agency, said she’s been told her job offer will likely be revoked. Other trail workers at conservation corps and non-profits who saw Forest Service positions as a step up the career ladder are rethinking their priorities. Danica Mooney-Jones, a trail crew leader who’s been with the Forest Service since 2021, is among those out of a job next year. Where she works, the trail crew staff will go from five to two, and the broader recreation program is being cut from 13 employees to just four. Trail workers on Cottonwood Pass in the Inyo National Forest (Photo: USDA Forest Service) “I moved across the country to work here, for a seasonal job,” she says. “We have people who have worked here for 10 years as seasonals, and made a career out of these positions. They trusted that the jobs wouldn’t go away.” Now, she and her former co-workers have a tough choice to make: leave their communities to find a job in trails somewhere else, or stay put and find a new career. Mooney Jones considers herself lucky; armed with wilderness EMT training, she found a local winter job as a ski patroller. Still, the idea of leaving the Forest Service behind for good is sobering. “I’d be really sad if this was the end of my trail career,” says Mooney-Jones. “I really love doing the work, I love seeing the product, and I’m very proud of the work that we do.” Trail maintenance is important every season, but 2025 may prove an especially difficult year to cut down on the workers who make it happen. After Hurricane Helene, southern portions of the Appalachian Trail are closed due to blowdowns, landslides, and washed out bridges. According to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, there are more than 2,000 trees to clear from the AT in Tennessee alone, and many Forest Service access roads from Georgia to Virginia are closed due to erosion and rockfall. That’s just on the AT—a popular long-distance trail supported by a non-profit organization and hundreds of trained volunteers. Elsewhere in the southern US, lesser-known trails face similar conditions but rely solely on Forest Service staff in order to re-open. The cuts also left employees and partners wondering how the budget shortfall became so dire after several promising years of funding increases. In 2021, the Biden administration mandated a $15 per hour minimum wage for all federal employees, which raised wages for some entry-level Forest Service jobs. Over the past several years, the agency also converted about 1,300 seasonal non-fire positions into permanent jobs. Wildland firefighters, who now make up about half of the Forest Service’s workforce, received bonuses of up to $20,000 per year, which were temporarily funded through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act. Several Forest Service employees said there was hope that pay raises for firefighters would eventually translate into raises for other field-going employees, as well. But those short-term gains have all but disappeared, replaced by a sudden budget shortfall. In March, the Forest Service requested $8.9 billion in funding, a $500 million jump from 2024’s $8.37 billion. By the summer, it was clear the agency was unlikely to receive it. In August, Forest Service Chief Randy Moore released a statement preparing the USFS for a reduced budget. With little evidence that Congress would pass a bill funding the government by the end of the year, Moore said in the September 17 all-employee call that “[the Forest Service] has an obligation to plan for the most conservative funding possibility.” A week later, Congress passed a continuing resolution that extended the 2024 funding levels through December 20. The lowest number Moore referred to comes from the proposal from the House Interior Appropriations Committee, which sets spending limits for all federal land management agencies, including the Forest Service and National Park Service. This year’s proposal includes $8.43 billion for the Forest Service—technically a modest increase compared to 2024. But last year’s budget was boosted by an additional $945 million through pandemic-era stimulus bills, a funding source that has since dried up. And while the House proposal fully funds the firefighter pay raises, the proposed budget would still necessitate cuts elsewhere at the agency. All of these details muddy the financial picture, but compared to total funding in 2024, the agency could face a budget hole of nearly a billion dollars next year. Because the Forest Service’s budget for next year is still not finalized, there is a chance the agency will fill some seasonal positions in the near future. “We are working closely with individual partners to explore creative solutions to fill gaps where we can. And we hope to have more hiring options in the coming year if additional funding becomes available,” Scott Owen, national press officer for the Forest Service, wrote in an email. Even with these sobering financial details, it’s clear that the agency’s decision to balance the books by cutting seasonal jobs came as a shock to many employees. “My trust has definitely taken a hit,” says Mooney-Jones. “I’d consider coming back to the Forest Service, but I’m not sure I could. It’s a balancing act between how I feel about how we’ve been treated and how much I love the forest.” From 2024 Nathan Pipenberg Nathan's work focuses on travel, the outdoors, and environmental issues. His work has been featured in publications like Outside Online, Backpacker Magazine, Mountain Flyer, and REI.

Maybe it makes more monetary sense to uproot every last tree to extract lumber. Maybe it makes more monetary sense to just kill people with serious illnesses or disabilities instead of building more hospitals. Maybe it makes more monetary sense to just put every damn child to work in the mines or in an Amazon fulfillment center instead of sending them to school. I can go on.

We could charge use fees and have the RV producers and hiking boot makers contribute in order to safeguard their business. But parks have value beyond the economic. They are valuable as cultural centerpieces. They define national identity. Without Yellowstone, the US would be less of a country. Without Central Park, New York would not be as iconic a city. These things need to be funded without regard to economic activity. They are beyond math. References to economic activity in relation to parks can be dangerous. Once we see them as engines of economic activity, then we will seek to maximize that activity. A national forest should not be described as a source of timber fees and tourist dollars. Down that road comes drilling for oil in parks, more roads, more hotels and the inevitable conversion of wild fields into condos. reply specialist 5 hours agorootparentprevObviously, I wholly agree with your preference for moral and values based justifications.

Some people only see the world thru dollars signs. Framing with positive ROI helps moot the \"we can't afford it\" zero sum scarcity mindset. Like exposing NIMBYs.

It’s a pension plan that people pay into. Similarly for Medicare. People pay into it before retirement. Then at a certain age they get this insurance benefit. Private insurers will not insure the elderly. If anything you should characterize this as a private insurance industry subsidy. It allows insurers to offload their riskiest clients to another entity. Your characterization is badly wrong. EDIT: Until recently Social Security took in more money than it paid out. It’s run by the government so its expenditures are counted as a budget item. But it is a sound pension system whose defects can be easily fixed if a certain party would actually govern. It is not the largest expense by the government. It’s just that it is a government run pension system. It’s not an entitlement either. reply jandrewrogers 15 hours agorootparentThis is incorrect per the US Supreme Court e.g. Flemming v Nestor in 1960. Social Security contributions are purely an income tax like any other, it is explicitly neither a pension nor insurance plan. Contributions create no obligation for the government to give you anything in return, same as the other income taxes you pay. The government largely treats it as tax revenue. It is intentionally (mis)represented as a pension plan where contributions are connected to benefits but that fiction is solely to maintain popular political support, they can disqualify citizens from eligibility at any time regardless of contributions and, on occasion, have. The main issue with Social Security is that most people in prior generations took far more out than they contributed, in part because it wasn’t really a requirement since it wasn’t actually a pension. reply skhunted 14 hours agorootparentIf the Supreme's deem it so then it must be.

If it did this, keeping in place Social Security “taxes” that would then go to the new corporation, we would not consider Social Security a budget expense.

But it's plausible that the Supreme Court could find government meddling on Social Security unconstitutional, because similar decisions have already been made in other countries. In Finland, the mandatory pension system is similar to Social Security, except that it aims to replace ~60% of earned income without any limits. Pensions based on past contributions have been established as constitutionally protected private property. If the system seems to be out of balance, the basic tools are raising the contribution rates without increasing the benefits and increasing the retirement age for younger generations. Any changes that would substantially lower the pensions that have already been earned would have to go through the same process as constitutional amendments. (There is also a third tool: increasing the tax rates for all retirement income, regardless of the source.

It’s a government run pension system. reply tptacek 15 hours agorootparentThis is not at all how the accounting for Social Security, Medicare, and other mandatory spending programs work. Generally, Social Security beneficiaries receive more than they paid in (invariably they do with Medicare). And, obviously, everyone receiving Medicaid and SSDI do. I don't think this technical point about Social Security is going to salvage the argument that the US pays more in defense than anything else. reply skhunted 15 hours agorootparentApparently you don't understand how pensions work. Take a 401(k). Under normal circumstances what you take out of the 401(k) far exceeds what you put into it. This is what happens with investments generally speaking.

Surely something like a handgun or detonated explosive would be cheaper and just as effective (though less fun). I don't think this use case needs the vehicle to be armored. reply jandrewrogers 17 hours agorootparentA pistol would be hilariously inadequate. As for \"detonating explosives\", what do you think they are doing? They are shooting high-explosive artillery rounds from a tank that detonate on impact. As for \"why artillery\", how do you plan on getting explosives into the snowpack, especially under conditions of severe avalanche risk? Those areas of the mountains are inaccessible by vehicle even in the summertime. A tank can drive on a road and deliver the explosives where needed. They often target 20+ separate snowfields so being able to do it in a timely and efficient manner matters. While the armor doesn't contribute much, it happens to be what the artillery gun is attached to. It would cost far more to rig some special-purpose vehicle. Sherman tanks are free, the government has loads of them lying around waiting to be scrapped, you just pay for fuel and upkeep. reply ceejayoz 17 hours agorootparentprevHandguns don't have the range or power.

It's kind of an, um, gift certificate. This year they gave Israel $18 billion, so much more than usual. In one sense, all of this is actually a jobs program for the US defense industry, since all that money is required to turn around as weapons purchases from US companies. Even $18 billion is less than 1% of the US non-military budget, this isn't the reason we \"can't afford\" the USFS, or the reason to stop giving weapons to Israel -- the US certainly can afford both. (The reason to stop supplying Israel is that those weapons are actually destabilizing the region and encouraging violence and gross human rights violations). But, no, Israel \"buys\" US weapons with US money, they are indeed a gift. https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/papers/2024/USspendingIs... reply fshbbdssbbgdd 13 hours agorootparentI think two different accounting methods are being conflated here which leads to the huge $3B vs $18B difference. Congress periodically authorizes spending for military aid to Israel and other countries. Later, the executive branch actually disburses that aid. In recent years, the US has on average given Israel $3B. This year, congress authorized an additional $18B to be disbursed through 2026 - which is what recent news stories about US giving Israel $18B are referring to, as far as I know. You would end up double-counting every dollar, if you did the math that way on an ongoing basis. But if you know of a clean source of data on the actual amount of aid provided each year, that would be useful. I’d guess the number this year would be a lot more than $3B given the physical reality of tons of expensive offensive and defense missiles fired. reply jrochkind1 4 hours agorootparentOK good point that the $18 billion is not all to be spent this year, thanks for correction, I didn't realize that, it is good to be clear! The best source i have for understanding this stuff is the study from professors at Brown University I linked above, but I haven't read/assimilated the whole thing yet. But my main point is we DO give Israel money to buy our weapons, they are indeed a gift. I don't know if Israel spends any of their own budget on US weapons -- my guess would be very little, because they would _rather_ be funding their own Israeli domestic defense industry (which is of course quite developed), they spend our military aid $$ on US defense industry because it is required as a condition of the gift. (There was a time in the past, when Israel, alone of all military aid recipients, was allowed to spend a portion of military aid on their own domestic defense industry, I guess becuase the US wanted to support the develpment of that specially among all other recipients of US military aid. It worked, Israel now sells $billions of weapons to autocratic Arab regimes in the middle-east and north africa: Notably Bahrain, the UAE, and Morocco. Saudi Arabia would love in on that too. But those provisions expired a few years ago, now all US military aid to Israel has to be spent on weapons from the US, just like other US military aid recipients.) reply nerdponx 17 hours agorootparentprevGood to know and thanks for that link.

GPS is another thing like that: it’s only a little bit useful to me, but it enables a lot of economic activity (like farm automation). And the fact that getting lost went from a regular thing that happens to rarely is probably at least somewhat valuable. Remote telecom is another thing. For sure, there are diminishing returns, but going from no access to some access for very remote places (think ships at sea, polar research stations, oil rigs, very rural communities) is probably valuable. How many ships haven’t sunk because they got a satellite weather update? You’re absolutely right, it’s not a strategy to invest randomly. And it’s quite possible that we’re over-investing in space.

Don't focus so much on GDP, when the increasing Gini coefficient tells you it's unevenly distributed. It's especially odd given how single-income families were more common in the 1950s, so a lot of adults had no salary. If we really wanted to raise the GDP, use tax dollars to fund preschools. Unpaid parents (usually mothers) watching the kids for free isn't included in GDP. Paid teachers are. And those mothers can get a job, raising the GDP even more, all paid by a progressive taxation and wealth tax to help lower Gini. Eating steak every day is a fool's errand.

    "originLink": "https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/row-poly/",
    "originBody": "home blog lisp favorites pl resources bread recipes rss Adding row polymorphism to Damas-Hindley-Milner October 22, 2024 Intro to HM Damas-Hindley-Milner (HM) is a type system for Standard ML and the ML-family languages. River and I wrote about it earlier this month. Check out that post if you would like an introduction or refresher. In this post, we’ll add row polymorphism to it. We’ll do it in the context of scrapscript’s implementation of Algorithm J, but the core ideas should be language and algorithm-independent. Records A record is an unordered collection of name to value mappings, like { x = 1, y = \"hello\" }. Scrapscript has a very dynamic notion of records in the interpreter and the compiler: any record can have any number of fields, with any names, with any values. This makes code like the following possible: get_x { x=1, y=2 } . get_x ={ x=x, ... } -> x At run-time, the pattern matching looks for a field named x in the record and ignores the rest. The spread (...) indicates that it’s okay to also have other fields in the record. If the pattern were instead { x=x }, then the match would fail at run-time due to excess fields. The following snippet also runs even though left and right have different leftover record parts: get_x left + get_x right . left = { x = 1, y = 2 } . right = { x = 1, y = 2, z = 3 } . get_x ={ x = x, ... } -> x This “leftover” bit isn’t straightforward to model in the type system. We’ll need some special sauce there. Right now, in the type system, we don’t support records at all. If we try to infer the type of one, it’ll fail with “unsupported” or something. We need to model records in the type system. Rows A lot of papers use a notion of rows to model records, kind of how you can use cons cells to model lists. A row is a mapping of names to types, like {x=int, y=string}. Rows also have a special field called rest which contains the type of the leftover fields. It’s either a type variable or the empty row. Having the empty row means that the record has no leftover fields. In fact, the example row above ({x=int, y=string}) is assumed to have the empty row as its rest field because all of these papers love shorthand. If it were extensible, if it had a type variable as its rest field, then it would be written as {x=int, y=string, ...'a}. This does mean that it’s possible to have nested rows like {x=int, ...'a={y=string, ...'b}}. This is normal but you’ll never see it in notation because everybody implicitly flattens the rows because it looks nicer. Also because unification happens on the flattened rows, but we’ll get there later. Now let’s talk about the data structures we’ll use to implement rows. We’ll reuse some of the data structures from the intro-to-HM post. The data structures It’s as I said: a row is either an empty row (TyEmptyRow) or has fields and a leftover/rest field (TyRow). @dataclasses.dataclass class TyEmptyRow(MonoType): pass @dataclasses.dataclass class TyRow(MonoType): fields: dict[str, MonoType] rest: TyVarTyEmptyRow = dataclasses.field(default_factory=TyEmptyRow) In order to unify and print rows, we’ll often deal with them in their flattened representation, which is a collapsed tuple of fields and a rest type. One key difference: because it is collapsed, the rest must be either the empty row or an unbound type variable. Also: not everybody uses the exact same representation. Some go for more cons-cell-like representations where every row has a label and a type and then a rest—no fields dict. They’re equivalent. Inferring record literals When we’re inferring the type of a record literal, we infer the types of the values and then construct a row from them. We should never see a ... in a record literal because we only support it in pattern matching. def infer_type(expr: Object, ctx: Context) -> MonoType: # ... if isinstance(expr, Record): fields = {} rest: TyVarTyEmptyRow = TyEmptyRow() for key, value in expr.data.items(): assert not isinstance(value, Spread) fields[key] = infer_type(value, ctx) return set_type(expr, TyRow(fields, rest)) # ... Pattern matching on records Pattern matching inference changed a little bit since the last post but not enough to make a big deal out of it. We now use this kind-of-similar infer_pattern_type function to infer the type of a pattern. It looks similar to infer_type but it’s a little more complicated because it has to invent fresh type variables for all variables in the pattern and it also has to deal with spread. In the case of records, we default to building a closed row. However, if we see a spread, we invent a fresh type variable and use that as the rest of the row. def infer_pattern_type(pattern: Object, ctx: Context) -> MonoType: # ... if isinstance(pattern, Record): fields = {} rest: TyVarTyEmptyRow = TyEmptyRow() # Default closed row for key, value in pattern.data.items(): if isinstance(value, Spread): # Open row rest = fresh_tyvar() if value.name is not None: ctx[value.name] = Forall([], rest) break fields[key] = infer_pattern_type(value, ctx) return set_type(pattern, TyRow(fields, rest)) # ... We also bind the rest variable to the name of the spread, if it’s named. This means we can do stuff like{ x=x, ...rest } -> something and then use rest in the something expression. Unifying rows: building intuition I don’t want to get too into it yet, but I want to explain that rows aren’t special in unification. I thought that there was some quirk or trick in the representation that enabled row polymorphism, but that’s not the case at all (shout-out to Sinan and River for making this clear). Unification is just unification. Whatever types it gets, it will make them equal. Permanently. If it can’t, there’s a type error. Let’s look at some examples: {x=int} unifies with {x=int} {x=int} does not unify with {x=string} because the types that correspond with x don’t unify Some type systems allow this by having a notion of “type sets” and I think this might be related to polymorphic variants but I’m not sure {x=int} does not unify with {y=string} because the fields don’t match and they are not extensible {x=int, ...'a} unifies with {y=string, ...'b} unification will set 'a equal to {y=string, ...'c} and 'b equal to {x=int, ...'c} note how they both get the same leftover row 'c because they are unified and supposed to stay that way Okay, so that means that if you have a function that is meant to be generic over a single field, how does that work? How can you have{x=x, ...} -> x if for every call to that function, the type of ... keeps expanding as it is unified? It might start as {x=int, ...'a} -> int but over time 'a will get bound to other row types and it might end up as {x=int, y=int, z=int, ...'d} and that will be too restrictive! What’s going on?? Let polymorphism What’s actually happening is boring: let polymorphism strikes once again. We talked about let polymorphism in the last post, but here’s a refresher: if you have an unbound type variable in a let-bound function type, it will get generalized with a forall. Have a function 'a list -> 'a? Well, the type in the context (the environment that deals in type variables) is actually forall 'a. 'a list -> 'a. Every use of that named function will instantiate that forall with a fresh type variable (maybe 'b or 't123 or whatever). This means that the same function can be generic over one or more type variables. Great. So that pattern match function above? The one with type {x=int, ...'a} -> int? Well, if it’s bound to a name, it will get generalized to forall 'a. {x=int, ...'a} -> int. So every call, well… you know the rest. That’s row polymorphism. Unifying rows: brass tacks Alright, well, assuming we have what I thought was the hard part done already, let’s go over unification in excruciating detail. We’ll start with a neat little base case: empty rows can only unify with other empty rows: def unify_type(ty1: MonoType, ty2: MonoType) -> None: # ... if isinstance(ty1, TyEmptyRow) and isinstance(ty2, TyEmptyRow): return # ... Yay, nice. Let’s continue. We’ll start by flattening the rows. For every field name present in either row, we’ll try to unify the types pairwise. But if it’s missing in one of the rows, we have to add it to the other one. So we collect that in ty1_missing (missing from ty1) and ty2_missing (missing from ty2). This leaves us with four cases: Both rows have all the same fields. In that case, we unify the rests so they stay the same. One row has all the same fields as the other and also some more. In that case, add the missing fields to the other (smaller) row. Note that they share a rest. The same, but flipped the other direction. They each have fields the other lacks. In that case, create new rows with the missing fields and share a rest. Now follow along in code: def unify_type(ty1: MonoType, ty2: MonoType) -> None: # ... if isinstance(ty1, TyRow) and isinstance(ty2, TyRow): ty1_fields, ty1_rest = row_flatten(ty1) ty2_fields, ty2_rest = row_flatten(ty2) ty1_missing = {} ty2_missing = {} all_field_names = set(ty1_fields.keys())set(ty2_fields.keys()) for key in sorted(all_field_names): # Sort for deterministic error messages ty1_val = ty1_fields.get(key) ty2_val = ty2_fields.get(key) if ty1_val is not None and ty2_val is not None: unify_type(ty1_val, ty2_val) elif ty1_val is None: assert ty2_val is not None ty1_missing[key] = ty2_val elif ty2_val is None: assert ty1_val is not None ty2_missing[key] = ty1_val # In general, we want to: # 1) Add missing fields from one row to the other row # 2) \"Keep the rows unified\" by linking each row's rest to the other # row's rest if not ty1_missing and not ty2_missing: # They both have the same fields for now, so make sure they have # the same fields *forever* by unifying the rests. unify_type(ty1_rest, ty2_rest) return if not ty1_missing: # The first row has fields that the second row doesn't have; add # them to the second row unify_type(ty2_rest, TyRow(ty2_missing, ty1_rest)) return if not ty2_missing: # The second row has fields that the first row doesn't have; add # them to the first row unify_type(ty1_rest, TyRow(ty1_missing, ty2_rest)) return # They each have fields the other lacks; create new rows sharing a rest # and add the missing fields to each row rest = fresh_tyvar() unify_type(ty1_rest, TyRow(ty1_missing, rest)) unify_type(ty2_rest, TyRow(ty2_missing, rest)) return # ... There’s a lot of code but the important thing to know is that both rows are going to end up with the same fields and the same rest type. Wrapping up There you have it. That constitutes row polymorphism. There’s some other stuff we don’t need to get into because Scrapscript doesn’t have some language features. For example, Daan Leijen of scoped labels fame jumped into the Hacker News thread to explain why we might not need scoped/shadowed/duplicate labels: About duplicate labels.. one needs to retain the duplicate field at runtime if there is a “remove_l” or “mask_l” operation that drops a field “l”. For example, {x=2,x=True}.remove_x.x == True. (Where the type of remove_l is {l:a|r} -> {r}) Since we don’t have such a masking operation, our lives are easier. Cool. We’ve heard that we can use rows to implement polymorphic variants, but haven’t figured that part out yet… See also Check out the Scrapscript PR.

    "commentBody": "Adding row polymorphism to Damas-Hindley-Milner (bernsteinbear.com)185 points by surprisetalk 13 hours agohidepastfavorite48 comments kccqzy 5 hours agoIt's easy enough to add row polymorphism if there is no subtyping involved. It is an entirely different matter otherwise. For example if a function needs to take a record containing x as a field with type int, it should also accept a record with y as a field that it does not use. This is just like in traditional OOP if a function takes a base class pointer, you can pass a subclass class pointer instead, just that these subtyping relationships are not explicitly defined by users but inferred by the record contents. There is width subtyping and there is also depth subtyping. And we also need awareness of contravariance and covariance. I implemented the above as a toy type checker. I found the above combination of features too complicated and they end up being unintuitive for the user: the type errors are difficult to comprehend when type errors are found. My implementation is here: https://gist.github.com/kccqzy/d761b8adc840333af0303e1b822d7... and I mostly followed the paper but I cannot guarantee there aren't bugs. reply paldepind2 1 hour agoparent> For example if a function needs to take a record containing x as a field with type int, it should also accept a record with y as a field that it does not use. Not sure if I misunderstand what you mean, but this does not require subtyping. One of the key distinguishing features of row polymorphism is that exactly this can be achieved without subtyping. The extra unused fields (`y` in your example) are represented as a polymorphic type variable _instead_ of using subtyping. See for instance page 7 in these slides: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aldrich/courses/819/slides/rows.pdf reply calebh 4 hours agoparentprevFunctions that use a field called x but do not use a field called y can use the type {x=int, ... 'a}, right? The main difficulty I see with row polymorphism is with field shadowing. For example if you have a record with type {a=bool, x=int, c=unit}, then set the x field with type string instead, the new type should be {a=bool, x=string, c=unit}. I suppose if you only have syntax for creating a record with a literal, but do not have syntax for updating an existing record this is not a problem. reply kccqzy 3 hours agorootparentI don't exactly understand your concern, but yes the type {x=int, ... 'a} is valid in a language with row polymorphism but without subtyping. If you do have subtyping, dealing with rest (or spread) is unnecessary. But if you remove subtyping, the unification algorithm isn't powerful enough on its own for many intuitive use cases. The easiest example is if a function takes a list of records all of which need an x field of type int, then you cannot pass it a list of records where all contain the x field of int but some also contain an irrelevant y field and others contain an irrelevant z field. reply hencq 2 hours agorootparent> if a function takes a list of records all of which need an x field of type int, then you cannot pass it a list of records where all contain the x field of int but some also contain an irrelevant y field and others contain an irrelevant z field. Can you explain that a little more? Intuitively I would imagine that those y and z fields would 'disappear' into the rest part. reply kccqzy 2 hours agorootparentWith subtyping, the type checker would understand that the list type is covariant and would accept a record with more irrelevant fields, because that's a valid subtype. Without subtyping, the rest part needs to be identical for each element of the list. In fact you cannot even express the concept of a list with different rest parts. The key thing to understand is that the rest part never really disappears. The type checker always deduces what the rest part should be in every case. In languages like Haskell you can work around this by using existential quantification but that's a whole different extension to the type system, and one that's certainly not as flexible as full subtyping. reply ogogmad 1 hour agoparentprevWhy have subtyping when you have row polymorphism? It seems that there's enough overlap that you should pick one or the other. reply kccqzy 21 minutes agorootparentMy whole point is that subtyping or row polymorphism alone is not enough to assign types to many valid programs that people intuitively write. My example about list of records shows you what happens when you only have row polymorphism without subtyping. See my other comment. (Nothing prevents you from designing such a type system that's slightly inconvenient though: it's really about whether users would want this type system.) If you were to go the other direction and choose only subtyping but not row polymorphism to implement records, then you end up co-opting things like intersection types inappropriately leading to unsoundness. reply rtpg 12 hours agoprevRow polymorphism is excellent. I was intro'd to it in Purescript, but I would like to say that Typescript gives you some things that rhyme with it through its combinations of records at the type level. Highly recommend people mess around with Purescript, you can feel how much pressure is relieved thanks to the row polymorphism tooling almost instantly. Truly, all we wanted as an industry is an easy way to bundle together various tags into our types, and row polymorphism gets you there. I think row polymorphism is a fairly straightforward thing compared to dependent types in general, but can let you crush a whole class of errors and pay almost nothing in terms of expression costs. reply enugu 10 hours agoparentSomtime ago, there was a debate on the ability of a static type system to model an 'open-world situation' where fields are added to records as model changes. (based on a post[1] which responded to a Rich Hickey talk). The crucial point was that structural typing on which row-polymorphism is based can model such open-world situations. Also, having such a system can free you from having overly nested types. It would be great if Purescript or row-polymorphism became more popular.

Row polymorphism is a type-level feature in PureScript where record types are constructed with an explicit \"row\" of fields. In Practice, row polymorphism is more granular, allowing you to explicitly allow certain fields while tracking all other fields via a (\"rest\") type variable. Example: PureScript allows you to remove specific fields from a record type. This feature, is called record subtraction, and it allows more flexibility when transforming or narrowing down records. You can also apply exact field constraints; meaning, you can constrain records to have exactly the fields you specify. Lastly, PureScript allows you to abstract over rows using higher-kinded types. You can create polymorphic functions that accept any record with a flexible set of fields and can transform or manipulate those fields in various ways. This level of abstraction is not possible in TypeScript. These are just a few examples. In the most general sense, you can think of row polymorphism as a really robust tool that gives you a ton of flexibility regarding strictness and validation. reply blue_pants 5 hours agorootparent> PureScript allows you to remove specific fields from a record type. This feature, is called record subtraction, and it allows more flexibility when transforming or narrowing down records. TypeScript does allow you to remove specific fields, if I understand you right [0]: function removeField(obj: T, field: K): Omit { const { [field]: _, ...rest } = obj; return rest; } type Person = { name: string; age: number }; declare const p: Person; const result = removeField(p, 'age'); // result is of type: Omit > PureScript allows you to abstract over rows using higher-kinded types. You can create polymorphic functions that accept any record with a flexible set of fields and can transform or manipulate those fields in various ways. This level of abstraction is not possible in TypeScript. Again, if I understand you correctly, then TypeScript is able to do fancy manipulations of arbitrary records [1]: type StringToNumber = { [K in keyof T]: T[K] extends string ? number : T[K] } function stringToLength>(obj: T): StringToNumber { const result: Record = {}; for (const key in obj) { result[key] = typeof obj[key] === 'string' ? obj[key].length : obj[key]; } return result as StringToNumber; } const data = { name: \"Alice\", age: 30, city: \"New York\" }; const lengths = stringToLength(data); lengths.name // number lengths.age // number lengths.city // number [0] https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/?#code/GYVwdgxgLglg9mABA...

The problem in question can be \"fixed\" like this const r1: { a: number; b: number } = { a: 10, b: 20 }; const r2 = r1 satisfies { a: number }; const r3: { a: number; b: string } = { b: \"hello\", ...r2 }; Now, TS would warn us that \"'b' is specified more than once, so this usage will be overwritten\". And if we remove b property -- \"Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'\" Another \"fix\" would be to avoid using spread operator and specify every property manually . Both of these solutions are far from ideal, I agree. --- I don't advocate TS in this thread though; I genuinely want to understand what makes row polymorphism different, and after reading several articles and harassing Claude Sonnet about it, I still didn't grasp what row polymorphism allows over what TS has. reply wk_end 1 hour agorootparentAs far as I understand it, row polymorphism wouldn’t allow the given example. Or to put it another way, the spread operator is impossible to type soundly in the presence of structural subtyping because the type system doesn’t capture the “openness” of the record’s type, the potential presence of additional fields. Whereas with row polymorphism, to some degree or another, you can. reply tmoertel 5 hours agorootparentprevCan `greetWithAge` be implemented using `greet`? reply tmountain 10 hours agoparentprevPureScript is such a cool language. I wish it would get more traction, but it feels like it's competing in the same space as TypeScript, and TypeScript seems to solve the category of problems it addresses well enough for most people. reply weinzierl 11 hours agoprev\"A record is an unordered collection of name to value mappings\" If there is one thing that is for sure, it is that we have too many names for \"collection of name to value mappings\". In my book the term record is not what first comes to mind when thinking of unordered mappings. All of the usages of the word I can think of imply the possibility of access by name while retaining order. Sometimes this allows easy indexed access (database rows used to be called records) sometimes it doesn't (C structs which also used to be called record types). reply gpderetta 8 hours agoparentC structs are record types, but, while the standard does guarantees an in-memory ordering, in the general case you can't really iterate through members and always have to access by tag, so it might as well be unordered. Also in C++: struct A { int x; int y; } a; struct B { int y; int x; } b; template concept has_x_y = requires(C c) { { c.x } -> std::convertible_to; { c.y } -> std::convertible_to; }; int sum(has_x_y auto z) { return z.x + z.y; } ... sum(a); sum(b); reply arianvanp 9 hours agoparentprevBut for an open world model we need the unordered definition. As two structs that have same names at different places in the struct still need to conform to the generic record type reply RandomThoughts3 10 hours agoparentprevYes, it is a very unusual definition of a record. As you rightfully noted, typically, a record is defined as a composite data structure mixing data types (indeed something more or less equivalent to a C struct basically). Access by name is not even truly necessary and the difference between tuples and records is minimal (you could build something looking exactly like field access on top of tuples with functions and would get as a result something indistinguishable from an actual record). The existence or not of an order is then totally accessory and it's generally straightforward to build an order on both provided the data types they contain is orderable by ordering the field and then using a lexicographic order. reply fire_lake 9 hours agorootparentYes in Haskell the names are just sugar for index numbers in a tuple (effectively) reply yazaddaruvala 10 hours agoparentprevI tend to agree with you. “Unordered” is very strange when clearly it is consistently “ordered” by some function(name, insertion_id) to facilitate low latency lookup. The iteration order seems arbitrary to a human, but that is exclusively because function(name, insertion_id) is not optimized for a human. It seems strange to call the collection “unordered” because of how it appears to a human. reply codeflo 10 hours agorootparentUnordered simply means the order isn’t exposed, not that the bits have somehow literally fallen out of the computer and are scattered on the floor. reply taeric 3 hours agorootparentI remember trying to explain to someone that Java's List type was ordered, where they thought ordered meant sorted. Turns out, language is tough. reply choeger 11 hours agoprevWell written! I wonder if there's a way to efficiently implement it without resorting to monomorphization? A function that's polymorphic can be transformed into a more primitive (say C or assembly) function that gets extra arguments that carry the \"shape\" of the type variable (think of sizes, pointers vs. values, etc.). Is there a similar strategy for these polymorphic records? I see two issues: 1. The offset of any particular field in the record is unknown at compile time 2. The size of the record itself is unknown at compile time (but this should be trivial as an extra argument.) reply pistoleer 10 hours agoparentSwift solves this by using witness tables. Witness table is a skeleton of the desired record shape. It records offsets of desired fields as found in the actual supplied record. Each function call the actual record is not passed, but its corresponding witness table instead. For instance, if the \"prototype\" of the argument is {int foo, float bar}, and I supply {int foo, int baz, float bar}, the table will be {foo: base+0 bytes, bar: base+8 bytes}. reply whatshisface 7 hours agorootparentWhy doesn't it limit what it pushes on the stack to (foo,bar) instead of pushing (foo,baz,bar) along with an offset table? If the offset table is possible to construct at the callsite, compiling it into the call is also possible. reply Joker_vD 6 hours agorootparentBecause the polymorphic function called may also need to pass the whole record it was given to some other polymorphic function a la \"void storeInGlobalStorage(key: string, value: T)\". reply wbl 1 hour agoparentprevCareful: the function definition doesn't remove the records but the call site does. You could transform into a type erased \"access at each offset dynamically\" form. reply marcosdumay 4 hours agoparentprev> I wonder if there's a way to efficiently implement it without resorting to monomorphization? Depends on what you consider \"efficient\". Monomorphization is necessary for the most efficient code. But you can have a vtable or a restricted type lookup. reply Jaxan 3 hours agorootparent> Monomorphization is necessary for the most efficient code. That is not always true. Monomorphisation also leads to code size increase, because the function is compiled for each type. This may decrease cache efficiency. reply Joker_vD 6 hours agoparentprevFor another approach without monomorphization see also my comment at [0] although it's only really meant for the immutable records.

I read through the source code as an experienced desktop automation/Electron developer and felt good about trying it for some basic tasks. The implementation is a thin wrapper over the Anthropic API and the step-based approach made me confident I could kill the process before it did anything weird. Installed smoothly on my M1 and was running in minutes. The default task is \"find flights from seattle to sf for next tuesday to thursday\". I let it run with my Anthropic API key and it used chrome. Takes a few seconds per action step. It correctly opened up google flights, but booked the wrong dates! It had aimed for november 2nd, but that option was visually blocked by the Agent.exe window itself, so it chose november 20th instead. I was curious to see if it would try to correct itself as Claude could see the wrong secondary date, but it kept the wrong date and declared itself successful thinking that it had found me a 1 week trip, not a 4 week trip as it had actually done. The exercise cost $0.38 in credits and about 20 seconds. Will continue to experiment reply kcorbitt 11 minutes agoparent(author here) yes it often confidently declares success when it clearly hasn't performed the task, and should have enough information from the screenshots to know that.

    "originBody": "I got dysentery so you don’t have to 5 Replies This summer, I participated in a human challenge trial at the University of Maryland. I spent the days just prior to my 30th birthday sick with shigellosis. What? Why? Dysentery is an acute disease in which pathogens attack the intestine. It is most often caused by the bacteria Shigella. It spreads via the fecal-oral route. It requires an astonishingly low number of pathogens to make a person sick – so it spreads quickly, especially in bad hygienic conditions or anywhere water can get tainted with feces. It kills about 70,000 people a year, 30,000 of whom are children under the age of 5. Almost all of these cases and deaths are among very poor people. The primary mechanism by which dysentery kills people is dehydration. The person loses fluids to diarrhea and for whatever reason (lack of knowledge, energy, water, etc) cannot regain them sufficiently. Shigella bacteria are increasingly resistant to antibiotics. A disease easily treatable by lots of fluids and antibiotics is becoming more lethal. Can someone do something? The deal with human challenge trials Clinical trials in general are expensive to run but pretty common; clinical trials where you are given the disease – “challenged”, AKA “human challenge trials” – are very rare. The regular way to investigate a possible treatment is to make a study plan, then find people who have the disease and offer to enroll them in the experimental treatment. Challenge trials are less common, but often more valuable for research – shigellosis is a fast-acting disease that is imminently treatable by antibiotics and uncommon in the US. It would be very difficult to test an alternative shigellosis treatment in the US in the conventional way, but it’s a great candidate for challenge trials. I’d signed up for email alerts on upcoming challenge trials at the nearby University of Maryland, and got one about an upcoming study. It caught my eye that it was for a phage-based treatment. Bacteriophages are really promising antibacterial medicines, not to mention what I’d studied as an undergrad. Here’s the thing: you really only get good medical research out of human subjects. Also, I could use $4000 and this seemed like a cool way to spend a couple weeks and help out medical research. So I signed up, got a check-in general health appointment, and shortly after, was told I was in. I made plans to spend my 30th birthday in a dysentery ward. Dysentery: it’s a modern disease Many of you reading this will know about dysentery from the 1971 simulation game The Oregon Trail (or its later versions). The actual Oregon Trail was a network of trails and the corresponding migration of mostly-white pioneers, moving on foot and on ox-drawn wagon from the eastern US to the western US between 1830 and 1869. About 400,000 people* crossed the Oregon Trail in this period, and a lot of them were on similar trails – a bunch of stressed and malnourished people, traveling in close quarters with their families, stopping and pooping near the same trails and creeks with no regard for water safety – diseases spread very fast in these conditions. From these and other stressors, about 65,000 people died in this 40-year period. Stated another way, more people die from dysentery now, every year than ever died from any cause on the Oregon Trail. So let’s calm down about the Oregon Trail, okay? *Lots of people use this 400,000 number but I can’t figure out where it came from and if this is referring to individuals or families – I’ve seen sources indicate it was either. If it was families, it was probably counting the men who were “the pioneers” and then being like “oh and there were women and kids there also, I guess.” But maybe it was individuals? Or maybe someone just made this up? Again, no idea where it came from. You gotta be careful every time anyone tells you a number. It’s so bad out there. The only thing worse than someone telling you a number is when they don’t tell you a number. Getting ready A week or so before I went, I’d been pointed to Jake Eberts’s twitter thread. Jake Eberts also participated in a challenge trial for a dysentery vaccine, also I think at UMD and the same Baltimore facility I was at, where he got very sick and went viral for livetweeting the experience. He started a fundraiser for dysentery relief and got a lot of people to sign up for clinical trials themselves, and now he works for 1DaySooner, premier “hey, human challenge trials are cool” advocates. I read his twitter thread and sent my friends this meme: I brought Infinite Jest, which I was partway through and was a lot more through (but still not done) by the time I was discharged. (I’m writing this while traveling, and in a fit of poor timing I finally finished it on the plane ride in, which means I now have a giant brick of a book to carry around in my suitcase.) My friend Ozy said that Infinite Jest was a really good book for reading in a dysentery ward. I thought, oh, that’s interesting, you know, a lot of the characters are pretty miserable and living in a controlling institution of some kind. Then I remembered this one passage, where circumstances have forced a character into withdrawing from heroin alone, holed up for days in a public bathroom: Time began to pass with sharp edges. Its passage in the dark or dim-lit stall was like time being carried by a procession of ants, a gleaming red martial column of those militaristic red Southern-U.S. ants that build hideous tall boiling hills, and each vile gleaming ant wanted a minuscule little portion of Poor Tony’s flesh in compensation as it helped bear time slowly forward down the corridor of true Withdrawal. By the second week in the stall time itself seemed the corridor, lightless at either end. After more time time then ceased to move to be moved or be move-throughable and assumed a shape above and apart, a huge, must-feathered, orange-eyed wingless fowl hunched incontinent atop the stall, with a kind of watchful but deeply uncaring personality that didn’t seem keen on Poor Tony Krause as a person at all, or to wish him well. Not one little bit. It spoke to him from atop the stall, the same things, over and over. They were unrepeatable. Nothing in even Poor Tony’s grim life-experience prepared him for the experience of time with a shape and an odor, squatting; and the worsening physical symptoms were a spree at Bonwit’s compared to time’s black assurances that the symptoms were merely hints, signposts pointing up at a larger, far more dire set of Withdrawal phenomena that hung just overhead by a string that unraveled steadily with the passage of time. It would not keep still and would not end; it changed shape and smell. I was forced to agree that Infinite Jest was indeed probably a pretty good choice. Two days until challenge Checking in, everyone’s bags were checked. I got the impression they really didn’t want some kind of bad outcome where they had to call cops into a ward where everyone was running around with the bloody flux, which, fair enough. They did take away my craft scissors. I didn’t end up knitting so it wasn’t a big deal but like I’m pretty sure I’ve taken those on airplanes before. Okay. We were assigned a number (I was just on this side of divinity at No. 107), given a plastic wristband, and shown to our rooms. We were also given two pairs of scrubs which were to be our main clothes on the ward – less risk of ruining hard-to-launder clothes in the more messy phases of the study – though it did mean 15 people having to coordinate laundry every day. Where I made my stand The ward was more of a retrofitted office building than a hospital. It consisted of some spaces for nurses and testing, about 6 bedrooms of various sizes (each with their own half-bath), two separate areas with two shower stalls each, a “kitchen” with snacks and where the meals were delivered to, a closet with washer and dryer, and a rec room with couches and a TV and a pool and foosball table. There were about 16 people on the ward, an even mix of men and women. Most of them were Baltimore locals; many of them had done other trials before. We were fully allowed to socialize – dysentery is, again, infectious through the fecal-oral route, hand sanitizer was stationed all over the place but there wasn’t a huge concern that we’d infect each other or even the nurses. Life on the ward is very chill. I was worried about being bored, but I’d forgotten that I spend most of my waking hours on the computer anyway, so it really wasn’t a problem. When even my iron gaze faltered and couldn’t stare at the computer anymore, I read Infinite Jest. Meals were delivered once a day – one cold usually wrap- or sandwich-based meal, one hot breakfast, one hot supper dish, labelled with people’s numbers. Sample lunch They were, like, fine. The caterers made a few interesting choices – for vegetarians such as myself, every sandwich/wrap was some veggies with hummus, and now and then there’d be like breakfast pancakes with a curry-flavored veggie hamburger patty. I would describe the flavor when drenched with table syrup as “weird.” Like, you can tell the person planning that menu was like “okay, pancakes and bacon… And wait, crap, something with protein for the vegetarians.” But again, I’ve eaten worse for things I’ve actually paid for ingredients for, and I was definitely eating better in terms of variety and volume than I did at home. I’m not complaining. One day before challenge: the age of phage This study was sort of an over-time test – ideally the first of a few, where we’d get phages before (unless we were in the control group), during, and after the “challenge” (the shigella) to see if they had any effect at all – if it did, later studies could determine if you could just drink the phage after getting sick, or if it would work best as a prophylactic, or etc. We drank a chalky buffer solution to neutralize stomach acid and give the bacteriophages (and later, the bacteria) a better chance at making it to the intestine. What do the solutions taste like? Basically all salty fluid with slight mineral nuance, from the buffer. Phages are known to be pretty tasteless so I didn’t expect anything else. Bacteriophage therapy: sending a cat after mice A bacteriophage is a virus that infects bacteria. They were discovered shortly after bacteria themselves were really pinned down – microscopes were finally powerful enough to make out bacteria, and visionaries like Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur were pinpointing that these little nothing-pinpricks were in fact the source of diseases. (For more on the discovery of the microbial world, see “Through the Looking Glass and what Zheludev Et Al. (2024) Found There”, my recent piece in Asterisk Magazine.) In 1917, Félix d’Hérelle found an agent that killed cholera bacteria, which passed through a fine filter, and which could reproduce – a living agent that killed bacteria, but that was itself smaller than a bacteria. d’Hérelle realized right away this substance which killed bacteria, and which people had apparently been drinking, had potential as medicine. He bred pathogenic bacteria in vats and added solutions, and waited until the cloudy brother of bacteria turned clear – then offered this liquid to sick patients. Many of them, sure enough, recovered. I was (unless I was in the control group) walking in historical footsteps. Dysentery was the first human disease ever treated with phage medicine. Sending a phage after bacteria is like sending a cat after mice. Phages are small, targeted, well-adapted hunters of specific bacteria. There is no way for them to infect a human cell like a human virus would – they are completely specialized. Phages are already in the body, along with their bacterial hosts – so you’re not introducing a radically new agent – and the immune system tends to play well with them. Phage are used widely in some parts of the world – the Republic of Georgia and Poland both sell phage over-the-counter, for use in say intestinal conditions or wounds, and have clinics for personalized treatment. In the US, phage therapy is an extremely rare specialty, sometimes even falling under the umbrella of naturopathy. (A phage being a natural bioactive product.) Why would you use antibiotics instead of phages, or vice versa? Phages Antibiotics Targeted – a phage attacks one species or one strain of bacteria Easy to find usable new ones More finnicky (e.g. less stable) Predator-prey pharmacokinetics Mostly spread where the bacteria are Very few side effects Broad-spectrum Hard to find usable new ones Shelf stable Regular blood-elimination-curve pharmacokinetics Systemic; enter the bloodstream Sometimes-serious side effects What if the bacteria become resistant to the phages too? Well, that can happen easily – probably even easier than with antibiotics. Cells have been duking it out with viruses since the beginning of life. (Did you know CRISPR-Cas9, now used for gene editing, evolved in nature as a way for bacteria to recognize and cut up phage DNA?) But the difference is that whereas new antibiotics are very hard to find, there is a nigh-inexhaustible evolutionary font of phages constantly pulling ahead in the arms race. So in short: once a bacteria becomes resistant to your special phage, just find a new phage. Do they work? To my knowledge, there aren’t any really gold-standard reviews comparing phages head-on to antibiotics. They are fiddlier than antibiotics, with a specialized body of knowledge for treatment – less stable, have to be introduced to the site directly, much more care in choosing an appropriate treatment. One small study found a phage treatment comparably effective to antibiotics for Salmonella typhimirium in 36 lab mice.1 Another meta-study compared modern antibiotic studies to 17 studies from the last time human phage research was in vogue in the US, the 1920s-40s, and found that phages were effective treatments – but 4 modern clinical trials suggested phages were not effective.2 A more recent study of personalized phage therapy showed promising results in infections considered “difficult-to-treat”.3 They seem to work best when used with antibiotics. I’m not doing a full lit review right now. I bet that phage therapy still has promise – more careful formulations and just more research will help. That’s before challenges of commercial rollout, including things like handling FDA approval for a product that must be reformulated regularly. The elephant in the room is antibiotic resistance – antibiotics usually work extremely well, but increasingly, bacteria can survive them. Antibiotic resistance is, unlike other diseases you might think of that are exacerbated by over-medication, not a condition of privileged countries – lots of Shigella bacteria in developing countries are increasingly antibiotic-resistant. Even if phages don’t work as well as the magic silver bullet that is antibiotics, they might work well enough to be worth incorporating into our medical toolbox as part of AMR management. And that means developing them now. The other challenge is of course regulatory – I’m excited that Intralytix, who made the experimental product I did-or-didn’t take, is throwing their hat into the space of human phage medicine, and to see how they handle this. Day 1 of challenge On the third day in the ward after a day of baseline and a day of phage (unless we were in the control group), we took another dose of phage (unless we were in the control group), waited a couple of hours, and then drank a glass of shigella. This tasted like baking soda and salt with no particular nuance, nor would I expect nuance; the dose was some 1300 organisms – as in 1300 individual cells of bacteria, count ‘em. A preposterously scant microbial innoculum, even for devoted parasites it often takes on the order of millions of organisms to lodge an infection – but shigella is remarkably tenacious. It would only have taken 10-200. This was overkill – a dose that WILL make you sick, unless you’re protected. All the participants drank. The waiting game Shigella has a 24-72 hour incubation period, maybe 12-96 hours on the far ends. Perhaps owing to quirks of my own psyche, whose origins I’m sure we don’t need to explore here, I find it reassuring to have reference experiences to conveniently benchmark the rest of my life by. If you go skiing, you can ask yourself later, “is this more or less exhilarating than skiing?” If you fall in love once, you can compare future loves to that earlier experience. A good standard reference point for “shared, resigned dread” is the 72 or so hours in a clinical trial ward after everyone has ingested shigella bacteria along with maybe-a-treatment. The vibes were ominous. Jovially nervous. Unprecedented gastrointestinal distress may or may not have been coming for me, but if it is, it would be arriving in (on average) 48 hours. The floor was pretty quiet. The hours ticked by. Infinite Jest is, by the way, a great book. David Foster Wallace knew how to write a goddamn sentence on purpose. Let’s learn about Shigella pathogenesis While I waited, I decided to read up. Shigella bacteria invades the body via the digestive canal, and infects the intestines – both small and large. It releases a toxin that facilitates its infection of other parts of the intestine and its eventual replication. It’s an intracellular pathogen – some bacteria, like all viruses, actually enter the host’s cell and replicate inside there. Shigella actually prefers to invade the outside (or should I say the inside?) of intestinal cells. But the body is a locked-down system with its own guard force, the immune system, keeping the dirty external environment separate from the sterile inside environment. Shigella in the digestive tract really wants to poke through that line of intestinal cells and get at them from the other side. Wikipedia explains: Once inside of the colon, S. flexneri can penetrate the epithelium in three ways: 1) The bacterium can alter the tight junctions between the epithelial cells, allowing it to cross into the sub-mucosa. 2) It can penetrate the highly endocytic M cells that are dispersed in the epithelial layer and cross into the sub-mucosa. 3) After reaching the sub-mucosa, the bacteria can be phagocytosed by macrophages and induce apoptosis, cell death. This releases cytokines that recruit polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) to the sub-mucosa. S. flexneri still in the lumen of the colon traverse the epithelial lining as the PMNs cross into the infected area. The influx of PMN cells across the epithelial layer in response to Shigella disrupts the integrity of the epithelium allowing lumenal bacteria to cross into the sub-mucosa in an M-cell independent mechanism. This is really funny. Okay, imagine there’s a blockade of tightly parked police cars facing you and you and your buddies need to go get to their trunks so you can hide in them. Here are 3 ways to do this: Push the police cars to the side so you can walk between them Look for the police cars with the biggest doors, so that you can squeeze through the car and leave through their trunk (or I guess probably just stay in the trunk at that point) Get yourself and your buddies arrested, then when they send backup police vans to push through the police to arrest all of you, run through the cracks in the blockade that those vans open up. Then go to the trunks of the original cop cars. And then once you’re inside the car, you can open the doors between the cop cars (they’re sliding doors) and then travel laterally between the cop cars. I love cells. As a fun side note, Shigella – including the strain I was developing an intimate relationship with, Shigella flexneri – is, taxonomically speaking, a kind of Escherichia coli. Now you may notice from the scientific nomenclature that this is not how this is supposed to work. When genotyping was developed and applied to some familiar standby kinds of bacteria that microbiology-as-science figured it understood pretty well, researchers learned two surprising new things: E. coli is not a coherent species. Different strains of E. coli – known to have slightly different properties, but thought to be all slight variations on the same basic species – turned out to have only 20% of their genes in common. (Humans and our closest relatives, chimpanzees, have almost all of our genes in common* and still aren’t considered as the same genus.) Shigella is in that umbrella of shared genes – a secret family member known as a taxon in disguise. It’s more similar to many E. colis than some E. colis. For most species, the procedure at this point would be to throw in the towel and reclassify – Escherichia coli spp. shigella, perhaps. But in this case, shigatoxin-producing Shigella and other pathogenic Escherichia coli have different enough clinical presentations that the distinction is still medically valuable, so accurate nomenclature has bowed its head to practicality. Cool! (Compare and contrast with trees.) *Wait, don’t people talk about 99% or something? That number is actually about sequence similarity and not related genes – if we have 96% sequence similarity, meaning the exact same genetic code, probably even more of that genome is still in related genes. Genes can code for clearly related proteins/sequences and still not be identical, like they came from a common ancestor and haven’t diverged much but have picked up a few changes along the way. Different E. coli have 80% completely different genes – a human has maaaybe 50 genes that a chimp doesn’t? I didn’t try very hard to find the actual similar metric between them. It’s what I was telling you about numbers. You gotta watch out. Let’s really learn about Shigella pathogenesis Some 24 hours in, the first people started going down. Via word of mouth I heard the phrase “Exorcist-style projectile vomiting” used to describe someone in the next room over, a description whose accuracy I fortunately cannot verify. Most people were in their rooms all day anyhow, but the crowd in the kitchen at mealtimes or showing up for morning dosing got thinner. I really held out. Going to bed at end of the second night, I felt okay, but couldn’t sleep well – nerves, I thought, or the faint distorted unpleasant bodily noises from other parts of the ward. I maybe managed a couple hours of sleep by the wee hours. 48 hours in, I woke up for vitals and dosing at 6 AM and started feeling really faint on the short walk to the next room. I stumbled over to the toilet. Off to the races! I should be clear in this section that I was in as close to zero long-term danger as you can get with dysentery, which is damn close – this was in a controlled setting with doctors and nurses, monitoring my condition regularly, with a known pathogen with a known cure. In this case, we weren’t expected to languish in indefinite misery – they wanted to see if we got sick and then how sick we got, yes, but only up to a point, at which point they would “call it” – administer regular antibiotics and end our experimental treatment. All I had to do was let the time pass. The next few hours were very bad. Surprisingly, the gastrointestinal symptoms were not much of a problem for me – I had them, but it wasn’t much worse than those of regular food poisoning. I didn’t throw up. I just wanted to go back to sleep. But sleep wasn’t coming. First was the plague of chills. The institutional cotton blankets did nothing; four of them also did nothing, as if there was no heat to hold in. Freezing, tooth-clattering cold. Within an hour came the plague of joint pain. It sank in rather quickly and was all in the lower extremities – hips, legs. Any more than one blanket became too heavy to bear having on them, so off they go, freezing cold but they weren’t palpably doing anything anyway. Right? I remembered reading people with chronic pain reporting that sometimes laying down was worse than other positions, and sure enough sitting up was – somehow – mildly better. I situated the adjustable bedside table so that I could slump onto it and maybe even sleep like that, but sleep remained out of reach. Time wasn’t shitting so much as dragging, by the bones, over rough pavement, every second another six inches, grating, relentless, second after second after second. Time is space in which you are moved forward one way or another. Pain is an active process. Around three hours later, the doctor came in and judged that I was done – they were calling it – symptomatically I had reached the Clinical Endpoint and would be treated. I was handed tylenol and antibiotics. I’d always thought of tylenol as sort of a second-rate painkiller, probably worth trying if you couldn’t find ibuprofen, but damn if that tylenol didn’t work pretty quickly. As soon as I could I went to sleep for like four hours – which, as usual, if you are in a position of needing four hours of sleep, makes a lot of things better and more manageable once you can swing it. Out the other side The antibiotics worked really quickly. Within hours, the fever had vanished and the aches had dwindled to twinges. Within a couple days, even the gastrointestinal situation was back to normal. Other people were harder hit, other people were just starting to get sick – staying vanished in their rooms even after I stuck my head into the kitchen and rec rooms like the first hopeful groundhog of spring – and many had been fine the whole time. The thing that kills people in dysentery is dehydration and complications thereof. So part of the recovery is collecting and measuring how many fluids were emitted, and then re-administering oral rehydration fluid – a salty liquid served ice-cold – in precise ratios to replace the bodily fluids lost. A human is a series of tubes with attached nervous system and fortunately I was in the company of master plumbers. Once the diarrhea had stopped, I was also able to stop guzzling big plastic cups of what I liked to imagine tasted like arctic seawater. Progress! Great view from the rec room. People who recovered and who never got sick started hanging out in the rec room more, chatting and playing pool. I spent my birthday calling my parents and talking to internet friends. One streamed himself playing a fish-themed video game in my honor. The Baltimoreans inexplicably set off fireworks many nights – maybe the proximity to July 4th? – and this was one of them. Not roadside-stand-ground fireworks, but big aerial fireworks. A fellow subject found ice cream bars in the kitchen freezer and kindly brought me one as a present. Fireworks aside, it was a quiet day. Apologies for the deception, reader. Technically speaking, the word “dysentery” usually refers to a syndrome, like “psychosis” or “high blood pressure”, which can have multiple causes but which is defined by specific symptoms. The specific symptom of dysentery is bloody diarrhea. I personally did not get this particular symptom – I became sick with shigellosis but, according to a common criteria, did not get dysentery. I’m sorry for clickbaiting you. In my defense, I would have taken it over the joint pain. Aftermath Twice a day after antibiotics, we gave the nurses a stool sample – these were sampled and cultured at some lab to determine if shigella was still in there. Two negative samples in a row meant that we were free to go. 9 days after coming in, I was cleared for release. I collected my scissors, and, free of dysentery, was released onto the streets of Baltimore. A year older on paper. Healthy, wrung out, ready for time to keep doing what it does. Hopefully, mostly on kinder terms. The train ride home. I see that 75% of these photos have coffee in them. What can I say? I’m from Seattle. I think that despite my relatively mild case, that I was in the control group. But the reason I think that was because in the whole trial, everyone drank the shigella, it sure seemed like about half of them didn’t get sick. Pretty goddamn cool, if you ask me.

While I agree its cool to see progress. If I get sick in the US and need medical attention, just fly me back to Europe. Id rather not go bankrupt. reply renewiltord 4 hours agorootparentI’d go to somewhere like India that has medical tourism. Any procedure that you can wait long enough to fly to Europe will have a long waitlist there. Besides I was completely blown up in the US on my motorcycle with fractures all over and in the ICU for days and I paid a grand total of $2k. I think it was pretty cool honestly. There was some therapy afterwards that cost a little more but overall I’m back to normal except for a few thousand. Since I make hundreds of thousands more this feels like a good deal. reply GJim 3 hours agorootparent> in the ICU for days and I paid a grand total of $2k My wife paid a grand total of £0 The very _idea_ we would need to pay money for such medical treatment is bizarre. reply akhosravian 3 hours agorootparentThe idea that it costs nothing somehow is bizarre. If you divide the NHS budget for 2024 (192 billion) by the UK population (67 million) you’ll find it works out to just under 3000 pounds per person just for 2024. Assuming your wife’s visit was this year your family paid about 3x what the poster you are responding to did. I’m also working from the assumption most posters here are in high tax brackets; I understand tech jobs in Europe pay much worse than the US so that may not be true. reply ghaff 3 hours agorootparentAnd people I know in the uk, at least those working for large US companies, also have private insurance in addition to NHS. Probably not a bad idea to get travel insurance if vacationing in the US. The other way around you may want some sort of additional insurance if traveling from the US to Europe. reply cnewey 2 hours agorootparentprevI think you're glossing over a few details here which - although understandable - deserve a little clarification. The poster is referring to cost at the point of care - which under the UK's NHS model is £0. The \"£3000\" per year should really be viewed as the cost of an insurance policy (in fact, NHS funding comes from a progressive tax called National Insurance - at least in theory). This \"£3,000\" on average then compares to the average cost per person of a health insurance policy in the US of around $7,700 [0] - plus of course in the USA you generally have point-of-care costs too. Additionally tax by its nature in the UK is progressive and the income distribution is fairly heavy-tailed, so it's not really a cost of \"just under £3,000pp\" - the average citizen pays far less than that, and even most high earners will pay less. For example someone on £100,000 (top 1-2% of salaries in UK) will pay just over £4,000 in NI [1] - but NI funds more than just the NHS and also funds social care and state benefits. Of course in the UK some people choose to supplement NHS care with some form of private insurance - either paid for privately (uncommon) or provided as an in-kind benefit through an employer (still not ubiquitous but recently more common). Private care is typically used for things like skipping waiting lists for certain treatments or access to alternative care not offered by the NHS. These private policies tend to have a lot less coverage than the NHS, so I would say aren't directly comparable to the NHS - nor are they generally totally adequate as standalone insurance policy so aren't comparable to an insurance policy in the US either. The model is just very different in the UK and the US, and it's hard to compare them directly. However, what is inarguable is that the NHS provides very good value for money, especially when compared with other G7 nations [2] - on average less than half of the expenditure per capita of the US.

But she and you and your countrypersons paid for it, nonetheless. It's interesting to me that you think about it as free. reply renewiltord 2 hours agorootparentprevYeah, that's what I mean. I would gladly pay $2k in an emergency to make the hundreds of thousands of dollars more every year. That's a trade I consider reasonable. To save $2k in an emergency I'm not eager to be making £200k. reply cheschire 8 hours agorootparentprevSure you might not have the financial burden but actually getting attention is not as straightforward as I infer from your wording. Wait times in much of Europe are kind of ridiculous. One isn’t better than the other. There are trade offs. Your preference appears to be financial. reply bilekas 6 hours agorootparent> Wait times in much of Europe are kind of ridiculous. It's prioritized as per need, for example elective/preventative operations or procedures will be delayed if there is a new higher level emergency, this makes practical sense given the nature of healthcare and I have never had a problem with that. It's slightly off topic though, my comment was off the cuff but it's a reality. > Your preference appears to be financial.

We do a lot of the (very expensive) drug discovery and testing. reply atrus 3 hours agorootparentAnd that means those same drugs, from those same companies are now cheaper outside of the US? That makes zero sense. That's like Amazon charging their employees 100x to use AWS vs outside people. They charge more in the US because they can, because of people who gleefully accept it and defend it by saying \"we do a lot of expensive drug discovery and testing\" reply cloverich 3 hours agorootparentIn some cases. But the point is other countries enforce lower prices, and they make up the margins in the US. On the one hand it is obscene but on the other we do see a pretty regular supply of miraculous new drugs. Something clearly needs done but the system does make sense (whether or not its optimal). reply echelon 3 hours agorootparentprev> And that means those same drugs, from those same companies are now cheaper outside of the US? Drug development essentially results in the creation of very expensive intellectual property. A wide variety of drugs are easy and cheap to manufacture [1]. The cost to develop a drug can range from $314 million to $2.8 billion [2]. Fewer than 8% of drugs make it through the development and trial process [3]. It's super expensive and risky. Other countries do not have to respect US drug IP and can produce these drugs for near zero cost. They benefit from the expensive drug discovery and vetting that the US pharmaceutical industry perform and the US FDA requires, but they don't have to pay for any of it. When countries do pay for US drug IP, they do a lot of strong arm bargaining. If this happened in the US, many of the drugs, especially for rarer illnesses, wouldn't be developed in the first place. [1] Gene therapies, monoclonal antibodies, viral vectors, and other types of treatments not so much.

Where are the costs, and what would it take to break tyem down? For example if the costs are in screening molecular candidates, that could be done in a lab on a computer in India or Vietnam just as easily as in New Jersey. If its clinical trials, Europe is cheap and Asia cheaper still, both with high quality medical staff. Etc. Any commenters understand where the major costs are? reply blahedo 5 hours agorootparentprevWait times in the US are also ridiculous. A couple years ago I tried to make a doctor's appt, at the clinic where I was regularly a patient, and had decent insurance, but it was for check-up stuff and to ask some questions. I called in July; the first available appointment was December. On the other hand, when I've gone to that clinic with urgent issues, they see me the same day. I gather it is much the same in systems with decent healthcare systems; just much, much, much less likely to bankrupt you just for being sick. reply alyandon 3 hours agorootparentI'm seeing this trend as well. It is getting to the point that I can not see my primary doctor without a 2-3 month lead time and specialist referrals are often 2-3 months as well. Hell, I recently had to find a new dentist because the one I had been going to for years suddenly had 4-6 month lead time if I needed to reschedule a routine cleaning. reply redwall_hp 3 hours agorootparentprevIt takes like two years to get in with a rheumatologist, or get a psychiatric evaluation where I am in the US, and other, less in-demand specialists are easily 6-9 months from your initial referral from your primary physician. I think it took about ten for my first dermatology appointment. ER visits are an all night endeavor. reply tetha 2 hours agorootparentprevI've been through this with a broken finger joint. I don't know if I'm a smooth talker or she remembered me as non-problematic, but the MFA at the clinic quite frankly told me: Don't try to go there without an urgent emergency, and ideally a document from a doctor confirming that it's an urgent emergency. If I wanted an appointment without confirmed urgency, I could have one in January - and it might be postponed for urgent cases. That's how booked they are. On the other hand, if my surgeon raises the correct alarm bells, I could also be in surgery next week. It's a roller coaster. Even though this does make sense if you think about it as a tiered support system. If my finger joints don't come back up, my general practitioner can see that, poke at the fingers a bit and decide if guided physio makes sense - no need for more expertise. If there are subtle breaks in the joint requiring attention - more expertise is needed. reply wishinghand 4 hours agorootparentprevWait times in the USA suck. I just moved to a west coast city, need to set up new doctors. Soonest I could get for an endocrinologist is February, and I made the appointment a month ago. reply virgildotcodes 4 hours agorootparentprevI was acutely ill on vacation in the UK and went to the hospital, got seen within an hour, no bill. I’ve waited far longer in US hospitals and paid hundreds of dollars AFTER insurance. reply croes 5 hours agorootparentprevWait times are much shorter if you cut off many people because they can’t afford the treatment. reply Waterluvian 7 hours agorootparentprevI dunno if it’s really so simplistic. I hear the wait time complaint about Canada a lot but it’s partly because we care for everyone, so sometimes you’ve got to wait if you’re not in real trouble. Especially with emergency care it’s quite fast. Back in August my son fell off the monkey bars and his elbow exploded. Ambulance in 7 mins. Hospital triage in 5 mins. Doctor 5 mins after. X-ray took 5 mins. Waited 7 mins. Diagnosis and sent to Children’s hospital one town over. More x-rays, surgery prep, surgery with two paediatric orthopaedic surgeons, four steel pins inserted, post-op, sleep, and he was home by 7am. Three more checkups with the main surgeon followed over the months. Cost us $8 in parking. Never even saw a bill. I would never, ever, trade this for the American approach. I need to know that every kid on that playground gets this exact same level of care. reply cheschire 7 hours agorootparentSince you have a specific anecdote as an argument, could you expand on your “American approach” concept and how it applies to your situation? I don’t mean talk in vague assertions about how you have read some other specific yet unrelated anecdotes about childbirth costing $125,000 or something. I mean how much would your son’s specific situation cost you in a comparable area of America for a family of comparable income? The reason I ask is because the general approach should not be argued against with anecdotes. You commonly hear of wait time issues in universal healthcare countries. You commonly hear about cost of care issues in America. Generally speaking there is an obvious trade off. And just like wait times and cost are preferences, your preference is equal care for children. In America that does not happen. That is part of the trade off. I am not implying that all things are equal. I am unhappy with the health insurance cartels that drive up cost in America making the lower middle class suffer. I am unhappy with the inconsistent care availability from region to region across the country. But I also resist the implication that American healthcare always bankrupts a person and that free / low cost care is a simple decision. reply throwway120385 4 hours agorootparentI can speak to even routine things like a childbirth still costing thousands of dollars with \"good\" insurance with a \"low\" out of pocket maximum and 100% coverage after the deductible. It still cost 3 or 4 thousand dollars. So it's not necessarily those six figure costs that are tough to deal with but even routine hospital care that gets very expensive in the US. I'm fortunate that we can afford that cost. But for a lot of people even making the payments on that would be a hardship. We didn't even know it would cost that much even though we had called our insurance to try to figure it out. Nobody can tell you how much it will cost until you incur the cost which is absurd. And the hospital \"price lists\" are beyond useless. It shouldn't cost anything to birth a child in a hospital setting like a birth center in any civilized country, and we shouldn't have to deal with billing issues and insurance companies in the insane first 12 weeks of a child's life when we're sleep deprived and just dealing with actual medical issues and adjustment. We've spent collectively hours on the phone with insurance for this and various other charges. The \"private payer\" \"employer provided\" system constantly produces bad experiences and outcomes for everyone. Every insurance provider I've had over the past 5 years is a company that constantly screws up and that I can't fire, unlike my car insurance. The American healthcare system doesn't bankrupt us right away, but it does so slowly by bleeding us for costs we shouldn't have to pay and by robbing us of time right when we need it most. reply mercutio2 3 hours agorootparentMy daughter was premature and spent weeks in the NICU. My family paid exactly $0 for this experience, with good US insurance. People paying thousands of dollars with insurance have chosen to purchase cheaper insurance premiums, and then bear higher costs when there’s an expensive event. This is a fine choice to make. It does not mean the US healthcare system is especially expensive for middle class people. Like many parts of the US economic system, the US healthcare system isn’t very good for poor people. But don’t go thinking it performs poorly for the upper half of the income distribution. reply foldr 4 hours agorootparentprev> I mean how much would your son’s specific situation cost you in a comparable area of America for a family of comparable income? That's the fun thing about the US system. The only way to find out how much it costs is to wait for the bill. So while your question is a fair one, logically speaking, it's unanswerable in practice. reply foobarian 4 hours agorootparentI wouldn't go that far. But it is true that there are far many more possible outcomes because of how diverse the private insurance system is. At the very least one guaranteed difference is that you would NOT not get a bill. Then, a common scenario is a health insurance setup that covers 100% of the cost beyond a threshold, while the individual is responsible for the cost below that threshold. My threshold is $6k for example. In the above scenario with the elbow, I estimate that the total cost would be around $100-200k. So I would end up paying the full $6k, and the insurance would take care of the rest. The other common scenario is one where the threshold is much lower (e.g. $200) but the insurance covers e.g. 90% of the total cost. I find that option more risky, because I know the total costs can be staggeringly high, and 10% of a staggering number is usually also a staggering number :-) reply foldr 3 hours agorootparentYou might know that you won't have to pay more than $X, but you generally can't find out beforehand the theoretical cost of the procedure as billed to the insurer. So if you're on the hook for any fraction of that (as in your second scenario) then you're very much in unknown territory. There is also the question of how well you really understand the terms of your insurance policy, which can be extremely complex. reply foobarian 2 hours agorootparent> which can be extremely complex. What gets me about the insurance billing is that besides being complex for me, it is also complex for the insurance company - people on the other side are just people, after all, not some infallible super-intelligent aliens. And the failures that come out of that are kind of hard to believe for people used to nationalized health care; my favorite example was a $15k bill I received months after a surgery that I called back to get more details, upon which the agent said something like \"oh that's coded wrong\" and after a few keyboard taps I owed $500. What if I had paid the original amount without asking? How many people do not ask? And the cynical question, how often do the \"coding errors\" happen the other way? reply Waterluvian 5 hours agorootparentprevI made the mistake of touching on a complicated, important, and oft-contentious topic just before starting my work day. Not ghosting you, but I'll do my best to get back to this when I have the time required to offer a worthwhile response. reply cheschire 3 hours agorootparentSame. I appreciate the reply but apparently this beehive isn’t worth kicking here. Seems like folks don’t know how to avoid the downvote button on emotional topics. I would love to have a deeper conversation about it but HN probably isn’t the place where I will find intellectual satisfaction on this topic. reply raverbashing 3 hours agorootparentprevWaiting times are a big \"it depends\" in Europe.

The daily goal tracker she developed is really neat, and I would love to own. The profit margin on it must be insane though at the price. https://yetch-shop.fourthwall.com/en-nzd/products/every-day-... reply francislavoie 17 hours agoparentActually, she spoke about that recently in a video, she's still at a loss on that product, mentioned here https://youtu.be/iEAShZ8TJCs?t=269 reply leros 18 hours agoparentprevI dunno about that profit margin. Don't underestimate how expensive developing products is as low scale. It would not surprise me if the margin is pretty normal. reply KMnO4 18 hours agorootparentSimone actually has a pretty good video that covers her costs to run the product business. TL;DW, not very much profit, especially at the beginning/low volumes. https://youtube.com/watch?v=iEAShZ8TJCs reply xmprt 14 hours agorootparentIt actually sounded like she was running it at a loss. Or rather that if there was any profit, it was because she was taking pretty much no salary out of the company. I really hope it succeeds but I think this is one case where someone with good marketing and sales skills could help her out a lot while she's able to focus on product. reply JohnFen 2 hours agoparentprevIt's just good business. It's never a great idea to have only one source of income (especially one as inherently risky as YouTube). That's a serious vulnerability. Ideally, you not only have multiple sources but you choose the sources so that they have different economic dependencies. That way, conditions that adversely impact one of them don't adversely impact the others -- or, even better, so that conditions that adversely impacts one positively impacts another. reply pryelluw 18 hours agoparentprevI have a software version of this that was built for my own purposes.

I do hope it works for others. Sometimes we do need custom tools even for the most basic needs. Mine is built to track not only that I did it but it allows me to comment on it. I can then go back and read through different entries. It’s super useful. One of the use cases is tracking medications. I then share the notes with my GP (they appreciate things being timestamped). Btw, love your website! I use it for multiple things like writing. I will just create an entry to track it and then just write away. I also track when I work on my projects. One button click and it records the time when I start working on my car for example.

Sure, if a founder would appreciate and use the item that they make, that's really a good indicator, but it's not your personal plaything, it's a profit-making business, so the primary objective should be making useful things that people will purchase, regardless of the tastes of the founders/employees, yes? That being said, I've enjoyed Simone's wit and creativity for several years.

Therefore, I had always supposed that her employment would have involved health insurance. If she had gone back to Sweden to do it, the surgery would have been free but she would first have had to reestablish herself in Sweden and then struggled with waiting time for her first doctor's appointment and possibly multiple referrals before she would have been put on a waiting list for surgery ... during which time her condition could have worsened.

    "originLink": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/10/the-global-surveillance-free-for-all-in-mobile-ad-data/",
    "originBody": "October 23, 2024 20 Comments Not long ago, the ability to digitally track someone’s daily movements just by knowing their home address, employer, or place of worship was considered a dangerous power that should remain only within the purview of nation states. But a new lawsuit in a likely constitutional battle over a New Jersey privacy law shows that anyone can now access this capability, thanks to a proliferation of commercial services that hoover up the digital exhaust emitted by widely-used mobile apps and websites. Image: Shutterstock, Arthimides. Delaware-based Atlas Data Privacy Corp. helps its users remove their personal information from the clutches of consumer data brokers, and from people-search services online. Backed by millions of dollars in litigation financing, Atlas so far this year has sued 151 consumer data brokers on behalf of a class that includes more than 20,000 New Jersey law enforcement officers who are signed up for Atlas services. Atlas alleges all of these data brokers have ignored repeated warnings that they are violating Daniel’s Law, a New Jersey statute allowing law enforcement, government personnel, judges and their families to have their information completely removed from commercial data brokers. Daniel’s Law was passed in 2020 after the death of 20-year-old Daniel Anderl, who was killed in a violent attack targeting a federal judge — his mother. Last week, Atlas invoked Daniel’s Law in a lawsuit (PDF) against Babel Street, a little-known technology company incorporated in Reston, Va. Babel Street’s core product allows customers to draw a digital polygon around nearly any location on a map of the world, and view a slightly dated (by a few days) time-lapse history of the mobile devices seen coming in and out of the specified area. Babel Street’s LocateX platform also allows customers to track individual mobile users by their Mobile Advertising ID or MAID, a unique, alphanumeric identifier built into all Google Android and Apple mobile devices. Babel Street can offer this tracking capability by consuming location data and other identifying information that is collected by many websites and broadcast to dozens and sometimes hundreds of ad networks that may wish to bid on showing their ad to a particular user. This image, taken from a video recording Atlas made of its private investigator using Babel Street to show all of the unique mobile IDs seen over time at a mosque in Dearborn, Michigan. Each red dot represents one mobile device. In an interview, Atlas said a private investigator they hired was offered a free trial of Babel Street, which the investigator was able to use to determine the home address and daily movements of mobile devices belonging to multiple New Jersey police officers whose families have already faced significant harassment and death threats. Atlas said the investigator encountered Babel Street while testing hundreds of data broker tools and services to see if personal information on its users was being sold. They soon discovered Babel Street also bundles people-search services with its platform, to make it easier for customers to zero in on a specific device. The investigator contacted Babel Street about possibly buying home addresses in certain areas of New Jersey. After listening to a sales pitch for Babel Street and expressing interest, the investigator was told Babel Street only offers their service to the government or to “contractors of the government.” “The investigator (truthfully) mentioned that he was contemplating some government contract work in the future and was told by the Babel Street salesperson that ‘that’s good enough’ and that ‘they don’t actually check,’” Atlas shared in an email with reporters. KrebsOnSecurity was one of five media outlets invited to review screen recordings that Atlas made while its investigator used a two-week trial version of Babel Street’s LocateX service. References and links to reporting by other publications, including 404 Media, Haaretz, NOTUS, and The New York Times, will appear throughout this story. Collectively, these stories expose how the broad availability of mobile advertising data has created a market in which virtually anyone can build a sophisticated spying apparatus capable of tracking the daily movements of hundreds of millions of people globally. The findings outlined in Atlas’s lawsuit against Babel Street also illustrate how mobile location data is set to massively complicate several hot-button issues, from the tracking of suspected illegal immigrants or women seeking abortions, to harassing public servants who are already in the crosshairs over baseless conspiracy theories and increasingly hostile political rhetoric against government employees. WARRANTLESS SURVEILLANCE Atlas says the Babel Street trial period allowed its investigator to find information about visitors to high-risk targets such as mosques, synagogues, courtrooms and abortion clinics. In one video, an Atlas investigator showed how they isolated mobile devices seen in a New Jersey courtroom parking lot that was reserved for jurors, and then tracked one likely juror’s phone to their home address over several days. While the Atlas investigator had access to its trial account at Babel Street, they were able to successfully track devices belonging to several plaintiffs named or referenced in the lawsuit. They did so by drawing a digital polygon around the home address or workplace of each person in Babel Street’s platform, which focused exclusively on the devices that passed through those addresses each day. Each red dot in this Babel Street map represents a unique mobile device that has been seen since April 2022 at a Jewish synagogue in Los Angeles, Calif. Image: Atlas Data Privacy Corp. One unique feature of Babel Street is the ability to toggle a “night” mode, which makes it relatively easy to determine within a few meters where a target typically lays their head each night (because their phone is usually not far away). Atlas plaintiffs Scott and Justyna Maloney are both veteran officers with the Rahway, NJ police department who live together with their two young children. In April 2023, Scott and Justyna became the target of intense harassment and death threats after Officer Justyna responded to a routine call about a man filming people outside of the Motor Vehicle Commission in Rahway. The man filming the Motor Vehicle Commission that day is a social media personality who often solicits police contact and then records himself arguing about constitutional rights with the responding officers. Officer Justyna’s interaction with the man was entirely peaceful, and the episode appeared to end without incident. But after a selectively edited video of that encounter went viral, their home address and unpublished phone numbers were posted online. When their tormentors figured out that Scott was also a cop (a sergeant), the couple began receiving dozens of threatening text messages, including specific death threats. According to the Atlas lawsuit, one of the messages to Mr. Maloney demanded money, and warned that his family would “pay in blood” if he didn’t comply. Sgt. Maloney said he then received a video in which a masked individual pointed a rifle at the camera and told him that his family was “going to get [their] heads cut off.” Maloney said a few weeks later, one of their neighbors saw two suspicious individuals in ski masks parked one block away from the home and alerted police. Atlas’s complaint says video surveillance from neighboring homes shows the masked individuals circling the Maloney’s home. The responding officers arrested two men, who were armed, for unlawful possession of a firearm. According to Google Maps, Babel Street shares a corporate address with Google and the consumer credit reporting bureau TransUnion. Atlas said their investigator was not able to conclusively find Scott Maloney’s iPhone in the Babel Street platform, but they did find Justyna’s. Babel Street had nearly 100,000 hits for her phone over several months, allowing Atlas to piece together an intimate picture of Justyna’s daily movements and meetings with others. An Atlas investigator visited the Maloneys and inspected Justyna’s iPhone, and determined the only app that used her device’s location data was from the department store Macy’s. In a written response to questions, Macy’s said its app includes an opt-in feature for geo-location, “which allows customers to receive an enhanced shopping experience based on their location.” “We do not store any customer location information,” Macy’s wrote. “We share geo-location data with a limited number of partners who help us deliver this enhanced app experience. Furthermore, we have no connection with Babel Street” [link added for context]. Justyna’s experience highlights a stark reality about the broad availability of mobile location data: Even if the person you’re looking for isn’t directly identifiable in platforms like Babel Street, it is likely that at least some of that person’s family members are. In other words, it’s often trivial to infer the location of one device by successfully locating another. The terms of service for Babel Street’s Locate X service state that the product “may not be used as the basis for any legal process in any country, including as the basis for a warrant, subpoena, or any other legal or administrative action.” But Scott Maloney said he’s convinced by their experience that not even law enforcement agencies should have access to this capability without a warrant. “As a law enforcement officer, in order for me to track someone I need a judge to sign a warrant – and that’s for a criminal investigation after we’ve developed probable cause,” Mr. Maloney said in an interview. “Data brokers tracking me and my family just to sell that information for profit, without our consent, and even after we’ve explicitly asked them not to is deeply disturbing.” Mr. Maloney’s law enforcement colleagues in other states may see things differently. In August, The Texas Observer reported that state police plan to spend more than $5 million on a contract for a controversial surveillance tool called Tangles from the tech firm PenLink. Tangles is an AI-based web platform that scrapes information from the open, deep and dark web, and it has a premier feature called WebLoc that can be used to geofence mobile devices. The Associated Press reported last month that law enforcement agencies from suburban Southern California to rural North Carolina have been using an obscure cell phone tracking tool called Fog Reveal — at times without warrants — that gives them the ability to follow people’s movements going back many months. It remains unclear precisely how Babel Street is obtaining the abundance of mobile location data made available to users of its platform. The company did not respond to multiple requests for comment. But according to a document (PDF) obtained under a Freedom of Information Act request with the Department of Homeland Security’s Science and Technology directorate, Babel Street re-hosts data from the commercial phone tracking firm Venntel. On Monday, the Substack newsletter All-Source Intelligence unearthed documents indicating that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission has opened an inquiry into Venntel and its parent company Gravy Analytics. “Venntel has also been a data partner of the police surveillance contractor Fog Data Science, whose product has been described as ‘mass surveillance on a budget,'” All-Source’s Jack Poulson wrote. “Venntel was also reported to have been a primary data source of the controversial ‘Locate X’ phone tracking product of the American data fusion company Babel Street.” MAID IN HELL The Mobile Advertising ID or MAID — the unique alphanumeric identifier assigned to each mobile device — was originally envisioned as a way to distinguish individual mobile customers without relying on personally identifiable information such as phone numbers or email addresses. However, there is now a robust industry of marketing and advertising companies that specialize in assembling enormous lists of MAIDs that are “enriched” with historical and personal information about the individual behind each MAID. One of many vendors that “enrich” MAID data with other identifying information, including name, address, email address and phone number. Atlas said its investigator wanted to know whether they could find enriched MAID records on their New Jersey law enforcement customers, and soon found plenty of ad data brokers willing to sell it. Some vendors offered only a handful of data fields, such as first and last name, MAID and email address. Other brokers sold far more detailed histories along with their MAID, including each subject’s social media profiles, precise GPS coordinates, and even likely consumer category. How are advertisers and data brokers gaining access to so much information? Some sources of MAID data can be apps on your phone such as AccuWeather, GasBuddy, Grindr, and MyFitnessPal that collect your MAID and location and sell that to brokers. A user’s MAID profile and location data also is commonly shared as a consequence of simply using a smartphone to visit a web page that features ads. In the few milliseconds before those ads load, the website will send a “bid request” to various ad exchanges, where advertisers can bid on the chance to place their ad in front of users who match the consumer profiles they’re seeking. A great deal of data can be included in a bid request, including the user’s precise location (the current open standard for bid requests is detailed here). The trouble is that virtually anyone can access the “bidstream” data flowing through these so-called “realtime bidding” networks, because the information is simultaneously broadcast in the clear to hundreds of entities around the world. The result is that there are a number of marketing companies that now enrich and broker access to this mobile location information. Earlier this year, the German news outlet netzpolitik.org purchased a bidstream data set containing more than 3.6 billion data points, and shared the information with the German daily BR24. They concluded that the data they obtained (through a free trial, no less) made it possible to establish movement profiles — some of them quite precise — of several million people across Germany. A screenshot from the BR24/Netzpolitik story about their ability to track millions of Germans, including many employees of the German Federal Police and Interior Ministry. Politico recently covered startling research from universities in New Hampshire, Kentucky and St. Louis that showed how the mobile advertising data they acquired allowed them to link visits from investigators with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to insiders selling stock before the investigations became public knowledge. The researchers in that study said they didn’t attempt to use the same methods to track regulators from other agencies, but that virtually anyone could do it. Justin Sherman, a distinguished fellow at Georgetown Law’s Center for Privacy and Technology, called the research a “shocking demonstration of what happens when companies can freely harvest Americans’ geolocation data and sell it for their chosen price.” “Politicians should understand how they, their staff, and public servants are threatened by the sale of personal data—and constituent groups should realize that talk of data broker ‘controls’ or ‘best practices” is designed by companies to distract from the underlying problems and the comprehensive privacy and security solutions,” Sherman wrote for Lawfare this week. A BIDSTREAM DRAGNET? The Orwellian nature of modern mobile advertising networks may soon have far-reaching implications for women’s reproductive rights, as more states move to outlaw abortion within their borders. The 2022 Dobbs decision by the U.S. Supreme Court discarded the federal right to abortion, and 14 states have since enacted strict abortion bans. Anti-abortion groups are already using mobile advertising data to advance their cause. In May 2023, The Wall Street Journal reported that an anti-abortion group in Wisconsin used precise geolocation data to direct ads to women it suspected of seeking abortions. As it stands, there is little to stop anti-abortion groups from purchasing bidstream data (or renting access to a platform like Babel Street) and using it to geofence abortion clinics, potentially revealing all mobile devices transiting through these locations. Atlas said its investigator geofenced an abortion clinic and was able to identify a likely employee at that clinic, following their daily route to and from that individual’s home address. A still shot from a video Atlas shared of its use of Babel Street to identify and track an employee traveling each day between their home and the clinic. Last year, Idaho became the first state to outlaw “abortion trafficking,” which the Idaho Capital Sun reports is defined as “recruiting, harboring or transporting a pregnant minor to get an abortion or abortion medication without parental permission.” Tennessee now has a similar law, and GOP lawmakers in five other states introduced abortion trafficking bills that failed to advance this year, the Sun reports. Atlas said its investigator used Babel Street to identify and track a person traveling from their home in Alabama — where abortion is now illegal — to an abortion clinic just over the border in Tallahassee, Fla. — and back home again within a few hours. Abortion rights advocates and providers are currently suing Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, seeking to block him from prosecuting people who help patients travel out-of-state to end pregnancies. Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a non-profit digital rights group, said she’s extremely concerned about dragnet surveillance of people crossing state lines in order to get abortions. “Specifically, Republican officials from states that have outlawed abortion have made it clear that they are interested in targeting people who have gone to neighboring states in order to get abortions, and to make it more difficult for people who are seeking abortions to go to neighboring states,” Galperin said. “It’s not a great leap to imagine that states will do this.” APPLES AND GOOGLES Atlas found that for the right price (typically $10-50k a year), brokers can provide access to tens of billions of data points covering large swaths of the US population and the rest of the world. Based on the data sets Atlas acquired — many of which included older MAID records — they estimate they could locate roughly 80 percent of Android-based devices, and about 25 percent of Apple phones. Google refers to its MAID as the “Android Advertising ID,” (AAID) while Apple calls it the “Identifier for Advertisers” (IDFA). What accounts for the disparity between the number of Android and Apple devices that can be found in mobile advertising data? In April 2021, Apple shipped version 14.5 of its iOS operating system, which introduced a technology called App Tracking Transparency (ATT) that requires apps to get affirmative consent before they can track users by their IDFA or any other identifier. Apple’s introduction of ATT had a swift and profound impact on the advertising market: Less than a year later Facebook disclosed that the iPhone privacy feature would decrease the company’s 2022 revenues by about $10 billion. Source: cnbc.com. Google runs by far the world’s largest ad exchange, known as AdX. The U.S. Department of Justice, which has accused Google of building a monopoly over the technology that places ads on websites, estimates that Google’s ad exchange controls 47 percent of the U.S. market and 56 percent globally. Google’s Android is also the dominant mobile operating system worldwide, with more than 72 percent of the market. In the U.S., however, iPhone users claim approximately 55 percent of the market, according to TechRepublic. In response to requests for comment, Google said it does not send real time bidding requests to Babel Street, nor does it share precise location data in bid requests. The company added that its policies explicitly prohibit the sale of data from real-time bidding, or its use for any purpose other than advertising. Google said its MAIDs are randomly generated and do not contain IP addresses, GPS coordinates, or any other location data, and that its ad systems do not share anyone’s precise location data. “Android has clear controls for users to manage app access to device location, and reset or delete their advertising ID,” Google’s written statement reads. “If we learn that someone, whether an app developer, ad tech company or anyone else, is violating our policies, we take appropriate action. Beyond that, we support legislation and industry collaboration to address these types of data practices that negatively affect the entire mobile ecosystem, including all operating systems.” In a written statement shared with reporters, Apple said Location Services is not on by default in its devices. Rather, users must enable Location Services and must give permission to each app or website to use location data. Users can turn Location Services off at any time, and can change whether apps have access to location at any time. The user’s choices include precise vs. approximate location, as well as a one-time grant of location access by the app. “We believe that privacy is a fundamental human right, and build privacy protections into each of our products and services to put the user in control of their data,” an Apple spokesperson said. “We minimize personal data collection, and where possible, process data only on users’ devices.” Zach Edwards is a senior threat analyst at the cybersecurity firm SilentPush who has studied the location data industry closely. Edwards said Google and Apple can’t keep pretending like the MAIDs being broadcast into the bidstream from hundreds of millions of American devices aren’t making most people trivially trackable. “The privacy risks here will remain until Apple and Google permanently turn off their mobile advertising ID schemes and admit to the American public that this is the technology that has been supporting the global data broker ecosystem,” he said. STATES ACT, WHILE CONGRESS DITHERS According to Bloomberg Law, between 2019 and 2023, threats against federal judges have more than doubled. Amid increasingly hostile political rhetoric and conspiracy theories against government officials, a growing number of states are seeking to pass their own versions of Daniel’s Law. Last month, a retired West Virginia police officer filed a class action lawsuit against the people-search service Whitepages for listing their personal information in violation of a statute the state passed in 2021 that largely mirrors Daniel’s Law. In May 2024, Maryland passed the Judge Andrew F. Wilkinson Judicial Security Act — named after a county circuit court judge who was murdered by an individual involved in a divorce proceeding over which he was presiding. The law allows current and former members of the Maryland judiciary to request their personal information not be made available to the public. Under the Maryland law, personal information can include a home address; telephone number, email address; Social Security number or federal tax ID number; bank account or payment card number; a license plate or other unique vehicle identifier; a birth or marital record; a child’s name, school, or daycare; place of worship; place of employment for a spouse, child, or dependent. The law firm Troutman Pepper writes that “so far in 2024, 37 states have begun considering or have adopted similar privacy-based legislation designed to protect members of the judiciary and, in some states, other government officials involved in law enforcement.” Atlas alleges that in response to requests to have data on its New Jersey law enforcement clients scrubbed from consumer records sold by LexisNexis, the data broker retaliated by freezing the credit of approximately 18,500 people, and falsely reporting them as identity theft victims. In addition, Atlas said LexisNexis started returning failure codes indicating they had no record of these individuals, resulting in denials when officers attempted to refinance loans or open new bank accounts. The data broker industry has responded by having at least 70 of the Atlas lawsuits moved to federal court, and challenging the constitutionality of the New Jersey statute as overly broad and a violation of the First Amendment. Attorneys for the data broker industry argued in their motion to dismiss that there is “no First Amendment doctrine that exempts a content-based restriction from strict scrutiny just because it has some nexus with a privacy interest.” Atlas’s lawyers responded that data covered under Daniel’s Law — personal information of New Jersey law enforcement officers — is not free speech. Atlas notes that while defending against comparable lawsuits, the data broker industry has argued that home address and phone number data are not “communications.” “Data brokers should not be allowed to argue that information like addresses are not ‘communications’ in one context, only to turn around and claim that addresses are protectable communications,” Atlas argued (PDF). “Nor can their change of course alter the reality that the data at issue is not speech.” The judge overseeing the challenge is expected to rule on the motion to dismiss within the next few weeks. Regardless of the outcome, the decision is likely to be appealed all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Meanwhile, media law experts say they’re concerned that enacting Daniel’s Law in other states could limit the ability of journalists to hold public officials accountable, and allow authorities to pursue criminal charges against media outlets that publish the same type of public and government records that fuel the people-search industry. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said Congress’ failure to regulate data brokers, and the administration’s continued opposition to bipartisan legislation that would limit data sales to law enforcement, have created this current privacy crisis. “Whether location data is being used to identify and expose closeted gay Americans, or to track people as they cross state lines to seek reproductive health care, data brokers are selling Americans’ deepest secrets and exposing them to serious harm, all for a few bucks,” Wyden said in a statement shared with KrebsOnSecurity, 404 Media, Haaretz, NOTUS, and The New York Times. Sen. Wyden said Google also deserves blame for refusing to follow Apple’s lead by removing companies’ ability to track phones. “Google’s insistence on uniquely tracking Android users – and allowing ad companies to do so as well – has created the technical foundations for the surveillance economy and the abuses stemming from it,” Wyden said. Georgetown Law’s Justin Sherman said the data broker and mobile ad industries claim there are protections in place to anonymize mobile location data and restrict access to it, and that there are limits to the kinds of invasive inferences one can make from location data. The data broker industry also likes to tout the usefulness of mobile location data in fighting retail fraud, he said. “All kinds of things can be inferred from this data, including people being targeted by abusers, or people with a particular health condition or religious belief,” Sherman said. “You can track jurors, law enforcement officers visiting the homes of suspects, or military intelligence people meeting with their contacts. The notion that the sale of all this data is preventing harm and fraud is hilarious in light of all the harm it causes enabling people to better target their cyber operations, or learning about people’s extramarital affairs and extorting public officials.” WHAT CAN YOU DO? Privacy experts say disabling or deleting your device’s MAID will have no effect on how your phone operates, except that you may begin to see far less targeted ads on that device. Any Android apps with permission to use your location should appear when you navigate to the Settings app, Location, and then App Permissions. “Allowed all the time” is the most permissive setting, followed by “Allowed only while in use,” “Ask every time,” and “Not allowed.” Android users can delete their ad ID permanently, by opening the Settings app and navigating to Privacy > Ads. Tap “Delete advertising ID,” then tap it again on the next page to confirm. According to the EFF, this will prevent any app on your phone from accessing the ad ID in the future. Google’s documentation on this is here. Image: eff.org By default, Apple’s iOS requires apps to ask permission before they can access your device’s IDFA. When you install a new app, it may ask for permission to track you. When prompted to do so by an app, select the “Ask App Not to Track” option. Apple users also can set the “Allow apps to request to track” switch to the “off” position, which will block apps from asking to track you. Apple’s Privacy and Ad Tracking Settings. Apple also has its own targeted advertising system which is separate from third-party tracking enabled by the IDFA. To disable it, go to Settings, Privacy, and Apple Advertising, and ensure that the “Personalized Ads” setting is set to “off.” Finally, if you’re the type of reader who’s the default IT support person for a small group of family or friends (bless your heart), it would be a good idea to set their devices not to track them, and to disable any apps that may have location data sharing turned on 24/7. There is a dual benefit to this altruism, which is clearly in the device owner’s best interests. Because while your device may not be directly trackable via advertising data, making sure they’re opted out of said tracking also can reduce the likelihood that you are trackable simply by being physically close to those who are.

The NSA figured all this out post 9/11 when they were building data haystacks in search of terrorists. What the data haystacks do get used for is dragnet policing wherein an agency picks some crime they're gonna go hard on, pulls up a bunch of results of people who probably did it, tosses all the people who are likely to pose any risk to them (e.g. you don't see the ATF knocking on doors asking about Temu glock switches in bad parts of Detroit) and kicks in the doors of whoever's left. The data haystacks are also really useful for witch hunts when they get egg on their face and need to make someone pay, like that time they prosecuted anyone and everyone who they could construe as having done anything to help the kid who bombed the Boston Marathon, and the January 6 people of whom a great number were certainly just hapless.

People happily pay for desktop software but the decades of everything on a phone being free by default despite the economics of that making no sense have made it borderline impossible to sell software to people for their phones. At the same time government has been completely asleep at the fucking wheel with regard to any regulation to protect consumers. Consumers shouldn't have to know the \"tradeoffs\" of free software, they shouldn't need to vet vendors of software on app stores for privacy policies. People should be protected by default. This \"informed consumer\" garbage is why we can't get anything done in a regulatory sense because these companies will make the argument that users consented when talking to any layperson user of MyFitnessPal will have you understand they really did not within 5 goddamn minutes. Could people read terms of service? Yes. Do they? No, because people have shit to do and nobody aside of an activist or someone with an interest in it is going to read 110 pages of terms of service each from the 50 services they're currently using and it's unreasonable to suggest that they should, and that's JUST the reading, even if they read it, do they understand it? Because most people according to a stat I saw recently about the United States read at about a sixth grade level, which is going to be a struggle to get through any legal document. And 4% apparently are completely illiterate. I don't mean to rant here but this pisses me off so much. Our entire society is constructed around a set of assumptions about people who are at least some level of educated, with decent english literacy, who have the time and energy to dedicate to managing these various things, and yeah, if you're that theoretical person, you can probably do quite well for yourself in the United States. But what if you aren't? What if you're one of the millions who have to work three fucking jobs to survive and don't have time to read the terms of service for twitter, and just want to relax? What if you're illiterate? What if you're disabled in some way that impedes your ability to read, or your ability to understand what data harvesting is or means? Does your inability to meet the standard I've outlined above just mean you're fodder for the scummy business alliance, ready to be taken advantage of at every single turn by everyone who can, because it's more profitable that way even if it means you will be broke, exposed, and/or otherwise exploited at every single turn and probably have a pretty miserable life? I am long tired of living in a society that is clearly, bluntly, at every turn designed for companies to live and thrive in and not people.

    "originBody": "OSes 20 Huawei makes divorce from Android official with HarmonyOS NEXT launch 20 Another step toward tech independence for China – on the day Tim Cook came to town Laura Dobberstein Wed 23 Oct 2024 // 05:31 UTC Huawei formally launched its home-brewed operating system, HarmonyOS NEXT, on Wednesday, marking its official separation from the Android ecosystem. Huawei declared it released and \"officially started public beta testing\" of the OS for some of its smartphones and tablets that run its own Kirin and Kunpeng chips. Unlike previous iterations of HarmonyOS, HarmonyOS NEXT no longer supports Android apps. Huawei maintains top Chinese outfits aren't deterred by that. It cited Meituan, Douyin, Taobao, Xiaohongshu, Alipay, and JD.com as among those who have developed native apps for the OS. In case you're not familiar, they're China's top shopping, payment, and social media apps. Huawei dangles developer incentives to sell Harmony OS around the world Huawei names first tablets, phones to run its Android-in-disguise HarmonyOS 2 TSMC blows whistle on potential sanctions-busting shenanigans from Huawei China ramps up semiconductor patents amid US export restrictions Huawei also claimed that at the time of its announcement, over 15,000 HarmonyOS native applications and meta-services were also launched. That's a nice number, but well short of the millions of apps found on the Google Play Store and Apple's App Store. The Chinese tech player also revealed that the operating system has 110 million lines of code and claimed it improves the overall performance of mobile devices running it by 30 percent. It also purportedly increases battery life by 56 minutes and leaves an average of 1.5GB of memory for purposes other than running the OS. If you like the sound of that performance boost on your smartphone or tablet – the OS runs on both, with a consistent interface – we're sorry to report that Huawei told us it currently has no plans to offer Harmony OS NEXT outside of China. That's despite previously saying it planned to take an older version of HarmonyOS offshore. iLove China, says Apple Huawei's launch was on the same day that Apple CEO Tim Cook met China's minister of Industry and Information Technology, Jin Zhuanglong. A ministerial announcement claims that Cook told the minister \"Apple is willing to actively seize the opportunities of China's opening up to the outside world, continue to increase investment in China, and help the high-quality development of the industrial chain and supply chain.\" Huawei did try to export the last version of the OS – and even offered assistance to developers who coded for the platform and targeted offshore markets – without success. But it has succeeded in having offshore entities develop for the platform: Singapore-based rideshare-and-more app Grab, and the airline Emirates, have created apps for the OS. The release marks a moment in China's push for tech independence. Before the upgrade, Huawei's HarmonyOS still relied on the Android Open Source Project for core functionality – a move driven by 2019 US sanctions that blocked Huawei's access to Google Mobile Services. That dependency has now been ditched. Huawei hopes to bring its OS to PCs, too. Last month the chair of the Chinese giant's consumer business group, Yu Chengdong, revealed it would no longer run Windows on its future machines, but Harmony OS instead. When such machines will emerge, and whether other PC-makers will use the OS, are unanswered questions. ® Sponsored: Where AI meets everyday business apps Share More about Huawei Mobile Operating System More like these × More about Huawei Mobile Operating System Narrower topics Android CentOS Debian Elementary OS Firmware iOS Linux macOS Mobile Device Management OS/2 Qubes Shenzhen Ubuntu UEFI Unix Windows Windows 10 Windows 11 Windows 7 Windows 8 Windows Server Windows Server 2003 Windows Server 2008 Windows Server 2012 Windows Server 2013 Windows Server 2016 Windows XP More about Share 20 COMMENTS More about Huawei Mobile Operating System More like these × More about Huawei Mobile Operating System Narrower topics Android CentOS Debian Elementary OS Firmware iOS Linux macOS Mobile Device Management OS/2 Qubes Shenzhen Ubuntu UEFI Unix Windows Windows 10 Windows 11 Windows 7 Windows 8 Windows Server Windows Server 2003 Windows Server 2008 Windows Server 2012 Windows Server 2013 Windows Server 2016 Windows XP TIP US OFF Send us news",

It was a bit more than political pressure, though: Huawei was added to the entity list and it would be a crime for US companies or citizens to do business with them. reply addicted 2 hours agorootparentI may be misremembering but I thought Google kicked them out even before, primarily because Huawei wanted to have only Huawei services and not Google services, which goes against Google’s terms. reply MichaelZuo 6 hours agorootparentprevThat’s clearly not the case though? A lot of Huawei gear is still installed and operating, as of today, in US telecom networks. Even the pentagon is contracting with many companies using Huawei gear. reply rickdeckard 5 hours agorootparentUsage of their equipment is one thing, technology export to a blacklisted company is another. The telecom providers arguably put quite some pressure to maintain such a distinction, since they purchased and paid for said equipment. But for i.e. Google it would have been a crime to provide dedicated technology access (early-access code, Google Services, etc.) for Huawei to then integrate into their products. reply GTP 5 hours agorootparentprevI guess it is a crime from the date they were added to the list, but not a crime to keep using devices purchased earlier. reply shrubble 5 hours agorootparentprevThey’re not supposed to be running it! There were specific orders to remove Huawei from the telecom network (but yeah they were not followed) in 2019. reply llm_nerd 5 hours agorootparentIt's a pretty big operation to purge all of that legacy gear, so the government made a multi-billion dollar fund to support the removal over time, and I believe gave them until 2025 to finish the purge. And even that isn't exhaustive: They can still operate it after the deadline, they'll just be restricted from various government subsidies and programs. So the government didn't flip a switch and tell them to make it disappear. They expected it to be a staggered, eventual process. reply nashadelic 5 hours agoparentprevAnother great example of the US shooting itself in the foot. I guess if we get more competition, its better for the consumer. reply amanaplanacanal 5 hours agorootparentHow does this hurt the US? reply mainecoder 4 hours agorootparentthat's a good question, this hurts the US by enabling China to decouple itself from the US. Thus Once they make their own OS and have apps joining in their own app store, they can expand their markets and compete on OS. It may seem ridiculous now, but in 10 years it will be a serious OS and you can have all the apps in a .apk file that exist on android already working on their OS. Everytime the US introduces a restriction you are making them self sufficient(see how they are making their own Chips and own space station because of restriction on ISS) which in the long term is more sustainable for a country since they are not dependent on other countries and international order if things go really bad a self sufficient country is on top(see China is the sole manufacturing superpower by from the center of economic policy research). reply audunw 3 hours agorootparentAll these things were gonna happen anyway. Or if not these things then China would aim to dominate in some other field. You think the capital allocated to these projects would otherwise sit idle? I don’t see any problems here 1. After China made a turn toward authoritarianism with Xi, decoupling - especially on the telecom side - is a hard requirement. They are objectively a huge national security risk. 2. Competition is healthy. I don’t see any problems with having another space race or another OS competing on the international arena. 3. I’m not too worried about China threatening USA in the long run anyway. USA still attracts the best talent from all over the world, many of which end up settling there long term. (I’m not American, so saying this as an outsider). You cannot become a citizen in China, and that’s unlikely to change in an ultra-nationalist authoritarian leadership. There’s so many factors (ultra-nationalism, changing demographics, less foreign investments, capital flight, overhead of doing everything themselves) that is slowly eroding Chinas economy. reply amenhotep 3 hours agorootparentprevThis could be a ten year old post about Nordstream with a little tweaking. Autocracies will pursue their goals regardless of \"coupling\", China is not going to be influenced by whether the Google Play Store is available. reply kyleee 2 hours agorootparentIt may accelerate their decisions though. reply exe34 4 hours agorootparentprevtbh I like the idea of a multipolar world - a lot of our biggest achievements came as a result of the cold war. it also forces some redundancy into the mechanisms of running a technological world - a disaster that affects one of the two or three polities may well leave enough stuff working that civilisation doesn't need to collapse completely. a world where everything depends on everything else working correctly is a bit more fragile than I would like. reply durumu 3 hours agorootparentI think it's not clear which way that effect goes -- the Cold War was also the closest humanity has ever come to destroying itself. If all nations depend on each other, there's less nuclear conflict risk and less risk of war in general. reply exe34 3 hours agorootparentnow that we've allowed Ukraine to suffer the consequences of trusting us with their defence in exchange for their old nukes, I expect nuclear proliferation to be inevitable and thus a nuclear exchange within our lifetimes isn't off the table. the worse is ahead of us, cold war or not. reply lawgimenez 6 hours agoparentprevI own a Huawei tablet and yes there is no Play Store. The Huawei app store also will link you to several third party sketchy apk stores. reply tananaev 5 hours agoparentprevI disagree with \"there's really no reason\". The reason is so that app developers can easily recompile existing apps for their platform with some minimal changes. If their system is completely incompatible, then it's probably a much bigger effort to build apps from scratch and many companies might not do it. reply horsawlarway 4 hours agorootparentThis is my take as well. I see this as likely in the same vein as Google copying the Java APIs. The similarity is important because of the compatibility it brings. So there's very much still an incentive to care about what Android does, and what API interfaces it exposes (at least in the transitional period). Whether that will still be true a decade or two from now is a different question. reply mrweasel 5 hours agoparentprevAt this point the Play Store is probably more valuable than Android for phone makers. It doesn't matter that Huawei has a new operating system, if it has no apps, or just lack the ones people really need. Depending on the country that's going to be some mobile payment options, banking apps, social media or government ID. If even one of those are missing, people will pick another brand, something with the Play Store. reply horsawlarway 4 hours agorootparentI mean - developers for your platform have always been a huge driver (something something developers, developers, developers - Balmer). But I think it's a mistake to assume that the Play Store is equivalent to your developer footprint for a platform. Google has been fairly insidious about integrating OS level APIs with the Play Store, so that's blurred the line a bit here - but if the OS is otherwise \"Android-like\" enough that it's just a matter of choosing a different target in your build and linking to different binaries... it'll be very easy to port over the developer base that's interested. Seems like Harmony is doing exactly that, and already has a large swath of companies that are planning to support the OS - so while some of that is likely because of government influence in this case... it's not required (ex - I'm thinking of Google and the whole lawsuit with Oracle around the Java APIs) reply mrweasel 4 hours agorootparentIt doesn't matter that you have 90% of all developers supporting your platform, if the final 10% is responsible for the must have apps. Huawei had a 4% market share last year. Is that going to be enough for something like MobilePay in Scandinavia to ensure that they are present on a platform, from a company and country they don't entirely trust? Without the MobilePay app, the number of people who'd buy the phones drop to almost zero. The same happens if Danes can't use their government ID on the phones, sales drops to almost zero, because the device just lost a major feature. I don't think it matters that Huawei has a large swath of companies ready to support their OS, it has to be all of them (or at least the right ones). They might pull it off and get every one on board, but the investment has to be really small to justify the work for such a small user base. reply blackoil 3 hours agorootparentHuawei has 22% market share in China which has its own ecosystem, so apps can be converted. Even for Xiaomi and BBK it will make sense to have few China only Harmony phones to hedge against any action by US against them. Countries like Iran, Russia can be next target for obvious reasons. In SEA likes of Grab and Gojek can be financially motivated to create apps. If they get a 4-10% marketshare it will make sense for Meta to port its apps to protect its position. YouTube will be a blocker as Google has strong reason to not support any alternative platform even if it will make sense for the App. Same happened for Win Phone earlier. reply snvzz 8 hours agoprevNotably, this is a microkernel, multiserver operating system[0]. 0. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HarmonyOS_NEXT reply tribaal 5 hours agoparentHuawei is very present at EuroRust and seem to look for a lot of people to hire. I guess it makes sense, I was curious why they would want people to work on e.g. Servo since Firefox is already available on Android... now I know :) Their team there made a pretty good impression for the record, they were knowledgeable and pitched their projects quite well (several of them quite interesting). reply ChocolateGod 7 hours agoparentprevI find it interesting how Huawei was able to make a nearly brand new microkernel operating system in a short amount of time, meanwhile Google with Fuchsia... Despite it being Huawei, I am interested to see how well the OS plans out. reply scrlk 6 hours agorootparentFuchsia was a success for its developers: they created something new and shiny at Google, which would allow them to receive their promotion. HarmonyOS NEXT is probably a lot more existential for Huawei. reply pjmlp 4 hours agorootparentprevThat is a good example of how politics are much more relevant than technical achivements, and anyone that dispels technology based on failure to gather mainstream adoption is lacking the whole picture. reply RicoElectrico 2 hours agorootparentprevCertainly Fuchsia failed on the brand front with so many people misspelling it as Fuscia (: reply ChocolateGod 2 hours agorootparentIt's more of an internal name like Darwin/XNU is for Apple. They could of just made it a new version of Android. reply kyleee 2 hours agorootparentprevThat should have been obvious from the get go, no chance most people are going to spell that correctly reply rfoo 6 hours agorootparentprevHonestly, I think Fuchsia was fine, there's just no reason to deploy it yet. reply grishka 5 hours agorootparentDidn't Google deploy it to some of its smart speaker devices a while ago tho? reply pjmlp 4 hours agorootparentYes, https://9to5google.com/2024/03/01/fuchsia-16-nest-hub-whats-... However it is quite clear by now, this is the best Fuschia will ever get, and it is mostly a top level software engineer retention program. reply ChocolateGod 3 hours agorootparentIt's a shame because Fuchsia would go a long way to solve the Android update mess that's partially caused by how Linux does drivers/kernels for ARM and that Android was never made to have generic updates like desktop operating systems, much of the design stemming from the embedded world it was originally made for. reply rfoo 1 hour agorootparentTime to... (check notes)... break up Google and somehow sanction Google so they themselves can't use Android anymore and you get Fuchsia on the Pixel line. That's how you push alternative OS thesedays. reply markus_zhang 7 hours agoparentprevLooks like a whole new OS to find exploitation for. Interesting. reply shrubble 5 hours agoparentprevI wouldn’t be surprised to find out that L4 kernel was an inspiration. reply DeathArrow 8 hours agoprev>Unlike previous iterations of HarmonyOS, HarmonyOS NEXT no longer supports Android apps. That's kind of big, HarmonyOS would not be just another Android flavor anymore. > we're sorry to report that Huawei told us it currently has no plans to offer Harmony OS NEXT outside of China That's to be expected. If you live outside of China and don't know Mandarin, the apps are not usable. reply nashashmi 6 hours agoparentWhat would they offer outside China? They still don’t have access to android. reply makeitdouble 5 hours agorootparentI never remember the clear lines. I think they're bared from US distribution and PlayStore being Google is a no-go. But they're not banned in the EU nor SEA or anywhere outside the US really, and the open source part of android is also probably fair game. It feels like refocusing on the Chinese market only is a business move more than a limitation of what they can do. Perhaps Xiaomi is putting too much market pressure to make it viable to them ? reply metalman 5 hours agorootparentChinese market,russia market,ex sov market n korea,mongolia,belt and road asia africa market afganistan,vietnam any country with a strategic level engagement with china,anybody who knows that china is big,bad,nasty,hates them,but is very most happy to do business with them so us too,on our go to china phones reply grishka 5 hours agorootparentprevThey do sell quite a lot of Android phones in Russia, but those come without Google apps. They have their own app store, Huawei AppGallery, and I see that logo fairly often next to Apple app store and Google Play. reply 082349872349872 7 hours agoparentprevthanks; that explains why the en and ru variants of https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/develop/ have limited information. reply Throw83489i7 7 hours agoparentprev> If you live outside of China and don't know Mandarin Not just that, China has super apps that integrate everything from payments, food delivery, taxi, social media...

Integrating this app directly into OS as a launcher (or shell) kind of makes sense. reply numpad0 6 hours agorootparentAre you sure those everything aren't just bunch of third party janky WebViews, only relevant because of private chat app account moat? (\"third party\" and \"private\" parts are relevant, IMO, otherwise Twitter superapp-ification had happened years ago) reply Throw83489i7 5 hours agorootparentMaybe, but that is just implementation detail. My point is that 3td party apps do not make much sense in China. They are useless without support from super app reply numpad0 1 hour agorootparentThat's same everywhere. If your phone didn't support local equivalents of VISA, Google, Uber, iMessage, Amazon, ... it's just Mainland China equivalents of services and slightly different implementation of federated login/payment. People tends to assume that the set of brands they recognize is truly universal and global and others are additive, that's not the reality. There are Chinese regional apk distribution sites for Chinese phones. You don't hear about those(I don't either) because there are near zero communication bandwidth across languages on this planet. That doesn't mean they don't exist. reply 015a 4 hours agorootparentprev> China has super apps that integrate everything from payments, food delivery, taxi, social media... To single application. I mean, you're simply describing an operating system. The west builds this as an operating system. China builds it as an app. The rise of the Chinese super-apps is literally just a response to the reality that the West, especially Apple, forces everyone they work with to think inside the App box. Uber has to build an app if they want to access Apple's customers; but with the Uber app adding delivery, its also becoming a little Super. The more interesting question is why the west doesn't have super-apps similar to the east. The reality, which I hinted to, is that I think we're starting to see more of them; Uber has delivery, Spotify is adding audiobooks, Google is adding an AI assistant, I think the scope-creep of these apps should give you a clue as to why China built them first. There's certainly cultural aesthetic differences; maybe the west places greater importance on simplicity and focus. I think the bigger reason is market dynamics. The west has a relatively far more competitive market among these goods and services providers. The primary fuel funding technology companies over the past twenty years has been venture capital, which is attracted to younger, newer companies over the old established players. But, venture capital is slowing down, the marketplace is calcifying a bit among the established players, both new ones from the VC boom and old ones which survived it: And now we're starting to see these players branch out from their core competency and become more-and-more super-appy as they pursue greater growth with less fear that a startup is going to drive-by and eat their lunch. reply bitwize 3 hours agorootparentPart of the motivation for Musk's rebranding of the Great Banality Laser as X is that he wants to turn it into a sort of super-app with payments, shopping, etc. That and he just has a kooky fascination with the letter X. reply jmclnx 7 hours agorootparentprevSounds nice at first until you look to see what places these apps are also linked too in mainland China. But not that it matters in the end considering the chaos the US has where eventually everyone gets to see what we do on our cells to. It is just a matter of speed, China is probably just more efficient. reply DeathArrow 7 hours agoprev>Huawei hopes to bring its OS to PCs, too. Last month the chair of the Chinese giant's consumer business group, Yu Chengdong, revealed it would no longer run Windows on its future machines, but Harmony OS instead That is very interesting. And considering that Harmony OS is not based on Android and Linux, I would be curious to see it running on a PC. reply karmakaze 2 hours agoparentSeems similar to (though a shortcut version of) Apple sharing mobile and desktop hardware/software tech. reply csomar 7 hours agoprev> Huawei did try to export the last version of the OS – and even offered assistance to developers who coded for the platform and targeted offshore markets – without success. I wonder if they really tried or if they just suck too much. I thought about getting invested into the eco-system. The technical details of NEXT are quite interesting; however, the on-boarding is literal garbage. I still, to this day, can't sign up for a Huawei ID and I am currently located in Asia. reply markus_zhang 6 hours agoparentHuawei or other Chinese companies are not particularly good at developer support. Maybe it's cultural or large corp or both. I have heard some bad stories about Ali cloud too. They are usable, but not particularly easy to use. reply lemper 4 hours agorootparentin agreement bro. their ECS equivalent's pages are still in hanzhi making it quite a pain to use. reply MichaelZuo 7 hours agoparentprevYou can really see Huawei’s roots as a telecom vendor here. Their hardware, firmware, and core parts of the software are nearly flawless, at least compared to Apple/Google in 2024, but the moment you need something beyond the shipped product it becomes a hoop jumping exercise. And the documentation is much worse. reply csomar 6 hours agorootparentIndeed. I don't have much technical expertise in the kernel/OS space, but I wouldn't be surprised if the NEXT OS is better than Linux. On the other hand, their dev experience is akin to opening a router paper manual.

I wouldn't be surprised if it's full of shortcuts with privilege escalations or contradicting exceptions. Not because it's Huawei, but because it's a single company developing BOTH the Operating System and the hardware it is supposed to be deployed in. When it comes to meeting a production deadline of a product, the pressure to apply a quick workaround is much much higher than the pressure to follow a structured process from whatever platform-team. Source: I worked in lots of companies which at some point tried to establish various kinds of frameworks, just to be forced to break them again in order to ship on-time... reply forgotpwd16 5 hours agorootparent>it's a single company developing BOTH the Operating System and the hardware it is supposed to be deployed in That's what Apple has been doing for nearly 20 years now. reply rickdeckard 5 hours agorootparentYes, with a very limited portfolio and mainly shipping to end-users, after breaking compatibility on every major release for 20 years before that. --- If you expect that Huawei will: delay a million-device mass-production for i.e. China Mobile because the project-team needs to wait for the platform-division to implement a fix in their common core and complete the entire release-process, for the project-team to then merge their code again on-top of this new release and start retesting the impact of all the other patches, -> instead of: the project-team just patching their fork of the platform, release a new build for China Mobile immediately and take a note to \"deal with this later\" then you have not seen the reality of this industry yet. Even Huawei's existing products are a multitude of forked and re-forked codebases with changes left and right, updated/outdated libraries and ever-pending merge-tasks. I don't expect this to suddenly change now reply nar001 5 hours agorootparentprevSure but they've had time to refine theirs, and MacOS is based on MACH/XNU and OpenBSD, Huawei HarmonyOS NEXT is apparently fully new, so lots of ways things could go wrong reply GTP 4 hours agorootparentprevBut, do we somehow know that it isn't based on Linux? The fact alone that it will not run Android apps doesn't bar that. reply MichaelZuo 4 hours agorootparentFrom what I’ve heard it’s a much smaller microkernel, so it’s improbable for it to be based on Linux. reply pjmlp 4 hours agoprevThe irony of blocking technology is that when the blocked ones are big enough, eventually this isn't a problem, and it will only weaken the position of the blockers, as their influence gets reduced.

The patch performing the removal was sent (by Greg Kroah-Hartman) only to the patches@lists.linux.dev mailing list; the change was included in a char-misc drivers pull request with no particular mention. The explanation for the removal is simply \"various compliance requirements\". Given that the developers involved all appear to be of Russian origin, it is not too hard to imagine what sort of compliance is involved here. There has, however, been no public posting of the policy that required the removal of these entries. to post comments Balkanization -- full steam ahead Posted Oct 23, 2024 0:37 UTC (Wed) by yeltsin (subscriber, #171611) [Link] (11 responses) What's the deal with an international project adhering to what is obviously a decision of the US government?

The post I'm replying to is authored by \"yeltsin\". That's exactly the figure in post-Soviet russia in 1992, who declared strategic alliance with China. And the post appeals to Chinese friends... The original Yeltsin died in 2007. So this is the case of mummies' return! I'd say \"I hope our Chinese friends take note\" from the post I'm replying to can even be seen as a threat!!!

Cyberspace is _not_ an independent domain from the \"real\" world, people are made out of meat, not sci-fi beings of pure thought energy, they eat food and live in places. on earth. where every square centimeter of land is subject to some sort of rules. 2) The Chinese government are currently competitors of the US government in international influence/relations and resource extraction, but not enemies in the way the Russian government has made of many nations for the way they behave with their neighbors. Sometimes international politics is just teenage middle-school drama, with more resources, with somewhat arbitrary emotional decisions, but I don't think this is one of those cases. This is different than say a ban of Huawei telecom equipment, which is subject to the rules of the place it's members live and do business, including having lawful intercept features, that the US government isn't comfortable allowing (which just incentivized the Chinese intelligence services to compromise the US CALEA lawful intercept features of its own domestic equipment instead, lol) which is more about the competition between US intelligence and others in gathering and protecting information. 3) The hypothetical situation where the organization that any developer works for becomes a sanctioned entity by some other nation who's jurisdiction matters requires a different geopolitical alignment to make sense, either someone's host nation authorized something very bad that pissed off a number of other powerful nations, or the leadership has changed to someone who has an irrational animosity and the power to enforce it. Either way I don't think trying to anticipate such things as if you control the outcomes makes a lot of sense, where you have influence over your local government please exercise it to advise them not to do stupid self-destructive shit, but you have almost no responsibility for or control of the decisions other nations governments make, sometimes your government has influence but you as an individual have almost none.

If all nations wish to make rules on its cyber network, there will be no more open Internet. 2) I don't think it is that different. It's just typical US exercising its power. US has banned NASAs' engagement in any bilateral activities with China or Chinese-owned companies for some time. This ban is not that different from the ban enforced on Russia developers on linux. Such ban will alert all countries to be more careful towards the risks in open source software. 3) We all have almost zero power. Maybe it marks the beginning of the end of open source communities.

One is left to wonder, \"Why not go all the way and remove the drivers too?\" No one will mistake me for an attorney, but it's hard to see why sanctions on individuals would motivate this step. Assuredly the removed maintainers are SW engineers, not arms traders or military personnel. Perhaps their employers are sanctioned. Chinese developers make major contributions to so many subsystems on such a regular basis that removing any number of them would cripple the kernel. It has only been a year or two since I thought, \"My employer should try to hire the author of new feature X\", only to figure out that she/he worked for Huawei in PRC. projects are left without maintainers Posted Oct 23, 2024 4:52 UTC (Wed) by Cyberax (✭ supporter ✭, #52523) [Link] (12 responses) It's indeed not the nationality, but the employers that are sanctioned.

Additionally, the US reserves the right to fine foreign entities that enable covered people to break US sanctions, and to prohibit them from trading with anyone in the USA until the fine is paid; so a Swedish bank that breaches sanctions can't then transfer money to, from, or through a US correspondent bank. People required to comply Posted Oct 23, 2024 12:33 UTC (Wed) by Kamiccolo (subscriber, #95159) [Link] (1 responses) And similar sanctions are not limited to US only. People required to comply Posted Oct 23, 2024 12:54 UTC (Wed) by farnz (subscriber, #17727) [Link] I know for a fact (having been subject to them) that Russian sanctions work exactly the same way as USA sanctions do. The only difference between the two of note is the relative economic power of the two countries - I would be annoyed if I could never visit the USA again or be paid by a company that does business in the USA as well as my local country, but it doesn't hugely bother me that I'd have problems visiting Russia or being paid by a Russian business. And that ends up being the core problem with where you locate an open-source foundation; international politics means that unless the world is at peace, you're really choosing the place whose sanctions decisions are least impactful on you, not a place from where you can ignore sanctions. People required to comply Posted Oct 23, 2024 14:13 UTC (Wed) by npws (subscriber, #168248) [Link] (2 responses) Thanks for the link. That answers who is subject to these sanctions. However I also wonder which specific sanctions might be applicable to someone holding a maintainer role. Its not really a formalized position, there is no money or goods exchanged, any idea what these sanctions prohibiting these people from keeping their position might be? People required to comply Posted Oct 23, 2024 15:18 UTC (Wed) by Wol (subscriber, #4433) [Link] Just a guess, but are they being paid, by a sanctioned entity, to work on the kernel?

That really is the question. At least for EU sanctions, I do not see anything obvious. You could maybe interpret providing authenticated GIT access as \"making available an economic resource\". The only exemption here is for registered telecommunication providers. But maybe US sanctions are broader. projects are left without maintainers Posted Oct 23, 2024 15:37 UTC (Wed) by xinitrc (guest, #126452) [Link] (1 responses) Maybe not the best correlation but still.

They are either personal (this will in all likelihood affect no one here) or against specific organizations, including companies. For the EU, the list is here: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02014R0269-20240914 Every entry has a justification; each significantly longer then a single sentence. The only thing that seems really objectionable here is the sentence \"They can come back in the future if sufficient documentation is provided\". That is naive (at best). I would not expect anyone of the affected, who is still living in Russia, to do that, even if they are not associated with any sanctioned entity. At the very least, they would be harassed online once they reappear in the list. Of course, if there was communication beforehand, and the list of affected maintainers was already reduced, then its fine. Reverse globalization has reached the open-source domain Posted Oct 23, 2024 6:08 UTC (Wed) by Guanjun (guest, #152647) [Link] (1 responses) Technology has no borders is a false proposition. Those who contribute to open-source software may hesitate before submitting patches in the future, and this is a bad start. Reverse globalization has reached the open-source domain Posted Oct 23, 2024 8:22 UTC (Wed) by DarkFlameMaster (guest, #113360) [Link] TECHNOLOGIES themselves have no regional boundaries, in the sense that a Chinese scientist can grab a paper written by an American scientist and still understand the technical details, provided the reader understands the language. The same is true for software, where you can grab the source code of any software and understand how it works, provided that you understand the programming language. It is the PEOPLE who set artificial boundaries that prevent the free communication of technology, for whatever reasons, like their economical interest, political stance, religious belief, or just bias, stereotype, misinformation or even superstition. And those who try to persuade you that \"technology does have borders\" are probably those who may benefit from such Balkanization. They themselves may be selling some technological products that are so inferior in quality that they wish their country can ban all competitors from overseas so that they can monopolize their domestic market. I am not sure how this works Posted Oct 23, 2024 7:00 UTC (Wed) by rgb (subscriber, #57129) [Link] (1 responses) Let's say all the Russian Linux developers collaborate to create their linux-следующий tree and then some new drivers and bug fixes get merged there. Is it illegal for Linus or any other non-sanctioned maintainer to pull those? I am not sure how this works Posted Oct 23, 2024 8:27 UTC (Wed) by farnz (subscriber, #17727) [Link] For a full answer, you need to speak to your lawyer, not to random Internet commentators like me. As with so much in law, It Depends; non-sanctioned maintainers cannot do anything that provides an incentive for a sanctioned entity to engage in commerce, so it comes down to details. Pulling a fix for Intel's GPUs (given that Intel aren't sanctioned) is probably OK; pulling a fix for hardware made by a sanctioned firm is probably not OK. Exact details probably need a lawyer's attention to each patch pulled, making it not worthwhile pulling fixes from linux-следующий or similar.

Posted Oct 23, 2024 10:23 UTC (Wed) by DOT (guest, #58786) [Link] Unfortunately, moving to another country will not really solve the problem, since the US has far-reaching influence that the foundation cannot ignore regardless of where it is legally located. Linux as a project cannot solve this. It's up to the politicians of the world. Is US still the best environment to run global open source projects? Posted Oct 23, 2024 11:36 UTC (Wed) by farnz (subscriber, #17727) [Link] The problem isn't just the location of the organisation itself, it's also the location of the maintainers; it is an offence under US sanctions law to attempt to bypass sanctions (e.g. by working with a non-US organisation to interact with sanctioned entities), and thus the only way that moving the LKO out of the USA helps is if all the US-based maintainers (such as Linus Torvalds and Greg Kroah-Hartman) leave the USA completely and relinquish their citizenship. Additionally, they'd have to accept that they might never be allowed to enter the USA ever again. Given that some of these people have family in the USA, that's a huge request to make of them.

Is it that these maintainers are considered untrustworthy due to their affiliation? If so, and assuming no wrong doing has already been observed, wouldn't an extra layer of review for these drivers suffice? Or is it that rather that supporting the hardware of Russian manufacturers reduces the effect of sanctions? That's sort of understanable but how does just removing the maintainers while keeping the drivers help? And what would happen if someone based elsewhere, not working for Russian company steps up to be maintainer for these drivers - would that be just as bad?

Presumably the reason it happened now was that a lawyer at LF got cold feet or a friendly inquiring letter from the US government. It's arguable whether what they are doing would actually be considered sanctions evasion in a court, but I do not blame them for not wanting to find out. The relevant documentation would be, as others have said, evidence that the relevant people are not employed by a listed entity. Copyright © 2024, Eklektix, Inc.

Reminds me of banks. Banks are fined for not having processes for detecting money laundering. Not money laundering, mind it, just having \"inadequate\" processes. If such a process flags someone, that someone is blocked and they should provide \"sufficient documents\", but the bank is not allowed to tell them why or what, that would be \"tipping off\", which is illegal.

In her testimony, which took place two months after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, she claimed to have witnessed Iraqi soldiers taking babies out of incubators at a Kuwaiti hospital before looting the incubators and leaving the babies to die on the floor. Nayirah's statements were widely publicized and cited numerous times in the United States Senate and by American president George H. W.

Her portrayal of Iraqi war crimes was aimed at further increasing global support for Kuwait against the Iraqi occupation during the Gulf War, which resulted in the expulsion of Iraqi troops from Kuwait by a 42-country coalition led by the United States. In 1992, it was revealed that Nayirah's last name was al-Ṣabaḥ (Arabic: نيرة الصباح) and that she was the daughter of Saud Nasser Al-Saud Al-Sabah, the erstwhile Kuwaiti ambassador to the United States. Furthermore, it was revealed that her testimony was organized as part of a wider public relations campaign conducted by the Kuwaiti government-in-exile's Citizens for a Free Kuwait, which sought to encourage American military involvement against Iraq's occupation of Kuwait through coordination with the American public relations firm Hill & Knowlton.

What's the point of open source? reply krick 2 hours agoparentI guess that's it. Open source is a fantasy that started coming to an end about 15 years ago. We lived in a fantasy world in 90s-00s, where there were no governments, no corporations and almost no people that make you shake your head. It was so easy (and of course silly, in the hindsight) to believe, that the internet is some another world, where earthly matters do not concern us. And everything was just about improving this world for ourselves. It's not like people often agree to work for free otherwise. Working for free is incompatible with capitalism, and we learn to believe that nothing else is truly possible in the real world. It's not like \"open source\" doesn't have a point in that imperfect world with governments, corporations and 8B people, that the internet seemed disconnected from for a while, it just doesn't have place. It simply almost doesn't happen there. So, now the real world has slowly catched up to that fantasy world of ours.

Today, marking the 56th anniversary, we reflect on technological advancements that the invention spurred and honor the memory and lasting influence of Mr. Dennard. About Robert Dennard Robert Dennard(opens in a new tab), an influential American electrical engineer, invented the one-transistor memory cell for dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) in 1966. His work laid the foundation for modern electronic memory storage. Dennard also contributed to the MOSFET scaling law, also known as Dennard scaling(opens in a new tab), critical for integrated circuit miniaturization and performance enhancement. He received prestigious awards, including the IEEE Medal of Honor and the Kyoto Prize. Dennard passed away in April 2024 at the age of 91, leaving a legacy in electrical engineering and computer technology. closeclose 1966 was a long time ago. The Beatles released Revolver. The No. 1 film was The Good, the Bad, and The Ugly. And computers, such as they were, involved paper tape and punch card readers. That same year, Robert Dennard invented dynamic random access memory (DRAM). Two years later — 55 years ago —on June 4, 1968, the DRAM patent was granted. The rest is history. To develop the technology, Dennard led a research team at IBM that experimented with binary data on a capacitor as a positive or negative charge. Since capacitors leaked charge, Dennard invented a platform where everything was handled by a single transistor, drastically decreasing the size. Random access memory (RAM), which employed temporary memory, was widely used at the time, but was complex, bulky and used a ton of power. Large magnetic storage systems required room-sized equipment, while storing only one megabyte of information. Dennard’s idea was to shrink the next generation of magnetic memory to a 25-centimeter square. The trick was condensing RAM into a single transistor. All of a sudden, a computer could hold a billion RAM cells on one chip. The first RAM chip, the 1103, was released in 1970. In two years, it bypassed magnetic core memory and became the best-selling semiconductor memory chip in the world. By the mid-1970s, it was the standard. In a recent IBM tribute(opens in a new tab) to Dennard, they describe the shock waves from the discovery: “Over the next five-and-a-half decades DRAM would, generation by generation, evolve...Not only did DRAM memory sweep away the earlier magnetic technologies, it became the foundational technology for an industry that has reshaped human society — from the way we work, to the way we entertain ourselves and even to the way we fight wars.” Today, DRAM components and modules in various technologies (like DDR, LPDDR, GDDR, HBM) and form factors (components, UDIMMs, SODIMM, RDIMM etc.) are pervasive from smartphones to cloud servers, powering the global economy. While we’re all familiar with Moore’s Law, Dennard Scaling takes that concept into a deeper technical meaning — the idea that with each generation, you could scale the transistor area down by half, while increasing operating frequency (clock speed) by 40%. In addition, transistors would become cheaper and more numerous in a given space yet keep power consumption constant (for twice the number of transistors). Dennard even saw the eventual end of Moore’s Law — and Dennard Scaling. An IBM colleague, Russ Lange, remembers it clearly: “Bob and I would always have lively discussions about whether there was going to be an end to the scaling. And he would say, ‘Yes, there’s an end to scaling. But there’s no end to creativity.’” By 1981, Micron exploded onto the DRAM landscape, shipping the first 64K DRAM product. This was the birth of our powerful leadership role in DRAM and NAND. Three years later we released the world’s smallest 256K DRAM product, and in 1987 came 1 megabit DRAM. closeclose Micron 64K DRAM product closeclose Micron ‘We Do Windows’ advertisement and Micron 1Mb DRAM product Gurtej Sandhu, multi-field inventor, IEEE Andrew S. Grove Award Winner and Sr. Fellow, Technology Pathfinding at Micron, recalls the early innovative days of DRAM, “When I visited the IBM Watson center about 15 years ago, my host took me to Dennard’s office. The office was kept open for visitors and in full working order and I was told that Dennard, who had retired a few years ago, still came there a few hours a week. It was ironic that at the time he invented DRAM, there was more attention given to it by Intel which was looking for a lower cost replacement for SRAM. Lowering the cost of bits was critical to grow the capabilities of computer systems and Intel went to great lengths to design their processor chip to manage DRAM refresh and customize a system level architecture which established DRAM as an integral part of the modern computing revolution.” closeclose Gurtej Sandhu EEE Andrew S. Grove Award Winner Sr. Fellow, Technology Pathfinding at Micron Sandhu adds, “It is a lesson in history we should not forget as we embark on finding memory technology solutions of the future. A successful memory technology implementation will always require a system level approach to design computer architecture and software around it to extract the most benefits for the end customer.” True to Dennard Scaling, DRAM kept getting smaller and faster. By 2002, Micron was demonstrating the world’s first 1 gigabit DDR (Double Data Rate) DRAM product. Over the years, we continued to lead the charge in DRAM innovation, from early PC DRAM, to graphics, to the current explosion of memory specific to automotive, IoT (Internet of Things) and AI (Artificial Intelligence) devices. Fast forward to 2021, when Micron released our 1α (1-alpha) node-based DRAM products, with the world’s most advanced DRAM process technology delivering major improvements in density, power consumption and performance. Notes Scott DeBoer, Micron EVP of technology and products: “With a 40% improvement in memory density over our previous 1z DRAM node, this advancement creates a solid foundation for future product and memory innovation.” For example, the node enables us to deliver ultra power efficient, reliable memory and faster low-power DDR5 (LPDDR5) operating speeds for platforms that require best-in-class LPDRAM (low power DRAM) performance. The company’s LPDDR5 based on the 1 alpha node, boasts a 15% improvement in power savings, allowing 5G mobile users to perform more tasks on their smartphones without sacrificing battery life. closeclose Micron LPDDR5 Other applications include the industry’s first automotive LPDDR5 DRAM that meets the most stringent Automotive Safety Integrity Level (ASIL), ASIL D. The solution is part of Micron’s new portfolio of memory and storage products targeted for automotive functional safety(opens in a new tab) based on the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 26262 standard. Today, Micron continues to be at the forefront of DRAM advancement, with the release in 2022 of the 1β (1-beta) production node, which boasts a 16Gb per die capacity and a data rate of 8.5Gbps, delivering a 15 percent better power efficiency and upwards of a 35 percent bit density improvement. In an early application of the node technology, Micron LPDDR5X on the 1 beta node will enable high-resolution 8K video recording and video editing in mobile phones. closeclose Micron 1-beta node wafer Meanwhile, Micron recently announced(opens in a new tab) that our 1γ (1-gamma) DRAM process technology employs revolutionary extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography production. We will be the first semiconductor company to bring EUV technology for production to Japan and will ramp EUV into production on the 1γ (1-gamma) node in Taiwan and Japan in 2025. Robert Dennard's innovation more than 55 years ago invigorated a burgeoning memory industry, including Micron's unparalleled 64k to 1γ DRAM leadership and advancements.

    "commentBody": "How DRAM changed the world (micron.com)124 points by sandwichsphinx 20 hours agohidepastfavorite89 comments asdefghyk 45 minutes agoI have a recollection of a design where microprocessor reads were used to refresh DRAM contents. Late 1970s. I thought it was in a early 6800 Motorola book. Can find it now, or no mention of the technique, now. Would slow down program operation for sure. Maybe my recollection is wrong, not sure. reply seunosewa 17 hours agoprevThe article doesn't properly explain how DRAM is different from SRAM. DRAM has to constantly refresh itself in order not to 'forget' its contents. reply kruador 2 hours agoparentIndeed - the 'dynamic' comes from 'dynamic logic'. Wikipedia: \"It is distinguished from the so-called static logic by exploiting temporary storage of information in stray and gate capacitances.\" What Dennard realised was that you don't actually need to have a separate capacitor to hold the bit value - the bit value is just held on the stray and gate capacitance of the transistor that switches on when that bit's row and column are selected, causing the stray capacitance to discharge through the output line. Because of that, the act of reading the bit's value means that the data is destroyed. Therefore one of the jobs of the sense amplifier circuit - which converts the tiny voltage from the bit cell to the external voltage - is to recharge the bit. But that stray capacitance is so small that it naturally discharges through the high, but not infinite, resistance when the transistor is 'off'. Hence, you have to refresh DRAM, by regularly reading every bit frequently enough that it hasn't discharged before you got to it. Usually you might only need to read every row frequently enough, because there's actually a sense amplifier for each column, reading all the bit values in that row, with the column address strobe just selecting which column bit gets output. reply dehrmann 2 hours agoparentprevIt isn't the point of the article, but this is true of every storage medium. It's just a question of milliseconds or years. reply asdefghyk 1 hour agorootparentStatic RAM ( based on how it is used) never needs to be refreshed at current typical computer power on times (hours or days ) . Current DRAM must be refreshed at very much faster rates to be able to be useful. reply praptak 10 hours agoparentprevYes, it totally misses the crucial and non obvious trade off which unlocked the benefits. The rest of the system has to take care of periodically rewriting every memory cell so that the charge doesn't dissipate. In fact it took a bit of time for the CPUs or memory controllers to do it automatically, i.e. without the programmer having to explicitly code the refresh. reply kstrauser 3 hours agoparentprevWhy would we use DRAM, then? It seems better not to have to refresh it all the time. (I think I more or less know, but I’d rather talk about it than look it up this morning.) reply myself248 3 hours agorootparentBecause SRAM is essentially a flipflop gate. It takes at least four transistors to store a single bit in SRAM, some designs use six. And current must continuously flow to keep the transistors in their state, so it's rather power hungry. One bit of DRAM is just one transistor and one capacitor. Massive density improvements; all the complexity is in the row/column circuitry at the edges of the array. And it only burns power during accesses or refreshes. If you don't need to refresh very often, you can get the power very low. If the array isn't being accessed, the refresh time can be double-digit milliseconds, perhaps triple-digit. Which of course leads to problems like rowhammer, where rows affected by adjacent accesses don't get additional refreshes like they should (because this has a performance cost -- any cycle spent refreshing is a cycle not spent accessing), and you end up with the RAM reading out different bits than were put in. Which is the most fundamental defect conceivable for a storage device, but the industry is too addicted to performance to tap the brakes and address correctness. Every DDR3/DDR4 chip ever manufactured is defective by design. reply kstrauser 2 hours agorootparentThat makes a lot of sense. Thanks! reply praptak 1 hour agorootparentprevThe key point is that the refreshes do not need to happen very often. Something like once per 20 ms for each row was doable even by an explicit loop that the CPU had to periodically execute. And this task soon moved to memory controllers, or at least got done by CPUs automatically without need for explicit coding. reply zoeysmithe 2 hours agorootparentprevThe inventor of DRAM, Robert Heath Dennard, just died a few months ago and I was reading his obit and his history. I think the long and short of it is that DRAM is cheap. DRAM needs one transistor per data bit. Competing technologies needed far more. SRAM needed six transistors per bit for example. Dennard figured out how to vastly cut down complexity, thus costs. reply MichaelZuo 19 hours agoprevDennard scaling for SRAM has certainly halted, as demonstrated by TSMC’s 3nm process vs 5 nm. What’s the likely ETA for DRAM? reply hajile 15 hours agoparentYears ago. DRAM uses a capacitor. Those capacitors essentially hit a hard limit at around 400MHz for our traditional materials a very long time ago. This means that if you need to sequentially read random locations from RAM, you can't do it faster than 400MHz. Our only answer here is better AI prefetchers and less-random memory patterns in our software (the penalty for not prefetching is so great that theoretically less efficient algorithms can suddenly become more efficient if they are simply more predictable). As to capacitor sizes, we've been at the volume limit for quite a while. When the capacitor is discharged, we must amplify the charge. That gets harder as the charge gets weaker and there's a fundamental limit to how small you can go. Right now, each capacitor has somewhere in the range of a mere 40,000 electrons holding the charge. Going lower dramatically increases the complexity of trying to tell the signal from the noise and dealing with ever-increasing quantum effects. Getting more capacitors closer means a smaller diameter, but keeping the same volume means making the cylinder longer. You quickly reach a point where even dramatic increases in height (something very complicated to do in silicon) give only minuscule decreases in diameter. reply kstrauser 3 hours agorootparentWhat does “faster than 400MHz” mean in this context? Does that mean you can’t ask for a unit of memory from it more than 400M times a second? If so, what’s the basic unit there, a bit? A word? I built a little CPU in undergrad but never got around to building RAM and admit it’s still kind of a black box to me. Bonus question: When I had an Amiga, we’d buy 50 or 60ns RAM. Any idea what that number meant, or what today’s equivalent would be? reply hajile 51 minutes agorootparentThe capacitors take time to charge and discharge. You can't do that more than around 400MHz with current materials. You are correct that it means you can't access the same bit of memory more than 400M/sec. This is the same whether you are accessing 1bit or 1M bits because the individual capacitors that make up those bits can't be charged/discharged any faster. When we moved from SDR to DDR1, latencies dropped from 20-25ns to about 15ns too, but if you run the math, we've been at 13-17ns of latency ever since. reply aidenn0 13 hours agorootparentprevIf that's the case, why haven't we switched to SRAM? Isn't it only about 4x the price at any given process node? reply RF_Savage 13 hours agorootparentThat 4x the price does also explain why it has not happened. reply guerrilla 11 hours agorootparentYeah but why don't we have like 500MB of SRAM per 8GB of RAM. Certain addresses could be faster, in the same way /dev/shm/ is faster. reply turtles3 10 hours agorootparentThis is sort of the role that L3 cache plays already. Your proposal would be effectively an upgradable L4 cache. No idea if the economics on that are worth it vs bigger DRAM so you have less pressure on the nvme disk. reply guerrilla 9 hours agorootparentCache is not general purpose as far as I know. I want to be able to do whatever I want with it. reply myself248 3 hours agorootparentCoreboot and some other low-level stuff uses cache-as-RAM during early steps of the boot process. There was briefly a product called vCage loading a whole secure hypervisor into cache-as-RAM, with a goal of being secure against DRAM-remanence (\"cold-boot\") attacks where the DIMMs are fast-chilled to slow charge leakage and removed from the target system to dump their contents. Since the whole secure perimeter was on-die in the CPU, it could use memory encryption to treat the DRAM as untrusted. So, yeah, you can do it. It's funky. reply MichaelZuo 7 hours agorootparentprevWhere’s the market demand for that? reply guerrilla 2 hours agorootparentWhere is the market demand for faster RAM? This isn't a good question. reply ghaff 6 hours agorootparentprevYeah, you’re basically betting that people will put a lot of effort in trying to out/optimize the hardware and perhaps to some degree the OS. Not a good bet. When SMP first came out we had one large customer that wanted to manually handle scheduling themselves. That didn’t last long. reply crest 4 hours agorootparentprevAMD offers CPUs with over 768MiB of cache if you're willing and able to afford them. reply Salgat 15 hours agoparentprev5nm can hold roughly a gigabyte of SRAM on a cpu-sized die, that's around $130/GB I believe. At some point 5nm will be cheap enough that we can start considering replacing DRAM with SRAM directly on the chip (aka L4 cache). I wonder how big of a latency and bandwidth bonus that'd be. You could even go for a larger node size without losing much capacity for half the price. reply crest 4 hours agorootparentSRAM also requires more power than DRAM and the simple regular structure of SRAM arrays compared to (other) logic makes it possible to get good yield rates through redundancy and error correction codes so you could have giant monolithic dies, but information can't exceed the speed of light in a medium. There just isn't enough time for the signals to propagate to get the latency you expect of a L3 cache out of gigabytes (in relative terms) far away big dies containing gigabytes of SRAM. Also moving that the data would to perform computations without caching would be terrible wasteful given how much energy is needed just to move the data. Instead you would probably end up with something closer to the computing memory concept to map computation to ALUs close to the data with an at least two tier network (on-die, inter-die) to support reductions. reply Salgat 1 hour agorootparentOh yeah this would definitely be something like L4 cache rather than L3 like AMD's X3D cpus. The expectation is as an alternative to DRAM (or as a supplement), kind of like what Xeon Phi did. reply bgnn 11 hours agorootparentprev5nm will never be that cheap. The performance benefit would be easily 2x or more though. reply Salgat 1 hour agorootparentEven 15 years from now? reply wmf 19 hours agoparentprevNow? Prices have been flat for 15 years and DRAM has been stuck on 10 nm for a while. reply philipkglass 18 hours agorootparentThat's overstating the flatness of prices. In 2009, the best price recorded here was 10 dollars per gigabyte: https://jcmit.net/memoryprice.htm Recently DDR4 RAM is available at well under $2/GB, some closer to $1/GB. reply jychang 16 hours agorootparent$1/GB? That's around the price SSDs took over from HDDs... reply ksec 19 hours agoparentprevNot soon as DRAM is mostly on older node. But overall cost reduction of DRAM is moving very very slowly. reply cubefox 7 hours agoparentprev> Dennard scaling for SRAM has certainly halted, as demonstrated by TSMC’s 3nm process vs 5 nm. I don't think the latter (SRAM capacity remaining the same per area?) has anything to do with Dennard scaling. reply WarOnPrivacy 5 hours agoprevupdated June 2024 Update: Today, marking the 56th anniversary...1966 Please forgive my pedantry but 58th. It was a busy year. reply neom 19 hours agoprevI miss RAM. I feel like if you lived through that 90s RAM frenzy, you probably miss RAM too. It was crazy how quickly we move through SDRAM/DDR, prices dropped and you could make real increases in performance year over year for not much money. I'm sure some of it was the software being able to capture the hw improvements, but that certainly was my fav period in tech so far. reply gregmac 16 hours agoparentI am confused by this comment. You said \"RAM\" (contrast to \"DRAM\" in the article title) but I think you are talking about DRAM sticks? But those have not gone away (other than with some laptops where it's soldered on and not upgradable). Going from 8MB to 32MB in the 90s is still comparable to going from 8GB to 32GB today. One difference is just that the price isn't dropping at the same rate anymore [1], so it doesn't make as much sense to buy small and re-buy next year when bigger chips are cheaper (they won't be much cheaper). Another is that DRAM speed is at the top of an S-curve [2], so there's not that same increase in speed year-over-year, though arguably the early 2000's were when speeds most dramatically increased.

This statement makes it difficult to believe you were there. reply rob74 10 hours agorootparentOf course, the really significant step back then was being able to go from 640 kB (+/-) to more than 1 MB (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conventional_memory). reply specialist 5 hours agorootparentYup. We maxed our Tandy (Radio Shack) 286 boxen, juiced to a blistering 8mhz, with 2.5mb RAM. I got blisters from stuffing RAM into daughter boards. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expanded_memory#Expansion_boar... Twas early years of PC-based image scanning and processing. We only had 1 image capture board. The boot's POST duration for 2.5mb was ridiculous. So after a cpature, my coworker (hi Tim Hall!) would ever so quickly yank the board out of a running box (now doing image processing) to be used in another box. Multitasking! As I remember it, the jump to 386 (much delayed by Micron's protectionist racket) was the next biggest step up. reply exe34 9 hours agorootparentprevNowadays electron apps will just baloon and take up the slack. Back in the days, it meant you could run 4x more stuff or handle bigger files/models with less thrashing of your very slow hdd. reply CalRobert 13 hours agorootparentprevHow so? reply phil21 13 hours agorootparent8GB -> 32GB doesn't really give you a whole lot more than opening more browser tabs or whatnot. Cache some more filesystem into memory I suppose. 8MB -> 32MB enabled entirely new categories of (consumer-level) software. It would be a game changer for performance as you were no longer swapping to (exceedingly slow) disk. They simply are not comparable, imo. 8MB to 32MB was night and day difference and you would drool over the idea of someday being able to afford such a luxury. 8GB to 32GB was at least until very recently a nice to have for power users. reply smolder 11 hours agorootparentDisk speed is definitely a key factor. Solid state is dramatically lower latency than HDDs were, while DRAM latency in absolute terms has been pretty constant for a long time. So even if you're doing something very demanding that works with large amounts of data relative to standard quantities of RAM (a situation that gets harder to come by,) having it all in RAM at the same time is much less important than back in the 90s/00s. reply Gibbon1 11 hours agorootparentprevGoing from 4MB to 16MB made Autocad and Orcad Capture under Win 3.1 no longer slow. I remember a few years before that you'd zoom in on a drawing and do as much as you could without zooming back out because it would take a full minute to redraw the screen. And then another minute to zoom back in somewhere else. reply winrid 12 hours agorootparentprevYeah, the equivalent nowadays would be like going from 256mb to 16gb.

HD to 4k some benefit. 4k to 8k... Well I suppose there is things. The starting to point really does matter.

(Actually asking, not being combative, I don't know) reply vbezhenar 16 hours agorootparentLast time I checked, DDR5 and DDR4 latency was basically the same. Very little progress there. May be with integrating DRAM and CPU on the same package, some latency wins will be available just because wires will be shorter, but nothing groundbreaking. reply cesarb 7 hours agorootparentThere's another factor, which is the number of independent channels; DDR5 doubles the number of channels per memory stick. This gets more important as CPUs get more and more cores. reply sundvor 12 hours agorootparentprevMy DDR4 was C16, but my DDR5 at C30 makes up for that with sheer speed. Currently sporting this - G.Skill Trident Z5 Neo RGB Black 64GB (2x32GB) PC5-48000 (6000MHz) with a 7800x3d. Previous kit was G.Skill Trident Z Neo RGB 32GB (2x16GB), PC4-28800 (3600MHz) DDR4, 16-16-16-36 [X2, eventually, for 64 total] with, you guessed it, the 5800x3d, from the 3900xt - my son loves it. reply smolder 11 hours agorootparentTo reiterate the GPs point, in case anyone didn't get it: DDR4-3200 CL16 is equivalent to DDR5-6000 CL30 or DDR5-6400 CL32 in terms of latency. Divide the frequency by the CAS latency and you get the same number for all of those. It was the same situation going from DDR3 to 4. There's some wiggle room if you run above-spec voltages (and depending on the quality of the chips, etc.) but things have stayed roughly where they are latency-wise, gen-to-gen. reply smolder 11 hours agorootparentprevYes, latency has stayed fairly constant going back at least as far as DDR3. It was nudged downward a little from DDR2 to 3, with higher clocks bringing finer grained timings, but I would say any improvement in later generations is pretty negligible in nanosecond terms. reply IshKebab 18 hours agoparentprevNah the biggest jump in performance by far was SSDs.

A single donation sparks a flurry of text messages and emails from candidates and political organizations across the country. The messages make urgent pleas for money and look as if they are coming directly from major political candidates. They come at an unrelenting pace, directing donors to pages that often sign them up for monthly – or even weekly – donations. Money is then drained from their bank accounts without them realizing it. Ultimately, some of these elderly, vulnerable consumers have unwittingly given away six-figure sums – most often to Republican candidates – making them among the country’s largest grassroots political donors. CNN Investigates How elderly dementia patients are unwittingly fueling political campaigns A CNN investigation reveals how deceptive political fundraising has misled elderly Americans into giving away millions of dollars By Blake Ellis, Melanie Hicken, Yahya Abou-Ghazala, Audrey Ash, Kyung Lah, Anna-Maja Rappard, Casey Tolan, Lou Robinson and Byron Manley, CNN Published October 22, 2024 (CNN) — The 80-year-old communications engineer from Texas had saved for decades, driving around in an old car and buying clothes from thrift stores so he’d have enough money to enjoy his retirement years. But as dementia robbed him of his reasoning abilities, he began making online political donations over and over again — eventually telling his son he believed he was part of a network of political operatives communicating with key Republican leaders. In less than two years, the man became one of the country’s largest grassroots supporters of the Republican Party, ultimately giving away nearly half a million dollars to former President Donald Trump and other candidates. Now, the savings account he spent his whole life building is practically empty. The story of this unlikely political benefactor is one of many playing out across the country. More than 1,000 reports filed with government agencies and consumer advocacy groups reviewed by CNN, along with an analysis of campaign finance data and interviews with dozens of contributors and their family members, show how deceptive political fundraisers have victimized hundreds of elderly Americans and misled those battling dementia or other cognitive impairments into giving away millions of dollars — far more than they ever intended. Some unintentionally joined the ranks of the top grassroots political donors in the country as they tapped into retirement savings and went into debt, contributing six-figure sums through thousands of transactions. To provide a snapshot of who these vulnerable donors are and how much money they have lost to increasingly aggressive fundraising campaigns, reporters reached out to more than 300 of the biggest and most frequent small-dollar political donors and their family members. Through these interviews and consumer complaints, reporters collected the accounts of more than 50 unwitting elderly donors and traced the path of where their money went. Often coming in $5 or $10 at a time, contributions from this small sampling of donors alone added up to more than $6 million over the last five years — the majority of which ended up with Trump and a long list of other Republican candidates, CNN found. While this is a small fraction of the billions raised by political campaigns, for many of the individuals who made the donations, the sums represented huge portions of their life savings. Deceptive fundraising tactics, including those that trick elderly donors, were exposed in the wake of the 2020 election. While studies show that older Americans tend to lean more Republican, both parties have continued to rake in donations from elderly voters. And mainstream Republican candidates have only doubled down on this strategy, using more aggressive and predatory tactics than those used by Democrats, according to donor complaints, interviews with experts and a review of solicitations. The Republican fundraising machine has been subject to more than 800 complaints to the Federal Trade Commission since 2022 — nearly seven times more than the number of complaints lodged against the other side. “The fact there are lots of complaints means this is likely a huge problem,” said Prentiss Cox, a law professor at the University of Minnesota and former manager of consumer protection at the Minnesota Attorney General&#39;s Office, when presented with CNN’s reporting. “From a consumer protection standpoint, this raises red flag level concerns about consumer misinformation and deception.” Donors identified by CNN were often in their 80s and 90s. They included retired public workers, house cleaners and veterans, widows living alone, nursing home residents and people who donated more money than they paid for their homes, according to records and interviews. The money they gave came from pensions, Social Security payments and retirement savings accounts meant to last decades. Donors took out new credit cards and mortgages to pay for the contributions. In some cases, they gave away most of their life savings. Their cell phones and email inboxes were so full of pleas for money that they missed photos of their grandkids and other important messages. At least one person continued to be charged for contributions after his death. Donors or their families often learned of the extent of their donations from CNN reporters. The family members of some said their loved ones had also been the targets of common elder scams. Most asked CNN not to name them out of concern that they would be further victimized or ashamed.

By the time a Taiwanese immigrant from California passed away from lung cancer this year at age 80, she had given away more than $180,000 to Trump’s campaign and a litany of other Republican candidates – writing letters to candidates apologizing for not getting donations to them on time because she was going into heart surgery. She had only $250 in her bank account when she died, leaving her family scrambling to cover the cost of her funeral. And a 78-year-old, a widow who limited showers to save on her water bill and canceled her long-term care insurance, didn’t understand why the retirement savings her husband had left her was dwindling so quickly. After CNN reached out to her family, they learned that the woman gave more than $200,000 in donations to Democratic political groups and candidates.

Email us at watchdog@cnn.com.The federal government has gone after non-political companies for similar tactics, such as making false statements in ads or making them seem as if they were written directly to the recipient. But regulators have done little to stop fundraisers from using misleading and deceptive advertisements to target vulnerable donors. And the lawmakers who experts say would need to act to protect consumers at both the state and federal levels are the same ones benefiting from the current fundraising machines. The biggest beneficiary of the small-dollar donations from unwitting donors identified by CNN was Donald Trump. His current and former campaigns and affiliated political committees brought in more than $400,000 from these elderly consumers between July 2019 and June 2024, which included multiple election cycles. The national committees which raise money to support House and Senate races across the nation also received hundreds of thousands of dollars from such donors, according to CNN’s analysis, and in all, the long list of Republican candidates and causes took in nearly $4 million. A spokesperson for the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee noted that fundraising efforts over the years have varied and said Trump ads were designed to be respectful, including such language as “don’t sweat it” if donors couldn’t afford to contribute on a regular basis. On the Democratic side, much of the money went to left-leaning political action committees known as PACs, not mainstream Democratic candidates. The Progressive Turnout Project and its affiliated group, Stop Republicans, took in the most, with roughly $150,000 coming from the vulnerable donors identified by CNN. President Joe Biden’s presidential campaign was not among the top recipients, taking in only about 10% of the $400,000 Trump brought in from those elderly donors. Vice President Kamala Harris had not yet launched her presidential bid during the fundraising period covered in CNN’s analysis, though more recent campaign finance reports show her campaign has taken in several thousand dollars from this snapshot of donors. The Harris campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Donald Trump and other Republicans took in millions from this small sampling of vulnerable seniors Over $6 million in contributions from just 52 elderly, unwitting donors identified by CNN were spread out among nearly 2,000 campaigns and political action committees (PACs). Most of the money went to Republican candidates, and Trump’s political operation was the top recipient.Total contributions to campaigns and political action committees from vulnerable donors identified by CNNActBlue WinRed 0 $50,000 DemocraticSenatorial CampaignCommittee$90,044100,000 DemocraticCongressionalCampaignCommittee$123,472150,000 ProgressiveTurnout Project/Stop Republicans$155,837NationalRepublican CongressionalCommittee$165,479200,000 250,000 300,000 National Republican Senatorial Committee$373,586 350,000 400,000 Trump campaigns and associated committees$440,033 450,000ActBlue WinRed 0 $50,000 DemocraticSenatorial CampaignCommittee$90,044100,000 DemocraticCongressionalCampaignCommittee$123,472150,000 ProgressiveTurnout Project/Stop Republicans$155,837NationalRepublican CongressionalCommittee$165,479200,000 250,000 300,000 National Republican Senatorial Committee$373,586 350,000 Trump campaigns and associated committees$440,033 400,000 450,000WinRed Trump campaigns and associated committees$440,033 National Republican Congressional Committee$165,479National Republican Senatorial Committee$373,586 ActBlue Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee$90,044Progressive Turnout Project/Stop Republicans$155,837Democratic CongressionalCampaign Committee$123,4720 50,000 100,000 150,000 200,000 250,000 300,000 350,000 400,000 $450,000Trump campaigns and associated committees$440,033 National Republican Congressional Committee$165,479WinRed National Republican Senatorial Committee$373,586 ActBlue Democratic CongressionalCampaign Committee$123,472Progressive Turnout Project/Stop Republicans$155,837Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee$90,0440 50,000 100,000 150,000 200,000 250,000 300,000 350,000 400,000 $450,000Trump campaigns and associated committees$440,033 WinRed National Republican Congressional Committee$165,479National Republican Senatorial Committee$373,586 ActBlue Democratic CongressionalCampaign Committee$123,472Progressive Turnout Project/Stop Republicans$155,837Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee$90,0440 50,000 100,000 150,000 200,000 250,000 300,000 350,000 400,000 $450,000Notes: These totals do not include refunds received by donors, which were typically only a small fraction of the total amount they had given. Trump’s 2020 and 2024 campaigns, along with several fundraising committees associated with those campaigns, are included together in this chart. Sources: CNN reporting and analysis of FEC individual contributions through WinRed and ActBlue from July 2019 to June 2024 The fundraising operations that have solicited money from vulnerable senior citizens use either WinRed or ActBlue, two juggernaut digital platforms that unite hundreds of political groups and campaigns under a single umbrella. Each platform charges a fee of about 4% of every transaction, although WinRed is a for-profit company and ActBlue is a nonprofit. Campaign finance records show that the two groups took in more than $100 million in fees from federal campaigns and political committees in the last two years alone. WinRed, founded by a former Trump staffer in 2019, and ActBlue, which has been around for two decades, say it is the campaigns themselves that are choosing the frequency and tenor of the pleas for donations. WinRed did not respond to multiple requests for comment. A spokesperson for ActBlue said the platform is designed to give “donors full control” over their contributions, saying donors or their families can contact their in-house support team with any concerns. But it is the fundraising platforms that have made it easier than ever for campaigns to bring in as much money as possible from their bases. Both have boasted of record-breaking hauls this campaign cycle, with WinRed saying this summer it was processing more than 2,700 donations per minute — a jump of more than 40% from 2020. The controversial feature that fools many donors is a pre-checked box campaigns use to automatically authorize recurring donations. Donors often don’t realize they need to uncheck that box, so while attempting to make a one-time small donation, they are unknowingly signing up for weekly or monthly recurring donations. Sometimes it takes months or years before they realize a campaign has been regularly charging their credit card or taking money out of their bank account. Richard Benjamin’s family tells CNN he was “manipulated” into donating his life savings to Republican causes while suffering from dementia. While many mainstream Democratic candidates have backed away from the practice, both the Trump and Harris campaigns have recently been using donation pages with pre-checked recurring boxes to raise money, a CNN analysis of fundraising emails and Facebook and Instagram ads found. Trump’s campaign said two of his current fundraising committees only returned to the use of pre-checked boxes in September after pausing the practice in January 2023. The spokesperson, however, did not address whether another Trump-affiliated committee still receiving donations this year had been using the tactic. Trump Campaign Senior Advisor Brian Hughes said \"we strive to be direct and transparent by informing them immediately when they have registered for recurring donations, sending a notice three days before processing, notifying them when the processing is complete, and having staff on-hand to assist with refunds and cancellations.” Recurring donations only multiply as confirmed donors become valuable political currency — their names and contact information quickly swapped and sold. And once WinRed or ActBlue has a donor’s financial information, donations can be triggered by actions including a response to an online survey, an order of campaign merchandise or a one-word reply to a text message. As a result, records show, some donors ended up being charged in excess of 100 times in a single day. ‘Lonely and isolated’Richard Benjamin, an 81-year-old from Arizona, believed he had been in personal communication with former president Trump through all the messages he was receiving. At one point, he told his children the former president invited him to a luxurious reception at Mar-a-Lago. He had grown up on a farm and worried he would feel out of his element at such a fancy venue. But when he received what he described to his children as an invitation to be a VIP at a rally in Arizona, he was thrilled he would finally meet the former president himself. He started making travel plans and asking his sister-in-law if she would like to accompany him, since his wife had passed away in 2018.Excerpts from a WinRed ad inviting donors to Mar-a-Lago Source: Trump Save America Joint Fundraising Committee Later, he told his son how angry he was that Donald Trump Jr. wouldn&#39;t call him back even though the former president’s son had sent Benjamin so many nice messages. “He was old, lonely and isolated,” his son, Jason Benjamin, told CNN, saying the pandemic only compounded that isolation. “’Save America, help save America,’ that was the constant message. He would get thanked for helping to save America.” Richard Benjamin, who now lives in a memory care unit at an assisted living facility, would look forward to the emails and texts, and especially to the ones thanking him for being a true American and patriot when he donated his money. This eventually led him to give about $80,000, leaving him tens of thousands of dollars in debt and his children angry at the campaigns who they say tricked their dad and took advantage of his compromised state of mind. “He really, in his heart, believed that Donald Trump and Donald Trump Jr. and other politicians were personally reaching out to him,” Jason Benjamin said. Richard Benjamin and his family showed CNN that he continues to be inundated with text messages and phone calls from politicians to this day. Yet he often couldn’t identify the politicians he financially supported. “There’s no excuse for them to allow something like this to happen,” Jason Benjamin said of the campaigns behind the many solicitations. An employee from Richard Benjamin’s bank even lodged a complaint to the Federal Trade Commission about deceptive practices, saying Benjamin had never intended to donate close to the amount he did, according to FTC records. Forensic geriatrician Kathryn Locatell said what Richard Benjamin felt each time he received a “thank you” message or made a donation is the same “dopamine hit” a lot of elderly Americans are seeking. And the solicitations are crafted in a way that intentionally suck elderly donors into their web, providing “a feeling of belonging to a thrilling, special club.” “You and I could call these demands for money laughable but to a person who’s lost their capacity to judge reality, and who’s been soaking up all the toxic misinformation out there, on the internet and TV, it’s a perfectly coherent reality and they’re happy to join in and become a part of it,” she said. “That’s how all their money will be drained until it’s gone.” Watch the full investigation:CNN’s Kyung Lah reveals how deceptive political fundraisers have misled hundreds of elderly Americans into unwittingly giving away millions of dollars. Because the text informing donors they are enrolling in recurring donations is often so tiny, particularly on WinRed donation pages, it would be very easy for someone who isn’t actually processing what they’re reading to miss it, according to Locatell and other experts interviewed by CNN. Elderly donors who have short-term memory issues could be making one-time donations again and again, not remembering that they made a donation even an hour earlier, they added. “These ads are a form of misleading, undue influence,” Locatell said. “One simple rule could be enacted: Ads can’t contain these pre-checked boxes; the person has to actively choose recurring donation.” Behavioral symptoms such as getting hooked by solicitations like these and making poor financial decisions often happen in the early stages of dementia, before family members even realize their loved ones are experiencing any sort of cognitive decline. CNN compared examples of pages donors use to make contributions to presidential candidates, former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. Some donors believe political candidates are speaking to them directly, with an ad like this one indicating that Trump requested to be their friend on social media. Invitations to join phony boards or focus groups are another common fundraising tactic that experts told CNN are used to make people feel special and are more likely to entrap elderly donors who may have diminished reasoning abilities. Polls like this one — with 11 questions — can rile up voters before asking them for money. The yellow box automatically signs donors up for weekly donations, after asking if Trump can count on their “sustained support.” The way this small text appears to be hyperlinked makes it seem like donors should click there to sign up for recurring donations. But they are actually already signed up by the pre-checked box above. These boxes, which claim to be messages from Trump, are known as upsells. A click on both of these results in two additional donations. Fundraising pages for the Harris campaign, like this one, are clearer than those used by Trump. This headline tells donors they will be signing up for weekly donations. Harris fundraising pages tend to be short and relatively simple. Like Trump, the Harris campaign sometimes uses pre-checked boxes that automatically sign donors up for recurring donations unless they opt out.Calls from CNN reporters asking about donations prompted some family members to rush over to their loved ones’ homes to help look through statements or to begin the long process of taking over their finances. Other families CNN spoke with said it was the unusually large number of political donations – which took precedence over expenses as important as electricity bills and taxes -- that alerted them something was wrong. In the case of the 80-year-old retired communications engineer who gave away close to half a million dollars, one of the man’s sons discovered his savings account was nearly drained from all his donations. The son said he took him to a neurologist where he was diagnosed with dementia and spent weeks canceling credit cards and disputing charges, attempting to turn off recurring donations one by one. He ultimately received refunds from WinRed for his father’s most recent donations. Still, his father remains out roughly $300,000. “When I found this out and started showing Dad, he was shocked, he had no idea,” his son said. “He&#39;s not a man to give anyone what he considered his life savings.” It often falls on families to try to help their loved ones.

She said her mother was going to donate to each before she stopped her. Her mother’s cognitive decline has gotten so bad, she said, that she believed when someone asked her for money, she needed to give it. The daughter, who lives in another city, said she has been trying to coordinate her mother’s medical care while also sorting through the credit card debt she accrued after giving away more than $100,000. No oversightWhen an elderly man discovered thousands of dollars&#39; worth of political charges on his credit card he said he never authorized, he turned to the agency that oversees campaign donations – the Federal Election Commission – for help. “I am an 89-year-old widower, a retired architect who lives alone,” he wrote in a 2022 complaint. He said he had been plagued by robocalls and scam mail and it appeared ActBlue was “rife with fraud.” By the time the FEC completed its investigation, he had died, collapsing \"on his way to the post office to mail postcards to voters in Texas,” according to his obituary. But the agency hadn’t planned on doing anything about his complaint anyway, writing in a response that the matter was “rated as low priority” for an enforcement action based on criteria including the severity of the allegation and the dollar amount involved. The agency shut down another complaint made about WinRed by the daughters of an elderly woman who said their mother had lost more than $6,700 to “elder abuse” with the same boiler plate response, noting the “low dollar amount involved.” The FEC would not comment on WinRed or ActBlue specifically but said in a 2023 report on legislative recommendations that it had been regularly hearing from donors who had signed up for recurring donations without their knowledge or consent. The report noted consumers had often attempted to cancel the donations without success before contacting agency staff for help. Agency officials said the outcry from donors \"strongly suggests that many contributors are unaware of the ‘pre-checked boxes’ and are surprised by the already completed transactions appearing on account statements.\" But it said it didn’t have the authority to ban the practice, and that Congress should introduce legislation to change this — a recommendation agency officials first made after the New York Times reported on the issue in 2021.

He said seeking recurring donations “from someone who is not of sound mind” is “unscrupulous behavior [that] falls into a legal gray area.” The Federal Trade Commission criticized pre-checked boxes in a 2022 staff report as an example of a “trick” and “psychological tactic” used by retailers and direct marketers “to get consumers to part with their money.” But the agency — which enforces laws governing deceptive advertising, among other regulations — told CNN it did not have jurisdiction over ads used by political campaigns, or over the operations of WinRed and ActBlue, despite fielding hundreds of complaints from consumers. Currently, pre-checked boxes for recurring donations are allowed in almost every state despite widespread condemnation of the practice from consumer advocates. Federal legislation introduced in recent years that would have prevented their use died in committee without gaining traction. And while four Democratic attorneys general have been investigating the fundraising tactics of WinRed and ActBlue, no action has been taken to date. A number of Republican lawmakers have specifically targeted ActBlue with investigations after right-wing influencers claimed the large volume of transactions from some donors suggested money laundering. CNN has found no evidence of money laundering, instead finding that many elderly donors simply didn’t realize how much they were giving. Individual complaints made to state attorneys general around the country, meanwhile, have not resulted in any apparent action taken against the fundraising platforms or campaigns, according to records obtained by CNN. And in what some donors and experts have pointed to as a potential conflict of interest, the same attorneys general receiving complaints about these platforms have also used WinRed and ActBlue for their own fundraising efforts. Making it stopIn Utah, a 69-year-old woman, who had a tube surgically placed in her brain to drain fluid from it and had such severe dementia that she required around-the-clock home care, donated nearly $20,000 to Republican candidates in less than four months. WinRed continued to charge her even after the attorney overseeing her financial affairs informed the company of her condition and sent a cease-and-desist letter. He filed a lawsuit in 2021 against the platform, which remains ongoing. But it still took a year to make the donations stop. Just seven days after she made her last donation to the Republicans, public records show that more donations were charged to her accounts. This time, to a political group supporting Democrats.

Source: CNN reporting and analysis of FEC individual contributions through WinRed and ActBlue from July 2019 to June 2024. Matthew Hurtt, the chairman of Virginia-based Arlington County Republican Committee, said he has fielded more than 200 calls and emails from frustrated donors located all over the country. Many of them are elderly donors who say they have struggled to stop their recurring contributions and receive refunds. Hurtt is not affiliated with WinRed, but said he receives the angry inquiries because WinRed is registered in Arlington, so charges made through the platform can sometimes show up with “Arlington” on credit card statements. Hurtt, like other experts, told CNN he believes such aggressive fundraising tactics are short-sighted and will turn off voters in the long run. “We don&#39;t have to trick people into giving money to our candidates and to our causes,” Hurtt said. “Any platform that tricks older donors into giving money unwittingly seems like a scheme to me.” Both WinRed and ActBlue have said they notify donors of each recurring contribution and have guides on their websites explaining how donors or their families can request refunds and cancel recurring donations. ActBlue told CNN it has trained its customer service staff to be on the lookout for those donors who use keywords that indicate confusion or cognitive issues and escalate them to a higher level of service. The platform said this situation is rare and that employees do what they can to accommodate refunds beyond the standard 90-day refund window. WinRed’s website meanwhile says it “is happy to refund any donation made in error,” but notes that it can only provide refunds for those contributions made in the last 60 days. Some of the candidates and PACs who CNN identified as receiving the most money from elderly, unwitting donors said they try to work with contributors to refund mistaken donations. But many of those interviewed by CNN said it was hard to determine which campaigns to contact, especially since donations were often spread out among hundreds of groups. They usually contacted WinRed or ActBlue instead and found the process confusing, difficult and frequently unsuccessful.Karen tells CNN her mother was inundated with text messages from political campaigns, leading her to donate nearly $200,000 in the months before she died: “It&#39;s unconscionable what they&#39;ve done.” Karen, who asked CNN not to use her last name, holds a stack of her late mother’s credit card bills, almost all of which reflect charges to WinRed. Gabe Ramirez/CNNKaren&#39;s mother&#39;s now-empty house is being prepared for lease. Gabe Ramirez/CNN In the case of WinRed specifically, many said they couldn’t even figure out how to reach a representative on the phone. One frustrated son who filed a complaint with the Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office told CNN he resorted to tracking down a company intern he found on LinkedIn in the hopes of finally turning off his mother’s recurring donations. He said she had lost more than $20,000 and that after contacting WinRed and even cancelling her debit card, she continued to be charged. In Washington state, meanwhile, WinRed was quick to dismiss an 80-year-old woman’s plea for the state to investigate the platform for “senior abuse” -- saying the woman had agreed to the company’s terms of use, which make clear it provides refunds only as required by law. By the time she had filed her complaint, her money was long gone. It was up to her to reach out to the campaigns for any refunds. “With all due respect,” WinRed’s attorney wrote, “there is nothing here to investigate.” How CNN reported this storyCNN reviewed Federal Election Commission reports on hundreds of millions of contributions made through WinRed and ActBlue, the main donation platforms for Republican and Democratic campaigns. Reporters identified the top small-dollar donors who also gave the most frequently on each platform in recent years, and then reached out to more than 150 of those top donors and their family members for each platform. Based on these interviews, as well as an analysis of hundreds of consumer complaints submitted to the Federal Trade Commission and state Attorneys General, reporters identified more than 50 elderly donors who gave more than they intended, many of whom suffered from cognitive decline or dementia. Reporters also reviewed complaints lodged on consumer advocacy websites TrustPilot.com and PissedConsumer.com. Reporters reviewed data on donations made by those vulnerable donors reported in WinRed and ActBlue’s FEC filings over five years, from July 2019 through the end of June 2024. The donation amounts reported in the story do not include any refunds the donors later received, which were typically only a small fraction of the total they had given. To identify ads with pre-checked recurring donation boxes, reporters downloaded data on fundraising ads on Facebook and Instagram from Meta’s Ad Library, and also reviewed fundraising emails sent by Trump and Harris’ campaigns provided by the Archive of Political Emails, which collects emails from numerous campaigns.

That would go a long way. If we really want reform, the system should be changed from a first-past-the-post presidential system to a parliamentary system with party-list proportional representation. Neither system is perfect, but the latter captures a wider range of views within society. Germany is a stable constitutional federal republic with proportional representation and power vested in the Bundestag. No reason why the US can't have the same. reply BobaFloutist 21 hours agoparentUnfortunately, the Supreme Court has been systematically attacking all attempts to limit private campaign finance, including public funding. In 2011, in Arizona Free Enterprise v. Bennett, they ruled that a program that Arizona established which would give campaigns that opted out of private financing public financing matching their competitors financing infringed on the First Amendment speech rights of the privately financed campaign. That's right, matching private campaign spending with public funding violates the free speech of the privately funded campaign, because it removes their advantage. The solution to campaign finance needs to start and end with court reform, or it's DOA. reply giantg2 20 hours agorootparentExactly what reforms do you want? If you want first amendment restrictions you can look into passing another amendment. That's really how that's supposed to work. The logic behind the ruling is fine if you actually dig into it - funding is speech, government funding of some candidates and not others dilutes the speech of some citizens and effectively compels speech from other citizens through the government. A better approach would be restricting all political advertising to some government provided platform. This would avoid the wasteful government matching. reply everforward 14 hours agorootparentThat line of logic is utterly insane even at a glance because it argues that citizens cannot be taxed for something they don’t support. Shall we ask the DEA when they’ll be issuing refunds? “Diluting” speech is equally incoherent. The presidents state of the nation address drags people away from my Twitter feed, so the government is diluting my speech. If the argument is just that the government can’t do anything that would make a citizen less heard, the government ceases to function because practically everything they do is more consequential than any citizens opinion. The First Amendment doesn’t even say anything about being heard. It is a right to speak, not a right to be heard. Funding a candidate does not remove the right or ability for other candidates to speak. > A better approach would be restricting all political advertising to some government provided platform. This is not even close to passing even a cursory First Amendment analysis. Telling people they can’t advertise on Facebook/Google/etc is absolutely a First Amendment issue. It is literal speech, and the right to express it is abridged by location. This will never happen without an amendment. reply giantg2 18 minutes agorootparent\"This will never happen without an amendment.\" When did I ever argue that it should? The main flaw with the funding match is that campaign spending is already very wasteful and we shouldn't be trying to match that waste with tax dollars. But you could go read Davis and the other case history about the undue restrictions and how a candidates own speech is constrained by matching schemes. reply ETH_start 15 hours agorootparentprevThe better solution is to continue respecting the First Amendment and not trying to restrict in any way, political speech, and instead reforming the electoral system so that the volume of speech one is able to output through the expenditure of financial resources does not have an impact on election outcomes. reply giantg2 15 minutes agorootparentHow so, and how is that different than my proposal in other comments? reply ETH_start 15 hours agorootparentprevThe Supreme Court is defending the First Amendment, and \"court reform\" is a euphemism for eliminating the independence of the judiciary in order to dismantle those First Amendment protections. reply SauciestGNU 5 hours agorootparentSupreme Court justices are taking bribes to deliver outcomes their cronies want, and \"court reform\" is a euphemism for holding justices selling our country accountable. reply consteval 44 minutes agorootparentprevI think even the most conservative of conservatives couldn't really argue our Supreme Court is defending the First Amendment. There's no speech restriction here - rather it's an attempt to further enrich the establishment by ensuring only career politicians and the ultra-rich can campaign. If anything, this is a speech restriction, because I do not have the ability to have my own campaign speech. reply samatman 21 hours agorootparentprevThat was a good decision, because the rule creates a negative responsiveness paradox. Spending money to support your preferred candidate should not make opposing candidates stronger. That was the effect of Arizona's rule: money spent to promote a candidate was matched by free public money, which the opposing candidate did not have exert any effort to obtain. Good voting systems minimize this effect. The US first-past-the-post system is not a good voting system, but that's no excuse for making it worse. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_responsiveness_parado... reply cbsks 20 hours agorootparentWhy should money be involved in supporting a candidate? Doesn’t the democratic action of voting do that? reply pc86 20 hours agorootparentYard signs, phone calls, websites, GOTV operations, consultants, debates, mailers, all of these things cost money. The current system requires you to appeal to donors with a winning message to get contributions to pay for these. Who decides which candidates get limited public funds? Are you just going to split it equally between whoever runs? Why should the public pay for fringe campaigns that won't get any votes? reply kelipso 20 hours agorootparentUsually you do a poll and set a threshold for funding, like 5% or something, to avoid funding fringe candidates. reply pc86 20 hours agorootparentprevSCOTUS doesn't \"attack\" anything. They issue a ruling based on law. It's funny that any time there's a judicial ruling we like, it's fair and impartial, and any time there's a judicial ruling we don't like, it's judicial activism. The other reply already makes it pretty clear why this Arizona's law violated 1A. If you want to make a legal argument that donating money to a political campaign isn't political speech, go for it. But right now it's considered protected political speech so this ruling makes perfect sense. \"Court reform\" is a funny way of phrasing \"ignoring the Constitution.\" This isn't even a partisan issue. Harris has been on the ballot 4 months and her campaign has raised approximately 3x the amount of money Trump's has. Moneyed interests are absolutely on the side of Harris this time around. reply zaptheimpaler 20 hours agorootparentThe Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade 2 years ago and the Chevron doctrine recently. Do you think these judgements were both supported by the constitution when they were made and also not supported by the same constitution when overturned? Which one was the \"ruling based on law\"? If there was a straight deterministic line from the laws to the rulings the court make, we would need far less courts or lawyers or highly trained judges. The fact is there are a million laws and precedents with 100 applying to any given situation in slightly different ways with many interpretations. Laws are written vaguely to keep them somewhat future-proof and leave room for interpretation/evolution. The courts do have a lot of power here. reply pc86 5 hours agorootparentIt was Chevron deference that was overturned and it's a very important distinction. The only thing that changed was that courts were required to give deference to the agency interpretation of a statute. Now the agency needs to prove they're not misinterpreting the statute. That seems like a good change, no? Having to prove you're right in court instead of the judge being required to just assume you're right unless they're overwhelming evidence to the contrary? reply consteval 39 minutes agorootparentIt seems like a good change if you're a Helen Keller impersonator. To anyone not blind and deaf, we understand the intention of that ruling is to cripple the agencies as much as possible. That is, and has been, conservative political policy. If you're conservative and ideologically opposed to the notion of the bureaucracy in general then it's a good change, because now they are much weaker. The fatal flaw you're making here is that courts are impartial. No, the intention of this overturning is such that rules which are obviously correct can still be challenged, delayed, and even killed by conservative courts. It takes even a cursory glance at the courts in Texas to understand this is the case. There're two aspects to law: what it says, and how it's practiced. What it says is that overstepping agencies must now prove they are following the laws as set by Congress. In practice, this means agencies will be blocked by extremely ungenerous conservative interpretations of law such that they cannot enforce common-sense regulations, with the intention of further empowering the private sector. reply ETH_start 15 hours agorootparentprevLater rulings supersede previous ones because later rulings review their precedents and will correct mistakes that they identify in their precedents, so if a later ruling found those earlier rulings incorrect in their application of the law, we assume there was in fact a misjudgment in those older rulings. The justices provided legal reasoning in overturning Roe vs Wade and the Chevron doctrine, and unless you find some glaring mistake in that reasoning, the default assumption should be that the rulings to overturn these doctrines were legally sound. reply consteval 36 minutes agorootparentThis completely ignores the political motivations for rulings. In my opinion, a person who does not at least try to address the obvious partisanism of our current court is not worth listening to. Please keep in mind some justices have gone as far as recommending revisiting rulings on same-sex marriage and interracial marriage. We cannot continue to play stupid. reply gottorf 20 hours agorootparentprev> It's funny that any time there's a judicial ruling we like, it's fair and impartial, and any time there's a judicial ruling we don't like, it's judicial activism. It is funny, but at the same time I absolutely believe that in many cases it's possible to distinguish between judgments of the activist kind and those that aren't. Critics of SCOTUS should keep in mind that they agree unanimously more often than one might think. In fact, it's the modal outcome over all terms, with roughly third of all cases decided unanimously. IIRC 7-2 or more one-sided rulings (meaning more concurrence between all justices) occur roughly four-fifths of the time. reply jgalt212 20 hours agorootparentprevTruth.

Said status quo means that every stupid nitpick of federal law winds up getting fought tooth and nail over. reply gottorf 20 hours agorootparentprevThat states' rights were used to fight for the right to maintain slavery does not mean that the concept of states' rights is wrong. It is slavery that is wrong. reply consteval 34 minutes agorootparentBut the unintended consequence is that we were forced to weaken states' rights, so that we could abolish slavery. We could not have federally abolished slavery if we did not first give the federal government the power to do that. Unfortunately, the union had to take that power by force. reply Dylan16807 18 hours agorootparentprevIt's more that states don't really do things better than federal. reply rat87 19 hours agorootparentprevIt was also used as an argument to fight for Jim Crow laws.

It's usually something gross and regressive, like wanting to mandate Christian doctrine as law, or to reintroduce racial segregation or to send all the gays to conversion therapy. Otherwise it would be something normal they could just, you know, pass a law about. Because states do have rights, they just don't have absolute sovereignty. reply gottorf 1 hour agorootparent> Because states do have rights, they just don't have absolute sovereignty. This would be more meaningful if the federal government wasn't involved in everyone's lives to the degree that most people's idea of state sovereignty ends at issuing driver's licenses and license plates. In general, a call for \"states' rights\" is a call for the federal government to act in line with the supreme law of the land that is the Constitution and restore the concept of \"laboratories of democracy\" that states ought to be. Instead, what we have is a federal government that supposedly has the legal authority to regulate activity that crossed no state boundaries and harmed no one[0]. > wanting to mandate Christian doctrine as law, or to reintroduce racial segregation or to send all the gays to conversion therapy I'm not aware of any recent efforts at the state level, at least more seriously than someone trying to make the papers in a primary election, to achieve such goals.

The difference between the “ruling class” and you is that politicians know what it takes to get support from large donors. A typical Senator spends most of their day figuring that out in fact.

One way to swing the balance back would be to make support contingent on support for (and accomplishment of) popular goals. reply pc86 5 hours agorootparentAs long as people see their chosen political party as their hometown sports team and the other political party as a bunch of demonic goblins looking to murder and imprison them and their families, that will never happen.

The analogy falls apart if said felony conviction is unjust or otherwise has no bearing on one's ability to lead the military.

As long as you intend to apply that across the population. But if you're saying \"A bunch of people don't like this particular conviction against this particular person, so we should have a separate standard for him,\" well that not how the rule of law works. reply gottorf 1 minute agorootparentIf we're talking about the rule of law, there is no law against a convicted felon from either being elected President or being the commander-in-chief. There is only the irony (as the GP brought up) of someone who cannot legally possess a firearm being in charge of the military, but neither irony nor hypocrisy is yet illegal. So I see no problem here. Is your point that a convicted felon should be legally barred from holding office? Then there is a straightforward legal process to achieve your goals. However, I caution you that politically motivated prosecutions have existed before Trump and will exist after, and that there's probably a better reason than mere oversight that the Constitution places so few limits on who can be voted President. kelipso 19 hours agorootparentprevWhat is a presidential pardon then?

The case he has been convicted of 2. The cases that are still in progress 3. Many things he hasn't been charged with yet. But if you want to do so I'll try to listen.

But I don't blame you for the mixup there's so many crimes people may have trouble confusing them. reply gottorf 17 minutes agorootparent> The case you listed isn't even the case he has been convicted of so far The source I cited refers to Trump's \"hush money\" convictions (over falsifying business records), which to my knowledge is the only criminal case that went through to the end of a trial and resulted in a felony conviction[0]. Is this untrue? > an honest nonpartisan case arguing that Trump is not guilty The argument is that the prosecution of these cases is partisan to begin with; that is, no one not named \"Donald Trump\" would have been prosecuted for the same matters on hand to the same degree. Obviously neither I nor anybody else can prove this claim, so you be the judge. MLK Jr. was legally harangued throughout his life, with many arrests and two felony indictments. In 1960, he became the first person in Alabama to ever be charged with felony perjury over tax returns. Are we to believe that he really was the first Alabamian to cheat on taxes? Had he been convicted, would you seriously believe that justice had been served, or would you instead think of the whole thing as partisan lawfare? Imagine this scenario: you see a line of cars on the highway all going 20 miles an hour above the speed limit, but only one gets pulled over. You have reasons to suspect that it's because the local sheriff doesn't like the driver, but you have no means of proving that. The logical counterarguments could be A) the officer happened to only see him; B) everyone was observed to be speeding and if the sheriff's department had more resources, then everyone would have been pulled over, but out of practical necessity only one car could be pulled over and it happened to be him; or C) actually, it was in fact just him who was speeding and nobody else. I don't find any of those to be persuasive in Trump's case.

This includes running primaries through State election apparatuses and laws governing primary selection processes. I’d be okay with zeroing out contributions to individual candidates and limiting political contributions exclusively to political parties to dole out to their members as they see fit, even if that required a constitutional amendment, but not with public money.

People that are good at public relations and communications can directly do political activism, while people bad at that and good at something else can use money generated from what they are good at to hire or support someone to do political activism for them. So forbidding money in political activism is just gatekeeping political activism to people good at public relations. reply SllX 18 hours agorootparentprev> Dollars represent disproportional ability to influence who has power. People with a lot of money already possess both, which is why I am perfectly content with people who have money to spend their own money. > Attempts to nudge candidates ability to win are antithetical to our value of egalitarianism. In that case, would you also support prohibiting people from spending their private time or using their public speech to influence election outcomes? No more volunteers, only paid workers funded by the State? The influence of dollars alone on the outcome of an election is already overvalued. Michael Bloomberg already engaged in the grandest experiment to prove that money really can’t buy political office and depending on your point of view here, either succeeded fantastically in that goal or failed miserably in his own goal in what was fundamentally an own goal. It’s also utterly naïve to think that by attempting to resource constrain elections by funneling money through the State to redistribute to campaigns that you will succeed in capping the real economy around election campaigns and prevent the State from giving the ultimate incumbent advantage and using its own official functions to influence the outcome of elections. More than likely you would just be hiding most of the activity around a campaign inside the State itself. The game doesn’t change just because you’re spending public or private money: your goal is to get people to fill out their ballots and submit them in your favor. What changes is whether it is private individuals, from small dollar donors to billionaires deciding how to spend their money (as is their right in all areas of life!) or the State deciding how they are going to spend other peoples money for them, which you know, speaking of, that is a mockery of decency. > Let's just close up shop and vote with dollars like we shop for shoes. So let’s not and say we didn’t. The cost of converting dollars into real votes is high and plateaus. The actual spending is an entire economy supporting the salaries of campaign staff and paying contractors and advertising firms which I am okay with. I’m even okay with putting additional constraints on who can raise money and in the case of local elections, Senate and House seats, from where locking out foreigners and interstate donations entirely changing the shape of that entire economy (provided an appropriate Constitutional amendment is agreed upon and passed), but not one red cent should be coming from a local, State or the Federal Treasury.

You can do it too! In the State of California where yours truly is domiciled, changing your party registration is easier than changing your underwear so if there’s a particular party whose primary you want to vote in for whatever reason, that’s a thing you can just do with absolutely no cost to you whatsoever. You don’t need any buy-in. If political parties are going to be a thing, and we’ve accepted that they’re just going to be a thing for over 200 years and counting, then there needs to be some buy-in for people running under their banner and proportionate institutional influence from the leaders and rank-and-file of the organization flying that banner. Given freedom of association is a thing, parties are not going to go away no matter what you try and do to constrain them, so I’m okay with them also being a focal point around which people qualify for the ballot and secure donations and staffed time to run for office since that is what they are there for. Real party turnover used to be higher. Parties would either fall out of favor and die and be replaced, or they would face credible risks from smaller parties and work to absorb them into their ranks by taking in the issues that energized them. Right now they’re functionally just an identity group, and that makes them both fragile and dangerous since their name still means something to voters, but their party functions do not command the premium they used to. reply maxerickson 17 hours agorootparentI don't care about what the organizations decide to do, that's their private business. The states shouldn't be offering them the ability to put up a candidate using a separate mechanism. So for instance, in that scenario, the backup strategy is for there to be several candidates aligned with the organization that seek ballot access, and then the organization can endorse one of them to try to concentrate votes. Versus the situation now where the organization can name their candidate later in the process and ensure that votes are concentrated. This would of course make things worse for 2024 Harris, but probably not to the extent that they would have for 2016 Trump. reply SllX 17 hours agorootparentJust so I understand because I think I might be misunderstanding you, are you against the States executing primaries on behalf of the parties, or are you against the parties gating candidates from also being on the general ticket under their name, or both? reply maxerickson 16 hours agorootparentThere shouldn't be ballot access for a party nominee.

I still don’t think the States should be executing party primaries or running the party registration process, but I do live in a a locality with numerous officially non-partisan offices with elections that are exactly what you describe and it isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. I would describe it as basically a charade. reply maxerickson 15 hours agorootparentI don't see how non partisan offices relate to what I'm saying. I don't care if candidates are endorsed by parties, claim to lead parties, whatever, I think that it is not a net benefit that established organizations play by rules that consolidate their power, that it's worth the mess for the system to not work in that direction. reply SllX 13 hours agorootparentOkay, well candidates already have to qualify for the ballot on their own. Being the party nominee doesn't except you from all the paperwork and petitioning that is required in pretty any jurisdiction I know of in America. Even Presidential candidates already have to qualify on a per State basis, but they have large campaigns, campaign staff in volunteers in each State that are willing to go to bat for them and dot the necessary i's and cross the necessary t's. Party machinery helps with this, but is insufficient on its own. The main reason you don't see more people running as candidates outside their Party is because of Party discipline and the sheer cost of running national campaign. Third parties can tread water qualifying for each ballot as they come up in some States, but they have no real media presence because they're not effective at creating a real presence for themselves (and it is often off-putting in the years they can, yeah, parties can get worse). People running outside their party as independents would be putting their political careers on the line by doing so, and not because of any kind of benefit or privilege in the law that favors parties specifically; it's because by doing so they are actively sabotaging their party's chances of winning that seat and parties don't want to keep people like that in their ranks. Add on top of that that it is expensive to even try, and it's just not worth it, although candidates that can raise more money on their own can shrug some of that party discipline off when it's a case of the party needs them more than they need the party, it's still not the norm. As far as partisan vs non-partisan offices go, the only distinction to a voter reading their ballot is whether or not the candidate's party affiliation is listed in the text box. There is no other functional difference that matters.

Going off my own list: $100/m phone bills when $15/m ones are available (even less, because employee discount!)? Well, it's more convenient (it wasn't, it was just money getting shoveled into the trash). Eating out at lunch? Making food is a chore (actually, stew pots are your friend, Panda Express is not). $200/m for a storage unit isn't reasonable. Neither is a new car note. Overspending on insurance. Monthly media subscriptions. On and on. You don't realize it until the money simply isn't there anymore, and you're forced to make cuts. And it's at that point that you realize, \"Dang, I could have had a lot less stress now if I'd been more vigilant about spending money I didn't need to - if I'd just known better - then.\" But the entire economy essentially encourages and then preys on your apathy and lack of knowledge.^1 By the time you see what's going on, it's too late.

Maybe I should set up some kind of network wide ad blocking for them but in general I try not to be intrusive on how they run their lives.

The other thing you might do is have their banking and credit card accounts set up to email you transaction notifications - that's obviously more intrusive, but it should let you catch repeating suspicious transactions. reply saltcured 21 hours agoparentprevHaving seen both of my parents develop dementia at different rates, I'll say that yes it does sneak up. There wasn't a clear day where yesterday they were self-sufficient and now they are not. It is natural for the sufferer to develop coping mechanisms hide problems from themselves and others. The problems have to grow until the coping mechanisms start to collapse, and then suddenly they are much more evident. Another aspect is the child's denial. It is a significant shift in your worldview to see a parent go from being self-sufficient to dependent. To recognize the myriad day to day functions you took for granted that now require a caregiver's involvement. Also, the cognitive problems do not develop as a slow and continuous trend. There are different cycles overlaid with seasons, illnesses, and even time of day. So you see fluctuations in their capacity and returning moments of lucidity and function help sustain denial. I've heard it said, and I agree, the process of caring for someone with dementia includes a grieving process with all the complexities that ever has. You are watching many layers of the person die, sometimes over and over. At times you are faced with the living husk of the person you remember. Or worse, a strange subset of their prior personality traits and memories. It can take a crisis to force the issue, if families get stuck in denial. Sadly, this also makes later caregiver arrangements more difficult. As far as I can tell, the happiest dementia sufferers seem to be ones who were able to transition into a supportive care environment before they progressed too far, so they had the capacity to adapt and familiarize themselves to new routines. Those routines help them cope in later phases. Those who go down kicking and screaming may be stuck with a care environment that seems (to them) threatening and disorienting. reply ryandrake 20 hours agorootparentEveryone really needs to have an up-to-date Power Of Attorney Directive and a trusted agent who can act on their behalf once they lose their cognitive ability and financial judgment. reply saltcured 18 hours agorootparentYes, and also a medical advance directive in most jurisdictions where that is separate from a legal/financial POA. reply rawgabbit 19 hours agoparentprevThis is from experience.

    "originBody": "7 MIN READ The Dawn of a New Era for Supernova 1987a NASA Hubble Mission Team Goddard Space Flight Center FEB 24, 2017 ARTICLE Three decades ago, astronomers spotted one of the brightest exploding stars in more than 400 years. The titanic supernova, called Supernova 1987A (SN 1987A), blazed with the power of 100 million suns for several months following its discovery on Feb. 23, 1987. Since that first sighting, SN 1987A has continued to fascinate astronomers with its spectacular light show. Located in the nearby Large Magellanic Cloud, it is the nearest supernova explosion observed in hundreds of years and the best opportunity yet for astronomers to study the phases before, during, and after the death of a star. The video begins with a nighttime view of the Small and Large Magellanic clouds, satellite galaxies of our Milky Way. It then zooms into a rich star-birth region in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Nestled between mountains of red-colored gas is the odd-looking structure of Supernova 1987A, the remnant of an exploded star that was first observed in February 1987. The site of the supernova is surrounded by a ring of material that is illuminated by a wave of energy from the outburst. Two faint outer rings are also visible. All three rings existed before the explosion as fossil relics of the doomed star’s activity in its final days. NASA, ESA, and G. Bacon (STScI) To commemorate the 30th anniversary of SN 1987A, new images, time-lapse movies, a data-based animation based on work led by Salvatore Orlando at INAF-Osservatorio Astronomico di Palermo, Italy, and a three-dimensional model are being released. By combining data from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope and Chandra X-ray Observatory, as well as the international Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), astronomers — and the public — can explore SN 1987A like never before. This Hubble Space Telescope image shows Supernova 1987A within the Large Magellanic Cloud, a neighboring galaxy to our Milky Way. NASA, ESA, R. Kirshner (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation), and M. Mutchler and R. Avila (STScI) This time-lapse video sequence of Hubble Space Telescope images reveals dramatic changes in a ring of material around the exploded star Supernova 1987A. The images, taken from 1994 to 2016, show the effects of a shock wave from the supernova blast smashing into the ring. The ring begins to brighten as the shock wave hits it. The ring is about one light-year across. NASA, ESA, and R. Kirshner (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation), and P. Challis (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics) Hubble has repeatedly observed SN 1987A since 1990, accumulating hundreds of images, and Chandra began observing SN 1987A shortly after its deployment in 1999. ALMA, a powerful array of 66 antennas, has been gathering high-resolution millimeter and submillimeter data on SN 1987A since its inception. \"The 30 years' worth of observations of SN 1987A are important because they provide insight into the last stages of stellar evolution,\" said Robert Kirshner of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation in Palo Alto, California. The latest data from these powerful telescopes indicate that SN 1987A has passed an important threshold. The supernova shock wave is moving beyond the dense ring of gas produced late in the life of the pre-supernova star when a fast outflow or wind from the star collided with a slower wind generated in an earlier red giant phase of the star's evolution. What lies beyond the ring is poorly known at present, and depends on the details of the evolution of the star when it was a red giant. This scientific visualization, using data from a computer simulation, shows Supernova 1987A, as the luminous ring of material we see today. NASA, ESA, and F. Summers and G. Bacon (STScI); Simulation S. Orlando (INAF-Osservatorio Astronomico di Palermo) \"The details of this transition will give astronomers a better understanding of the life of the doomed star, and how it ended,\" said Kari Frank of Penn State University who led the latest Chandra study of SN 1987A. Supernovas such as SN 1987A can stir up the surrounding gas and trigger the formation of new stars and planets. The gas from which these stars and planets form will be enriched with elements such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and iron, which are the basic components of all known life. These elements are forged inside the pre-supernova star and during the supernova explosion itself, and then dispersed into their host galaxy by expanding supernova remnants. Continued studies of SN 1987A should give unique insight into the early stages of this dispersal. Some highlights from studies involving these telescopes include: Hubble studies have revealed that the dense ring of gas around the supernova is glowing in optical light, and has a diameter of about a light-year. The ring was there at least 20,000 years before the star exploded. A flash of ultraviolet light from the explosion energized the gas in the ring, making it glow for decades. These images, taken between 1994 and 2016 by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, chronicle the brightening of a ring of gas around an exploded star. NASA, ESA, and R. Kirshner (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation), and P. Challis (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics) The central structure visible inside the ring in the Hubble image has now grown to roughly half a light-year across. Most noticeable are two blobs of debris in the center of the supernova remnant racing away from each other at roughly 20 million miles an hour. From 1999 until 2013, Chandra data showed an expanding ring of X-ray emission that had been steadily getting brighter. The blast wave from the original explosion has been bursting through and heating the ring of gas surrounding the supernova, producing X-ray emission. In the past few years, the ring has stopped getting brighter in X-rays. From about February 2013 until the last Chandra observation analyzed in September 2015 the total amount of low-energy X-rays has remained constant. Also, the bottom left part of the ring has started to fade. These changes provide evidence that the explosion's blast wave has moved beyond the ring into a region with less dense gas. This represents the end of an era for SN 1987A. Beginning in 2012, astronomers used ALMA to observe the glowing remains of the supernova, studying how the remnant is actually forging vast amounts of new dust from the new elements created in the progenitor star. A portion of this dust will make its way into interstellar space and may become the building blocks of future stars and planets in another system. These observations also suggest that dust in the early universe likely formed from similar supernova explosions. Astronomers also are still looking for evidence of a black hole or a neutron star left behind by the blast. They observed a flash of neutrinos from the star just as it erupted. This detection makes astronomers quite certain a compact object formed as the center of the star collapsed — either a neutron star or a black hole — but no telescope has uncovered any evidence for one yet. Astronomers combined observations from three different observatories to produce this colorful, multiwavelength image of the intricate remains of Supernova 1987A. NASA, ESA, and A.

But I do worry a bit about Flock, which is extraordinarily popular (for some good reasons and some bad ones). I've posted here before about this, but: we did a give-to-get in my local municipality. The police (and voters), concerned about a wave of carjackings, wanted a Flock deployment. Activists opposed the cameras. There was a board fight, which came down to a tie-breaking vote from the board president. In exchange for a pilot deployment of Flock, we ultimately: * Disabled automatic sharing of Flock data to out-of-state entities (I tried getting sharing disabled altogether, but we solved a murder with shared access to another muni's cameras) * Revised the police department's General Order regarding ALPR cameras to get a bunch of privacy/security stuff added (mandatory 2FA, use exclusively from PD computers, monthly audits of Flock stops, etc). The General Order we approved also forbade the use of Flock cameras for non-violent crimes. * Got the ACLU's CCOPS model ordinance enacted, which mandates board approval of any new surveillance technology --- we're the first muni in Illinois to do that (put us on your silly maps, ACLU!), and, finally * Forbade the police department from using Flock to stop \"stolen\" cars (the Illinois \"hot list\" of stolen cars is surprisingly bad, with months sometime passing after cars reported stolen being removed when it turned out they weren't); we instead monitor for stolen license plates (for which there are no innocent explanations). None of this is perfect. The activists certainly aren't happy! On the other hand, we probably have the most tightly restricted ALPR deployment in the country, and we were up against an electorate that, if it had to choose between no cameras and 5x as many cameras with zero restrictions, would have sided with the cameras.

I rarely say this, but we need legislation. reply rtkwe 2 hours agoparentI do really hope some day we get legislation that recognizes the data broker hole in the 4th Amendment. IMO if the information would require a warrant/subpoena to get if the police collect it it should require a warrant for them to purchase the data from a 3rd party. reply sbuttgereit 1 hour agorootparentI actually hope that we __don't__ get a law. What I hope is that cases like this succeed in getting the precedent and recognition that we already have a law that prohibits systematic data collection and use like this: the 4th Amendment. Accepting the premise that the 4th Amendment doesn't apply here is to accept the very premise that allows governments to try this sort of thing. The courts making clear that the 4th Amendment should be interpreted broadly and that it doesn't matter how novel your surveillance/search methods are to that end is ultimately superior to playing legislative whack-a-mole. reply rtkwe 34 minutes agorootparentI think a law is more likely before the Supreme Court does anything close to patching that loophole. reply potato3732842 1 hour agorootparentprevThere isn't even a hint of extending \"papers and effects\" to \"digital stuff held by a 3rd party\" yet. I wouldn't hold my breath. But yes, it's a massive oversight and should be closed. But it won't be because the government benefits soooo much from being able to scrutinize any person's past metadata going back god knows how long on a whim. And speaking of \"going back god knows how long\". I hope I'm not the only one who noticed that in the whole Fani Lewis Georgia thing they at one point introduced 10yo (!!!) cell location data as evidince in court like it was nothing and normal evidince to have on hand. I forget which side introduced the data or what the \"sides\" even were in that case but imagine having to defend your cherry picked whereabouts a decade ago from a prosecution team who's already built a narrative about them. reply rtkwe 1 hour agorootparentI could see the courts or legislature taking action on things like location data tracking and some other stuff but I'm not super hopeful on that much less the kind of metadata generated by calls and what not. Ideally both would be covered but I think the former might get some protection before things like call or contact metadata. reply cortesoft 1 hour agorootparentprevI feel like if we don't like the government buying this data from a broker, we should make laws that make it so NO one can buy that data from a broker. reply rtkwe 1 hour agorootparentTrue that's an ideal outcome, given the option though I'd at least block the government from having it. reply lancesells 1 hour agorootparentprevI would much rather they pass laws that you can't acquire, indefinitely hold, or sell the data. Meta and Google should not know where I went for breakfast if I didn't use their services to get there. reply observationist 1 hour agorootparentprevThe nearly unlimited acquisition of private data should be tightly regulated, ephemeral by default, require total transparency in disclosure to any party for any use. Any time any ad or government agency or private individual obtains your data, you should be notified at the expense of the entity obtaining the data. Everything should be proactive and favor the rights of individuals. Not following regulations should be lethal to corporations, disincentivizing the mindless global surveillance apparatus we have now. reply abeppu 1 hour agoparentprevHow would it be different if Amazon does it than the current company they're partnering with? It already sounds like there's a subscription structure, which I think implies that the partner company and not the city owns and runs the camera network? > In 2023, Norfolk Police partnered with a company called Flock Safety, Inc. to install 172 automatic license plate reading cameras across town. The cameras were strategically placed to create what Norfolk Police Chief Mark Talbot referred to as a “nice curtain of technology,” which would make it “difficult to drive anywhere of any distance without running into a camera somewhere.” > Unlike traditional traffic cameras—which capture an image only when they sense speeding or someone running a red light—Flock’s cameras capture images of every car driving by, which it retains for at least 30 days. Artificial intelligence then uses those images to create a “Vehicle Fingerprint” that enables any Flock subscriber to both track where that vehicle has gone and identify what other vehicles it has been seen nearby. This makes it a little ambiguous whether the Flock subscription is for the specific added service of tracking a car around, or access to the whole system. reply sbuttgereit 1 hour agoparentprevThis suit is against the city and for its actions, not the company (Flock Safety). While Flock Safety can be used for rights violating purposes, it's ultimately the city's decisions that take advantage of that enablement and actually violate rights. The principle is what is being tested here and, should the IJ prevail against the city, that ruling would apply as equally to Amazon as it does to Flock Safety. reply EvanAnderson 1 hour agoparentprevI think we need legislation requiring government-held warrantless surveillance data, regardless of how it was obtained (via subscription or gathered themselves), to be made available as a public record. I would assume wild unpopularity with the constituency would work to curtail the use of such surveillance. If the constituency didn't balk then, at the very least, the data would be available to the public and would help balance the power dynamic with the government. reply paul7986 1 hour agoparentprevor Meta with their future Ray Bans (i love mine) could create an opt in program where each users can share in revenue from cities to have their feeds while in public recorded/archived.

But we need to quantify what a \"solve\" is: You charge someone with murder; the secondary concern is if they did it. When you read extremely high figures like 100% solves in 62 murders over two-years, one has to wonder if this is the most effective detective work ever, or they're finding any warm bodies to charge to pump the stats. As the article about this says, the national average is closer to 50%, and even that is known to contain wrongly charged and or convicted people. Do people really believe that a couple of hundred cameras in fixed public locations really improved the solve rate that much? I'm extremely skeptical. And: > 90% Michigan freeway shootings resulted in arrests with the help of Flock* > * As of July 2023, Michigan State Police reports using Flock in 90% of the freeway shootings having an arrest in all of them. So now we're using arresting people (not charges, or convictions) as our yard stick? So we're rewarding police departments for going out and finding anyone who may be loosely connected, taking away their civil liberties, in order to look better on paper? That's outright gross. Major red flag. Let's just say for the sake of argument that \"Flock Safety\" helps police find/arrest/charge legitimate suspects. There must be better ways of showing it. Also someone needs to look into Cobb County PD in Georgia for the quality of their murder charges, because that stat is more indicative of abuse than competence.* reply SoftTalker 1 hour agorootparentThere's no doubt in my mind that this sort of technology and omnipresent surveillance helps the police solve crimes. That is obviously beneficial to the rest of us. However it gets back to the old argument over trading liberty for safety. It's long been established that you don't have a reasonable expectation of privacy when moving about in public. However that precident was established at a time when tracking people en masse was technically impossible. An individual, or a place could be surveilled, but not everyone, everywhere. To my mind, such mass surveillance databases, given that they are now possible and do have some clear beneficial uses, must be protected in ways that were not necessary in the past. Warrants should be required to access the data for specific places at specific times, at minimum. And the governments that contract for these services should own the data, not Flock or other vendors. reply heywire 2 hours agoparentprevThese have been popping up all around my town in southwest Ohio reply aryan14 2 hours agoprevHow does a project like this go unnoticed?

And how often do you notice cameras? There's no constitutional right to privacy (Roe v Wade overturned, remember), it's legal to photograph people in public in that country, and doing something legal 60 times per second in 170 locations automatically doesn't make it illegal. reply shadowfacts 1 hour agorootparentThe police following one person’s car isn’t unconstitutional, but following everyone’s cars very much is. The IJ press release mentions this: the 4th Circuit (which covers Virginia) ruled several years ago that Baltimore’s near-continuous aerial surveillance was unconstitutional in part because it “ transcends mere augmentation of ordinary police capabilities.” I think there’s an entirely reasonable argument to be made that what the City of Norfolk is doing by contracting Flock to create a database of where every car has been for the past 30 days similarly crosses that line. https://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinions/201495A.p.pdf reply nkrisc 2 hours agorootparentprevExcept as the article noted previous courts have ruled that prolonged and detailed surveillance can constitute a search and is protected by the fourth amendment. reply millerm 2 hours agorootparentI'm not sure, but it's probably not too far of a stretch to call this surveillance harassment.

These actions appear legal because the person is using their official authority, but in reality, they can be an abuse of power or a violation of laws or civil rights.

For very long our justice system has operated under the principle that Law enforcement cannot catch every criminal and we shouldn't even try, instead we need to make an \"example\" out of every criminal we do catch to deter enough of the percentage of the population to make crime not a problem. This leads to aggressive prosecution [1]. Now as blowback, justifiably, we've started under-prosecuting and an overburdened (and frankly quiet quitting) police force catches no criminals, even simple traffic crime in major cities is basically not policed [2] As a resident of Oakland, California, I find this kind of technology a decent middle-ground.

Ordering all other relief to which Plaintiffs are entitled, regardless of whether such relief is demanded in this Complaint.\" You could argue that point b is a blanket ban, but in fact it's kinda limited: it asks to prohibit the city from operating the cameras, but says nothing of any other party operating them. All the other points simply ask for the city to be required to obtain a warrant, just like it would have to do under normal circumstances. reply pj_mukh 39 minutes agorootparentThe city should be able to put cameras where it sees fit (especially on public property where no one else can). I agree though that the footage should be only accessible with a narrowly definable warrant.

I'd like to be able to catch a decent percentage of criminals so as to make crime statistically pointless. That's not at all what's going to happen. I don't think we have reason to believe it's going to significantly reduce crime let alone make it \"statistically pointless.\" What it will do is, you know, conduct mass surveillance. This technology will support the policing doctrine that everybody is a criminal suspect. That means you are a criminal suspect, and the police will watch you, and if they want to, they'll stop or arrest you for something or other. You don't need to be dangerous to anyone, that's irrelevant. Just vulnerable. And this tech makes you more vulnerable.
