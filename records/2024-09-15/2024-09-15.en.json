As impressive as NopSCADlib and BOSL2 are (and OMG they are, when you consider what they have to work with!), OpenSCAD is a one-way, declarative CSG environment that essentially only outputs mesh formats. It's really not that much better than working with three-dimensional pixels. You won't really be able to analyse, iterate over or measure your models, easily build on faces, do easy chamfers or fillets, export STEP files, make use of constraint-based designs, model assemblies, or so many other things that \"CAD\" means in the 21st century. All the tools that help you do this on OpenSCAD are layers and layers of task-specific hacks and clever bodges. I totally get wanting to make models with version-controlled text files instead of GUI CAD (which can be a sort of weird battle to learn for a programmer), and I get wanting to avoid FreeCAD. I just don't really get wanting to limit oneself to such a limited concept of a 3D \"model\"! The three alternative systems I mention are all based around bindings to (or in Replicad's case, cross-compilation of) OpenCASCADE, which is a bRep CAD kernel capable of much richer interactions. It is not without its faults, but arguably code-CAD spares you from some of the inscrutability that trips up FreeCAD's interactive model. reply wiw2 18 hours agoparentI poked around with CadQuery and Build123D. The learning curve required a paradigm shifted in abstraction. That was too much. I just want OpenSCAD simplicity, but with modern programming language syntax. I ended up settling with PythonScad. I was able to hit the ground running and leverage what I already know about python within a day. It's new, but the author is extremely active and collaborative on github (https://github.com/gsohler/openscad) and reddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/pythonscad/). The author actually pushed for merging this into OpenSCAD mainline, but got gatekeeped out since OpenSCAD maintainers believed Python went against OpenSCAD's mantra of being 'secure'. I recommend PythonSCAD to anyone that liked OpenSCAD simplicity in abstraction but feel handicapped by the lack of expressiveness. reply throwgfgfd25 18 hours agorootparent> The learning curve required a paradigm shifted in abstraction. This is true! And I think that brute-force simplicity of OpenSCAD is the appeal. I am still ultimately a CAD greenhorn but it got me started, and I don't blame you. But I guess the point I am getting to is, that paradigm shift is where you really want to be. It's certainly where I think most competent programmers who want to really build in 3D should want to be. Because it unlocks the ability to reason about the shapes you're creating, within the code that creates them. You can for example place a feature in the centre of a face of an object you just created, without having to recalculate the location of the centre of the face or the normal etc. You can write code that is truly parametric with real encapsulations, and without a battery of variable definitions and calculations for every single element -- because you can reflect on what you've already made. (You can also export STEP files to other packages, import STEP files and reason about/analyse those as objects rather than meshes.) reply rollcat 8 hours agorootparentAs someone who's dabbled a little bit with OpenSCAD, SolidWorks, etc: > Because it unlocks the ability to reason about the shapes you're creating, within the code that creates them. You can for example place a feature in the centre of a face of an object you just created, without having to recalculate the location of the centre of the face or the normal etc. I can definitely see the appeal of this; would it be possible to refit such capability back into OpenSCAD's model (even if it meant breaking some backwards compatibility)? Like, you're not just executing imperative \"drawing\" operations, but the models you've created become available as first-class objects to be further referenced & poked at? reply throwgfgfd25 6 hours agorootparent> I can definitely see the appeal of this; would it be possible to refit such capability back into OpenSCAD's model This is where my understanding gets weak, but I think the answer in a practical sense is no. Not with the way that kernel works. It could be somewhat modelled on top, but then you have a layer around the kernel doing essentially the whole task of a bRep kernel. reply wiw2 18 hours agorootparentprevThankfully I have been able to do what I want to do without learning the complexity that comes with Build123d etc. Perhaps someday, but I havent had the need to get there thus far. Also: Encapsulation etc was achievable with Python, which is something I already know. PythonSCAD checked all the boxes for me without the learning curve. reply photonthug 9 hours agorootparentAnother option in this space is using python to directly generate openscad code, which is a fun exercise to sort of quickly visualize simple recursive algorithms in a 3d world and play with tilings, space filling curves, etc. of course building what amounts to a transpiler will be fun for some, or a distraction, depending on how focused you want to be on the 3d part. But openscad is a cool and minimal instruction set for such experiments, and doing this in a language with better meta programming support would be even more fun. reply WillAdams 6 hours agorootparentThat is such a popular thing that back when I was maintaining the Shapeoko wiki there was a separate section for that sort of thing and it was hard to keep up: https://web.archive.org/web/20211123185332/https://wiki.shap... I really hope that OpenPythonSCAD becomes standard and that it can harness all that energy and creativity --- in particular note that it is now possible to upload a design for sharing using it. reply msephton 4 hours agorootparentprevI find it quite surprising that you're a self-proclaimed greenhorn, but very opinionated about what apps people should be using. reply Brian_K_White 3 hours agorootparentWhatever this is supposed to be criticizing exactly, is misplaced and doesn't matter, because they are right about the limitations of openscad and the real world problems that result from those limitations. You will discover these problems while still green, and their report is corroborated by anyone else who has used openscad. You could try it yourself and discover that what they said is true. If you've tried to use openscad to model more than a cube, then you have run in to the limitations. If you have gone on to spend years building models in openscad, then you know even more limitations and problems than you did while \"green\". Even people like myself who use openscad for as much as they can because they love being able to describe an open source model in about 1k of human readable, editable, parametric, gittable text instead of several megs of xml or binary, even we will say that this is all simply true. the more experienced you are, the more you know how true it is. I will still call myself green because I will simply call myself green about almost everything as simple facet of my character, regardless how many years or how much work I've done with something. Should such people not advise others on what they have learned? Do self-proclaimed experts largely give better advice than experts, or even mere practitioners, who don't like to self-aggrandize? Regardless, in this case their statements were all sound. As someone who has spent a lot of time figuring out methods to get things done that a new user would not know yet, I have no notes on this greenorns opinions. reply throwgfgfd25 2 hours agorootparentprevIt is a reasonable point. I am a greenhorn in the sense that I've been learning CAD for my own somewhat complex, multi-part projects for three years. And I am not an industrial designer. Or a mathematician! (I am opinionated.) The point for me is that, as a relative novice, I have got past some really important hurdles recently. So I can explain the benefits of getting past them to people who maybe don't know they are there. I started off using OpenSCAD because it convinced me I'd be able to make something, quite quickly. My first two or three things were OpenSCAD things. It introduces you to stuff that isn't immediately obvious: the more complex booleans like difference of simple primitives, extrudes, lofts, sweeps, revolves. Great! I made things, I printed them, it was transformative. (There's also quite a good thread library -- Adrian Schlatter's threadlib -- that I do want to say is very helpful and I learned a lot from.) But it will likely hold back your development as a CAD user for even modestly complex things. Because you will never get access to the fundamentals of your objects -- the faces, vertexes and edges. Putting aside BOSL and the like, it leaves you stuck with a lot of increasingly complex maths, when if you could use the generated geometry you would not have to be. You would have much simpler operations relative to faces and edges. This is why I said it would be worth spending at least some time with these tools. So you know what is out there. reply RobotToaster 6 hours agorootparentprevThere's also ImplicitCAD, which can use an OpenSCAD like language or Haskell https://github.com/Haskell-Things/ImplicitCAD reply WillAdams 16 hours agorootparentprevThe amazing thing to me is that PythonSCAD is useful just for allowing access to variables and being able to write out files --- and it allows encapsulating those capabilities in \"normal\" OpenSCAD so that it is then possible to use them in a supporting tool such as: https://github.com/derkork/openscad-graph-editor see: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WillAdams/gcodepreview/mai... and the matching: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WillAdams/gcodepreview/mai... reply jcgrillo 2 hours agoparentprevThe main complaint I have with CadQuery et. al. is the API verbs are all coming from the point of view of describing bRep shapes instead of thinking about the design from the standpoint of \"how would I make this?\". I think there's an opportunity for a code-first CAD API to incorporate GD&T and manufacturability information directly as part of the modeling process. For example, if I'm making a shaft I want to describe that operation as it will actually be performed in the shop e.g.: (1) select round stock of nominal dimension X (2) cut to rough length (3) chuck in 3-jaw chuck and drill center (4) flip around in 3-jaw chuck and drill the other center (5) mount between centers (6) turn to rough outer dimension (8) turn down to add the various bosses, threads, chamfers, other details, etc... With this kind of a process I get all kinds of GD&T information for free--for example, the precision of my 3-jaw chuck determines how much larger my nominal dimension X needs to be than my target rough outer dimension to be able to reliably achieve it. So I think these APIs are coming at the problem from the wrong point of view--they're all about driving the CAD kernel and telling it how to draw abstract shapes in a computer. Instead what I want is to tell the computer how I intend to make the thing and get an estimate of what the result will look like. reply throwgfgfd25 2 hours agorootparent> So I think these APIs are coming at the problem from the wrong point of view--they're all about driving the CAD kernel and telling it how to draw abstract shapes in a computer. Instead what I want is to tell the computer how I intend to make the thing and get an estimate of what the result will look like. I have certainly learned over time that when you're looking at an object that exists in the real world, one way to start to figure out how to model it is to figure out how it -- or its injection-mould positive -- was physically made. Can it be cut with a mill? Was it glued together in parts? It absolutely is fun to try to work out how to come up with a shape subtractively from some giant primitive as if it was a block of steel. I often find myself visualising in terms of a scroll saw. I watched a couple of great videos about three-dimensional scroll-saw work and it weirdly affected my understanding of CAD! reply WillAdams 1 hour agorootparentprevIsn't that basically coding in G-code? The problem of course is that that limits one to straight lines and arc moves. Are there any really good G-code previewers for lathe work? For that matter, what is the best 3D G-code previewer which will allow one to see the surface of the cut part in 3D? I'm about to break down and buy tkcnc --- is there something better? reply jcgrillo 59 minutes agorootparent> Isn't that basically coding in G-code? No, I think G-code is too prescriptive and low level for the modelling task. What I'd prefer is some way to specify operations in a fluent, object-oriented API e.g.: round_bar = RoundBar( alloy=1018, diameter=Dimension(1*Inch, error=0.010*Inch), length=Dimension(12*Inches, error=0.25*Inch) ) 3_jaw = 3JawChuck(tolerance=0.005) between_centers = BetweenCenters() center_drill = CenterDrill(size=4) shaft = round_bar .chuck(configuration=3_jaw) .drill(bit=center_drill, depth=Dimension(0.250*Inch, error=0.02*Inch)) .unchuck() .rotate(axis=Y, degrees=180) .chuck(configuration=3_jaw) .drill(bit=center_drill, depth=Dimension(0.250*Inch, error=0.02*Inch)) .unchuck() .chuck(configuration=between_centers) .face() .turn( target_diameter=Dimension(0.750*Inch, error=0.001*Inch), length=Dimension(11.5*Inch, error=0.05*Inch, anchor=round_bar.tailstock_face()), finish=Rough ) .external_threads( class=ThreeA, nominal_size=FiveEighths_18, length=Dimension(1.25*Inch, error=0.020*Inch, anchor=round_bar.tailstock_face()), reverse=False, relief=DefaultRelief(FiveEighths_18) ) ... reply dbcurtis 21 minutes agorootparentI can see where you are coming from, and I've thought about similar ideas. But ultimately, I think this fails for separation-of-concern reasons. Describing the part is different from describing how to make the part. The same part might be sent to 3D printing for a non-functional fit prototype, sent to a prototyping machine shop to make 5 or so units on basic CNC machines that require 3 set-ups to complete it, and after a few design iterations scaled to production on a multi-spindle Swiss-style lathe that drops finished parts into the basket all night long, lights-out. Those are wildly different programs and work flows. Something like you propose might be an interesting thing to explore for creating CAM posts. The actual Gcode that your API would emit is going to vary quite a lot even within super-similar machines -- a 3+1 axis job targeting a machine with a FANUC controller is going to be pretty different from the same job targeting a machine with a Heidenhain controller. reply hereonout2 11 hours agoparentprevOn the contrary if you're a coder doing anything non-substantial and only rarely need to do some basic 3d modelling I would say definitely look to openscad! I make models for my 3d printer just a few times a year. I find it much easier to get back into openscad than remember my way around a gui or wrestle with more advanced tools. There's nothing I've not managed to make with openscad yet, though the things I have made are embarrassingly simple (yet highly functional). reply Brian_K_White 2 hours agorootparentYou CAN get things done, but there is no getting around the fundamental problems expressed here. All my models are about 50% variable declarations and 50% inscrutable equations to express the relationships between the values. Sometimes huge ternary stacks because the language doesn't allow variable changes, so you can't have simple if/else/case to have a simple concept like a default value that maybe gets replaced based on some other condition. And the lack of things like fillets is simply impossibl. The things you have to do to attain the end result of a fillet without an actual fillet function is ridiculous, and even after doing the ridiculous things, you still have a limited crap result where no matter what you simply can't actually have a fillet wherever you want, but you can compromise and get at least the ones you really need if you're willing to live with a simple design. That is not a good tool. A good tool gives you the means to express whatever you need to express. Openscad gives you the power to express cubes and spheres and hulls and intersections of those, and even that only in a bafflingly limited way thanks to the language limitations. It's not a great tool. It's a great proof of concept for a great idea for a great tool. reply throwgfgfd25 6 hours agorootparentprev> There's nothing I've not managed to make with openscad yet, though the things I have made are embarrassingly simple (yet highly functional). It is workable if you have an extremely solid grasp of mathematics, and you don't mind objects that ultimately retain the feel of the combination of a few CSG primitives. But I make 3D-printed things that for a variety of reasons are little more than rings, plates, discs, and helixes, and I've already very clearly run into situations where the face/vertex/wire model of a proper CAD package is more or less the only way to keep control over a design. reply jdevy 17 hours agoparentprevTo add, there's a new CAD kernal that is in slow development called truck [1]. Is is written in Rust and you script/make models in Rust. It doesn't have any geometric constraints though. There was a very short attempt at starting to make a GUI for truck [2] but development has seemed to have halted. There was discussion and hype about this here a couple months ago [3].

It is uncommonly well-written. reply philsnow 18 hours agoparentprev> OpenSCAD is a one-way, declarative CSG environment that essentially only outputs mesh formats This is why such a basic-seeming thing as “how do i get the bounding box for this CSG frankenobject I’ve created?” comes up again and again on stackoverflow etc. it’s apparently not possible without some hacks. I’ll take a look at the alternatives you mentioned, thanks. reply RobotToaster 6 hours agorootparentOpenSCAD is often said to be for programmers, but in some ways it's more for mathematicians. If you know the formula/code for the object, you can calculate the bounding box, but that isn't a way most programmers are used to thinking. reply criddell 7 hours agorootparentprevI’d recommend taking a look at SolidWorks. For hobbyist use, it’s $50 / year or $15 for a month. You will save yourself so much time and headaches and develop a skill that could be useful for your resume. reply WillAdams 6 hours agorootparentIf you're a U.S. (or Canadian) Veteran it's $20/year. BUT for these reduced price options, it's the educational version, and the files are watermarked, and the license precludes commercial use. That said, if your goal is to learn a CAD program and get a job --- in an industry/region which uses Solidworks_ (for some reason, CAD usage seems to be specific to either certain industries or regions, though SW is almost certainly the most widespread), that is definitely the way to go, along with a Community College course/degree and/or a training certificate: https://www.solidworks.com/solidworks-certification-program reply avhon1 1 hour agorootparentprevSiemens Solid Edge is also available in a free community edition. https://resources.sw.siemens.com/en-US/download-solid-edge-c... reply Filligree 2 hours agorootparentprevOr OnShape, which isn't quite as capable, but is free and probably easier to learn. reply junon 17 hours agoparentprevComing from freecad as my only frame of reference, even though I understand the concepts of build123d, I found it wildly difficult to express anything useful in it. Not saying it's not possible - I've seen what it can do - but even with my software background it was hard for me to really work with something that isn't based on constraints. reply throwgfgfd25 17 hours agorootparentI ultimately went the other way, and got to FreeCAD from OpenSCAD via CadQuery; it was CadQuery that helped me understand important concepts. CadQuery may appeal to you? It does have (some) early support for constraints in 2D and 3D I believe. (CadQuery and Build123D ultimately share both OCP underpinnings and viewer tooling.) reply hyperbrainer 12 hours agoparentprevFornjot[0][1] is also really impressive as a CAD kernel.

There will be no more releases for the time being. I will no longer submit pull requests for my own work. reply microtherion 17 hours agoparentprevThe alternatives you suggest look interesting and worth checking out. I certainly have my annoyances with OpenSCAD, but one reason I keep coming back to it is that many of my models have user adjustable parameters, and as far as I know, OpenSCAD is the only tool supported by the thingiverse customizer. Personally, I rather like the constraint based approach in FreeCAD and miss that a lot in OpenSCAD. reply throwgfgfd25 17 hours agorootparent> and as far as I know, OpenSCAD is the only tool supported by the thingiverse customizer I am sure you are right that this is still the case. This is a big plus for OpenSCAD. One of the alternatives I mention takes customisation to a different level that makes me hopeful.

Thank you for explaining mesh Vs BREP. reply IshKebab 13 hours agoparentprevAh these look so much nicer, thanks! OpenSCAD's willful disregard for the entire CAD industry's well established parametric modelling paradigm always annoyed me. reply WillAdams 1 hour agorootparentIf you would like to point out a library which allows one to use the \"CAD industry's well established modeling paradigm\" in OpenSCAD, I would be glad to try it out. If that doesn't exist, why not? reply ajross 19 hours agoparentprevThat is... a weird post to be making from a throwaway account. Do you work for Big OpenSCAD or something? :) But that said, this is all correct. OpenSCAD is actually an extremely limited environment and much more expressive tools exist in the same \"code-based 3D modelling\" space. reply throwgfgfd25 19 hours agorootparentThis is a totally reasonable question! I am using a throwaway to limit my HN usage, to be honest. I wish I had a better way to manage my addictive social media behaviour than torching accounts after a few discussions. But I do not. I saw this thread only because it's clearly a followup to the FreeCAD discussion the other day that I have contributed to. -- People do get oddly grumpy when you criticise OpenSCAD; there is an element of the \"I can do maths and refuse to believe CAD needs to be any more than this\" militancy about it. I absolutely don't hate it -- OpenSCAD's mere existence is what unlocked my ability to even reason in 3D, actually. But that quasi-militant tendency is holding back a fascinating, liberating software field. reply WillAdams 18 hours agorootparentThe great thing about OpenSCAD is that it makes creating models which may be described mathematically/programmatically easy. The awful thing about OpenSCAD is that what one can create in it is strongly bounded by one's facility with and fluency in mathematics. I'm curious how the new Python-enabled (I really hope it gets added in to the program itself) will affect this. reply coryrc 16 hours agorootparentThe awful thing is that you can only export triangles, so you can't make any true curves. If it was capable to true circles it would do everything I have ever needed to make. reply RobotToaster 6 hours agorootparentOpenSCAD has it's origins in 3d printing (specifically the reprap project IIRC). Most 3d printing slicers[0] and firmware don't do curves[1]. [0] Some will import them now but convert them to triangles, cura can use a plugin to convert those triangles back to G2-G3 arcs or circles. [1] at least by default, marlin has optional support for arcs that can be enabled at compile time. reply asveikau 16 hours agorootparentprevI don't understand this. You can make triangles small enough that you can't tell the difference, and define them mathematically in terms of curves..? Isn't this how any rendering will ultimately work? The primitive is triangles. reply WillAdams 16 hours agorootparentYes, but the representation as arcs allows one to defer the conversion to polylines/triangles until a later time. As an example, if doing V carving, the appearance will be smoother if the geometry is imported so as to have arcs/curves, deferring the conversion to polylines/straight line movements until the last possible moment on the machine. Arcs/Curves are also easier to work with if one needs to edit, and are more efficient in terms of representation/disk space/storage. reply ddingus 15 hours agorootparentAll true. Great comment. reply coryrc 14 hours agorootparentprevWell, you could export enough triangles to get less than 0.0005\" variance, but in practice actual CAM software will choke on it is my impression; I sent some circular objects out to be machined, but they just treated by OpenSCAD-exported files as a secondary reference for them redoing it in real software. reply ddingus 16 hours agorootparentprevThere is a big world out there beyond rendering. CAM people, for example drive numerically controlled machines and robots. (CNC machines) These machines are driven by lines, arcs, higher order analytic curves, such as the conic, and recent controllers will accept bsplines. Having path planning done with real geometric entities brings a lot of benefits along for the ride! Accuracy without a bazillion entities for the look ahead system to manage and for program buffers to drip feed (DNC) to a machine that probably does not have a large enough program memory to deal with that bazillion entities. In many cases, derivative or extrapolated curves do not convey the right shape or path or are difficult and time consuming to force conformance. We ended up with the big geometry kernels, such as Parasolid, precisely so that CAD could create a brep (boundary representation model) of sufficient fidelity to make other tasks, such as CAM and simulation, as well as derivative designs possible, practical, repeatable. Those big code bodies have so damn many man hours of development in them it is very hard to replace it all. And that means we are stuck with some things, like many operations being single threaded, which caps CAD design to be a function of sequential compute speeds. There are ways to build models to eliminate some dependencies, and the same goes for assemblies, so that multi-processing of some sort is possible. That brings our multi-core CPUs into the game. But those are hard to teach, a lot of software does not yet support multi-threading anywhere near enough to fully exploit the model work, and, and, and... In the CAD / CAM world, the primitive is the b-spline, and the surfaces it can represent. Those generate faces, trim boundaries and sets of those create boundary representation models. And still those can cause grief. They might be open, or just a surface representation. Or, they may self intersect... Basically, every edge, which boils down to a b-spline curve that matches up to another b-spline curve serving as a trim boundary of a surface, must be shared by two and only two surfaces or the model is not representative of a real world, manufacturable thing. Another great observation regarding real world objects is there are no edges, just radii, if only a single molecule big. Just an interesting and perhaps useful aside. And b-splines are constrained to conform to the properties of lower order entities, such as lines, arcs, and the like. This is a part of why wireframe entities are all called \"curves\" or \"sketch curves.\" They literally are all b-splines constrained by number and or placement of control points. reply imtringued 11 hours agorootparentprev>You can make triangles small enough that you can't tell the difference, and define them mathematically in terms of curves..? This doesn't work if you already have a mesh. You need to generate your triangles on demand from the BREP data. Alternatively you need to use tesselation, but then you need to design your models with tesselation in mind, such as people do in blender. >Isn't this how any rendering will ultimately work? The primitive is triangles. Uhm no. 3D printing and CAM do not work with triangles. The slicer and CAM software generate tool paths in gcode. Importing STEP files into OrcaSlicer/BambuSlicer gives me better quality results and better print speeds than using STL files. I have personally never understood the love for STL files in the 3D printing community for anything that isn't the result of a blender export. Like, is it really that fun to constantly export different versions of STL files set to different quality levels? Rescaling a print in the slicer is not recommended with STL. You have to re-export the model from blender where the tesselation happens. reply WillAdams 16 hours agorootparentprevI added the ability to export to arcs/circles when writing out DXFs using PythonSCAD in the library: https://github.com/WillAdams/gcodepreview See: https://github.com/WillAdams/gcodepreview/blob/main/export.d... reply coryrc 14 hours agorootparentYou call out 2d and mention mills and routers, so after reading the page I'm thinking I wouldn't be able to design a piece to be put in a CNC lathe ala the hub in the lower right of https://canev.com/cdn/shop/products/CEV5205_1024x1024@2x.png..., which has multiple holes (sometimes threaded), including threaded setscrew holes tangential to the primary axis. reply WillAdams 14 hours agorootparentNot as-of-yet --- it's 3-axis at the moment --- hoping to eventually add support for additional axis/axes.

This is something that should be avoided as it’s not clear to OpenSCAD whether the two cubes form one object together. This issue can be easily solved by always maintaining a small overlap of about 0.001 - 0.002 between the corresponding objects. This goes against the whole point of doing parametric design and should be logged as a bug. If the CAD software is unsure whether object spanning [0 to 1] and object spanning [1 to 2] are physically fused, that should be a bug. Mathematically they are fused. reply throwgfgfd25 3 hours agoparentIt's really a floating-point rounding issue. It is a bug (well, a limitation), but AFAIR from my own designs, it generally only affects the low-precision, \"fast\" preview; in the final calculation it won't be an issue.

In addition it only took 4 minutes to do it correctly in a normal CAD package [1]. OpenSCAD is cool, but it's not at all a replacement for traditional 3D CAD and I wish people would try to sell it on its strengths instead of selling it as a replacement for traditional CAD. [1]: https://youtu.be/aL5KLXNV-FI reply ddingus 1 hour agorootparentOpenSCAD is really neat! It comes at the model representation process in a very different way. In it's current form, it will never replace CAD as we know it today. People have a hard enough time breaking an object they can see into features they can draw and combine, or modify as is done today. Add in the need to work with 2D drawings, sketches, photos, and it gets a bit harder for them still. I have been training people to use CAD since the days of serious transition away from drafting boards. Very few of them would be able to author the descriptive text examples up thread. And to be fair, parametric CAD, with or without history is powerful, but hard enough for plenty of people to really struggle, but that difficulty seems a couple orders below what we are discussing here. Frankly, a better developed OpenSCAD could become a very powerful tool to be used in tandem with traditional CAD. It could even make use of the mature geometry kernels that way too. Those make more complex object and feature create actually work well because they have solutions for the almost innumerable corner and edge cases which always come up. It is possible to create things largely OpenSCAD style in some CAD programs too. NX has a variety of programming interfaces, one being essentially Visual Basic with CAD appropriate functions.[2] (NX SNAP, as I recall) You get entity create, query, rename, transform (full transform, scale, translate, rotate), modify like adding a fillet to an edge, boolean cut, join, intersect, split, add, partition... and a whole lot more! (It may not support partition, but it is supposed to for SDRC compatability, and that isn't the point anyway, so... yeah) And there is the general purpose programming environment. Useful in all the obvious ways we here know well. The main point is one can take an entirely analytical approach to model create, while also having the robust 3D and on NX 3D stereo[1] even, GUI to evaluate, debug, and all the other good CAD stuff! To me, that is the OpenSCAD strength. The team can take a peek at the tools I just mentioned, add features and Open Cascade will do way more geometry cases than people think, and now you have model and entity create that can really work for some tough use cases: --catalog parts with conditional features --simulation and or analytically driven model shapes, many of which could be used as base features to be finished into manufacturable things --coupled with an LLM trained on geometry, could result in Star Trek like plain language model create There is more. But the actual engineering, product design and manufacturing use cases are not going this way at all. It is too obtuse. People need to see, and I would argue benefit from haptics for interrogation, assembly and more. Don't get me wrong here. All the open CAD tools are awesome. Open CAD is important and we just don't have much yet, and more is better. We do not have much yet because CAD is really hard, and the robust, mature geometry kernels out there have gazillions of man dev hours in them. Open Cascade is actually quite impressive to be for how well it really does work Given the tiny fraction of dev hours it has by comparison. And what this means is CAD inertia is a problem likely an order harder than say the replace C code inertial some feel is worth doing. Best bang for the dev hour investment us to augment and compliment traditional CAD, IMHO of course! [1] All you need is a stereo capable GPU and display. I used my laptop with nVidia Quadro series and a fast Samsung 3D plasma TV for huge stereo modeling. Frankly, it was crazy good for evaluating technical surfaces and complex, think airplane internals, assembly was down right fun! Recommended and I am unsure why this is not more widely done. [2] I used SNAP to convert bitmaps into voxel objects, where each voxel was a cube, and from those, combine them into larger voxel objects that were the basis for tooling models to make the desired shape. The retro pixel look you are picturing was desired and I wish I could show the finished project. Neat! Have also used it to make plenum and manifolds driven by simulation output or area / flow equations. Both cases would be torture using the traditional CAD model create UX.

There could be many arguments why it's kinda important. Like fit to other parts in a final assembly or production complexity. But even for DIY purposes this minor adjustments would suck a lot of blood in prototype phase, it's a way more simpler to constraint it to be smooth (tangent) and forget about all tweaks needed after dimension changes. reply throwgfgfd25 4 hours agorootparentprevI have been exactly where you are right now :-) You are right on a precipice between what you know, and falling into a deep, deep trough of CAD knowledge! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_lines_to_circles You absolutely don't need to get into the maths to get value from this idea. The maths terrifies me. Just know this core concept: a tangent line meets a circle only once and is at right angles to the radius when it does. Here's why this is valuable in CAD environments that properly support it: once you know how a tangent line works, and see how a constraint-based modeller represents them, it is possible to understand how to model a whole set of smoothly rounded features that the CAD package can automatically adjust to changes made to core measurements, retaining this perfect \"join\".

We're slowly building higher-level components that allow you to specify constraints so that you can write CAD in a way that more closely mimics the design intent, rather than a bunch of calculations.

It also doesn't matter if you have a GPU. So, there's no \"best machine\" for running it - You can't compute the size of a shape, unless you know a formula for it. It's specially bad if you are dealing with texts, as you can't predict their shapes unless you're using a monospace font - It has some bugs in visualization - Even though it's on active development (you can see that in their Git), its latest release was in 2021 reply throwgfgfd25 5 hours agoparent> But of course it has a lot of cons: - It isn't multithreaded, so, it doesn't matter if you have an 32-core CPU or a single core.

Sure, multi-threading can really help make the wider application feel more responsive, and a GPU is enormously useful for high-level photorealistic rendering as an end product.

It has a steeper learning curve, but seems to be significantly more robust. https://dev.opencascade.org/ reply kiba 18 hours agoparentI think if you want to do complex things in OpenSCAD, you have to use someone's library or write your own. For example, I wrote centering code that basically work for arbitrary length, which then become a frequently used part of the codebase. Then when I faced the limitation of the centering code, I wrote more code for arbitrary subdivision of elements. I haven't extracted the new arbitrary subdivision of elements out into a module for my library, but I will eventually. reply thelastparadise 3 hours agoprevAnyone try plugging this into an LLM for text -> 3d model generation? reply WillAdams 2 hours agoparentThere is a blind user on /r/openscad on Reddit who has been trying to do that. reply randomghost1 20 hours agoprevWhat are people's thoughts on CAD generation with LLMs for OpenSCAD and other proprietary GUI-based softwares? I imagine soon we will also be able to \"autocomplete\" or \"semantically edit\" feature trees in SolidWorks, Fusion, etc. reply seveibar 18 hours agoparentThe problem with most CAD tools is they don't represent \"design intent\" or high-level components well, and I believe this is mostly due to the language's not being sophisticated enough e.g. a human says \"these holes need to be separated by 2mm\", but when we program in OpenSCAD and other CAD languages we usually specify x={-1} for one component and x={1} for the other (just an example of how design intent is being lost) When we can represent design intent well, we'll have something that LLMs can really grab hold of and build higher level components reply throwgfgfd25 17 hours agorootparent> e.g. a human says \"these holes need to be separated by 2mm\", but when we program in OpenSCAD and other CAD languages we usually specify x={-1} for one component and x={1} for the other (just an example of how design intent is being lost) What you mean there is constraints, I suppose? And yes -- there's some work to add constraints to CadQuery sketches/cqparts, but it's early. https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/assy.html https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sketch.html#constr... I suppose the logic has always been that if you control the placement of parts in code, you can build your own quasi-constraint logic to make reactive, parametric designs. And you might argue that \"having complete control over this in code\" is its own kind of \"design intent\" with its own potential justifications. Specifying constraints in the way the CadQuery development does may not be natural. But both CadQuery and Build123D have kernel-based tools like face finders, vertex finders etc., that are capable of things that OpenSCAD definitionally cannot do at kernel level. Replicad (a JS OpenCascade environment) has face and vertex finders, face-based sketching, etc. reply stavros 20 hours agoparentprevI made some simple stuff using Claude with OpenSCAD, it was eminently decent.

This post kind of upset me; it’s comparing totally different classes of program. SolidWorks is subscription based, so your $50 buys access this year and probably you won’t want to use the model again next year, right? OpenSCAD is free software, and that matters. Hopefully readers know it’s decades behind and very rough to use. Your example of “superpower modern CAD” could have been a whole lot simpler... probably some simple 2D geometric construction would be enough to show a big gap. SolidWorks is locked to Windows - out in the real world that might be 95% of the users but here it’s probably 50%. To finish my defense of OpenSCAD: there’s a place and an upside to all-text source and coding parameterized with traditional variables that you can change in your editor and recompile just like any other code. No GUI is only 80% bad. reply KMnO4 18 hours agorootparentYou had me tricked into thinking Solidworks was $50/year. I was about to impulse purchase a license and switch over from Fusion.

But no amount of productivity from Solidworks will make spending $3000/year be worthwhile here. reply wlesieutre 45 minutes agorootparentSolidworks says noncommercial but then gives you $2000 leeway on commercial use before you need a commercial license. I’m not sure how they square that with later saying the watermarked files you’ve created don’t work in a commercial version. And it leaves you with an awkward gap where you sell $2000 and need a commercial license, but even ignoring income tax you don’t have enough revenue to afford that license. reply kiba 16 hours agorootparentprevGenerally people who preferred niche apps like OpenSCAD preferred not to be restricted in how they can use the app. reply WillAdams 16 hours agorootparentprevIf they were, they would probably be using TinkerCAD. reply the__alchemist 17 hours agorootparentprevImagine being new to the CAD landscape. There are so many technologies, and approaches. Different resources talk about the merits of the individual techs.

Your points are all great, but I don't mind the post you're replying to for this reason. reply dgroshev 18 hours agorootparentprevFirst of all, I'm sorry I upset you! That was definitely not intended. I'm not comparing the two, I want to show what's possible. I often see people finding OpenSCAD, getting comfortable with it because it's all code, and stopping there. But there's so much more to solid body modelling, it's not too complicated to learn, and a bit more advanced CAD really expands the range of physical objects we can create! This is why I chose those slightly more complex examples, I'm not trying to gotcha OpenSCAD, I tried to show why one might want to branch out, despite all the downsides (subscription, non-code source files, Windows*, etc) you mentioned. Fwiw I dream of a good open source CAD that syncs code and GUI (like KittyCAD) but doesn't fall into the trap of \"procedural\" modelling like OpenSCAD or KittyCAD. The combination of sketches+constraints+3D operations+projections is perfectly representable as code, it's just much more work than raw CSG, requires a geometric kernel, and is more mind bending. Still, I hope we will get one some day. *: it does run perfectly well in Parallels though, so between Mac and native Windows I suspect it's more like 80% here reply exe34 11 hours agoprevi always thought I'd love openscad, being from a more coding background, but it turns out I'm not too fond of it.

PS I haven’t figured out Windows builds yet, but Linux and Mac are supported. authorfly 12 hours agoNice. I like the tiny size a lot, that's already an advantage over SBERTs smallest models. But it seems quite dated technically - which I understand is a tradeoff for performance - but can you provide a way to toggle between different types of similarity (e.g. semantic, NLI, noun-abstract)? E.g. I sometimes want \"Freezing\" and \"Burning\" to be very similar (1) as in regards to say grouping/clustering articles in a newspaper into categories like \"Extreme environmental events\", like on MTEB/Sentence-Similarity, as classic Word2Vec/GloVe would do. But if this was a chemistry article, I want them to be opposite, like ChatGPT embeddings would be. And sometime I want to use NLI embeddings to work our the causal link between two things. Because the latter two embedding types are more recent (2019+), they are where the technical opportunity is, not the older MTEB/semantic similarity ones which have been performant enough for many use cases since 2014 and 2019 received a big boost with mini-lm-v2 etc. For the above 3 embedding types I can use SBERT but the dimensions are large, models quite large, and having to load multiple models for different similarity types is straining on resources, it often takes about 6GB because generative embedding models (or E5 etc) are large, as are NLI models. reply curl-up 3 minutes agoparentI assume that by \"ChatGPT embeddings\" you mean OpenAI embedding models. In that case, \"burning\" and \"freezing\" are not opposite at all, with a cosine similarity of 0.46 (running on text-embedding-large-3 with 1024 dimensions). \"Perfectly opposite\" embeddings would have a similarity of -1. It's a common mistake people make, thinking that words that have the opposite meaning will have opposite embeddings. Instead, words with opposite meanings have a lot in common, e.g. both \"burning\" and \"freezing\" are related to temperature, physics, they're both english words, they're both words that can be a verb, a noun and an adjective (not that many such words), they're both spelled correctly, etc. All these features end up being a part of the embedding. reply deepsquirrelnet 6 hours agoparentprevGreat ideas - I’ll run some experiments and see how feasible it is. I’d want to see how performance is if I train on a single type of similarity. Without any contextual computation, I am not sure there are other options for doing it. It may require switching between models, but that’s not much of an issue. reply refulgentis 11 minutes agoparentprevIts a 17 MB model that benchmarks obviously worse than MiniLM v2 (which is SBERT). I run V3 on ONNX on every platform you can think of with a 23 MB model. I don't intend for that to be read as dismissive, it's just important to understand work like this in context - here, it's that there's a cool trick where if you get to an advanced understanding of LLMs, you notice they have embeddings too, and if that is your lens, it's much more straightforward to take a step forward and mess with those, than take a step back and survey the state of embeddings. reply warangal 4 hours agoprevEmbeddings capture a lot of semantic information based on the training data and objective function, and can be used independently for a lot of useful tasks. I used to use embeddings from the text-encoder of CLIP model, to augment the prompt to better match corresponding images. For example given a word \"building\" in prompt, i would find the nearest neighbor in the embedding matrix like \"concrete\", \"underground\" etc. and substitute/append those after the corresponding word. This lead to a higher recall for most of the queries in my limited experiments! reply deepsquirrelnet 1 hour agoparentThat’s a really cool idea. I’ll think about it some more, because it sounds like a feasible implementation for this.

This model does not perform attention calculations, or use a deep learning framework after training. You won’t get the contextual benefits of transformer models in this one. It’s not meant to be a state of the art model though. I’ve put in pretty limiting constraints in order to keep dependencies, size and hardware requirements low, and speed high.

It was trained on a tiny amount of similarity pairs compared to what we have available today. As of the last time I did it in 2022, Mini-lm can be distilled to 40mb with only limited loss in accuracy, so can paraphrase-MiniLM-L3-v1 (down to 21mb), by reducing the dimensions by half or more and projecting a custom matrix optimization(optionally, including domain specific or more recent training pairs).

Acknowledgments Introduction Bluenoroff or APT38, more commonly referred to as Lazarus Group is a threat group which has been tied to the North Korean government since as early as 2009 primarily being financially motivated utilizing malware custom built for each target. Early on, the threat group gained notoriety for cyberattacks such as Sony Pictures Hack in 2014 and $81M Bangladesh Bank heist in 2016 and in more recent years has shifted focus to targets in the cryptocurrency industry. Analytics firms such as TRM and Chainalysis release annual reports summarizing crypto related incidents linked to DPRK and since 2017 they estimate between $3B to $4.1B has been stolen. The research in this article closely follows 25 hacks targeting companies and individuals in the cryptocurrency space spanning from August 2020 to October 2023 by tracing the movements of funds to multiple accounts identified at P2P marketplaces where Lazarus Group exchanges stolen crypto for fiat. Table 0: Lazarus Group hacks from 2020–2023 covered in this article 2020 — CoinBerry, Unibright, & CoinMetro Hacks CoinBerry Incident Summary On August 24, 2020 the Canadian crypto exchange CoinBerry stopped processing withdrawals for 12+ hrs after $370K was drained from the Bitcoin and Ethereum hot wallets.

A recent DPRK report published by the United Nations from March 2024 revealed a Steadefi team member had been in contact with someone on Telegram pretending to work at a fund named “Spirit Blockchain Group” where the attacker sent a malicious file disguised as a presentation for their investment fund which the Steadefi team member downloaded.

The theory is supposed to be that you make it illegal to conceal the source of money that are the proceeds of a crime, so you can prosecute criminals for money laundering even if you couldn't prove the original crime. Which, to begin with, is pretty sus. But that also doesn't work. The criminals just set up a legitimate business as a front, claim the money came from there and the only way to prove otherwise is to uncover the original crime. So in practice money laundering is overwhelmingly charged in one of two cases. One, they already proved the original crime and tack on a money laundering charge which is pointlessly redundant because those criminals were already caught. Two, you get some innocent people who -- unlike career criminals -- don't understand how money laundering laws work, so even though they were doing nothing wrong, they do something which is technically money laundering (or triggers the false positive AI nonsense) and then get charged with money laundering or booted out of the banking system. Meanwhile large criminal organizations know how to make their transactions look like innocent transactions and then the government yells at banks for not catching them, even though the banks have no real way to do that because the criminal organizations made their transactions look like innocent transactions. This is a stupid law that does more harm than good. Just get rid of it and charge the criminals with their actual crimes. reply mulmen 13 hours agoparentprevIs there any reason to believe the Australian investment is related to money laundering or drug sales? reply shakna 13 hours agorootparentThe FATF report goes into it in more detail [0], but to put it very simply - Australia doesn't have the protections it should, when it comes to money laundering.

It’s almost subliminal how the conversation shifted reply jimz 12 hours agorootparentprevThere was also the \"white Australia policy\" though. And China is the perfect scapegoat, like NK, since they seldom make public statements, and when they do, the west tend to treat it as across the board false. But the top Area Studies scholars are not working for the government. I hang out in quite a few Chinese telegram chats (mostly sysadmins and just bullshitting - the term translates well literally but carries a slightly different connotation in that it's not falsity per se but bragging/exaggeration OR falsity, depending on context). There's a pretty general sense of neo-imperialistic motives on the part of the west and it's hard to blame them considering that for a nation that wasn't annexed it effectively had very little to no say in the administration of various parts of its territories for 160 years. Whether out of arrogance or because there's a huge blind spot (or both), this has led to missing out on numerous opportunities in effectively gain leverage on the CCP in significant ways, like getting rid of the quota system for H1-B visas so those who were on F-1s and graduate can actually stay and work in the US, or give general asylum to the protestors against the Chinese takeover of HK, a cohort that is educated, have relevant skills, speaks English, and compared to the rest of China, are relatively wealthy. The official fear of a brain drain have been around since the 1880s - the Chinese Exclusion Act was the preferred policy of both the US and Chinese governments, one that helped nobody and legitimized racism parallel to Jim Crow. One would think that we'd be over that by now. There's some chatter that there's a soft-coup since Xi haven't been leading the nightly 30 minutes of propaganda, probably for the first time since the 1980s the news, broadcast nationally, didn't lead off with some inane report of leadership meeting dignitaries. The truth is anybody's guess but an actual military coup is unlikely to occur after the Lin Biao incident. The fact that America doesn't even seem to be aware of this is telling, and in North Korea's case, even more amplified. Also, a nation-state cannot by definite launder any money since money laundering is only a thing because the state wants its cut. But here, by their theory, all of the money is going to the nation-state so... what laundering are they talking about? Theft, perhaps. Expropriation? Sure. But laundering? That makes no sense unless you internalize that America or whoever is actually the world's policeman.

It's a funny thing to say, because in this mindset there is freedom literally to do anything. Consequences come after, minutes, hours, days, years, but after and not before, at least not until OpenAI-Google's new \"PrescientCrimeCAItcher\" comes online. These \"community guidelines\" are quite frustrating because a major communication modality presently does not have freedom of speech, it has removal of speech it does not like. So that's an interesting loophole legalese-wise. Presently these are private sector companies running addicting entertaining boards from which they serve ads for profit.

Blockchains are cool in that they allow to follow the laundering (so it allows for nice blog entries with good looking graphs, which I do appreciate), as opposed to traditional banks where it's all opaque. But the amount of money laundered using cryptocurrencies is a drop in the bucket compared to size of criminal activities ongoing in the world (btw criminal activities predates blockchain by centuries or millenia).

All told, the US has spent $8 trillion and several thousand young men on the GWOT. Once the US pulled out, the Taliban strolled back into Kabul. $8 trillion will reduce the US debt by 25%, or pay off all student debt, or build 80 million $100k homes. Wasted, and the only thing you have to show for it is nothing tangible, except more vibrant terror groups, and immigrants flooding Europe. Meanwhile, 8k US veterans die by suicide yearly. You had the firepower but failed to achieve your political goals. Just like in Vietnam, Iran, Syria, Laos, Cambodia, and more countries than I care to mention.

This has the same problem plus the gross negligence of advising anyone living under a repressive government to use a financial system designed to leave an immutable trail for the police to use when prosecuting them and everyone they know. The full retroactive deanonymization is incredibly dangerous for dissidents since it allows the authorities to prosecute them for transactions they made even before they were suspected of anything. reply yieldcrv 1 hour agorootparentprevThe point is that when a government seizes crypto funds and auctions them off again, the funds are clean for legal purposes but transaction history doesn’t change, it just has an additional transaction. Software that flags aspects of transaction is nullified by the reality that it doesn't actually know that one subsequent transaction cleaned the whole trail. There are hundreds of thousands of governments around the world when factoring in municipal authorities, even governments you don't respect are cleaning funds in the eyes of governments you do respect. In the eyes of the requirements of exchanges that have these automated chain analysis practices. Right now, only a handful of governments do crypto investigations and seizures, but as this increases it only moves towards the nullifying chain analysis, as many funds will be comingled with a flagged transaction but unknown to the software about how these funds have been washed by a nation state’s blessings. reply earnesti 9 hours agoprevSo all the crypto went to paxful/noones, and was converted to fiat there.

More precisely, an eigenvector, v, of a linear transformation, T, is scaled by a constant factor, λ, when the linear transformation is applied to it: T v = λ v. It is often important to know these vectors in linear algebra. The corresponding eigenvalue, characteristic value, or characteristic root is the multiplying factor λ. Output: Eigenvectors are vectors that don't give a damn when a linear transformation tries to mess with them. They just scale up or down like they're at the gym.

We’ve learned, painfully, that for the multigenerational poor, home might be the worst enemy. Appalachian loyalty to the land is the stuff of legend, yet the stubbornness of poverty in the region means that those who stay risk being poor forever. When the government paved thousands of miles of roads in Appalachia, it hoped to provide employment for the masses and infrastructure to sustain future economic growth. But the best and most lasting effect of those roads was to give people a faster way out. If we cannot improve the urban ghetto or the mountain hollow — and the evidence suggests we can’t — then the best anti-poverty program is a ticket to somewhere else. The tool did really well at not sounding like ChatGPT! > Turns out the government's \"help\" for Appalachia mostly taught us that staying put keeps you poor.

[0]: https://slipsum.com/ reply chris_wot 8 hours agoprevChatGPT is remarkably good at removing bullshit, whereas this just gives an error. I asked it to rewrite the following: “This thesis critically interrogates how masculinist practices of breakdancing offers a site for the transgression of gendered norms. Drawing on my own experiences as a female within the male-dominated breakdancing scene in Sydney, first as a spectator, then as an active crew member, this thesis questions why so few female participants engage in this creative space, and how breakdancing might be the space to displace and deterritorialise gender. I use analytic autoetthnography and interviews with scene members in collaboration with theoretical frameworks offered by Deleuze and Guttari, Butler, Bourdieu and other feminist and post-structuralist philosophers, to critically examine how the capacities of bodies are constituted and shaped in Sydney's breakdancing scene, and to also locate the potentiality for moments of transgression. In other words, I conceptualize the breaking body as not a 'body' constituted through regulations and assumptions, but as an assemblage open to new rhizomatic connections. Breaking is a space that embraces difference, whereby the rituals of the dance not only augment its capacity to deterritorialize the body, but also facilitate new possibilities for performativities beyond the confines of dominant modes of thought and normative gender construction. Consequently, this thesis attempts to contribute to what I perceive as a significant gap in scholarship on hip-hop, breakdancing, and autoethnographic explorations of Deleuze-Guattarian theory.” It gave me: “This thesis examines how breakdancing, often seen as a male-dominated activity, challenges traditional gender norms. Based on my personal experience as a woman in Sydney’s breakdancing community—first as a spectator and then as a participant—I explore why so few women take part and how breakdancing can be a space to challenge and redefine gender roles. Using my own story and interviews with others in the scene, along with ideas from philosophers like Deleuze, Guattari, Butler, and Bourdieu, I look at how people’s bodies and identities are shaped within this culture. I argue that breakdancing allows for breaking away from conventional ideas about gender, offering new ways for people to express themselves. This thesis aims to fill a gap in research about hip-hop, breakdancing, and how Deleuze-Guattarian theory can be applied to personal experiences in this space.” reply marsovo 5 hours agoparentI got \"Yo, check it: I'm a chick who breakdances in Sydney's sausage fest scene.

    "originBody": "Google Has Officially Killed Cache Links As Google borks on one of its oldest features, the book closes on an era of the web. By Thomas Germain Published February 2, 2024Comments (7) 𝕏 Copied! Photo: egaranugrah / Shutterstock.com (Shutterstock) 25 years ago, the internet was kludged together with duct tape and a dream. Sometimes typing in a URL brought up a website. Sometimes things were just broken. Google, then just a bizarrely named startup, would soon offer a solution. The company added “cache” links to its search results, which brought up a previously saved version of web pages. Now the internet is mature, Google is among history’s most powerful conglomerates, and as of today, the cache link is officially kaput. The change, first spotted by Search Engine Land, was just confirmed by Google’s Search Liaison Danny Sulivan, the company’s go-between for SEO (Search Engine Optimization) professionals. “Yes, it’s been removed. I know, it’s sad. I’m sad too,” Sullivan tweeted Friday. “It’s one of our oldest features. But it was meant for helping people access pages when way back, you often couldn’t depend on a page loading. These days, things have greatly improved. So, it was decided to retire it.” Nostalgia for a button that a lot of people probably haven’t heard of might seem absurd, but Google’s cache function was a foundational solution to one of the web’s earliest problems. As the web transformed into a more stable infrastructure, cache was mostly abandoned by regular consumers, but it was still a useful tool. SEO workers used it to watch changes made by competitors. Journalists and researchers checked caches to keep an eye on the historical record. Some savvy internet users knew cache was a way to get around paywalls, or as a poor man’s VPN to load websites that were blocked in particular regions. But Google’s cache links have been doomed for a while. There used to be a cache button right next to blue links on Google.com, but the company moved the feature to the “About This Result,” menu where it languished in obscurity. As the Verge noted, a Google engineer tweeted that cache is “a basically unmaintained legacy feature” back in 2021. For now, you can still view Google’s cache by typing “cache:” before the URL, but that’s on its way out too. There’s another solution, but it’s on shaky ground. The Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine preserves historic copies of websites as a public service, but the organization is in a constant battle to stay solvent. Google’s Sullivan floated the idea of a partnership with the Internet Archive, though that’s nothing close to an official plan. “Personally, I hope that maybe we’ll add links to @internetarchive from where we had the cache link before, within About This Result. It’s such an amazing resource,” Sullivan tweeted. “No promises. We have to talk to them, see how it all might go — involves people well beyond me.” Google SearchSearch engineWorld Wide Web You May Also Like Tech NewsArtificial Intelligence OpenAI Hopes to Take on Google With SearchGPT The ChatGPT-like search engine ‘prototype’ will provide small natural language summaries in addition to webpage links.

Cache basically guaranteed that whatever Google thought was on the page could actually be found. These days Google will offer a result where the little blurb (which is actually a truncated mini cache) shows a part of the information I'm looking for, but the page itself does not. Removing cache means the data is just within reach, but you can't get to it anymore. Internet Archive is a hassle and not as reliable as an actual copy of the page where the blurb was extracted from. reply jfoster 9 hours agoparentGoogle used to have a policy of sites being required to show Google the same page that they serve users.

That said, there's a huge gray area.

However, it can just be a way to do what the parent commenter dislikes: render a mini-blurb unfound on the actual page. Shoot, even a meta description qualifies for that - thankfully Google uses them less and less. reply frde_me 6 hours agorootparentGoogle will reliably index dynamic sites rendered using JS. And other search engines do the same. There's really no good reason to do this if you want to be indexed on search engines. reply lelandfe 6 hours agorootparentAgreed. Yet whether it should be done is different than whether it is done. Google was recommending it in 2018, and degraded it to a \"workaround\" just two years ago.

From an end user PoV it is (was) a very useful feature, one that kept me using Google by default¹, and I think that many like me used it as a backup when content was down at source. The key problem with giving access to cached copies like this is when it effectively becomes the default view, holding users in the search providers garden instead of the content provider being particularly acknowledged never mind visited and the search service making money from that through adverts and related stalking. I have sympathy for honest sites when their content is used this way, though those that give search engines full text but paywall most of it when I look who complain about the search engine showing fuller text, can do one.

They'd go after you if you had entirely different content for google vs for users, but large scientific publishers already had \"full pdf to google, HTML abstract + pay wall to users\" 20 years ago and it was never an issue. It makes some sense, too because the edges are blurry. If a user from France receives a french version on the same URL where a US-user would receive an english version, is that already different content? What if (as it usually happens), one language gets prioritized and the other only receives updates once in a while? And while Google recommends to treat them like you'd treat any other user when it comes to e.g. geo-targeting, in reality that's not possible if you do anything that requires compliance and isn't available in California. They do Smartphone and Desktop-crawling, but they don't do any state- or even country-level crawling. Which is understandable as well, few sites really need to or want to do that, and it would require _a lot_ more crawling (e.g. in the US you'd need to hit each URL once per state), and there's no protocol to indicate it (and there probably won't be one because it's too rare). reply kaoD 6 hours agorootparent> It makes some sense, too because the edges are blurry. If a user from France receives a french version on the same URL where a US-user would receive an english version, is that already different content? The recommended (or rather correct) way to do this is to have multiple language-scoped URLs, be it a path fragment or entirely different (sub)domains. Then you cross-link each other withtags with rel=\"alternate\" and hreflang (for SEO purposes) and give the user some affordance to switch between them (only if they want to do so). https://developers.google.com/search/docs/specialty/internat... Public URLs should never show different content depending on anything else than the URL and current server state. If you really need to do this, 302 Redirect into a different URL. But really, don't do that. If the URL is language-qualified but it doesn't match whatever language/region you guessed for the user (which might very well be wrong and/or conflicting, e.g. my language and IP's country don't match, people travel, etc.) just let the user know they can switch URLs manually if they want to do so. You're just going to annoy me if you redirect me away to a language I don't want just because you tried being too smart. reply luckylion 3 hours agorootparent> Public URLs should never show different content depending on anything else than the URL and current server state. As a real-world example: you're providing some service that is regulated differently in multiple US-states. Set up /ca/, /ny/ etc and let them be indexed and you'll have plenty of duplicate content and all sorts of trouble that comes with it. Instead you'll geofence like everyone else (including Google's SERPs) and a single URL now has content that depends on the perceived IP location because both SEO and legal will be happy with that solution, and neither will be entirely happy with the state-based urls. reply immibis 5 hours agorootparentprevWhat about Accept headers? reply kaoD 4 hours agorootparentQuoting MDN https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Ac... > This header serves as a hint when the server cannot determine the target content language otherwise (for example, use a specific URL that depends on an explicit user decision). The server should never override an explicit user language choice. The content of Accept-Language is often out of a user's control (when traveling, for instance). A user may also want to visit a page in a language different from the user interface language. So basically: don't try to be too smart. I'm more often than not bitten by this as someone whose browser is configured in English but often would like to visit their native language. My government's websites do this and it's infuriating, often showing me broken English webpages. The only acceptable use would be if you have a canonical language-less URL that you might want to redirect to the language-scoped URL (e.g. visiting www.example.com and redirecting to example.com/en or example.com/fr) while still allowing the user to manually choose what language to land in. If I arrive through Google with English search terms, believe it or not, I don't want to visit your French page unless I explicitly choose to do so. Same when I send some English webpage to my French colleague. This often happens with documentation sites and it's terrible UX. reply amy-petrik-214 5 hours agoparentprev>Internet Archive is a hassle and not as reliable The paradox of the internet archive's existence is if all that data were easily searchable and integrated (i.e. if people really used it) they would not exist by way of no more money for bandwidth and by way of lawsuit hell. So they exist to share archived data, but if they share archived data they would not exist. and so it is a wonderful magical resource, absolutely, but your \"power user\" level as well as \"free time level\" has to be such that you build your own internet archive search engine and google cache plugin alternative... and not share it with anyone for the above existential reasons reply avar 7 hours agoparentprevI don't have a current example of this, but I'd just like to add that they also do this for images. E.g. images deleted from Reddit can sometimes be seen in Google image results, but when following the links they might lead to deleted posts. reply dspillett 5 hours agorootparentThat is because the image and the post are treat as separate entities, with the post providing metadata for the image so the search engine will find it when you query. Even from Reddit's sure, if the post is gone the image may remain so you could be being served that by Reddit (or third party) rather than from Google's cache (any thumbnail will come from Google of course). reply Retr0id 5 hours agoparentprevI've been puzzled by this move for a long time, since they first announced it. None of their provided reasoning justifies removal of such a useful feature. The simplest answer could be that making the cache accessible costs them money and now they're tightening their purse strings. But maybe it's something else... For sites that manipulate search rankings by showing a non-paywalled article to Google's search bot, while serving paywalled articles to regular users, the cache acts as a paywall bypass. Perhaps Google was taking heat for this, and/or they're pre-emptively reducing their legal liabilities? Now IA gets to take that heat instead... reply dageshi 5 hours agorootparentI assume it's to stop people using the cached copies as source material for LLM's. The cache is arguably a strategic resource for google now. reply Retr0id 4 hours agorootparentIf it is a scraping thing, I'd rather they added captchas than took the feature away entirely. I know captchas can be bypassed, but so can paywalls. reply amelius 7 hours agoparentprevI always wondered if it was legal for Google to store those cached pages. reply lysace 4 hours agorootparentThe killing presumably has to something do with the legal costs of maintaining this service. reply geuis 11 hours agoprevThis breaks my heart a bit. My first browser extension Cacheout was around 2005. Back in the days of sites getting hugged to death from Slashdot. The extension gave right context menu options to try loading a cached version of the dead site. Tried Google cache first, then an another cdn caching service I can't remember, and finally waybackmachine. Extension even got included in a cd packaged with MacWorld magazine at one point. This has always been one of Google's best features. Really sad they killed it. reply giantrobot 9 hours agoparent> Tried Google cache first, then an another cdn caching service I can't remember, and finally waybackmachine. Coral Cache maybe? The caches you listed were my manual order to check when a link was Slashdotted. Google's cache, at least in the early days, was super useful in the cache link for a search result highlighted your search terms. It was often more helpful to hit the cached link than the actual link since 1) it was more likely to be available and 2) had your search terms readily apparent. reply terinjokes 5 hours agorootparentI remember CacheFly being popular on Digg for a while to read sites that got hugged. reply Nyr 8 hours agoprevI am surprised that no one has mentioned the most obvious alternative: Bing Cache. It is not as complete as Google's, but it is usually good enough. reply stuffoverflow 7 hours agoparentYandex also has a pretty extensive cache, although recently they seem to have disabled caching for reddit. Otherwise it is good for finding deleted stuff, I've seen cached pages go as far back as a couple of years for some smaller/deleted websites. reply relaxing 6 hours agoparentprevThanks! I never go to Bing but I probably will now. reply accrual 11 hours agoprevI recall the links disappearing quite a while ago. It's a bummer because cached links are genuinely useful - helps one visit a site if it's temporarily or recently downed, sometimes can bypass some weak internet filters, can let one view the content of some sites without actually visiting the server which may be desirable (and maybe undesirable for the server if they rely on page hits). reply saaaaaam 9 hours agoparentThe article is from February 2024, so you probably noticed them going around the time it was published! For some reason people seem to be talking about it again as though it only just happened, I’ve seen this and similar articles/threads posted a couple of other places this week. reply romanhn 7 hours agorootparentIt's odd, because I haven't seen cache links on Google for years. I used to rely on them quite a bit and once in a while would try again and run into \"oh yeah, they seem to have dropped this feature.\" This whole thread is strange to me, sounds like they've been around for people much more recently? Or maybe moved location and I haven't found them (which is weird cause I looked...) reply terinjokes 5 hours agorootparentNot just you, I haven't seen links to the feature, even when I've gone looking for it, in years. Even the link on archive.is to use Google's cache if the page wasn't already archived hasn't worked in quite a while. reply dspillett 5 hours agorootparentprev> It's odd, because I haven't seen cache links on Google for years For quite a time they stopped being a simple obvious link but where available in a drop-list of options for results for which a cashed copy was available. reply praisewhitey 1 hour agorootparentFor some sites. For years many search results didn't have a cache link in the drop down. reply zo1 3 hours agorootparentprevNot OP, and yes they \"hid\" it that way too. But I got the distinct sense that they removed it many years ago for certain websites (and more and more over the years I guess till now). They probably had some sort of flag on their analytics dashboard that website owners were given the privilege of changing so that people couldn't see the cache. Or for all we know it was some sort of \"privacy\" feature similar to \"right to be forgotten\". reply Xenoamorphous 5 hours agorootparentprevSame here, I found this submission really odd since I haven’t seen them in years. Maybe they did some slow roll by country? reply seydor 10 hours agoprevThat was never Google's job anyway. It boggles my mind how there is very little public investment in maintaining information, while tons of money is being wasted keeping ancilarry things alive that nobody uses. We should have multiple publicly-funded internet archives, and public communication infrastructure fallback, like email. reply interactivecode 6 hours agoparentPart of the ideas behind the EU’s “very large online platform” rules. Basically saying that if your platform gets big enough where its basically important infrastructure, that then comes with responsibilities. I would welcome some rules and regulations about this kinds of stuff. Can you imagine that google wakes up one day and decides to kill gmail? It would cause so many problems. It’s already impossible that even as a paid gmail user you can’t get proper support in case something goes awry. Sure you can argue they can decide what ever they want with their business. But if you have this many users, I do think at some point that comes with some obligations of support, quality and continued service. reply seydor 6 hours agorootparentI wouldn't trust google to decide what information should be stored and what should be condemned to damnatio memoriae reply 1equalsequals1 9 hours agoparentprevWhat is Google's job?

Generally, people don’t adjust filters until people complain. After you become the number one ticket creator for mundane site requests, they’ll usually bend the rules for you or learn to adjust the policy. The reality is that people who create these filter policies often do so with very little thought, and sans complaints, they don’t know what their impact is. reply freedomben 5 hours agorootparentIf your company actually does this, that's impressive. The vast major Big corporates that I have seen do not even really review these requests unless they come from a high-ranking person. When they do actually review them, it's usually a cursory glance or even just a quick lookup of the category that their web filters have it on, followed by a rapid and uninformed decision to deny the request. Oftentimes they won't even read the justification written by the employee before they deny the request. God help you if you need something that's not tcp on port 443. Yes, I'm still a little bit bitter, but I have spent a lot of time explaining the difference between TCP and UDP to IT guys who have little interest in actually understanding it, and ultimately won't understand it and will just deny the request. Sometimes after conferring with another IT person who informs them that UDP is insecure and/or unsafe, just like anything, not on Port 443. reply lukasb 11 hours agoprev“There’s another solution, but it’s on shaky ground.

VERY rare these days a google search result actually contains what was searched for - anything with a page number in the url and cache was guaranteed to be the only way to access it.

If you have team sizes set sanely and empower devs to do what they need to do in order to accomplish the goal, they'll be fine without the management overhead of arbitrarily imposed productivity flow. Agile et al, along with 99% of the features in ticketing systems, exist to make managers feel like they are justifying their paycheck. If you are a manager and this makes you angry, you're one of the bad ones. reply loloquwowndueo 16 hours agoparentJust keep in mind that a lot of people equate Agile with Scrum, which is incorrect. Agile is about exactly what you said: empowering devs to get shit done. None of the extra “keep managers happy” crap that Scrum introduces is in any way covered by the Agile manifesto. reply 2-3-7-43-1807 7 hours agorootparent1) scrum is even more democratized than agile 2) no matter what \"agile\" was supposed to mean - managers anyway interpret it as devs having to be very agile for them all the time ... reply jrs235 6 hours agorootparentAnd by \"devs having to be agile\" you mean \"devs having to be interruptible during managers hours and flexible in doing their work after all the bs office hours are over\". reply 2-3-7-43-1807 2 hours agorootparentexactly ... i mean even without hindsight \"agile\" is a rather poor choice as the label. it just evokes the wrong ideas too easily. reply LeFantome 16 hours agorootparentprevWhat in Scrum is about keeping managers happy? reply twunde 15 hours agorootparentDaily stand-ups, the main benefit of which is that managers (EMs/PMs) get daily updates on status. Sprints themselves which promise that a certain amount of work will always get done, without any free time being wasted. A lot of the ceremonies in general are mostly helpful to the EM/PM. How many things that you're doing are actually improving how you get work done? Especially when you consider how much time is spent on these ceremonies (sprint planning 1 hr, sprint retro 1 hour, daily standup 15-30 minutes. Plus whatever prep is needed and the interruption time.) For many companies this is a 20% or more overhead that's mainly busywork because you still need the additional meetings to understand what you're working on. reply wild_egg 15 hours agorootparent> Daily stand-ups, the main benefit of which is that managers (EMs/PMs) get daily updates on status. The scrum guide fairly explicitly states that managers should not attend or be part of stand-ups unless they're actively involved in the work as part of the development team. reply Aeolun 13 hours agorootparentIt may be explicitly stated, but I’ve never had a scrum meeting without all managers and project managers. They also tend to make the stand-ups one hour long. reply repox 12 hours agorootparent> They also tend to make the stand-ups one hour long. I'm Head of Development in a midsized SaaS company. Another team's PM went for paternity leave and I stepped in to lean in on any needs. I discovered that the team of 10 people were using close to an hour a day on stand-up. A culture thing, apparently. I joined he stand-up a few times, slimmed the scope of the conversation to roughly 10-15 minutes. This worked for all three months of the PM's paternity leave. PM returns, is pissed over the change and in less than two days, the stand-up is back to almost an hour a day. reply jghn 12 hours agorootparentIt Depends. I said in another post that I hated all the ceremonies, including standup. And it goes without saying that means long standups. But, one team I was one, we had long ass standup and it was perfect. It was very dev-driven, we were facing hard problems, and that was our time of the day to really nerd out. The PM would get bored after about 15-20 minutes and then we'd be working out how to deal with the issues that faced us. Sure, it could have happened at any point of the day, but that was our designated time where we were all in the office (this was pre-pandemic) reply relaxing 6 hours agorootparentprevWhy is the PM still employed? Hasn’t the team all quit? reply gloryjulio 4 hours agorootparentprevThat's the issue where the PM has so much power. In our company the engineering team dictates their process. They can do however they like as long as they ship the products on time. reply lpapez 11 hours agorootparentprev> It may be explicitly stated, but I’ve never had a scrum meeting without all managers and project managers. This, this, this and a thousand times this. It's always the same with Scrum. Every time you point out something clearly wrong, the response is always \"well that's not really scrum, you're doing it wrong\". It's like when discussing communism with some diehard fans - when you point out the flaws, the response is always \"well that wasn't real communism that's why it failed\". Well to both of those camps I say: if most attempts ended up implementing it \"incorrectly\" in the end, it's not a very useful framework to begin with then, is it? reply wild_egg 4 hours agorootparent> It's always the same with Scrum. Every time you point out something clearly wrong, the response is always \"well that's not really scrum, you're doing it wrong\". Scrum is a victim of semantic drift. The vast majority of people \"doing scrum\" have never read the guide and are just doing things that other people have told them is Scrum. It's not Scrum's fault that people have hijacked its name for something completely different. It happens often. What people call Scrum isn't really Scrum. What people call REST isn't really REST. What people call DevOps isn't really DevOps. People using the wrong word for something doesn't mean the original definition of the word is invalid. It's fairly different from the Communism situation in that people discussing Communism are generally talking about the same concepts and the debate is whether or not they're feasible. With the other terms I used above, people are using the same words to talk about completely different concepts with different definitions. reply jjav 18 minutes agorootparent> People using the wrong word for something doesn't mean the original definition of the word is invalid. It doesn't make the original definition invalid, but words mean what society uses them to mean, which changes over time. So agile & scrum do in fact today mean constant status meetings, treating professional developers as mindless cogs and keep everyone in line with a constant stream of tickets chosen by someone else. Perhaps it's not what it meant in some idealistic manifesto lost to history, but it is what it means to developers employed in the industry today. reply roenxi 10 hours agorootparentprevThat similarity is superficial. It is observing that no ideology perfectly survives implementation - which is true, but there is no alternative option so it isn't a useful observation. We don't have any successful countries that use communist ideologies because central planning is destructive and the abolishment of private property is catastrophic. Calling for communism is tantamount to wishing for death and destruction. The path to success through communism is something like China where they eventually learned to do the opposite of communism and got great results. We do have lots of successful companies using Scrum. They hire Scrum masters. They see Scrum as adding value. The scrum ideal is generally a bit of a compass towards higher value add. So scrum as an ideology seems to be net-successful even if implemented wrong. reply carlmr 8 hours agorootparent>So scrum as an ideology seems to be net-successful even if implemented wrong. How do you get to this conclusion? I haven't seen any implementation of scrum that didn't slow down development speed, due to unnecessary meetings and micromanagement. This might be that I've only seen 8 or so \"implementations\". If there's any evidence that scrum is a key net positive I'd like to see it at this point. Kanban IME can work well if the manager understood the core principle: Limit amount of concurrent work, use daily standup to prioritize work and unblock people hitting the multitasking limit. Sadly this concept which is the core tenet of Kanban and can be explained in one sentence was still too much to grasp for some managers, but I've at least seen most Kanban implementations be either a net positive, or neutral. I might be biased by my own experience, but I still need to see a Scrum implementation that doesn't grind productivity to a halt. reply roenxi 8 hours agorootparentThe company isn't optimising for fastest development speed. They typically optimise for low variance, consistent value in support of existing processes. Interestingly, if you want highest value then for software it is best to use a high-variance strategy. But that is never going to come out of a company large enough to need professional management because it is pointless to manage large numbers of people to a high variance strategy. Google is an interesting case study where they tried that and, by and large, flopped. It makes more sense to spin out separate companies VC-style. I assume programmers occasionally quit companies, build something and sell it back to the company at extortionate prices which would be the right way to do fast development. That isn't to say professional management is bad - large companies need it. It is just a fact that large companies aren't good at development and something like scrum elevates them from total failure to unproductive but fumbling in a good direction. reply carlmr 7 hours agorootparent>scrum elevates them from total failure to unproductive but fumbling in a good direction. Where's the evidence for this? I kind of agree on big corporate not being able to achieve great development speed. But they had a system before scrum, and I've yet to see scrum not completely destroying every metric of development achievement, whether it's throughput, latency or iteration speed. reply roenxi 5 hours agorootparentThe evidence is in the company choosing scrum then sticking with it. They believe it helped. > I've yet to see scrum not completely destroying every metric of development achievement, whether it's throughput, latency or iteration speed. It is too hard to argue from vague anecdotes, so I am resisting the urge to try. However, I will say that if that is a demonstrable thing and there was no upside then it would be surprising that scrum sticks as well as it does. reply carlmr 4 hours agorootparent>scrum then sticking with it. They believe it helped. Not necessarily. It's well known that there are many psychological biases in favor of keeping the status quo. Whether it's the sunk cost fallacy, the escalation of commitment or the endowment effect. Humans tend to stick with bad decisions way longer than rational. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escalation_of_commitment#/sear... I think the problem here is we've had a huge trend in switching to scrum, but then people stick with failed scrum because it's the new status quo. Switching back to waterfall can't be sold by consultants. Even if it would help. reply vannevar 5 hours agorootparentprev>It's always the same with Scrum. Every time you point out something clearly wrong, the response is always \"well that's not really scrum, you're doing it wrong\". Yeah, that would be the correct response. If we were discussing communism, and you started complaining that under communism everyone has to stand on one leg and hop up and down, a communist would correctly point out that hopping on one leg is not communism. >Well to both of those camps I say: if most attempts ended up implementing it \"incorrectly\" in the end, it's not a very useful framework to begin with then, is it? This is like saying that exercise isn't useful because most people who attempt it don't stick with it. Doing actual scrum is hard (particularly for managers), so a lot of teams can't stick with it. That doesn't mean it isn't useful. reply oneshtein 12 hours agorootparentprevYou never had a SCRUM meeting. reply shepherdjerred 12 hours agorootparentprevSurely you're exaggerating about a one hour standup? reply mid-kid 12 hours agorootparentI've been at companies where this was indeed the case. reply bboygravity 12 hours agorootparentprevThe goal is always 15 minutes and the reality always (much) longer. reply dathinab 11 hours agorootparentprevI wich while it's not quite as bad for us 30min are the norm and it spilling to 40 min not rare and that is with us trying to cut it short but too many other things are conflicting with short dailies, mainly sure to company structure/size reply thayne 14 hours agorootparentprevIn my experience, if the PM isn't part of it, the standup doesn't happen, because no one else cares that much. If someone gets stuck on something or needs help we just send a slack message, no need to wait for a fixed meeting. reply erik_seaberg 15 hours agorootparentprevThat's hard to imagine. In big tech it's the team manager who decides that standups should happen and when (maybe this is an expectation from higher-ups). He always joins unless running late. reply oneshtein 14 hours agorootparent> In big tech it's the team manager who decides that standups should happen and when (maybe this is an expectation from higher-ups). Then it's not a SCRUM process at all. Case solved. https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#scrum-definition https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#daily-scrum reply bigstrat2003 14 hours agorootparentprevBe that as it may, if the scrum guide explicitly says they shouldn't then it isn't really fair to blame scrum for that. Honestly, the recurring complaints with scrum, agile, etc basically boil down to this: shitty organizations can make any system miserable. People generally are blaming the intermediate cause (how we do scrum sucks) rather than the root cause (our company sucks and nothing would work). reply Aeolun 13 hours agorootparentWe blame scrum because the framework provided makes it a lot easier for life to be miserable. reply bboygravity 12 hours agorootparentprevOh, the good old \"the user is doing it wrong, the product is fine\" with scrum being the product. Can anybody (not PM/leader) give 1 example of a company where they saw scrum being done \"correctly\"? crickets I guess scrum is fine and people just don't know how to do it properly. reply albedoa 1 hour agorootparentMan, I agree with your specific criticism of the \"No True Scotsman\" refrain and with the larger criticisms of scrum, but this is an example of scrum prescribing X and companies doing !X, the literal opposite. How could scrum, the product, possibly be to blame for that even if it sucks? Or, at what point is it reasonable to blame the PM/leader for actively and knowingly practicing !$scrum while pretending it's $scrum? reply rolisz 11 hours agorootparentprevSprint planning 1h? Lucky you. At the former employer that was 6h (so basically the whole day was wasted) reply usea 9 hours agorootparentI interviewed at a place whose sprint planning took a full week and was reportedly incredibly stressful. Customers participated. Their product was a website that agile teams used to track their process. reply gedy 15 hours agorootparentprevThis may sound like a no true Scotsman argument, when our company was trained by one of the scrum founders about 18 years ago, they were very clear that the daily standup was only for the team members, and the scrum master. (The scrum master could be a team member, and rotate btw). Managers were not allowed or invited to these. The only thing product managers and engineering managers would participate in and give feedback was in Sprint demos, and the beginning of planning meetings to answer any questions on upcoming stories. At the time it was incredibly freeing and fixed a pretty awful and behind waterfall project. I was (briefly) at a startup a couple years ago that said they \"did Scrum\" and what a clusterfuck that was - all the managers meeting daily with devs to see if they were behind and scold them if they were. See ya. reply ta_1138 14 hours agorootparentBut Managers as the center of the scrum is how many, many tech companies the outside world wouldn't call crappy run things. They also use Jira, mostly because they want reports that let people two or three levels up think they have any control over anything. One of my least favorite standups was even worse than a ceremony for the manager: The manager and the Product representative were there in every single one, but they didn't actually pay any attention: Another 20+ minutes of \"parking lot\" would be added after the 5-10 minute process as they asked the team all the random questions they thought they needed, in which they also proved that they weren't actually paying attention to the actual updates, or the tickets, or anything. In practice, a sequence of 1:1 meetings where everyone was stuck watching, because after inquisition to one person, it'd come after another. In practice, I don't think I've seen scrum run without a manager in standup, ever. reply wsc981 15 hours agorootparentprevSome things that come to mind: - burn-down / velocity charts - retrospectives - poker sessions - daily stand-ups - user stories and related tickets (eg in JIRA) There’s probably more ... Perhaps these things are not necessarily meant to make managers happy, though managers do seem to like this stuff. As a dev, I prefer a more fluid approach without all the rituals. In the start-up I joined a couple of months ago, we don’t deal with any of the above shit. Which of course is sure to change as the company grows, as that seems to happen often. Our current way of working (remote company, 4 people): - 2 calls a week, which tend to last about an hour. - We discuss work for upcoming week or future stuff. - We try to deliver every week on whatever was agreed upon at start of week. Actually, previous company I worked at, was a bit bigger (35 people), but also very little rituals, at least for devs. There was a support department that did the JIRA related stuff. And we had like 2 day-long meetings every year to discuss personal goals/work for next half year. But afterwards just a short weekly meeting for team (sometimes lasting only 10 minutes), no stand-ups and such. reply Stratoscope 14 hours agorootparentAnd sprints! When I started at my current job, I naively looked at the bugs and tasks assigned to me, and started picking and fixing the highest priority tickets. Then I was informed, \"Oh no, that's not how we do things here. Don't look at the priority, just work on what is assigned to you in the current sprint.\" I had never heard of sprints before. More recently, I had a conversation with my manager and asked, \"Do we really need sprints? I've been in this business a long time. 10, 20, 30 years ago we didn't have sprints and somehow still managed to produce great software.\" The reply was \"But if we didn't have sprints, how could we possibly measure the team's productivity and individual productivity?\" I knew I wouldn't win this debate, so I politely let it drop. I just wanted to sow some seeds of doubt. In all fairness, my manager is a very reasonable person. But when this devotion to sprints is ingrained in the entire company, it is hard to question it or get away from it. At least we don't do daily standups! reply ta_1138 14 hours agorootparentThat's normal nowadays, even in the most ridiculous of situations. I once found that a system was getting a little expensive. As, AWS was billing us a million a month expensive. I figured this out, and came up with a plan that would cut it down to 80 thousand by spending 4 days: You know, a mild, 11 million a year of savings. Management insisted that the work had to go through scheduling, and intake, a process that would involve zero developers looking at anything, but would delay doing the task a month and a half. And no, nothing the team was working on came even remotely close to that ROI. Following the process just cost an extra 1.5 million dollars. reply shostack 13 hours agorootparentWhat was the opportunity cost of potentially deprioritizing other work? reply nine_k 12 hours agorootparent^ nothing the team was working on came even remotely close to that ROI.

The only thing on that list I've ever liked is the velocity charts. And the only reason I liked them is that it helped me give a slightly less made up date to my own bosses to explain when something might ship. Over the years I've found that devs have been the one who like retros. Or at least a certain subset of them. When I've been an EM I would try to get rid of them, only to have them requested by my teams. Who knew. reply meowfly 14 hours agorootparentRetros all too often focus on the last thing that happened and risk turning into a complaint session. I've told my team anyone is welcome to ask for a retro whenever for any reason, but we don't make them recurring meetings because there is too much of a temptation to find something wrong to fill the time. reply shade 3 hours agorootparentBest retro I ever had, on a small team of seniors: we all sat down, looked at each other, agreed that a sprint happened and we couldn't think of anything that was good or bad about it. Then we called in our manager, who also acted as scrum master, so we could do planning for our next sprint. I thought this was reasonable enough - ostensibly we'd do retro and then planning back to back, and none of us minded the chance to take a few minutes and reflect if we had anything we should discuss. By contrast, I've worked with scrum masters who were strict about the process and insisted _every_ retro needed to have at least one improvmenet or action item out of it, preferably more. I found this pointless and I've rarely seen them actually followed up on. reply jghn 12 hours agorootparentprevThis is exactly why I hate retros. It's just a venting session. We're going to whine about some things, of which we have absolutely no power to change, and somehow that changes the future. But people seem to love them. I'd prefer to spend that time putting my head down and grinding through whatever sucky thing people were otherwise whining about. reply rpcope1 14 hours agorootparentprevAs a developer, I find retros most useful when EMs (and probably PMs, depends on how things are configured organizationally) aren't present, as it should give a chance to talk freely about challenges you or the team face, which often are organizational in nature and may involve one's management chain. My current role doesn't adhere to this, and it makes retro often really painful. reply jghn 12 hours agorootparentI would agree with you. I never want my manager there.

Again, who knew? reply Leherenn 10 hours agorootparentI don't know, at least for my current team a lot of the stuff we complain about in the retro is beyond the team level: coordination between teams, infrastructure issues, ... The intra team issues are usually talked about before (e.g. during standup, or just asynchronously). If the EM is not there, those are not actionable. What we try to do is: do the retro by ourselves, and invite the EM at the end of there is stuff for them. Usually they are not available though... reply jksmith 14 hours agorootparentprevGood points, and eye-rolling stuff for teams thaqt don't understand the intricacies. For instance: - burn-down / velocity charts: Teams use this at standups to make sure their sprint isn't drifting. That's why a burn-down should be tracked in hours and not points. With points, the data isn't actionable in a reasonable amount of time. The the team sees a problem, they might make use of a pre-determined emergency procedure to address it. - retrospectives: Yeah most retrospectives are horrible. Retros should be like post rocket test - examine your telemetry deltas to see what changed (edge cases, governance,compliance, desgn, etc.) These conversations are not forced, but good teams always repeat the same data analysis unless they intentionally change it. - poker sessions: Yeah this is totally misunderstood. Pointing stories is about snap reactions to comparing difficulties and complexity, and that's it, move on. Teams will tighten up estimates when they do an implementation plan in sprint planning. So they don't sweat estimates. - daily stand-ups: The whole team is responsible for the sprint backlog, nothing is assigned, everything is volunteered. So if you're working on something that is going south, or you have some extra capacity, let your team know about it. The team will work together to scale capacity to get things done, which is how they can disappear on Friday afternoons. - user stories and related tickets (eg in JIRA): Well yeah, Jira sucks. So do all the other major backlog tools. Jira gets addins, but the fundamental approach to backlog development hasn't changed in a decade. (I'm working on a soln from scratch, btw). Also, user stories are meant to be work-items with enough signal so they can be executed with certainty in a sprint. So that means a lot of refinement to the left of the story must occur to get rid of the noise (epics to features to stories to tasks). Once a team says a story meets their definition of ready, that story can be scheduled for a (timely) sprint. Team members may be doing hard-core story refinement because of some technical hurdles, so their time outside of development during sprint can be pinned down with the team's capacity plan. BTW, capacity plans and implementation plans belong solely to the team. They're nobody else's business, including managers to CEOs. reply relaxing 6 hours agorootparent> That's why a burn-down should be tracked in hours and not points. With points, the data isn't actionable in a reasonable amount of time. I don’t follow this? The arguments against estimates in hours are well known as this point. reply jksmith 1 hour agorootparentSure, comes from a prevailing view that estimating is bad. But it's only because estimating is treated like the answer, then we just go with that answer. The best scrum teams I've worked with maintain a very important survival notion: We don't know the full minimum survivable solution today, but that's ok because we do know enough to get to tomorrow at least. We survived another day. Point is, estimating was never meant to be an answer. It was just meant to kick off discovery. And that's a great way to start because humans tend to be exceptionally good at quickly comparing things for difficulty and complexity. It's an instinctive survival skill. Ultimately, well after estimating this scrum team will do an implementation (tasking) plan in hours if needed during sprint planning. They will compare that plan against their team capacity plan in hours. If the implementation plan blows out the cap plan by say, 30% then that's a warning sign and they'll tell the PO they need to drop a story for the upcoming sprint. If the cap plan compared against the imp plan shows a 30% surplus, then they will pull in a stretch story and bump their velocity, or won't tell the PO and maybe go play golf at the end of the sprint. So the story pointing exercise just gets the team some data that helps them get to the next day (survival speak). There's still a lot of story refinement to be done, before they will tell their PO a story is ready to be pulled into one of their sprints. When teams pull in stories to their sprint backlog, the team is committing to get that story done, so they need immediately actionable data on what's going on at every standup. If the burndown was done in points, the graph ends up looking like a straight line for days with sudden dropoffs toward the end of the sprint - that hides problems. So a sharp team will use task hours instead. Makes the plot a lot more actionable from day to day.

Something lightweight like Trello is ideal - A Kanban board so people have an organised way to pick up new issues when low on work - A weekly showoff meeting where there are few 5 minute presentations and a 30 minute \"I did something really cool or learned something really cool\" - 6 month task split into 1 month ish deliverables, with a flexible deadline for each.

My manager spends much of her time figuring out how to help remove our roadblocks and planning the 6 month to 1 year horizon (with our input). I lead the weekly meeting where we do the showing off, PSAs, or light brainstorming on issues with broad relevance. Two scheduled meetings per week = tons of dev time and freedom to explore / innovate! (Ok, three weekly meetings if you count the product-wide meeting, which is usually a waste of N-5 people's time, and I usually have it on the background while I continue working.) We are remote, so ideally there's also one in person gathering per year to do the big vision casting and major high level brainstorming.

Well put. reply maximumgeek 16 hours agoprevI think back to the early 2000's, and there are other factors in play as well. Back then, I worked with a team of engineers that stayed together for over 4 years. In that time, we did not have Project Managers telling us to do daily standups. We met as an engineering team. We often would go days without having a formal meeting. But, software was different then as well. Everything is interconnected now. One team dropping the ball affects countless other teams. Deployments were whenever we felt a new one was due or at a multi month cadence. Did this introduce problems, yes, but at the same time, they came in controlled release cycles. Nothing against CI/CD and continuous delivery, but the hamster wheel has gotten to a point where we have to release all the time. Corners are cut on everything, and testing is given lip service. At this point, I am a manager, and SCRUM stresses me out. Either let us work from a queue, or give us a project with a deadline. Give me back a stupid gant or pert chart. At least then it was, is this done to allow XYZ, not we are going to accomplish this in the next 2 (arbitrary) weeks. So much more to say, but I am toast. reply gregmac 13 hours agoparent> Nothing against CI/CD and continuous delivery, but the hamster wheel has gotten to a point where we have to release all the time. Corners are cut on everything, and testing is given lip service. Just to call it out: Having CI/CD doesn't mean you have to do all these things, or do scrum. It's imho just good engineering practice. I have it in my side projects, and I've had it at work on a Kanban-driven team (as well as on scrum). It removes disputes over build process (eg, nobody can ever say \"well, it complies on my machine\"). It is a form of build/deploy documentation. It removes bottlenecks (\"only Tom knows how to deploy that service, but he's on vacation\") and stupid mistakes (\"whoever deployed this last did it wrong and left a bunch of old files around\"). I also have found deploying regularly is stress-reducing. For one, with CD the development environment is running the same steps, and we know it works because we do it dozens of times a week. The longer it's been since last prod deploy, the less confident we can be it'll go smoothly, whereas when it gets deployed every few days it becomes a non-event. When something breaks, having only 1 or 3 changes makes it really easy to figure out why. Recovering after a big release with 40 PRs in it is absolutely painful. None of this means you have to release everything on a regular schedule (like a sprint). You can still do long running branches or feature-flag things off, Just try not to go too long without deploying something. reply RussianCow 11 hours agorootparent> When something breaks, having only 1 or 3 changes makes it really easy to figure out why.

First is the \"gap\" between those doing the work, and those writing the checks. (When it's the same person, this problem disappears.) The guy editing the checks likes to understand progress is being made, and that the project both has an end and will be successfully completed. The second problem is that by it's nature software \"never ends\" and many (dare I say most?) projects fail and are simply abandoned. The moment the check writer is not the direct manager of the development you have an intractable problem. The person in-between (quite literally middle management), is often not technical. But he has to convince the bean-counters that this project is \"on time and on budget\". He can't help but feel sometimes that he's herding cats. He's an irritant to those who are \"doing the work\" so they treat interactions with him as a waste of time. Inevitably he starts trying to measure things. (And we all know what that means.) His job is hard. He's stuck between developers who don't want anything to do with him and higher-ups who want reassurance, bit don't really trust what he's saying.

No matter how you slice up the work, we all have to demonstrate progress and goal achievement. Agile, Scrum, Kanban, Method 1, or whatever are all meant to measure success. In a lot of cases there is a client or a customer that requires regular progress reports. Management uses reports to measure team performance. I’m not sure what planet the OP is from, but this will never change. If you have a small team with a simple codebase, kanban is probably sufficient. In larger teams or complex solutions, the reporting just needs to happen. reply gridspy 14 hours agoparentThe post is fundamentally about all the performance of making stories, assigning points, allocating work and doing standups all the time. None of that is required to actually create software. If people are judgemental around what stories are left uncompleted or points / week then the situation can become stressful for no benefit to anyone. reply bruce511 13 hours agorootparent>> None of that is required to actually create software. Agreed. (Assuming you mean \"create\" as in write, as distinct from create as in get funded.) >> If people are judgemental around what stories are left uncompleted or points / week then the situation can become stressful for no benefit to anyone. Clearly no stress is better. But these things create stress in the other direction too. Slower than expected progress, the existence of \"intractable problems\", work going unfinished creates significant stress up the ladder. In a perfect world the dev team is given a perfect spec, and a reasonable time to do it in, and after being \"left alone\" they deliver the finished product on time. Given that that world doesn't exist, given that the \"money we're spending\" may turn out to be completely wasted (because the spec was wrong, or because the problem us much harder than anticipated), the ideal case seems unlikely to happen. I say this not as a defense of crappy management processes, or even less as a defense of crappy managers, but rather in the spirit that understanding the problem goes a long way to solving it. And yes, many places have bad processes and bad middle managers. I don't envy you that. But finding a way to better solve the manager's problem typically improves the relationship. reply Aeolun 13 hours agorootparent> Agreed.

It seems to me that most devs don't understand the root problem, so they both don't understand, and don't constructively improve the current solution. Improvement is not \"leave me alone\".

Building software has a long history of delays, running over time, running out of budgets, etc. As a stakeholder/customer, you need certainties up front: how long is it going to take, what is it going to cost? And if you think this isn't reasonable, just consider, would you hire a contractor to work on your house that can't tell you up front cost and duration? Anybody doing work needs to be able to estimate duration, progress, risk of delays, etc. Other people's work depends on your deadlines. Go/no go of a project depends on cost and duration. Insight and tracking is required. None of this was done any better before agile. reply 015a 14 hours agoparentprevI don't feel anything you've said is logical. The deliverable is, in the best case, what communicates progress and success. Short of that, tickets can do that, which is also not what the article is complaining about.

The answer is that as the deadline nears, the team realizes that they have not made enough progress to meet the deadline. They must work longer hours, start cutting corners, and toss out features at the last minute. All of this is extremely stressful. It's also a cascading problem on bigger projects where this team's product is a subsystem that subsequently has to be integrated into a bigger platform, because they may have broken compatibility at the last minute to make their deadline. Contrast this with scrum, where the team collaboratively sets goals on a regular basis and regularly monitors the work remaining and the rate at which they are progressing, so that they know early whether they need to start making trade-offs or adding people to the team. As the author notes, this trades peaks of extreme stress for a predictable (and manageable) medium level of stress. But it also ensures a more consistent and panic-free delivery process. The problem of burnout is a separate issue. Neither scrum nor waterfall offers a solution to burnout---that is up to the team's management. Nothing in scrum prevents a team from taking breaks from sprints, either as a team or individually. reply uldos 1 hour agoparentWhy do you assume that its devs who are slacking in waterfall?

And if they can't they must be a low-performing team? The OP may have some things wrong, but the 'constant grind' aspect of scrum sprints is spot on, there is no slack. Add to that the 'radical transparency' aspect of scrum. That works great among a tight-knit team, but it can be insidious and actually self-defeating when certain types of manager get involved and weaponize it. I'm sure there are many people who love programming, but hate being a programmer as a job, and to some extent that has always been true, but scrum seems in many cases to make it much, much worse, IMHO. The attitude displayed here is exactly the problem. reply jksmith 15 hours agoprevUnfortunately, we aren't understanding the intricacies of high-performance. I've worked with maybe 150 scrum teams. 99% were mediocre. Remaining 1% understood energy usage, how to limit what they took into a sprint backlog, and how to manage their capacity. When I asked a manager about a particular team, he said \"I don't care if they do fight club in the morning, just let them keep doing what they're doing.\" To reframe, high-performing scrum teams are actually anti-legacy management, they get more done, are happy (low energy state) and stakeholders were satisfied. So their rolling sprint goal was taking a half day each month and going to Top Golf . The key is, everybody on the team was a scrum sme, and understood how to work the process as a team to reinforce certainty and stability. They also didn't need a scrum master. I've got lots of anecdotes from this couple of teams, what kind of work their managers actually did, and the sneaky ways they made the process work for them. There's a lot more to scrum than a certification. Just the teams approach to sprint planning was in a whole different class from what mediocre teams normally did. As for the other 99% of teams, they were mostly management tools. Scrum had been co-opted, especially in orgs using the SAFe framework. This has been at F250's in my experience btw. reply Too 10 hours agoprevThis guy has clearly never worked waterfall, the progress bar doesn't look at all like in the graph. Instead, there are even more milestones throughout the project. Granted, they are usually spread out further than every 2 weeks, there is no such thing as just one final deadline where you can slack the first half of the project. Month 1: Specifications need to be frozen, because month 2 all the test plans need to written, so that month 3 all the test cases can be implemented. Then month 4 all code should be written and month 5 we put everything together to test it. Hoping that what you wrote down half a year ago is still relevant and the most important thing to work at now. Add a complex web of dependencies to other teams on a gigantic gantt-chart with fixed dates and you will have deliveries regularly anyway. Usually, by month 2 you are already overdue on the first milestone. The time plan is not going to shift because of it. Meaning you now have even less time to meet the second deadline, obviously it will be missed, repeat throughout the remaining milestones, resulting in constant stress throughout the project. That's not to say that the graph doesn't exist, its just not called waterfall. It's longer deadlines with more autonomy between. reply Trasmatta 15 hours agoprevI'm at a weird point in my career where every development process stresses me out, no matter what. Guess that's burnout. reply jakub_g 2 hours agoprevThe forever-sprinting approach indeed is unmanageable long term. In my prev job we used to have a cycle of 2-3 sprints followed by 1-2 weeks of rest (to handle tech debt etc.) In other companies it could be named \"innovation week\" or something similar. I still didn't love this, precisely due to always wanting tangible deliverables within 1-2 weeks, while sometimes you just need more time to think clearly about some problem. We partially mitigated it though by explicitly stating whether a giving story is \"delivery\" or \"discovery\", the latter being used to better understand the scope of the problem, current status quo, validate assumptions etc. reply debacle 16 hours agoprevWe moved from sprints back to work queues for exactly this reason. Output is exactly the same but no one is cutting corners to \"finish\" the sprint. We still use a kanban and do estimation the same exact way, but rather than arbitrary deadlines, devs are trained and encouraged to communicate on their velocity in a way that is far more effective than a daily standup. Scrum was an idea that had its time, but after like...15 years the limitations are apparent. reply aetherson 16 hours agoparentThe main value of stressing about sprint goals and what's \"in\" a sprint and finishing it is the very specific situation of there being a bunch of people who want to feed in a large amount of work to a team (usually bugs/support requests/operational work) and it results in constant prioritization issues. If you don't have that situation, you probably don't need to be really careful about what's in a sprint. reply gregmac 13 hours agorootparentKanban lets you prioritize exactly the same way, except it doesn't have to fit into a sprint schedule. You also have to make good stories, which are independent, have a meaningful thing that gets delivered and are of a reasonable size. Then important bugs can get moved to the top of the to-do column, and get done quickly as possible without interrupting any in-progress work. reply lloeki 10 hours agoparentprev> do estimation the same exact way, but rather than arbitrary deadlines, The core problem with that is that effort - consciously or not - gets immediately turned into (start day + estimate) => deadline which only works when you consider spherical cows, not accounting for the hard true practical fact that reality is messy. And it is quite messy, by the very nature of the work which is to do something that has not been done before (otherwise by the very nature of software you'd just reuse it) and thus carries unknown unknowns. Everyone has experienced this \"one-line fix, should be done tomorrow\" that turns into a bind-mending multi-week hunt down the rabbit hole; replace \"fix\" with \"feature\" at your discretion; replace rabbit hole with \"that very urgent task preempting anything else\". The second-order problem is that deadlines are used to schedule higher level dependencies between teams, all the way up to product, and possibly customers, and then it becomes the coupling interface and everything falls apart when there's a delay that inevitably trickles up with rippling consequences, because the system is not designed to handle such a failure mode, having this deadline dependency as its core interface between all the parts. If you're not convinced of that, \"follow the money\": the consistent metric across the software industry to evaluate an employee's performance boils down to \"deliver on time\". Three months down the road, the rational explanation to delays of mandatory rabbit holes and very legit preempting tasks is forgotten, even when acknowledged by management. You're told to factor all that in, but estimating unknown unknowns is by definition impossible (best case you go statistical, with deadly outliers around the corner, which amounts to say it's a bet). Experience reduces these unknowns but they're still around, everywhere. Overall, you tried telling the hard truth with absolute candor were left helpless when it backfired. Ultimately, whatever the process, the stark reality is that to get shit done you have to take part in the make-believe dance and lie - white lies, because soon enough one realises that the other kind of lies also backfires very quickly - in a way that still communicates some form of deeper truth: \"progress is being made, it'll be done (when it's done)\". Inflate some numbers, tune wording when reporting, steal time by bleeding some for task X (reported or skunkworks) into task Y. All the reporting meetings and documents entirely become smoke and mirrors, but are somehow important as they're oil to the whole machinery. Two parallel universes emerge and graciously evolve in parallel. This sleigh of hand is the missing buffer catering for the lack of acknowledgment that producing software is entirely different in nature than producing hardware in a factory. It is in essence more of a creative act, albeit a strangely misleading one because of its technical component. Lots would be amazed as to how much closer it is to advanced drawing or musical composition than it is to more \"material world\" engineering (although the rigorous process of the latter certainly helps for technical aspects), and taking classes of the former would probably do a lot of good. reply irrational 13 hours agoprevI refuse to stress about it. If I don’t get the things done in the time allotted by the points, oh well. If I don’t get them done by the end of the sprint, oh well. And, while my manager might bring it up in one-on-ones, I’ve never seen any consequences from not stressing about trying to meet artificial deadlines. reply morningsam 8 hours agoparentSame here. I have become stressed about deadlines that were actual deadlines imposed by external dependencies (e.g. API deprecation) or stakeholders (e.g. launch of feature needs to be coordinated with efforts in other departments), but never about \"deadlines\" I've just had a hand in making up out of thin air myself during sprint planning. reply 20240915 10 hours agoparentprevI have had consequences for not cranking out work fast enough.

I don't see any yet so as the devil's advocate: You're supposed to have autonomous teams who put up their own tasks they want to complete in the sprint, and the sprint length can be more than 2 weeks if the team wants. And if it's tight to get the scrum's tasks done, that's supposed to be feedback to you and the team. You have autonomy in setting sprint goals, you can put less stuff on a sprint so you have the slack you're supposed to between sprints. Or spend more effort refining so you don't get surprises so often. (Or otherwise change things up in how you work) If you don't have the autonomy and the continuous improvement in your work culture, it's not agile. Scrum is for agile and it doesn't work otherwise. If you do have autonomy you can switch to something else from scrum if you want. Same goes for the \"scrumfall\" part of course but that's admitted in the text already. (I do think scrum is overengineered for agile ideals, has failure modes like in the post, and in 95% of cases you should do something lighter than scrum) reply forgotacc240419 16 hours agoprevI feel like in a lot places the ultimate purpose of sprints is to let executives think they can see data that represents the amount of work getting done down to a fine level. reply Tempest1981 14 hours agoparentIndeed.

And for each meeting we had to present something, with slides as well. We spend more time thinking about usercase than writing the code. I guess that's good in its own way but honestly I don't have such superpower to report something new every meeting. In fact most of my meeting back then were \"I am still coding X\" and that was it, then the scrum master or the leader would talk about big picture over again. reply mortify 14 hours agoprevThere's truth to the ScrumFall design process which is inevitable for most development processes. It's not just that a tool needs to be marketed, but that it needs to be integrated with work from multiple teams and other processes. What ScrumFall does is provide some level of feedback prior to delivery. In the age of Waterfall, devs would develop until they said they were done, we'd get to delivery and UAT only to find that key features work differently than expected and continually extend the release date by months or years until it finally goes out the door more from frustration than actual completion. That stress level would be pegged at 10 for months until it was completed. reply al_borland 7 hours agoprevI was less stressed when doing scrum.

The CD pipeline goes throughout the whole value stream, not just at delivery. Just like delivery automation (eliminate intervention of humans), there's also human automation (helping people get out of their own way). So I could see a use case where managers are just eliminated. You need people who can eliminate the noise and replace with enough signal that delivery teams can execute. POs and stakeholders can do that; managers not needed. I think what you bring up though is an interesting point: maybe managers needs to transition to business engineering roles. This all will play out in the 21st century. 20th century management is a legacy artifact at this point. Best example is F500s, which are generally mediocre in their execution. If a SpaceX type org (14k employees, private) gets into their space, they're screwed. Even with politicians in their pockets, I don't see how rock swallowing dinosaurs like Boeing (170k employees, public) will make it. Just the energy they have to expend to get anything done compared to SpaceX is massive, due in part to their giant management bureaucracy. reply foolinaround 16 hours agoprevare there places today that don't do some variation of scrum today? Waterfall is pretty much non-existent. reply 015a 14 hours agoparentMany engineering orgs just give lip service to scrum, which is as good as not doing it, which is good and works better. Meaning, in my experience: You work in a priority queue, that priority queue is re-synced with stakeholders (at least) once every two weeks, retros may be there as an opportunity to get other business verticals into the room to see what engineering finished recently, and the concept of \"a ticket going over to the next sprint\" doesn't raise blood pressure, because the system is designed for this and sprints aren't deadlines. Features might have deadlines, absolutely, but that's independent of the sprint. I've worked at ~three places that operated similar to this; \"minimum viable scrum\" is a good name, or even better, \"emergent scrum\" because it isn't a process that's designed, its the process that emerges when someone toggles the \"agile/scrum\" button in Jira, but no one really cares one way or the other. Its a good process. I've worked in one environment that was hard scrum, had scrum masters, extremely strict. To be honest: I felt almost no stress, but the company also delivered very little. There was a lot of \"we can't get to swapping the color on that button until Sprint 18 in three months, but we'll schedule it for then\". Missing a sprint was life or death, so every estimate got padded like crazy. When you took vacation, it was common knowledge that you needed to leave halfway through a sprint and come back halfway through another, sprint planning would basically forget about you. That (public tech) company doesn't exist anymore, and it radicalized me against agile/scrum: The entropic end-state of perfectly executed agile/scrum is an extremely well-lubricated machine that actually does very little. reply Tagbert 16 hours agoparentprevSome teams use Kanban which is a way to manage the number of tasks/tickets and doesn’t generally use sprints.

Everything is the same if you squint hard enough. We do not have anything like a SCRUM master. We don't do stand-ups, we usually don't have a per-release target for features. For example, for the past three months I've had a target of October 1st for a feature, but no specific sub-deliverables for the realeases before that. This is typical. We don't have a separate sprint retrospective meeting. We discuss such things during our weekly meeting, even between releases (ie we don't wait). It doesn't feel like what I've been taught and have read about SCRUM. But sure I'll agree it's closer to SCRUM than to the waterfall method. reply oneshtein 45 minutes agorootparentYep, it's typical Agile.

If a software teams are producing deliverables, each is different. Kanban (originally) is an method of sending purchase orders (ie requests to make widgets of specific type in some quantity) from the team(s) who need them to the teams who make them. In software, quantity is always 1 and while the “widgets” have notionally been designed (specced out in the ticket), they have never been built before, unlike in the factory where every widget at least had a test run before. That is, Kanban in software development is a cargo cult from Toyota in which an essential difference (time to reconfigure the assembly line for another widget, vs time to design, prototype and test the widget) has been lost. And it STILL works better than Scrum. reply oneshtein 9 hours agorootparentKanban was invented for Just-In-Time factories, where each product item is customized to meet demand, so fewer things can be predicted in advance, thus making Waterfall unsuitable. Kanban allows to achieve both the flexibility of customization and cost effectiveness of mass production. In software development, incoming requests are broken down into small manageable tasks, which are familiar enough for developers to estimate reliably. Then this continuous stream of small tickets is executed continuously (Kanban) or in sprints (SCRUM). For example, request to add feature X can be broken down into «Make UI for feature X» and «Make backend for feature X». If they are still large, they can be broken further, for example «Make a CRUD for feature X.y», «Make a SQL table for X.y with migration script», and so on. reply senko 9 hours agorootparent> each product item is customized to meet demand No, each product run is customized. Products are already known and fixed (they have been built before, with the same specs), the demand is unknown (in advance). There is a subtle difference between this and your “make CRUD for xyz”, where XYZ is always something different (if it wasn’t, we’d just reuse the thing we wrote the last time).

    "commentBody": "Fuck founder mode. Work in \"Fuck off mode\" (reddit.com)175 points by neerajdotname2 13 hours agohidepastfavorite64 comments sph 11 hours agoHN won't probably like the tone of this one. But one thing I want to emphasise from the post: you don't need to be innovative I see a lot of aspiring entrepreneurs wanting to build something, and get obsessed about finding a new idea that's never done before, and failing at it. As if there was only one of everything in the world. There cannot be another restaurant in this city because there's already one. No one can make money selling phones, shoes, browsers, utility software, because they already exist. Nonsense. Either you have a new idea and invent a monopoly, or you have an old idea but you make it better. And you probably don't want to build a monopoly just yet, that's a whole other game. The bonus of being a startup is that you can afford to try out new approaches to old problems. You don't need a crazy new idea, just to make a marginally better product than the competition. Effort > originality. reply _rm 8 hours agoparentAbsolutely this. Worse mistake I made was thinking a new business has to be innovative. Lost me years. Anyone bootstrapping should make sure to copy an existing successful product or service. Copy it, copy its sales funnel, copy its ads, everything you can get away with. Moonshots is for funded startups. Bootstrappers biggest risk, which will happen almost 100% if they have a technical background, is building stuff based on a logical \"good idea\", rather than mimicking what's proven to work as closely as humanly possible. There's plenty of time for innovating later once the wheels are rolling and you're getting real time feedback. reply threecheese 43 minutes agoparentprevMy observation is the rate of innovation - acceleration I guess - has just been increasing uncontrollably, driven by technology and capital. Is anyone mindful of the risks? “Technologist” here, not a luddite at all. Looking back 500 years or so, you can put your finger on some innovations that have changed the world positively - Enlightenment, printing press, steam/coal/etc power, assembly line etc. These have all had some unseen societal cost associated with them, where change propagates and feeds back leading to unknowable outcomes. We’ve gotten through it (well most of us). Looking back just 50 years, computing, internet, globalization of trade, mass communication and media, social media/peer to peer, decentralization, and now AI; social mores have gone 180 degrees, social groups/religions that have persisted for centuries are falling away, hobbyists from across the globe can converge and share their interests with the rest of the world, and so can anarchists and bad actors. And if AGI happens, given we’ve trained it on 50 years of digitized “two feet on the accelerator pedal” innovating, I am not sure our civilization can take it. Or if anyone cares (besides a few anti accelerationists who are widely derided). reply astrobe_ 10 hours agoparentprev> HN won't probably like the tone of this one. But one thing I want to emphasize from the post: you don't need to be innovative I don't know anything about founding nor am I interested about it, but at least it was funny. On some other topic, I've found this kind of post to be refreshing and relieving, even if your inner voice says \"yes, but...\". It is kind of popping a couple of the nested bubbles you're in when you are deep in a project. This line about innovation reminds me what one of the (founding) member of a band says in a masterclass session [1]: the music you make doesn't have to be entirely new all the time. They show an example with one of their own song and compare it to another famous one: \"That's the same thing\". [1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwpXTeKhWYs reply orlp 9 hours agoparentprevPeople that do believe you need to be innovative are in for a rude awakening when they actually do something innovative successfully only to find out a year later there are now 5 competitors copying you, with decent success. reply al_borland 3 hours agorootparentThe will also be in for a surprise when they find out they can never be innovative enough to not have a group of people online downplaying the innovation, because of other things that came before it, or components and concepts that were used to create it. Go all the way back to the first guy who made the first screw. A foundational innovation. The critics of the day might have said, “that’s not an innovation, he just wrapped an incline plane around a cylinder. What a joke.” Prior to that when the incline plane was described the critics may have said, “wow, what an amazing and ‘innovative’ scientist, he thinks he invented hills. Ha.” There is no hard line that separates evolution from revolution at the design stage. It’s really up to the market. Seemingly small changes, like pre-sliced bread, can change everything. While things people think will be revolutionary fall flat… remember when the Segway (Ginger) hype, it was going to change the design of cities. It didn’t. reply neerajdotname2 4 hours agorootparentprevEven if you do innovate, it's very hard to have a strong moat. Look at IFTTT and Myspace. Their successors ate their fucking lunch. reply rich_sasha 9 hours agoparentprevI guess the interesting question is the ultimate financial return for the founder from (a) VC funded hyper-unique optimized lean startup, or (b) a somewhat boring, non-unique, well-executed business. No doubt if you found Facebook and you swear blood about it he fine detail of SEO optimisation, there's no competition. But what about in average, where a realistic best case scenario is a fairly successful startup with a few 100m exit and a lot of dilution. I don't know the answer but often wonder. Running a startup sounds fun, but also the whole VC treadmill sounds very stressful. reply phil21 5 hours agorootparentI don’t consider VC funded companies as startups. If you have to answer to a board to stay alive due to needing that next round of financing, you are no longer in control of your own company and simply work for someone else with a fancy title and some extra steps. We call those folks CEOs. It’s been weird watching the term morph into what it is today over the past 25 years. So much for hacking on a startup in your garage with friends after collecting enough money from friends and family to bootstrap yourself. Once you are taking millions of dollars from investors while being valued in the billions you are simply a boring old corporate enterprise to me. And that doesn’t even get into the absurdity of 10 year old “startups” with hundreds of employees. I think the term loses all meaning when you are talking about established companies with HR departments. reply neerajdotname2 3 hours agorootparentAbsofuckingltely. Another way of looking at it is that the day you take funding from that day you are trying to sell that company. Realistically how many companies will have IPO. Not many. So your next best option is to get bought out. How fucked up is that. Think about it. You are starting a startup and you know that your end goal is to sell it off. Fuck that shit. It's not for me. reply ath3nd 11 hours agoparentprev> HN won't probably like the tone of this one. Oh, I emphatically agree with both the post's content and the post's tone. I think it is a lot about building something you like well. It doesn't have to be unique, it doesn't have to cost you a burn out and your health, it just has to be something well made and with some passion. reply xenospn 10 hours agoparentprevJust take a trip to your local grocery store and see how many water bottle brands there are, selling the exact same product that you get for free out of your faucet at home. reply namaria 7 hours agorootparentIn my corner of Europe the cool kids from the business course all start some sort of bottled drink company.

It felt criminal to charge as much as they did for water in a fancy can, but I wasn’t going to order soda just so I could feel like I’m paying for something. It was probably 2 years ago and I’m still bothered by it. The world needs less of this, not more. I’ve been to a couple cities in Europe that were very proud of their water. Hotels and restaurants advertised that they served tap water, and the bottled water was proudly bottled tap water. There were filling stations around town to get more of this water for free. I want more of this, and less Liquid Death. Invest in the local water supply, not marketing companies with the laziest product possible. reply m3047 3 hours agorootparentWhere I live (Tacoma WA if anyone wants some) there are wellheads you can go to and get water for free. I use it for brewing beer (because of the mineral content). I've never seen anyone else filling. I was curious so I asked, and they measure how much water people take and it's only in the hundreds of gallons a month per wellfield.

If you're above solving small problems that users say hell yes too, it's very difficult to build anything big with that kind of ego. All big problems are very regularly a lot of small problems very well understood on their own and in between each other. Innovation can actually be faster, better, and cheaper, and still charge more. In the cases where people want to hide in academic style R&D with no real connection to operationalizing or commercializing .. the pursuit of innovation for recognition of some kind can oddly correlate with seeking significance/self-worth.. from others. - The disease and illusion of externally reinforced innovation can be very challenging. - It's one thing to have this disease, and another to be able to deliver on it. Very few can, let alone do. Even fewer sit with problems for the time needed to let the understanding form. - Being the first is not usually best, or the best. Usually early an the worst. Learning market timing and meeting the market is so important. - Being unique is not great either most of the time, there are so many challenges created in needing to create your own market, and educate them.... the very first time you're being an entrepreneur lol. YC has some good videos on this. - Adding or creating value isn't just invention, innovation, or even commercialization. Adding value to making the lives of people is beneath someone, they might not be a founder, and more of a finder of one's self-worth. reply Onavo 9 hours agoparentprevWell if you see other threads here today, it's all about finding product market fit in massive addressable markets that are absent of competitors.

Don't make a fancy restaurant, just build a better burger joint. There are endless burger places. Why? Because people love burgers. Innovation is great once you have money to burn. Until then, be the corner roast beef place that everybody loves and is an institution. The business model is sound, no great innovation is necessary, just hard work, persistence, cleverness yes but not genius. Startup this way is still challenging but not impossible, and initially no major pivots are needed. Customer acquisition is still the most difficult part, and that takes time no matter how well you are funded. reply Waterluvian 2 hours agoparentTo add to this analogy: you also spend that time learning how to run a burger joint. That’s not wasted time. Walk then run and all that. If you can’t make a burger joint work, you can’t make a fancy restaurant work. Don’t fool yourself by thinking the problem was the menu and atmosphere. I experienced a startup where a bunch of mechatronics grads built a product line of simple robots for research use. Simple hamburgers of robotics. Only after years of that did they dive into far more complicated markets. From my rank and file vantage, this felt simple and genius. reply jimnotgym 10 hours agoprevFounder mode is a really terrible essay. It plain makes up a reality to make his theory sensible.

Sounds like an annoyed teenager; it's sad because the author is smarter than that. Basically his message sounds like: \"I build what I want and I don't care.\" Well, yes, it works, as long as you enjoy the ride and don't plan to make money off it. (You of course can make money off the result, with some luck, if you build a useful thing.) Most of things in the initial hate list are not useless. They just are not worth obsessing over. You don't need tons of SEO, market research, or analytics. A small but nonzero amount is still useful. That guy, for instance, used the overdose of profanities as a marketing tool to successfully get his product and his personality on the HN front page. Mocking onboarding though is a more serious mistake. Most of your users won't \"figure it out\" unless you care about it well beforehand. \"Have you done market research to figure out your pricing?\" is a very, very reasonable question. But likely the research for your (tiny) upcoming product should take under one hour. Looking at your competition's offers and at people's reactions along the way could give you an idea or two how to (slightly) improve your own product. And \"this whole notion that you have to build something innovative and magical\" mixes up two unrelated things. Actually \"innovative\" is rare. But absolutely go for \"magical\" if you can! I see \"magical\" as \"friction-free\". Say, Docker was not very innovative but \"docker run\" was magical. Dropbox was famously lambasted on HN for not being innovative; still it was magical enough to be a big success. Google Wave was genuinely innovative, but it sorely lacked magic, \"You’re a startup. You’re a founder. Fucking act like it.\" Nope, nope. A startup is a \"go big or go home\" kind of deal. A founder's job is to convince VCs that the thing may go big, and do an honest effort to make it happen. But with this attitude, you're not a startup. You just have got a side project, or two. It's a completely fine thing to do. \"My cushion is my consulting gig. Even if all my products tank, I’ll be fine.\" Good for you, sir. But this is a Wendy's. reply scrollaway 9 hours agorootparentAgree with you until the last paragraph. Startups don't have to go for a VC and founders aren't VC pets unless they choose it. \"Lifestyle startups\" can absolutely be startups. reply nine_k 9 hours agorootparentI see. But I'm used to the notion of a \"startup\" being a vehicle to take over the world by explosive growth. A coffee shop is a fine lifestyle business, but not a startup. Theoretically explosive growth can be self-sustained, but usually it's impossible to grow fast enough (even when the market is ready for taking) without taking some external funding, as an investment or at least as a loan. reply KaiMagnus 7 hours agorootparentprevYeah, the part where he’s talking about „his startup“ not being all in, because he wants to do consulting as a fallback. Turns out that’s a little dishonest since he has a whole agency where benched employees work on „his startups“. In the comments he goes on to say he’s based in India and people there can’t use intercom for some reason, so that’s why „he’s building“ some knockoffs. Way different reality from what the first half of the original post makes it seem. I guess this is some kind of meta commentary about not trusting startup influencers. While the post has some good parts, there’s also some godawful advice sprinkled in there. reply polotics 10 hours agoprevThis would be a a great article if instead of \"fuck off\" it used the phrase \"focus\", all the points are valid, and the anger against low mental effort conventional herd mentality is also justifiable.

If you are not going to take VC money, then I think this attitude should absolutely be the default approach unless you've got a proven reason not to. There is a large world to be tapped outside of VC funded category leaders where there is enormous, life changing amounts of money to be made by intelligent, pragmatic founders just trying to build real businesses. And the reality of these businesses is that you don't need to be the best out of everyone -- you just need to be the right kind of good enough: better than the alternatives. reply zem 11 hours agoprevI am not even remotely an entrepreneur, but if I were then this is totally the sort I would want to be! 8<----------- I agree.

    "originBody": "Press Release Twelve Defendants Sentenced for Violent Home Invasion Robberies to Steal Cryptocurrency Friday, September 13, 2024 Share For Immediate Release Office of Public Affairs A Florida man was sentenced to 47 years in prison on Wednesday for his role in a scheme involving a series of home invasion robberies targeting cryptocurrency. Between Sept. 5 and Sept. 12, a total of 12 men have been sentenced for their role in the scheme. According to court documents and evidence presented at the trial, Remy Ra St Felix, 25, of West Palm Beach, and his co-conspirators stole over $3.5 million from victims through SIM swapping and violent home invasions in which they held victims at gunpoint, assaulted them, and bound them with plastic cable ties. St Felix was convicted on June 25 by a federal jury in Greensboro, North Carolina, after a six-day trial. In addition to his sentence of incarceration, St Felix was sentenced to five years of supervised release and ordered to pay $524,153.39 in restitution. According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, beginning in late 2020, St Felix’s co-conspirator, Jarod Gabriel Seemungal, 23, of West Palm Beach, and foreign co-conspirators stole cryptocurrency from victims’ accounts at exchanges. They obtained access to the accounts by gaining control of the victims’ phone numbers through SIM swapping. In 2022, Seemungal and his co-conspirators devised the home invasion scheme and recruited St Felix and others to assist with the invasions. St Felix later became the leader of the home invasion crew. In September 2022, St Felix and members of the crew committed violent home invasions in Delray Beach and Homestead, Florida. In Delray Beach, the victims were held at gunpoint in their home. In Homestead, a man and his family were held at gunpoint in their home, and then the man was abducted, held hostage, and beaten, before the man was found by law enforcement 120 miles from his home. Later in 2022, St Felix and his crew targeted a Little Elm, Texas, man and made several trips to attempt the robbery. In December 2022, Seemungal and a Houston-based crew comprised of Deangelo Lee Contreras, 21, Tristian Rene Gamez, 21, Victor Gonzalez, 27, Jesus Salazar, 24, Cristian Valdez, 21, and Jesus Gerardo Valdez, Jr., 27, all of Houston, Texas, committed the home invasion. The Little Elm man and members of his family were held at gunpoint and restrained in their home for over three hours, during which time members of the crew tortured the man and his mother. The perpetrators stole approximately $150,000.00 in cash, two Rolex watches, and a valuable necklace and pendant. In April 2023, St Felix and Elmer Ruben Castro, 23, of West Palm Beach, invaded the home of a wife and a husband in Durham, North Carolina. Prior to the invasion, St Felix’s co-conspirators obtained unauthorized access to the couple’s email account and conducted multiple days of surveillance on their home. During the invasion, the men violently assaulted the couple, threatened them with guns, and restrained them with plastic cable ties. They forced the man to provide access to his computer and cryptocurrency exchange account. Seemungal then remotely accessed the computer and stole over $150,000.00 worth of cryptocurrency. Conspirators laundered the funds through anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies, as well as “instant exchanges” and decentralized finance platforms that did not conduct know-your-customer checks. In July 2023, St Felix traveled from Florida to Long Island, New York, to commit a home invasion of a family of five. Before St Felix could do so, however, he was arrested. At the time of his arrest, St Felix was in possession of two firearms and plastic cable ties. Throughout the conspiracy, the conspirators communicated via an encrypted messaging application to plan their crimes. They identified targets and discussed how to gain entry to homes, the tools required to carry out the crimes, the technical aspects of cryptocurrency, and the patterns of life of their targets. They also circulated pictures of their targets and their targets’ homes. In addition to the home invasions described above, conspirators used the encrypted messaging application to plan additional home invasion robberies in Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Orlando, Florida; and Georgia. Seemungal and the foreign co-conspirators financed the purchase of rental cars, hotel rooms, and firearms by co-conspirators Haisel Daily, 22, of West Palm Beach, and Ruben Matias Nicolopulos Silva, 22, of Lake Worth, Florida, to use during the robberies. Seemungal was also sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison followed by five years of supervised release and ordered to pay $4,038,479.39 in restitution. Seemungal pleaded guilty on December 19, 2023, for his role in the scheme to steal cryptocurrency by hacking victims’ cryptocurrency accounts as well as the home invasion and robbery scheme. On Feb. 6, Castro pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit kidnapping and kidnapping. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 1. On May 29 and 30, nine of St Felix’s and Seemungal’s co-conspirators pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit kidnapping, and were sentenced as follows: Jose Alfredo Avila, 27, of West Palm Beach, was sentenced on Sept. 11, to 20 years in prison, followed by four years of supervised release and ordered to pay $365,100.00 in restitution. Contreras was sentenced on Sept. 5, to 15 years in prison, followed by five years of supervised release and ordered to pay $355,800.00 in restitution. Daily was sentenced on Sept. 5, to 25 years in prison, followed by four years of supervised release and ordered to pay $524,153.39 in restitution. Gonzalez was sentenced on Sept. 6, to 12 years in prison, followed by three years of supervised release and ordered to pay $355,800.00 in restitution. Nathan Noel Quintana, 24, of Royal Palm Beach, Florida, was sentenced on Sept. 6, to 16 years in prison, followed by four years of supervised release and ordered to pay $365,100.00 in restitution. Silva was sentenced on Sept. 5, to 12 years in prison, followed by five years of supervised release and ordered to pay $524,153.39 in restitution. Cristian Valdez was sentenced on Sept. 6, to 12 years in prison, followed by four years of supervised release and ordered to pay $355,800.00 in restitution. Jesus Valdez was sentenced on Sept. 6, to 12 years in prison, followed by four years of supervised release and ordered to pay $355,800.00 in restitution. Jesus Manuel Santiago, III, 23, of West Palm Beach, is scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 1. Also, on May 29 and 30, Salazar and Gamez pleaded guilty to conspiracy to interfere with commerce through robbery. Salazar was sentenced on Sept. 5, to five years in prison, followed by four years of supervised release and ordered to pay $355,800.00 in restitution. Gamez was sentenced on Sept. 11, to eight years in prison, followed by three years of supervised release and ordered to pay $355,800.00 in restitution. Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division; U.S. Attorney Sandra J. Hairston for the Middle District of North Carolina; and Special Agent in Charge Robert M. DeWitt of the FBI Charlotte Field Office made the announcement. The FBI Charlotte Field Office investigated the case, with valuable assistance from the Durham Police Department and the FBI New York, Miami, Houston, Mobile, and Newark Field Offices. The National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET) of the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) is partnered with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of North Carolina in prosecuting the case. CCIPS/NCET Trial Attorney and Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric Iverson for the Middle District of North Carolina and CCIPS Trial Attorney Brian Mund are prosecuting the case. The U.S. Attorneys’ Offices for the Southern District of Florida, Southern District of Texas, and Eastern District of Texas provided valuable assistance. NCET was established to combat the growing illicit use of cryptocurrencies and digital assets. Within CCIPS, NCET conducts and supports investigations into individuals and entities that enable the use of digital assets to commit and facilitate a variety of crimes, with a particular focus on virtual currency exchanges, obfuscation services, and infrastructure providers. NCET also sets strategic priorities regarding digital asset technologies, identifies areas for increased investigative and prosecutorial focus, and leads the department’s efforts to collaborate with domestic and foreign government agencies as well as the private sector to aggressively investigate and prosecute crimes involving cryptocurrency and digital assets.

The financial and digital hacking risk I was okay with, the physical risk to my family was too much. Even if I kept it off-site and in a safe deposit box somewhere no criminal would actually know that. Decoy systems and complicated multisig setups are all vulnerable to the ball peen hammer attack. Had I known Bitcoin would turn into what it had I would have done far more to create a pseudonymous persona when participating in the early scene vs. my well known and easily linked handle to my real identity. It was a fun ride, but the risk just got to be too much. reply big-green-man 9 hours agoparentIsn't this a risk that everyone with a nice, expensive house lives with? I fail to see how it's specific to bitcoin or cryptocurrency. Neighborhoods full of mansions are bound to have lots of expensive jewelry inside. Maybe you could say the novelty and hype around bitcoin attract pests, but generally speaking the more you have to lose the more you need to spend securing what's yours. reply aerique 6 hours agorootparentCrypto is much easier to move around and, with some effort, convert into harder to follow cryptocurrencies. Very few people will be their own bank. reply nullc 9 hours agorootparentprevA great many people who live in nice houses are extremely illiquid, they may even have a negative net worth, and their visible property all saddled with debt. Also how much are you really going to get from jewelry in a typical ritzy house after fencing overheads? Maybe a few grand? Of course, people do break into ritzy houses too... though they generally do it when no one is home. Jewellery doesn't tend to have passwords. reply csomar 5 hours agoparentprevSo you are saying we should torture you a bit more until you say where your private key is. I guess the lesson here is to never brag and keep the lowest possible profile. reply naming_the_user 17 hours agoparentprevSurely no criminal knows that you've actually sold it all? reply xethos 17 hours agorootparentBitcoin is not anonymous. Should one be able to link a wallet to a real name (like, for example, phil21), they can then follow each transaction that wallet makes, and where every coin ends up. Once you know phil21's wallet is empty, those looking to heist anything would look through which wallets the coins ended up in, and start linking identities to those wallets. If a criminal knows to look, they see the risk no longer matches the reward. If they don't know to look, odds are they weren't involved enough to have followed phil21's coins and wallet back to a street address in the first place. Sure, the risk isn't zero, like you're implying, but it's dramatically lower. reply naming_the_user 16 hours agorootparentWhy does phil21 necessarily have one wallet? I find it doubtful that the majority of these heists follow anything like the pattern you've described. I think much more likely is just something simple along the lines of \"xyz was active in Bitcoin in 2011, they're still using exchanges as of 2020 because we have a leaked email database, they probably have either nothing or a metric ton of coins, let's give it a go\". If anything I think that someone shouting loudly \"I have definitely sold it all, I promise\" is a sign that they probably haven't. reply klingoff 3 hours agorootparentThere are thousands of definite targets. People don't actually plan maybe crimes with coconspirators unless they want to be maybe dead. reply ipaddr 16 hours agorootparentprevSo phil traded coin for real money. Why aren't they after that money? reply naming_the_user 16 hours agorootparentFiat money is harder to steal because you can't just transfer hundreds of thousands or millions about from mainstream banks without questions being asked. For the most part I don't think that the GP has the story straight. You can't really have it both ways - either Bitcoin is desirable to criminals because it's untraceable enough to get away with it etc, or it's not. I think that they're overstating the ease of finding a person's complete holdings. Having said that, amusingly, if I had to think of the best way to force someone with a million dollars in a bank account to give me it... the first thing that comes to mind would be to hold them hostage and say to them, get KYC'd on a crypto exchange and send me the crypto. I think that the biggest barrier would be that with no prior history their bank and the exchange would throw a big fat WTF and probably lock everything down for weeks. reply xethos 15 hours agorootparentI'd say it's really a mix here: It's traceable enough to make Phil uncomfortable, but not every criminal will know it's traceable (especially by government agencies). Your point is the big one though - one cannot suddenly, unexpectedly, and without a history of doing so, transfer six-figure sums without traditional financial institutions looking at said transaction fairly closely. Bitcoin doesn't have this drawback reply water-data-dude 16 hours agorootparentprevThere’s more friction involved in withdrawing money from a bank. You can do stuff like cancel transfers within a time window, something that’s not usually possible with cryptocurrency reply phil21 15 hours agorootparentprevOh, this thought has definitely crossed my mind quite a bit. Just not much I can do about it! reply tasuki 9 hours agoparentprevHow would the criminals know you actually offloaded it? reply thebruce87m 3 minutes agorootparentOne tactic might be to go on a public forum and claim you offloaded it while still holding it. reply tptacek 18 hours agoparentprevI mean, the premise is more or less the same as that of keeping your money in gold bars under your bed, except without the physical labor. So yeah, seems like a bad idea. reply ajb 13 hours agorootparentWhen I was in high school, the computing teacher remarked that some people still don't believe that computers have benefited society. His answer to this was that they have nearly eliminated armed robbery, because when people were paid in cash, the payroll was an enormous target. Such heists used to be a commonplace risk, but a couple of generations have grown up without them. reply xelamonster 11 hours agorootparentWouldn't this have been addressed by paper checks long before direct deposit came into play? reply ajb 8 hours agorootparentHmm, it's years since I properly thought about this anecdote Yes, in theory you could have done everything with checks. It didn't completely happen though, until after computerisation. In the UK, it turns out that employees had the right to receive pay in cash as late as 1986! And taking it away was controversial.So it may be that you are right that computerisation wasn't essential, but most likely the reduction in cost of banking spread it to enough people that armed robbery became less of a risk. reply tenuousemphasis 11 hours agorootparentprevGold bars that you can create a backup of in case of loss of protect at a molecular level with cryptography. reply smeej 18 hours agoprevIt's a surprisingly hard threat to model against. For example, sure, don't store your funds on an exchange and they can't get in with a SIM swap, but when they're in your house, that doesn't help you. You could store your funds with a multisig wallet and make sure you don't have access to enough keys at home to move the funds, but how do you make them believe you? You can have one or more decoy wallets you can \"cave\" and give them access to if you think it might buy your freedom, but once you start, again, why would they believe you? Do you just acknowledge that they won't believe you,that they are going torture you regardless? And at least make sure you or your heirs have the money if any of you survive? There really isn't a good way out of this. reply jncfhnb 16 hours agoparentHow about a trusted third party that adds a little bit of friction for suspicious transfers of large volumes of money? reply roenxi 10 hours agorootparentI get the joke, but you could do that without the trusted third party. It is pretty easy to imagine a system where transfers have to be signalled X blocks before the actual transaction takes place if the transaction is statistically weird. The sort of problem smart contracts are there to solve. reply SV_BubbleTime 14 hours agorootparentprevHmm. Maybe like the group holding your assets has a centralized check and control system? Like they could operate physical locations and have staff? A novel concept. reply xelamonster 11 hours agorootparentGreat idea! Those things cost money though and users won't like paying up-front--they'll have to be sure to make up costs with obscene fees, the more obfuscated the better. To minimize pushback on the fees they should consider focusing them on the most disadvantaged users, since they're least likely to be able to do anything about it. Isn't it a great system? reply atty 14 hours agorootparentprevPerhaps these groups could be regulated and insured by an even larger entity, perhaps even one with the authority to punish individuals and organizations for wrongdoing? reply tenuousemphasis 11 hours agorootparentprevWith Bitcoin, you could create that third party in a trust minimized way, something impossible to do with the banking system. For instance, if the third party refuses to authorize a legitimate transaction, you have a third key you keep offline somewhere that can be used to force a transaction through. reply xelamonster 11 hours agorootparentThen your third key would be vulnerable to the same $5 wrench attack as your seed phrase is now. reply jncfhnb 5 hours agorootparentAnd if you lose the third key you are now beholden to the third party with no recourse reply nullc 9 hours agorootparentprevUnfortunately you can do awesome security stuff, but the threat comes from the perception of vulnerability, not the reality of it. reply throwawayffffas 16 hours agoparentprevYou could custom program a canary wallet. When the wallet makes a transfer it automatically calls 911 and sends the cops to your house or your phones location. reply koolba 17 hours agoparentprev> There really isn't a good way out of this. The answer is to live anonymously. Don’t flash the cash. reply flarex 17 hours agorootparentIt's becoming increasingly difficult. Data leaks, address and name leaks and chain analysis have made it easier to track who owns what. If crime agencies are able to track wallets down then criminals are too. reply throwawayffffas 16 hours agorootparentMaybe if your money is not on a public blockchain you don't have to worry about chain analysis. reply CaptainOfCoit 16 hours agorootparentOnly the your onramp/offramp would need to know who you are (because of KYC/AML), otherwise you can be as anonymous as you want and it really isn't hard, assuming you don't want to hide from your onramp/offramp. reply Banou 10 hours agorootparentOnramps/offramps generally generate individual wallets per user to send/receive from, so it still goes back to you at the end of the day. reply CaptainOfCoit 7 hours agorootparentThey either generate wallet address dynamically, and in those cases allow you to regenerate one at will. Or, they have wallets that acts as combined input/output for all/groups of users. I don't know a single big exchange that generates exactly one wallet per user and uses that one always for the same user. When you think about it, it makes a lot of sense they do it like that. reply valicord 14 hours agorootparentprevUnless of course you want to use your hard earned crypto to buy tangible things over the Internet. reply CaptainOfCoit 7 hours agorootparentWhy unless? Say you have 1 ETH in Wallet A, if you transfer it to your on/offramp (the exchange) and then do Wallet B, the only link between Wallet A and B is only known by the exchange, so you'll remain private (publicly, again assuming you don't want to hide from the exchange). reply throwawayffffas 4 hours agorootparentYou can't trust the exchange to not inadvertently leak the information. A substantial leak could include personally identifying information along with account balances and or deposit and withdrawal totals. reply CaptainOfCoit 4 hours agorootparentSomewhere along to lines, if you want USD, you need to trust someone, it's inescapable. So once you know this, you can act accordingly. But still, the original argument was that you have to worry about chain analysis because everything is public, but obviously that isn't true, no matter if an exchange may or maybe not inadvertently leak something. reply fakedang 16 hours agorootparentprevThis is the way. A friend of mine became insanely wealthy just off of Bitcoin. Immediately went off the grid a few years (back in 2017). Now owns a precious metals mining company in South America. Still holds Bitcoin, lives comfortably to a point, changed passports to evade sanctions (he was Russian), and even has a kind of his own private army, that's mostly involved in the mining business. You wouldn't figure all of that out by simply looking at him, but strike him now and you'd have to contend against a few major governments at this point. reply gverrilla 8 hours agorootparentYes private armies are VERY SECURE. reply fakedang 7 hours agorootparentWell it's practically a security corporation that has contracts with a major US ally. Their work is mostly for that government. But yeah, he basically lives like a dead man. reply tptacek 16 hours agorootparentprevI mean, that, or keep your money in a bank or brokerage. But yeah, I guess if you're not going to do that, git gud at opsec. reply lmz 17 hours agoparentprevMaybe if the exchanges didn't require KYC or phone, there would be no way of knowing where they live just from the exchange account. reply csomar 5 hours agoparentprevYou can have timed transactions with Bitcoin. That is the transaction will only be valid after xxxx date. You do, however, need to keep creating transactions to keep pushing the date further. reply flarex 17 hours agoparentprevThe decoy method doesn't even work because a smart criminal could just check your exchange withdrawals for amounts. You'd have to hope that they were ignorant enough. reply spencerchubb 18 hours agoparentprevMultisig wallet where you and your spouse both have to sign. In case one dies, the multisig can expire after a certain amount of time and let you access with just one key Of course this assumes you have a spouse reply KMnO4 18 hours agorootparentDon’t you live with your spouse?

Use 2 or 3 safety deposit boxes, they are very cheap. reply bruce511 13 hours agorootparentNot to be flippant, but your head is not terribly secure either. Coercion is a thing, and despite what you see in the movies, you'd be surprised at how fast you offer the password. But perhaps more certainly, you will at some point die, and it's probable you will do so lacking the capacity to pass the code on to your heirs. So if you want your wife and family to jnherit, well, you may want to rethink. And that's before we discuss thd uselessness of crypto as currency where you have to go to your safe deposit box to spend any of it. reply bufferoverflow 1 hour agorootparentYou misunderstood. Since your keys are stored encrypted in a safety deposit box, it doesn't matter if you're forced to tell your password to some random thug - they don't have access to your keys. You can also put your password in your will, if you're afraid of not passing it to your family. reply SV_BubbleTime 14 hours agorootparentprevThe faintest of ink will outlast the best of memory. reply justinclift 17 hours agoparentprev> There really isn't a good way out of this.

What I'd like to know, which wasn't in the release is how did the criminals identify or decide to target these specific victims. reply bnralt 17 hours agoparentOne of the reasons why this happens is because repeat violent offenders get away with a surprising amount.

E.g. https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/victimization-durin... FBI / UCR covers only reported crimes at police agencies that forward data, and is a subset. BJS tend to be better at getting realistic numbers. (E.g. a majority of burglaries aren't reported to the police, and thus don't show up in UCR*) Also robbery is not a superset of home invasion, due to the difference in definition from burglary. Burglary isn't actually about stealing stuff, it's just breaking in with the intent to commit some crime (which is often theft, but not always). Robbery implies theft, but doesn't require it to be in someone's abode. So there's some overlap, but there's robberies that aren't burglaries (because no breaking in is involved), and there's burglaries (even some of the how did the criminals identify or decide to target these specific victims.

    "originBody": "Emily F. Gorcenski Bio+CV Writing Math+Tech Talks Media Photos To Forget is an Ethical Act #twitter #personal 03.09.2024 On and off for the last several years I’ve been manually curating my roughly 40,000 lifetime tweets. I recently finished, and in the process embarked on an unexpected journey of self-discovery. In Regarding the Pain of Others, Susan Sonntag concludes with an observation that remembrance is an act with ethical weight and, as a corollary, that in the prevention of future suffering it is also sometimes necessary to choose to forget. The internet is disjointly fragile: some things last forever, and other things break suddenly and permanently. As I enter my middle ages, I’ve been contemplating what I leave behind, how I want to be seen, and how I want to be remembered. And, thinking of how Lord Byron had unpublished manuscripts burned after his death, I have similarly been thinking that some cleaning house is long overdue. I think it’s important to curate your digital presence, if not in real time, then certainly after the fact. Years ago I started undertaking this effort. It was a pass time for the most part: in 20 minutes on the U-Bahn I could delete a handful of tweets here or there. This casual activity got me shockingly halfway or so through the process. (I don’t know how many total posts I have lifetime, but my estimate is in the neighborhood of 40k). But I didn’t want this to go on another few years. I am entering a turning point in my life, my attitudes on social media have changed dramatically. I wanted to get it done. So I finally coded up a little script to help me out. This process was not so simple. I didn’t want to delete everything. Some of my posts have real archival value: my posts around Unite the Right or Sines v. Kessler I believe will have distinct historical relevance. I’ve also worked with biographers and historians who have already found them to be important and useful. So I wanted to be able to preserve those posts. This meant wholesale autodeletion was out. I would have to manually review every post. Revisiting every post came with emotional baggage. Many of the posts were cringe; several were from stupid internet arguments. Others were painful to watch, dredging up traumatic experiences or memories of loved ones who’ve passed. But reading them was also a unique and worthwhile experience. It gave me the opportunity to reflect on what I’ve learned from 10+ years of microblogging and, hopefully, has made me a better person. So that’s what this post is about: a litle self-retrospective on what brought me to where I am and, by extension, a little clue of where I might be going. Here’s what I’ve learned. Twitter was annoying We so belovedly called it the “hellsite” for good reason: the daily trek through the timeline was like tapdancing in a minefield. Twitter was awful because it rewarded awfulness. I’ve written before about how Twitter was a global chatroom and that meant there was a lot of coal to sift through to find any diamonds, but reflecting on 10 years of posts really highlighted how terrible everything and everyone—myself not excluded—was. Twitter users had a preternatural ability to infer context that was never present in a post. They’d assume the worst possible intention, they’d latch onto an extremely common and benign turn of phrase and then just destroy you over it. Everyday people logged onto the timeline looking for blood and if they didn’t find it they would create it themselves. The worst part of it was the self-certain belief that in doing so they were engaged in a legitimate and effective form of activism. If there was ever a valid criticism to be leveled against the perjoratively-designated “SJW” Twitter (once upon a time, before it was “CRT”, before it was “DEI”), it’s that people would simply badger someone until they changed the very language they spoke. Most of the time, it was just someone literally making something up thinking it sounded smart and progressive and then suddenly it became a shibboleth. God forbid you logged off to watch, I don’t know, a movie or a baseball game, and then logged back on to find that vocabulary shifted under your feet. Oh, you’re using transphobia instead of transmisia? Ableist swine. Oh, you’re using “MtF?” It’s “AMAB.” Oh, you’re using “AMAB?” Binarist asshole.1 These battles rage on today, and every time I poke my head back in I see people who by every other measure should be in community with each other tearing each other apart instead over minor invectives that have no analog-world equivalents. Having used Twitter for ten years meant being around long enough to have fought for normalizing certain language in everyday speech only to see people suddenly allege it to be bad as literal fascism. I’ve been openly queer for a very long time, and I remember keenly the fights to encourage straight people to use “partner” for their loved ones because it made social interactions more inclusive to queer people, only to watch a few years later as people would launch hundred tweet invectives about how it was “queer appropriation.” It was a dizzying experience. A shocking number of posts that I gleefully purged were deep threads about exactly these kind of debates. But it wasn’t just the micropolitics that made the site unbearable. Twitter had legitimate relevance and that meant it was a proving ground for actual politics. Which meant that few could resist the opportunity to dunk all over Glenn Greenwald or Michael Tracy for some headass take. Of course, this only increased their engagement which made them more culturally relevant and the site rewarded them with this behavior. People literally turned hate into profit, and the Twittersphere gleefully took part. The worst of this was how it turned us all into mean girls, everyone vying for the perfect, incisive burn. To some extent, that was better than engaging directly, giving credibility to awful ideologies, but it was not nearly as good as using the power of the platform to build something new and more powerful. The most power anyone ever had on Twitter wasn’t in using it as a laboratory for journalism and research—although many did and it mattered—it was in harassing the everloving bejeezus out of someone, laughing maniacally the whole time. Sarah Jeong’s heartrending farewell piece to the hellsite covers this. Jeong spent her time in conservatives' crosshairs (and, for a scary while, this could have meant literally), her obviously facetious tweets having been willingly taken out of context and used to impugn her. It’s not without a sense of irony and guilt that I note that this happened on the heels of her being named the New York Times technology editor, a post that was vacant because its previous resident, Quinn Norton, was bullied out of a job by left wingers outraged at her ties to the infamous neo-Nazi hacker, Andrew Aurenheimer. I remember this clearly because I was a part of that. Mea culpa. The harassment on Twitter often led to a pattern of people trying to defend themselves: I deleted hundreds of posts trying to defend against libelous claims about my past, which were of course propagated through selectively-cropped screenshots and removed from context. This never worked, this never made any progress. Likewise, the magic “accountability” people sought, which I wrote about years ago, was a myth. Recently Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez talked about how someone found her at a restaurant and hecked her, demanding to know when she would call Israel’s military interventions in Gaza a genocide. It didn’t matter much that she already did so months ago. Twitter brain is a prion disease that spreads offline. We don’t want the truth, we want to see your guts on the pavement! I deleted all that, oh how it gave me pleasure to do so. These arguments weren’t worth having at the time, they’re certainly not worth keeping all these years later. Nothing edifying ever came of them, only ruin, and my responsible and self-defensive act is to evaporate them for all time. The process was annoying Let me just say that I definitely gave myself a repetitive strain injury. In the last month I’ve curated over twenty-thousand posts and purged almost three-quarters of them. This meant a lot of clicking, but also copying and pasting post IDs. About two-thirds of the way through this process I managed to find some keybindings that made this slightly easier, but it wasn’t pleasant at any point. The process went something like this: because of Twitter’s rate limit—I could load 100 posts every 15 minutes or so—I wrote a script that would parse my Twitter archive calendar week by calendar week and open 50 posts at a time in a browser. Anything I wanted to delete I would delete, and anything I wanted to keep I would copy the ID to a text file. This would help me validate the curation later on, to make sure I didn’t miss anything. I arrived at this solution after trying several others. Initially, my casual curation relied on Twitter’s search. I would simply type from:emilygorcenski until:2018-01-31 into the search bar and go backwards from there, deleting as I went. I could do 100 posts very quickly in this way. But after Elon Musk bought the company to turn into his own little global therapy session, the search indexing simply stopped working. Moreover, I discovered a while ago that this method wouldn’t return any quote posts of posts from blocked, suspended, or deleted users, nor quotes from deleted tweets. This was a not-insignificant number of posts. The more manual approach I took showed me just how many posts were like that. I would estimate about half of what I deleted were replies to posts from suspended or blocked accounts, or deleted tweets, or accounts that blocked me. There was a huge amount of link rot, a lot of removed context. And while I realize I was contributing to that problem by deleting my posts as well, it felt a little like cleaning up an old battlefield. Of course, I also tried with the API. But this was even worse. The free tier allowed for five deletions per fifteen minutes, a comical number. I could have given Musk money (blech) to up this by a couple factors, but it was hardly worth it, since I still needed to manually curate anyways, it was easier to microbatch the process. Of course the site is decaying, it’s hostile to anyone trying to do anything interesting on it. After working with the fantastic Bluesky API, the frustration of Twitter’s inferior product was palpable. It’s impressive to see what the ATProto (Bluesky’s underlying protocol) community is doing. It’s an early sign of what Twitter could have been. Time is annoying I was watching Stranger Things in 2016? I started watching Wheel of Time in 2021?? This makes no sense. Pandemic time is fake, let’s face it, but I remember writing some of these tweets. The linear passage of time has no right to attack me like this. I was annoying All those indictments I laid out in the first section? I plead guilty, your honor, to those and to crimes not yet charged. I committed every sin in the book. I weaponized identity politics. I bullied the “intellectual dark web”. I dunked with regularity. I spread awful content because I was angry with it. I wrote irritatingly long threads about stuff I was barely aware of. I am not asking for absolution, here. Some of this was intentional. In the summer leading up to Unite the Right, I very deliberately made it all about me, so that the neo-Nazis marching into our town focused on me and not my peers who were doing the real organizing work. I trolled Andy Ngô, because I figured the more time he and his followers spent trying to harass and attack me, the less time they would spend on someone else. But this also empowered them, made his profile bigger, and I would eventually come to realize that the only winning move is to not play. Andy wrote a big chunk of his (in my opinion defamatory) book about me, but he hasn’t paid any attention to me in over a year. It turns out the best play was always to let it go—not ignore it, but not engage with it. Eventually, trolling right wingers just became who I was. I was good at it—I still laugh at how I got Zuby banned for saying “ok dude” to me and then him writing his most popular song about it—but eventually I realized I wanted to be more than just someone who clowns on completely replaceable conservatives. I’ve said before that there are times for builders and times for breakers and I wanted to stop being a breaker. There are more things I want to be known for. That’s why I walked away from the site over a year ago and haven’t been back. And that’s why I felt like it was time for me to curate what I want to survive from that time, at least publicly. I’ll probably keep my archive files around for a bit. I might even load them into a database to search and view on my website, eventually. The tweets aren’t forever gone, they’re just now locked in encrypted files that I need to decide what to do with. Maybe a future archivist studying Charlottesville and its impact on early 21st Century US politics will find some value in them. I don’t know. Why did people in the past save their letters, if not for the benefit of generations to come? We hardly write letters anymore. These are our letters. Maybe this is my little candle against the digital dark ages. But that’s not for the present. For the present, I’ve curated what remains. I was annoying, I still am. But the six-thousand some-odd tweets that I’ve retained still have some value to me, and the others do not. I may have been irksome but the journey was never boring. I’ve come to discover my tweets cited in several books, including several books by right wingers whining about “cancel culture.” I’ve had to explain tweets in court on two occasions (do not recommend—never tweet). My tweets were on the news and in the newspaper, I would see them float around Facebook as viral memes. They made their way into several court filings, even in cases I wasn’t party to. I made an actual difference with some of them, and I bought a lot of trouble on my own head with others. Some of them were even genuinely funny. I like to think I refined a sense of humor in this time. I became friends with celebrities, I helped shape front-page stories. I brough hurt and pain and stupidity, but I also like to think I brought a little laughter and wisdom, too. In the end, in ten years of active posting on twitter dot com, I only ever regretted one tweet: a tweet where I, a week before Unite the Right and with an overdose of hyperbole, said I would have punched James Damore in the face. That one was a mistake. I had to explain that one in court this summer. We learn and we continue to learn. What’s next? So what comes next after this grand exercise in after-the-fact prudence? I will keep my account, in case it ever has actual value to me. I still check in on a couple niche communities that haven’t migrated to a different social network yet. But I won’t be back unless the site radically changes, and I don’t think it will. I need to believe that that era of social media is dead. We can’t go back. We have to go forward. What that forward looks like, I am still trying to figure out. I tried Mastodon for a year, but I found it unbearingly sweltering. Mastodon is not a fun social network. You cannot have fun there without an endless army of pedants dissecting your every post endlessly in your mentions. Its operating model is inscrutable, its moderation metadrama impenetrable, and its product strategy nonexistant. I eventually rage-blocked the entire mastodon.social domain and then set my posts to autodelete after 7 days. I use it only as an automated relay for my blog content now. The one gem in the ActivityPub (Mastodon’s underlying protocol) space is bookwyrm.social, a federated replacement for Goodreads. The site isn’t bad. They need some design love and to fix some performance issues, but it’s become my go-to for book management, and I’m happy with it. My go-to social media now is Bluesky. The site is not without its dramas, but it has the most promising product and technical approach I’ve seen yet. The API is very open, which has allowed me to write some easy scripts to megablock bad actors. The “Feeds” function is fantastic, and the moderation tools aren’t perfect but they’re way ahead of anyone else’s. I’ve also made the site auto-curate: all my posts auto-delete after two days, unless I self-like a post. This way, I can still post my whims, but I can choose in real time what I want to endure. I’ve been running this way for a couple of months, and I have to say it feels incredibly fresh. Bluesky’s community is also much more averse to Twitter brain bullshit. Quote posts are possible but dunking is looked down on. The block function is brilliant—block and move on is the motto of the site. It means that the network there is much more pure and original. The one thing it lacks compared to Mastodon is that Mastodon was always much more receptive and supportive of DIY creation. I wish Bluesky to adopt that culture. But I am also trying to figure out what is next for me. As I write this, I’m forty-two, almost ten years after I started my transition process. The decade my transition bought back is coming to a close, and I’m finding myself trying to make a decision on what my next big thing is, if I even have one left in me at all. I feel like I’m on the edge of reaching the next level. I retired from activism, where I know I made an impact. I left Twitter, which was my means and medium of change. I’m even doing ok career-wise: I’ve built an amazing team, did some really intense stuff that made a difference in people’s lives. I’ve helped people write and publish books, seen the world, and left a positive impact on it in ways that have never and will never post about. I’ve taken the last year or two to step back a bit. I needed to focus on myself, my family, my health. I’ve read more books in the last 16 months than I have in the 16 years before them. I’ve ran 5k, 8k for the first time in my life. I’m able to do more situps now than at any point since I was probably 15 years old. I think I will be ok if the rest of what I do will just be putting around my house, reading books, grumbling about sports. But of all people my wife knows that I’ll be restless again before long. There’s a poem I’ve held with me for many years, Tennyson’s “Ulysses.” Everyone knows the famous final lines, “one equal temper of heroic hearts, made weak by time and fate…,” but every few years I come back to the poem to see how it speaks to me. It talks of Ulysses becoming restless in his old age, choosing not to fade into memory but to boldly tackle the world he once dared. It’s the first verse that speaks to me now: I cannot rest from travel: I will drink Life to the lees: All times I have enjoy’d Greatly, have suffer’d greatly, both with those That loved me, and alone, on shore, and when Thro' scudding drifts the rainy Hyades Vext the dim sea: I am become a name; For always roaming with a hungry heart Much have I seen and known; cities of men And manners, climates, councils, governments, Myself not least, but honour’d of them all; And drunk delight of battle with my peers, Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy. I am a part of all that I have met; Yet all experience is an arch wherethro' Gleams that untravell’d world whose margin fades For ever and forever when I move. How dull it is to pause, to make an end, To rust unburnish’d, not to shine in use! I, too, have another gear in me, if only I can find it. I’m looking for inspiration in the people I admire. People like Molly Conger, whose been with me step-by-step in so many ways since late 2017, who just launched an amazing podcast that is taking the country by storm. People like Molly White, who is doing some amazing and consistent impact journalism covering the tech industry. And, to be sure, many others not named Molly. I look up to these folks and what they’ve accomplished for themselves, for others, and in that admiration I want to find the clarity of mind and purpose the next step. I think I have some ideas, but I knew I couldn’t get to them as long as this was hanging over my head. And so this is the little bow I tie on a ten-year chapter of my life. To move forward I need to close the books on what holds me back. The past is mine to write and so too is the future. Now one have I written, and now search the words for to write the other. this is not to say these points were meritless, but rather that the relatively frictionless way that they became axiomatic and mandatory, as well as the way people are brutally and disproportionately criticized for using the “wrong” words (which were often the “right” words just months before) with no ill intent, is a phenomenon on Twitter with few equals. ↩︎ Posted: 03.09.2024 Built: 15.09.2024 Updated: 03.09.2024 Hash: 296a8ec Words: 3700 Estimated Reading Time: 19 minutes Impressum Designed with Bulma, built with Hugo Design inspired by Laura Baross and D2 2016-2024 © Emily Gorcenski All rights reserved Privacy policy",

I remember when I was in elementary school teachers would talk about minimizing time spent watching tv. Parents would be encouraged to tell their kids to minimize tv watching and spend more time reading. The point wasn’t to never watch tv. But to keep the time spent watching as little as possible. It was well understood that tv is addictive and a life spent in front of the tv is no life at all. But now we have the internet. Far more addictive than tv. People spend hours staring at the interactive tv that is the smartphone. People spend hours engaging in “activism” on the internet that feels good inside but accomplishes nothing. The feeling of false accomplishment feeds into the addiction. Everyone instinctively knows a life watching tv is a waste but people are deluded into thinking that a life on social media matters. In other words it’s all a drug. Makes you feel good but leads you to waste your life. Nobody says live and let live to a drug addict. “It’s not a hobby for them, it’s their whole personality” Just like a life lived like this is no life at all, a personality like this is no personality at all. reply bongodongobob 17 hours agorootparentNah.

With no representations of yourself on the net, you may as well not exist, and people are free to project anything whatsoever unto the tabula rasa of your nonexistent persona. While this is an excellent Rorshach for exposing the internal biases of others and demonstrating that even the staunchest progressives are also readily capable of misidentifying others or failing to recognize their \"self-identification\", the issue of not being seen for who one is and constantly \"misidentified\" also presents its own challenges. reply Yodel0914 18 hours agoparent> With no representations of yourself on the net, you may as well not exist, and people are free to project anything whatsoever unto the tabula rasa of your nonexistent persona I think this is only as issue if you are a “known” person in some regard. For most of us plebs, receding into anonymous nonexistence is likely a very healthy thing. reply ryandv 18 hours agorootparentEven while writing pseudonymously and innocuously you are at risk of being doxxed and subjected to mob \"justice;\" as an example of this see Scott Alexander's writings on Slate Star Codex. In light of this the safest recourse is to simply not post anything online at all, for fear of being doxxed at some point in the future (an inevitability given modern standards for and cultural attitudes towards privacy) and subjected to invective for years' old posts and writings. This is the culmination and terminal state of \"anonymous nonexistence\" you refer to. In this way the chilling effect achieves totality, and nobody feels comfortable sharing genuine thoughts online at all. It's arguable that this is a societally healthy state of affairs. reply Yodel0914 2 hours agorootparentScott/SSC is an interesting example. In my dichotomy of “known people” vs “plebs”, even behind a pseudonym Scott is far closer to the “known people” end. He writes about (sometimes) controversial stuff for a large(ish) and influential audience. He wants to be known and influential. I think he deserves the right to do so pseudonymously, but that’s tangential to my actual point. Most of us plebs do not want to be famous or influential, and therefore it doesn’t make a ton of sense to leave a trail of possibly regrettable or easily misinterpreted bits of data attached to our real names. reply seanhunter 12 hours agorootparentprevThe Scott Alexander thing is interesting to me in terms of how online dramas work because the drama assumes its own momentum and the facts struggle to maintain the pace. Scott Alexander was not in fact doxxed. He said in his final post before deleting his blog that the NYT planned to reveal his name, deleted his blog and the NYT published their article three weeks after he had already revealed his own name.[1] The pros and cons of whether they would have revealed his name became this massive hoo-hah and maybe they would have revealed his name given the chance but the fact is he was not in reality doxxed by anyone other than himself.

You can say or do anything and just make a new identity (as seen on sites like Reddit or even this) The idea of pseudo-anonymity is interesting. I’m not sure how it sound work, but would love to know if others could identify it. Only solution I can see is to stop being held accountable for every thought and action we’ve ever had.

I didn't have conclusive results because I just played with a few ideas, never really making it serious, but the idea has stuck with me as important for a long time now. In a finite space the pigeon hole principle says you eventually must take something out to put something new in so finding algorithms that efficiently forget are likely key to learning. I think this applies to neural networks and, I think, to society as well. You can't preserve every building for history. You can't remember every grievance or act of heroism.

Take just rendering (my area of expertise): There's game programming in general, OOP and ECS, input and update loops, setting up a window, common patterns, etc, necessary prerequisite stuff. Then there's rendering APIs and the GPU, e.g. learning about vertex/fragment shader concepts and syntax, buffers and uploading data, binding resources, making pipelines and such, etc. Then there's how to make an actual rendering _engine_, e.g. abstractions for batching entities, generating draw lists, command buffer recording for various passes, etc. Then there's lighting - analytic direct lights, many many forms of baked or realtime indirect lighting, BRDFs and PBR shaders, the pain that is shadow mapping, etc. Then on top of all that there's actually optimizing everything both from a CPU and GPU (shader) perspective. And that's _just_ rendering. Game engines are usually way more. Asset management, physics, UI, possibly scripting, possibly networking, animations, usually some sort of scene editor, etc. All of those with many many subfields and complexities. reply badsectoracula 10 hours agoparentWell, here is the thing though: you don't need most of that rendering stuff to learn how to make a game engine - if anything it might actually be better to not focus too much on the rendering as there are many people with the misconception that a game engine is really all about its renderer when in most engines it only is a small fraction of it (i remember checking my own engine some time ago and only around 10-15% of the codebase was about the rendering, i mentioned it to some Godot developer who said that this number checked with Godot too and years ago a AAA game i worked on also had the rendering bits be around 7-10% of the codebase too, so i think on average the percentage is more or less stable) and there are a lot more things going on. The content on the site seems to also follow, even quickly browsing from the materials there and despite using Vulkan (which is much more verbose than necessary), it still only mentions basic things like rendering sprites, meshes, some scene representation and leaves lighting and shadows (which only get a couple of paragraphs to describe the ideas behind shadow mapping) at the very end (up to that point everything is unlit/fullbright). Even lighting is only described at its basics and the page mentions some external resources to learn more if anyone wants to. reply nyjah 4 hours agoparentprevThis reminds me of an upper level cs class I took in college. Can’t exactly remember the course but it was a lot of logic and terminal. We had this long syllabus and barely made it thru 2 assignments. It was a mess. Great school, great teacher too. The next year I had another cs prof pull me aside and ask me what the hell happened in that class. And I didn’t have answer. It was an unfocused mess. But that syllabus used in the course old. It wasn’t the first time the prof had used it. Something changed between my freshman and sophomore years, 2005-2007. When I first took cs, no one was in the class. By the following year they were adding intro cs classes.

And it's a complicated one. We need to design complicated objects that precisely interface with each other. And often we don't want to just design a single object, but classes of objects, parameterized by variables. And we need to do this in collaboration. There are trivial cases, like a screw driver of varying length or the width of a table. Traditional geometric constraints can suffice here. But what if we want a key based of a list of numbers describing the heights of a lock's pins? Now we need programming. But that's only the beginning. We can abstract away the stupid work humans do in designing objects. We can build DSLs. We can unit test objects and put them on github.

Also, it is written in Haskell, so maybe there is finally some other useful project in Haskell other than the Haskell Compiler, as the joke goes. https://github.com/Haskell-Things/ImplicitCAD reply mytwoscents 6 hours agoprevhttps://build123d.readthedocs.io/ is IMO a much better choice than openscad and implicitcad.

Control flow, arithmetic and datastructures can be handled one level above in the transpiled language, because OpenScad never produces data – you can't ask it to determine the volume of an union for instance – so two way communication between your code and the geometric engine is not an issue.

I would reframe this a bit, otherwise someone not familiar with the book will take from your quote the exact opposite lesson from the one taught in The Mom Test. I believe the main lesson from the book is: - Don't talk to people about your ideas - Ask people about their actual use cases and frustrations - Figure out where they're struggling, investing effort and money. Let them talk - Don't ask people about your idea and don't ask them if they want it or not. You're only trying to validate the problem. Questions to ask: What's the hardest thing about [doing this thing]? Tell me about the last time you encountered that problem... Why was that hard? What, if anything, have you done to try to solve the problem? What don't you love about the solutions you've tried? [0]: https://www.onetake.ai (an autonomous AI video editor for SMBs) reply inapis 11 hours agoparent>don't ask them if they want it or not After reading the book my understanding was to not even ask this question. See if they have already tried to solve the problem by looking for another app or going to excruciating lengths to solve it another way. If yes, then they will probably buy your product. reply smogg 8 hours agoparentprevStrong +1 - the book is also very concise and full of practical advice. I wish we've put the learnings into practice even earlier in the process of building fragmentapp.io reply atoav 9 hours agoparentprevNot knowing the book, but this sounds a lot like a scientific mindset where people try not to bullshit themselves. This is good advice, many people who start out only see what they want to see. Yet, this can go into the other direction as well, where people tie themselves to the result of one poll or survey as they have lost touch with their customer base completely. As always: if people tell you about their problems aand things they dislike those things are real even if they don't make sense. If they tell you how to solve it they are most likely wrong. reply brumar 10 hours agoparentprevI second this recommendation for early startups. We learn from tons of lean books that customer discovery is crucial to not build the wrong thing, but this book gives very practical ways to do that well. Most recent useful read for me. Still in the lean canon, a great complementary read could be lean marketing, as validating your sales channel is of an equal importance of validating your PMF. reply code_biologist 11 hours agoprevThe first 25 pages of Steve Blank's Four Steps to the Epiphany (here's a PDF for some Stanford class [1]). Sounds very similar to The Mom Test, but presented from a much different angle. It diagnoses the startup failure mode of excessive focus on product over customer understanding. It hit me like a freight train after my first startup failed. His detailed examination of downstream consequences in other areas of the business, like sales and marketing, are just uncannily accurate to how they played out in my business. Validate, validate, validate. \"That's really cool\" is not validation from a customer. \"That's really cool. I want it. How much does it cost?\" is validation from a customer.

If it doesn't exist yet (and based on your submissions, it doesn't), you can start after reading The Mom Test. You might also want to read The Lean Startup. However, you can read a dozen books and still be stuck in the research phase. Reading alone doesn't create your startup. If you understand The Mom Test and apply its knowledge, you're ready to start. Be cautious of advice from people who have read hundreds of books on starting a startup - they may not have had the time to actually create one. Go validate your idea, and (hopefully) start building.

And for a bit of different approach, Make by Pieter Levels. This also recommends trying a lot of ideas and seeking what sticks, but perhaps with a more straightforward approach. reply lbriner 8 hours agoprevI think you need to be careful thinking that the books will be the most valuable input you can get as a Startup. The most basic skill of any business is to \"Sell what people want to buy\", as Paul Graham puts it. If you just sit and think about that, it encapsulates almost everything that is important about a business: To sell, people need to know about the product/business (marketing), you have to build it (development) and you have to sell it (sales). But you put good people in those roles and they will do their jobs but still not make much money. Why? People need to want to buy it and the main driver for that is a balance of a Customer-focussed Product Manager as well as a DNA of what the company is about and what it is offering. You want to make things customers want but they don't always know what they want and you might be selling something different, in which case your marketing message might be off. The books might say \"Always be closing\" or \"Marketing is everything\" or \"Deliver junk and iterate\" and these are all partial truths but they can also come at a cost to other more effective parts of the business. As the CEO, your job is to supervise those various levers/teams/departments so you need to know enough about them to understand if they are working, if the person running them is the right person and whether the changes you need to make are big and small! p.s. I enjoyed the Mom Test but I think if you have an open mind, a lot of that stuff you would work out just from experience. Good luck. reply ji_zai 5 hours agoprevToo many people fall into the trap of over consuming knowledge. The only knowledge that matters at the end of the day is experiential: the kind that is learned by doing. The kid who ships a product to a dozen users, learns and iterates with determination and focus, will have learned far more than the intellectual reading and waiting for the right opportunity to strike. Of course there is value in intellectual knowledge, but most are far from the optimal balance - too skewed towards the intellectual vs. engaging with, and learning from, reality. reply codingdave 5 hours agoparentBooks are an efficient way to transfer the experiential experience others have already gained over into your own reality. I agree that direct experience is more powerful, but with zero reading, you don't know what you don't know. People can over-read, and I've seen inexperienced management teams pass books around like candy instead of leading and doing, but there is a healthy balance where you read some, do more, and grow. reply ji_zai 4 hours agorootparentAgreed. My point was that most of us are far from the optimal - in the direction of overconsumption vs. actually doing. Ofc this is difficult to show with clear evidence. It's my intuition based on observing myself and conversations with other builders. reply pryelluw 6 hours agoprevRead “The ultimate sales letter”.

Hint 2: I noticed that when I set 1920x1080, the hardware decoder firmware changes it to 1920x1088, but the isp/encoder does not adjust in the 6.6.31 kernel. This leads to memory being out of range. However, if I set 1920x1088, all works fine. Run as Linux Service 1.

My idea was to have a camera making a time lapse video with the secondary effect of being able to be accessed by me from the internet so I can take a look at how the crew was doing. Unfortunately every single ideia that I have is already had and developed by anybody else. In this case, china. Ali express have some pretty good cameras that does that and more; with a better finish then a 3D print shitty case... 1 https://youtube.com/watch?v=5E7_40PWqiQ reply marcodiego 7 minutes agoparentSome (maybe most or all) of these devices require an external service to be used. That means it will work as longs as the service exists. You are in the hands of the vendor. My dream is to make devices like this and make them remotely accessible through Tor; that way it can be fully local but remotely accessible from anywhere in the world. reply yu3zhou4 1 hour agoprevNeat, I was looking for exactly something like this to run person detection! I'm using yolov3-tiny, not quite a new but very lightweight computer vision ML model, and just right now I'm trying to maximize performance of inference with C++, to perform real-time person detection around my house (I want to know when someone enters the parcel at night so a siren and lights can turn on automatically to deter the intruder) - https://github.com/jmaczan/yolov3-tiny-openvino reply jchoksi 2 hours agoprevAn alternative project I was looking to use with my Raspberry Pi Zero WH's was mediamtx. https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx?tab=readme-ov-file#ra... reply gz5 1 hour agoprevnice use of WebRTC, which somehow is still underutilized. >If you're self-hosting and you want to access the signaling server remotely via mobile data, you may need to set up DDNS and port forwarding if your ISP provides a dynamic IP. this also exposes your server to the internet. instead you can use one of the open source solutions which creates a private connection between your Pi and server (so there is no network access to the server - make it unreachable), and doesn't require static IPs or port forwarding. reply Sean-Der 1 hour agoparentIt’s my passion in life to see WebRTC utilized to its full potential! When I learned about P2P/NAT Traversal I could never go back :) Why do you think it’s had trouble? Poor software, educational materials etc… always looking for new projects reply nubinetwork 1 hour agoprev> Raspberry Pi 5 [...] do not support v4l2 hardware encoding I'm not sure I get the point of that... they go through the effort for video decoding, but why doesn't it have an encoder? reply Sean-Der 1 hour agoparentMy assumption is the amount of people encoding is much smaller then decoding. overlap exist in encode/decode. When working on a Opus codec I did have a fair amount of code distinct to one path still. reply bmh 1 hour agoparentprevThey decided to use the silicon space for other things. The Pi5 CPU is powerful enough to decode most h264 streams in software. The Pi5 has an h265 hardware decoder. reply hcfman 1 hour agorootparentShame. Cause h265 is problematic wrt licensing etc. I would have preferred that they kick out h265 and used the silicon for h264. And maybe the pi5 has enough cpu to do the decoding. But how much would be left over for more interesting AI tasks ? reply moffkalast 7 minutes agorootparentWell it's not fast enough for most AI tasks as it is, you'd need to offload that bit to a pcie accelerator. reply bmh 1 hour agorootparentprevI agree 100% reply hcfman 1 hour agoprevVery nice to be able to see how to do this C. reply hcfman 57 minutes agoprev [–] very small amount of code to make a functional webrtc implementation. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
