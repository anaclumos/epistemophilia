    "commentBody": "Bitwarden SDK relicensed from proprietary to GPLv3 (github.com/bitwarden)863 points by ferbivore 20 hours agohidepastfavorite330 comments solarkraft 4 hours agoI’m relieved. Maybe the company would have survived this somehow, but they sure wouldn’t have been the techies’ darling anymore and that was going to be expensive. I hope they realized that being FOSS is their moat and it nets them a lot of goodwill (it’s the whole reason I bother with their not-quite-the-best product in the first place). The bold claim „the most trusted password manager“ was kind of justifiable while it was FOSS (if we don’t count keepass), without it not at all. I’m still not sure how I feel about them now. I can now somewhat trust that the applications will remain free software, but trust in the company has eroded a bit. I still haven’t seen official communication about this. reply apitman 2 hours agoparentI'm cautiously optimistic, but still concerned about the long term. * I just don't see how taking $100 million can be good for users in the long run. By far the most likely outcomes are bloat or enshittification. * bitwarden does not appear to be very forkable, ie it's a complex system written in C#. The existence of Vaultwarden helps a lot with this, but what about the client apps? Forkability is the second most important protection against user-hostile action, behind being open source in the first place. I hope it works out. I'm a recent adopter of bitwarden, and so far the UX has blown keepass out of the water. reply _bin_ 43 minutes agorootparentThe client apps can pretty easily be forked and maintained. We probably wouldn't see much feature growth but I also don't think we need that so much. Lots of OSS projects have been messed up by fundraising and communities often just fork them and keep them around so I'm not too worried. Besides, garbage features could probably just be unsupported by Vaultwarden, which has worked extremely well for me and been nothing but stable. reply whimsicalism 3 hours agoparentprevthe gh or had official communication. it was obviously a dep issue blown out of proportion reply itfossil 7 hours agoprevNice to see Bitwarden make a course correction here. I wasn't looking forward to switching to another password manager, so I'm quite happy. reply ryukafalz 7 hours agoparentYeah, likewise. I'm a Bitwarden subscriber but I'd been looking into alternatives recently because of the licensing kerfuffle. But switching password managers is a pain, so I'm glad to not feel like I have to now. reply spl757 3 hours agorootparentKeePassXC (and I assume the other versions) can import an encrypted JSON Password Protected (NOT Account Restricted) export from Bitwarden. I use them both. I have KeePassXC for my local machine, and Bitwarden for things I may need out and about. With the browser plugins for both it's not that hard to manage them both, at least in my opinion. I was hoping to see some course correction on this from Bitwarden, even if the over-stated impact was really just to the SDK. They appear to understand the look of their licensing move was going to cost them more than it probably should have. Most companies refuse to change course at all, so I at least see it as encouraging. edit to fix a typo reply sirdvd 5 hours agorootparentprevSwitching is decisively a pain. But apparently this episode was what I needed to start looking seriously into VaultWarden. reply horsawlarway 4 hours agorootparentHuge VaultWarden fan here. It's been running absolutely unattended for about 3 years from a machine in my basement now, and it's great. I back things up fairly often, but otherwise I would have no idea I'm not just using the enterprise grade Bitwarden license. Things just work, features are there. Side-note - VaultWarden is incredibly reliable for a self-hosted free solution (I have 1 pod restart 27 days ago due to a power outage, but otherwise it basically does not fall over. No memory leaks, no high cpu consumption, no reliability problems) reply BrandoElFollito 3 hours agorootparentSame here - I just see that versions change from time to time (yeah I know I should do that manually but there we are). One thing I do not like (or, say, \"miss\") in Bitwarden/Vautwarden is the ability to make decrypted backups. I run the service for my immediate family and would like to have access to some people's passwords (of course with their agreement) to make sure they are fine. A solution is to use Organizations but you cannot have a \"organization-only account\" - an account that would exclusively save to an organization without a private vault. The \"solution\" is to tell people to move what they save to such and such Org but this works fine with me, recently with my wife but somehow my father does not do it and we sometimes end up with tense moments when it is time to get to some accounts :) reply idonttalkenough 4 hours agorootparentprevTacking onto this comment as another thumbs up for vaultwarden. \"incredibly reliable\" is exactly the way to describe it, in the world of tech headaches the password manager is the last thing you want to be worrying about and I can say with confidence that vaultwarden is a reliable well-oiled machine. Backups are also fairly easy so if need be a DR can be done (and automated) with very little hassle. The vaultwarden backend does depend upon the bitwarden apps for client devices but also features it's own web UI. reply cmeacham98 4 hours agorootparentYour comment was marked dead FYI, I vouched for it. Normally this would mean you are shadow banned, but I don't see any other comments in your history getting this treatment - perhaps this comment caught the ire of some anti-spam algorithm. reply xelamonster 2 hours agorootparentI mean it reads like ad copy, and the entire first paragraph takes so many words to say nothing more than \"I agree.\" As comments go, I have to say I've seen better. reply Brian_K_White 1 hour agorootparentI got more out of it than this one. reply hedora 4 hours agorootparentprevOld versions of vaultwarden broke recently (for just about everyone?) due to incompatible changes on the iOS client. Breakage is not ideal, but here's how they handled the second, more subtle compatibility break: https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/issues/5069 I haven't worked up the courage / time to back up my database and upgrade the docker container; will probably get to it this weekend. However, I can't imagine using bitwarden with the official server (too bloated to be trustworthy), or with their cloud thing. I got burnt by lastpass. I'm not putting my passwords in a giant high-value target again. reply apitman 2 hours agorootparentprevVaultwarden is great, but it's only half the equation. If bitwarden does go user-hostile eventually, who's going to fork all the client apps and extensions? reply AzzyHN 3 hours agorootparentprevVaultWarden is great. But I don't use it, because I trust Bitwarden's infrastructure more than my own, for now at least. reply slenk 2 hours agorootparentprevI found psono and spun up a self-hosted instance. I may just try to keep them in sync for a while while this business fully settles reply creesch 6 hours agorootparentprevAre there other alternatives that are 1) open source 2) offer the same integration to begin with and finally 3) have been audited or are popular enough to be under constant scrutiny? There is of course the KeePass ecosystem, but that is why I included my second point, as with KeePass you are responsible for vault syncing, having clients for all platforms, etc. I suppose that it is good to be aware of other options. At the same time, jumping ship so easily also doesn't seem realistic or ideal behavior to me. reply WD-42 4 hours agorootparenthttps://www.passwordstore.org/ reply zie 4 hours agorootparentprevI have no affiliation, just found them this week, but https://psono.com/ exists. So 1 and 2 are met and 3 is half-way there maybe? It's a self-audit but they have been around a while. Apache2 licensed. Again, I literally found them the other day, and other than a cursory check to make sure the UI/UX is friendly enough to compete with BW or 1P, I haven't had a chance to look through their code at all yet. I have no idea if the promises they document are met. reply chickahoona 15 minutes agorootparentHi, Sascha here, the main developer behind Psono. Psono has been audited multiple times so far, usually on a yearly bases. The last one here https://psono.com/blog/security-audit-2024 (you will also find a link to the audit itself) reply KPGv2 5 hours agorootparentprevThe audited part is going to be tough to meet because it's a very niche skill people generally won't do constantly for free. reply hedora 4 hours agorootparentprevI decided that vaultwarden should not have an internet accessible port. Are there any that meet those requirements and also let you (reliably!) edit/create passwords when offline? Also, sometimes the bitwarden client decides to blow away my local copy of the password database. I'd like it to store it pesistently on all machines so I have to lose my phone, my laptop, my vaultwarden server and its two backups before I get locked out of everything. Currently, the phone + laptop don't count as backup copies. reply BrandoElFollito 3 hours agorootparent> I decided that vaultwarden should not have an internet accessible port So how does your browser extension work when outside your LAN? via Tailscale or similar VPN mesh? And for people who use it outside of the LAN entirely? reply hedora 2 hours agorootparentThe app (and iOS keyboard integration) degrades to read only mode. It works about 95% of the time. I'd rather it work 100% of the time, and be read-write. I don't run the browser extension. (There have been too many other password managers with exploitable password bugs.) reply g19fanatic 4 hours agorootparentprevi use the keepass ecosystem with app.keeweb.info. Its an open source webclient that can directly pull from your google drive (and other places!). I use a google drive through keeweb for syncing, 2 clicks and its syncd. Auto pulls when past pw. keepass works in browser (how I use it on a computer), can work offline (which is good in air-gapped instances, one of my reqs) and works directly on my android phone without issue. reply creesch 29 minutes agorootparentIt is actually sort of how I used it as well, though through nextcloud. It did still remain a hassle. It also requires all different apps to be maintained and equally safe. Keeweb for example has not had an active maintainer since 2022 https://github.com/keeweb/keeweb/issues/2022 reply Glazui 5 hours agorootparentprevI‘ve recently learned about PassBolt, but it doesn’t meet criteria 3 I’m afraid reply blendergeek 17 hours agoprevThank you to Bitwarden for relicensing a thing to Free/Open License! Unfortunately, I no longer recommend Bitwarden for normal people because the built-in password manager in Firefox is too good. But for anyone with more advance needs (or who doesn't trust a password manager built into a web browser, I always recommend Bitwarden because KeepassXC + syncing is way too difficult for normal people. reply jasode 6 hours agoparent>, I no longer recommend Bitwarden for normal people because the built-in password manager in Firefox is too good. But a lot of \"normal people\" actually need a secrets manager which is larger in scope than just a \"websites urls passwords manager\". This means a password manager with extra metadata fields for users to add notes, associated email aliases, etc. E.g. if a website has an extra step of \"Confirm your identity by answering this question : What was your childhood pet's name?\", users want a place to save the answer (\"BugsBunny\") in the \"notes\" field of a password manager.) Another example would be the secret PIN unlock code for the spouse's phone. That's not a website url, it's just a \"secret\" that needs to be stored in an encrypted file. Firefox password manager is too bare-bones with the only 2 fields being \"Username\" & \"Password\". The better UI/UX for normal people is to have a unified app to store all their secrets instead of having some secrets in the Firefox password manager and other non-web-url secrets saved separately in yet another app. reply cryptos 6 hours agorootparentI completely agree with you! Almost everyone needs to store more than only usernames and passwords for websites. Think of PIN for credit cards and the like. reply PawgerZ 5 hours agorootparentprevBitwarden also stores authenticator keys for MFA and passkeys. The custom fields, notes section, and attachments are invaluable to me as well. reply socratics 1 hour agorootparentprevAbsolutely, everyone I recommend BW to appreciates the notes feature as well - it's handy to have a place to jot down important things that aren't log-ins! reply qwertyuiop_ 5 hours agorootparentprevThis ^ passwords just don’t live in Firefox when you are using apps that need passwords across platforms (mac ios windows) and apps. This is where Bitwarden shines. reply jvdvegt 2 hours agorootparentI don't know about iOS, but Firefox syncs my passwords between my Linux machine and Android phone just fine. reply danpalmer 16 hours agoparentprev> Unfortunately, I no longer recommend Bitwarden for normal people because the built-in password manager in Firefox is too good Interesting, I've always felt that browser-based password managers provided remarkably little value for most people. Using them on mobile is tricky and platform dependent, it's easy to have local-only, non-synced data and then lose it, and being multi-device is trickier, especially in a work context. On the other hand, people generally understand installing an app on each device they own and that app doing it for them. reply simfree 15 hours agorootparentFirefox password sync just works. It's one of those things I never think about. Watching friends and family struggle with bespoke, poorly integrated password managers makes me cringe and is one of the big reasons I enjoy the seamless experience of the built-in Firefox password manager. reply danpalmer 14 hours agorootparentDoes it require a Firefox account? Does it only store them locally if you haven't signed in to Firefox? This is the sort of failure I've seen, where people think their passwords are synced but because they didn't sign in years ago it's actually not backed up at all. At least on Chrome you get reminded of that all the time on YouTube/Google search, etc. I know for Safari all the sync is via iCloud meaning if you're not signed in it's locally stored and vulnerable in that way. Especially as many people can't/don't sign in to their own iCloud on work computers, or don't have a Mac. reply neobrain 6 hours agorootparent> Does it require a Firefox account? Does it only store them locally if you haven't signed in to Firefox? The passwords are available offline, so they are stored locally. reply notpushkin 14 hours agorootparentprevFirefox reminds you a bunch of times, too. Would be nice if you could just link a new device via QR code (creating an account for you in the background). reply codys 13 hours agorootparentThe original Firefox sync worked like this (with a unique code and pairing instead of an explicit account) (this is so on the nose I suspect you may know this). This blog post goes over some of that history: https://blog.mozilla.org/services/2014/04/30/firefox-syncs-n... reply callahad 13 hours agorootparentDidn't expect to click on that link and end up on a blog post I wrote 10 years ago! The old Firefox Sync / PAKE stuff was fantastic for getting sync going between devices... but people wanted backup, not sync. I wonder if we'd do anything differently confronted with the same challenge today. reply g8oz 4 hours agorootparentHey I love the syncing reply nox101 13 hours agorootparentprevit just works for websites. it does not \"just work\" for apps where as the platform ones do or have a chance to work with apps. Kind of hope regulation will force apple/google/ms to allow iterations for 3rd parties to integrate with the os but on the other hand that will open a host of issues reply joshvm 11 hours agorootparentIt does on iOS, but I believe the onus is on the app developer to enable the autofill feature in the form, or at least make sure that the app hints to iOS that it can be filled with a password. I'm making that assumption because there are lots of apps which don't trigger the native Apple password manager either (which is a lousy user experience). However, if one works then both do. The UI offers a choice of password manager and Face ID works to unlock it. I use both. Apple's manager supports OTP generation which is nice, but on desktop websites, Firefox is often more convenient. reply phs318u 7 hours agorootparentI use the Strongbox app on iOS [0] and the KeepassXC app my Linux laptop. The passwords.kdbx file sits on my Onedrive, which the Strongbox app can access. On Linux I use a Onedrive client [0] that I use to sync several folders within my home folder. Strongbox supports both Keepass and pwSafe database formats. It also integrates well with iOS, with autofill supported (also supports Yubikey unlock and Apple Watch unlock). [0] https://apps.apple.com/app/strongbox-password-manager/id8972... [1] https://abraunegg.github.io/ reply BodyCulture 3 hours agorootparentThis discussion is about an open source password manager. I wonder why you are recommending a closed source software? Are you aware that many people prefer open source for security software for a reason? reply delfinom 6 hours agorootparentprevYep, it's the same problem on Android. Some app developers go full asshole with the password text boxes. There was one electric utility here that I lambasted hard and they finally fixed their form which not only didn't trigger the password manager, it literally blocked all pasting. reply monocularvision 1 hour agorootparentpreviOS already has all of the API required to integrate a password manager with the OS. Third party password managers can already integrate with both browsers and apps to provide passwords and password generation reply mikae1 14 hours agorootparentprevBut does it work for non-website passwords like the PIN for the door at your workplace or the usernames and passwords for your computers? reply archermarks 14 hours agorootparentYes. You can add whatever passwords. It asks you for a URL but you can put anything in. reply gouggoug 14 hours agorootparent> It asks you for a URL but you can put anything in. Well, that’s kind of the problem isn’t it? Yes, you can put bogus URLs, but it’s far from a great user experience reply RamRodification 11 hours agorootparentdoor://businesstreet/23/A/front reply dbolgheroni 6 hours agorootparentNot supported. It can't be anything. reply globular-toast 10 hours agorootparentprevSomeone understands URLs! The URL will be 30 years old soon[0], and still many people don't know what it really is. [0] https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1738 reply bowsamic 10 hours agorootparentprevNo end user understands URLs this way. Unless Firefox teaches them this, then this is nonsense reply RamRodification 9 hours agorootparentYes, It's a joke. Sorry reply eitland 7 hours agorootparentWhy not both? reply bowsamic 9 hours agorootparentprevIs it? I thought you were being serious reply RamRodification 9 hours agorootparentYes, it's a joke. Sorry. reply tverrbjelke 5 hours agorootparentWhere is the joke? I don't get it! reply bowsamic 8 hours agorootparentprevWhy, though? Isn't it actually a good suggestion? reply nutrie 7 hours agorootparentAgree! And it's funny. reply INTPenis 10 hours agorootparentprevTechnically maybe someone could make you navigate to that url in the future, through mitm or some sort of DNS poisoning, and autofill a form with your password and then auto submit it. reply Nathanba 8 hours agorootparentprevthat's not my experience, I've lost bookmarks due to firefox sync multiple times. reply ClassyJacket 13 hours agorootparentprevCan Firefox password manager work in other apps on Android? reply attendant3446 10 hours agorootparentLooks like yes[1] 1. https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/end-of-support-firefox-... reply kome 9 hours agorootparentprevyes and it's perfect. firefox (with ublock) are really the best experience on android. reply _fs 14 hours agorootparentprevDoes it have the ability to unlock with faceID on ios? reply phaerus_iconix 14 hours agorootparentYes it does. reply jorvi 6 hours agorootparentprevThat is such a laughable statement. 1Password has incredible UI/UX. Even has e-mail masking with Fastmail. And auto-enters TOTPs, for the less-important one’s you feel comfortable saving in your password manager. reply miki123211 12 hours agorootparentprevFirefox sync made the criminal sin of implementing end-to-end encryption, enabling it by default, and being insufficiently clear to people that their passwords are lost forever when they forget the master password. This provides a really terrible UX to \"normal\" users. I woulnd't recommend that option to anybody who doesn't already know what E2E is and what tradeoffs it has. Google's implementation is a lot better in that regard, at least they offer plenty of avenues for account recovery. reply KPGv2 5 hours agorootparentCan you identify the password managers that do not implement end-to-end encryption so I can avoid them forever? reply bandrami 11 hours agorootparentprevPresumably the passwords themselves have recovery/reset procedures? I can't think of a good reason to add another risk surface to a password manager given that reply mrwm 15 hours agorootparentprevI'm not sure how it is on iOS, but I've been using firefox as my password maanger on android. It's a trivial change in the settings and works across all apps as well. I also recommend it to my friend group, as they can use firefox with uBlock Origin, and also have their passwords synced. reply tetris11 5 hours agorootparentYep, since Android 12 I think you can set Firefox as your main password manager. It's genuinely delicious reply lrem 12 hours agorootparentprevAll serious browser vendors offer sync to logged in users. That’s multi-device, cross platform and pretty foolproof. I still prefer Bitwarden because of self-hosting and integrating nicely with the iOS ecosystem. But there’s not much wrong with the browser approach. reply usrusr 11 hours agorootparentMulti device is all nice and well, but what if you use products from more than one browser vendor? reply lrem 3 hours agorootparentThen you’re a rare corner case that’s served by something third party. reply CJefferson 10 hours agorootparentprevI have the opposite problem. If I forget to log into bitwarden, passwords just get saved into firefox / chrome, so now I've got some passwords in bitwarden, some in chrome, some in firefox, and worst of all bitwarden doesn't seem to have an easy way to unify these databases. reply trinsic2 4 hours agorootparentThat's a bit much to put on a 3rd party password manager. reply floydnoel 14 hours agorootparentprev> people generally understand installing an app on each device they own and that app doing it for them. an app like Firefox or Chrome, perhaps? reply danpalmer 11 hours agorootparentThis is obviously true for the HN crowd, but for normal people I think there's a distinction. Don't underestimate the value of centering a brand and an icon on a home screen around a single function. reply JoshTriplett 13 hours agorootparentprev> Interesting, I've always felt that browser-based password managers provided remarkably little value for most people. They provide the value of \"you should, by design, have no idea what most of your passwords are; if you know any significant number of your passwords you probably have bad passwords\". And both Firefox and Chrome sync passwords between devices. reply wruza 8 hours agorootparentThis is the value of any password manager, not a browser-based one. reply wrasee 8 hours agoparentprevIf Mozilla released a separate passwords app so you could manage and access your passwords outside of Firefox I think the two would be more comparable. That would promote your passwords as part of your Mozilla account, not just Firefox. Bitwarden excels here, and i think is the model to beat. However, Mozilla would have the advantage since their browser integration would essentially be built-in and first class. Otherwise, unless you use Firefox exclusively for everything I just don't think a single browser is the right place to manage passwords. I would say that's true even for a broad audience, given the importance of passwords and security in the modern age. Bitwarden is also nice in that you can \"lock\" access to your passwords while keeping the browser open. That way, for the 99% of the time you're just browsing the internet you essentially don't have access to all your passwords \"open\". The last time I looked at this I had to enter my master password on opening Firefox, even if I didn't need access to my passwords. That meant that \"unlocking your vault\" is essentially tied to opening the browser. That alone was enough for me to bail on it. reply openopenopen 8 hours agorootparent> If Mozilla released a separate passwords app so you could manage and access your passwords outside of Firefox I think the two would be more comparable They used to have one called LockWise https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/end-of-support-firefox-... reply greensh 8 hours agorootparentprevthere used to be an android/ios app by mozilla called lockwise which did exactly that iirc. https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/end-of-support-firefox-... reply wrasee 7 hours agorootparentAh yes I remember that now, I had forgotten about that! Funny, especially now that I see Apple are now going the other way with a dedicated \"Passwords\" app on iOS 18 and macOS 15.

It's a shame as I think Mozilla could really compete well in this space. They are both cross-platform, have their their own browser and have a good reputation on privacy. It's a killer combo.

I see so many \"I don't trustso I use dropbox\" comments around these parts and I just don't understand what real or perceived threat is being mitigated. reply Brian_K_White 12 hours agorootparentIt's valuable that the syncing mechanism is seperate because that makes it agnostic. Parent comment uses Dropbox, I use Google Drive, someone else uses OneDrive, someone else uses iCloud, someone else uses Syncthing or Nextcloud, etc. You don't have to trust the single cloud provider to encrypt and not be able to spy. The vault is encrypted on your own device using fully open software, and the cloud only ever sees a blob they have no keys to, directly or indirectly. The encrypting/decrypting software was not written by the cloud provider. You don't have to trust any single cloud provider to stay up, be available in your country, stay friendly to you. If Dropbox goes down or kills your account, you just flip to any of 20 other options. You say you don't understand why someone prefers Dropbox over the special custom syncing, but I don't understand what the excuse is for a special vendor-specific implimentation of something that is already generic and agnostic. It's like using a browser that uses it's own version of http to download files and only works with one web site that has the matching special server. It's not a remotely equivalent comparison between \"one cloud\" and \"another cloud\". One is a single vendor-specific, custom purpose, single-provider thing, the other is agnostic and infinite, use any method you want from any provider you want any time you want. For me it's not about \"mitigating a real or percieved threat\". It's just basic system resilience and principle to avoid special things and prefer generic/agnostic things, and keep concerns seperated. But it is also more secure not to trust any integrated cloud provider, vs having the cloud be just storage that doesn't know anything about the blob being stored, and can't even if they turn bad, or are pressured by a government, or get hacked, etc. reply chpatrick 14 hours agorootparentprevI guess the idea is that you trust open source software to encrypt the vault, so Dropbox couldn't do anything with it even if they wanted to.

Especially keeping passkeys platform-independent is a huge advantage, in my view. reply freedomben 16 hours agorootparentThere will always be different opinions, but my opinion is that storing your TOTPs in your password manager is at best a reduction in security because you're reducing your 2 factors down to 1 factor. If the password manager gets compromised (even phished! It needn't involve the password manager's servers getting hacked), then you gain nothing by having 2FA enabled. I would strongly advise using something like Aegis on Android, or Gnome Authenticator on desktop (or both). I like to duplicate/backup my seeds so that I'm not SOL if my phone breaks, but I do it by having them on my laptop, desktop, and phone. That way as long as I have one of the three devices, I can always get in, and then they're not \"in the cloud.\" Though, \"in the cloud\" is still better than \"in the cloud alongside all my passwords.\" reply dcow 14 hours agorootparentThe only true 2nd factor is a setup where your totp codes live on a separate piece of physical hardware. If your totp codes are in an app on your phone, and your password is in a different app on your phone, you're not pure 2nd factor despite convincing yourself that you are. Anything that is convenient is not real 2FA. Real 2FA needs to be pick two of: a password in your head, a verifiable biometric signature, a code/key on your phone or separate physical hardware yubikey. I'm not saying I think everyone needs real 2FA. I think 99.999% of the time storing your 2FA codes in your PW manager, or just moving on to Passkeys, is the right answer. 2FA is a hack put in place to mitigate passwords being relatively insecure and phishable. It's supplanted by Passkeys. reply freedomben 5 hours agorootparentI think you're letting perfect be the enemy of good. It doesn't have to be pure 2FA to be better than 1FA. Being in separate apps does give some benefits. It's always going to be harder to compromise two apps than it is to compromise just one of them (even if the difficulty increase is marginal, it's non-zero). Often simply not being low-hanging fruit is enough to save you from an attack. There are plenty of things for which a 2FA in PW manager is fine, but the most important things I think it's an unnecesary and regretful reduction in security. For example, email account. Email is the \"forgot password\" way to get access to almost everything, so it's worth a trifling inconvenience in having to load your 2FA into a different app. Same with things like AWS, Cloudflare, and other high-value targets. For the vast majority of people, keeping your Twitter seeds in your PW manager is fine, but it's foolish to do that with your email and other high-value targets, and IMHO if you're already going to have to have two apps, you might as well just standardize and keep the seeds in your authenticator app, and your passwords in your vault. YMMV reply dcow 2 hours agorootparentNo I’m specifically not. Did you read my 2nd paragraph? It’s essentially your argument here. The person I was responding to was arguing that totp in pw manager is no good. Maybe you meant to reply to them and not me? reply freedomben 51 minutes agorootparentI did read your second paragraph. There is some ambiguity, but I ultimately decided you weren't agreeing with me because you said (emphasis added): > I think 99.999% of the time storing your 2FA codes in your PW manager, or just moving on to Passkeys, is the right answer. If you're storing your 2FA codes in your PW manager, then you're NOT using separate apps. You're using the same app (your PW manager). My argument is that you should use separate apps for the things that matter, like your email (which can be used to get access to almost every other account), and since you're already using separate apps for those things, you might as well just be consistent so you don't have to remember where each TOTP token is stored. I see three levels we've discussed: 1. Pure 2FA using hardware token or equivalent (which I agree is rarely needed) 2. Impure 2FA but separate app for storing passwords and TOTP tokens (which I'm advocating for) 3. Storing TOTP tokens in PW manager (which you appear to be arguing for in 99.999% of cases, which is basically all of them) If you are actually advocating for level 2, then we agree, but from reading your 2nd paragraph it seems pretty clearly to be arguing for level 3. reply lxgr 2 hours agorootparentprev> Anything that is convenient is not real 2FA. That's a pretty user-hostile attitude. Sure, some combinations of factors are pretty unergonomic, but I'd call that a bug, not a feature. It's also incorrectly suggesting that somehow complexity/painful usability automatically yields security, while usually the opposite is true: An effective secure authentication solution absolutely must consider usability, or it's doomed to be circumvented by users in one way or another (either via some insecure practice, or by your users simply ceasing to be your users). reply KPGv2 5 hours agorootparentprev> Real 2FA needs to be pick two of: a password in your head, a verifiable biometric signature, a code/key on your phone or separate physical hardware yubikey. My thumbprint isn't stored on my phone, so I have two factors. From the PCI Security Standards supplement on MFA, > The issue with authentication credentials embedded into the device is a potential loss of independence between factors—i.e., physical possession of the device can grant access to a secret (something you know) as well as a token (something you have) such as the device itself, or a certificate or software token stored or generated on the device. As such, independence of authentication factors is often accomplished through physical separation of the factors; however, highly robust and isolated execution environments (such as a Trusted Execution Environment [TEE], Secure Element [SE], and Trusted Platform Module [TPM]) may also be able to meet the independence requirements. So your phone can constitute a token, while the biometric constitutes the second factor. I don't know about Apple phones, but Google's requirements for biometrics are: > Capturing and recognizing your fingerprint must happen in a secure part of the hardware known as a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). > Hardware access must be limited to the TEE and protected by an SELinux policy. > Fingerprint data must be secured within sensor hardware or trusted memory so that images of your fingerprint aren't accessible. reply dcow 2 hours agorootparentI think you misunderstood me. I agree that biometric plus password or device key would constitute two factors. I perhaps believe that you can’t really trust the device to have performed biometric verification without some sort of software attestation. So if the security if your protocol depends on two factor, you’d need to yes have a biometric signature or remote attestation that a biometric check has been performed. reply czarit 12 hours agorootparentprevThis depends on the threat model. Having 2FA in the PW manager defends against someone phishing the password and database leaks on the server side, which are the most common in my threat model. But note that if they can phish your pw, they can probably phish your 2FA as well. It does obviously not protect against the scenario where someone is breaking into your password vault. I tend to enable 2FA but conveniently save the token in the PW manager for relatively low equity stuff, just to make it less enticing for an attacker, but use hardware FIDO for everything actually important. reply guerby 11 hours agorootparentSame here. TOTP is trivially phishable via evil nginx just like your password, and via social engineering. FIDO2 is not phishable and you have no secret to give out to social engineering attacks. reply KPGv2 5 hours agorootparent> TOTP is trivially phishable . . . via social engineering Is it? I've been on the Internet since the 80s and haven't been phished a single time (despite being the recipient of many obvious attempts). Maybe I could be phished, but I think that's evidence it's not trivial. I have to wonder how many people sophisticated enough to use and pay for a password manager like Bitwarden could be \"trivially\" phished. reply lxgr 2 hours agorootparentThat's great for you, but also a sample size of one (probably technically sophisticated) user, i.e. irrelevant to the bigger picture. The phishability of TOTP really is exactly as bad as that of passwords, except that a once-phished TOTP isn't reusable by the attacker(s), unlike a phished password. But even one-time access is often catastrophic, especially if it allows the attacker to rotate credentials. reply AyyEye 15 hours agorootparentprevSometimes the TOTP is forced on me for a service I really don't care about. That's most of mine, actually. reply freedomben 5 hours agorootparentIndeed, when that's the case I think the PW manager is fine. Though, if you already have to have an app for the important stuff like your email, then IMHO it's actually simpler to just keep them all in one place even if you don't care too much about some of the tokens. Just one less thing you have to remember (i.e. where did I put service X's token again? was that in bitwarden or Aegis? etc). reply lucideer 7 hours agorootparentprevAegis is no more secure than storing your TOTPs in your password manager - 2 factors primarily protect against remote attacks, which don't have direct access, in which case the app your 2nd factor lives in is moot. If your threat model involves direct access you need dedicated hardware for your 2nd factor. Most people are fine with TOTP in pw manager. (I do use Aegis as I like the UX but that's a separate topic) reply saint_yossarian 15 hours agorootparentprevIt's still 2 factors though, if someone discovers your password they don't automatically know the TOTP key. So I use TOTP in my password manager for sites where I wouldn't use 2FA otherwise (because using my phone would be inconvenient), so it's still a security improvement for me. And for critical accounts I do use Aegis on my phone. reply hsdropout 12 hours agorootparentThat's not 2FA, that's two of the same factor. The factors are: - Something you know - Something you have - Something you are (biometrics) reply lucideer 7 hours agorootparentThat list makes for a nice slidedeck but the separation (like many things in tech) isn't as clear cut as the metaphor. \"Something you know\" (password) becomes \"something you have\" as soon as you store/autogenerate/rotate those passwords in a manager (which is highly recommended). \"Something you have\" in the form of a hw key is still that device generating a key (password) that device/browser APIs convey to the service in the same way as any other password. \"Something you are\" is a bit different due to the algorithms used to match biometric IDs but given that matching is less secure than cryptographic hash functions - this factor is only included in the list for convenience reasons. The breakdown of this metaphor is one of the reasons passkeys are seen as a good thing. reply saint_yossarian 9 hours agorootparentprevNot sure what you mean, it's still a second unique token that an attacker would need to know to access my account, so it's improving my security even when stored in my password manager. This was in response to grandparent's opinion that it's \"at best a reduction in security\". I'm not talking about my password vault getting breached, in that case I'd be fucked either way. reply freedomben 5 hours agorootparent> I'm not talking about my password vault getting breached, in that case I'd be fucked either way. But that's the whole point. If your password vault is breached, the second factor is what prevents you from being fucked. That's why putting your seeds in the vault is a reduction in security. It may be a reduction/risk that you're willing to take for convenience, but it's still a reduction. reply magackame 15 hours agorootparentprevDoesen't having the seeds available on all of the devices make it not 2FA?

Passwords are in your head - \"something you know\". TOTP codes are generated by a hardware token - \"something you have\". If the TOTP codes are crammed into your password manager, then the factors are no longer distinguished by these qualities, but they're now the same factor, and it's not true MFA anymore, whether or not they're split up across devices, or apps. reply akho 8 hours agorootparent2FA via TOTP implies two things: 1) you know a password; 2) you know the seed. This is why people criticize that approach. In practice, knowing a password and having a file (seed) seem different enough, and work against some phishing threats.

It was a deliberate change, per the CTO's comment on https://github.com/bitwarden/sdk/issues/898 and elsewhere. They slowly worked their way towards adding this SDK dependency to every client, and the SDK was intentionally not open-source. The public outrage is the only reason Bitwarden is GPLv3 again. reply odo1242 15 hours agorootparentprevYeah - they've always used an open-core licensing model with like a few features (used only by business users/applications) behind a proprietary license. They just ended up mixing the code in a way such that the (theoretically open-source) app ended up having some utility functions for the business version mixed in. Since the client apps don't use that functionality, they split the repository so that you can build the app without using any proprietary code. reply froggerexpert 11 hours agorootparentFair.

Yes the trust was seriously damaged, but this move does restore it largely for me. reply RyeCombinator 14 hours agoprevCan somebody ELI5? reply wmf 13 hours agoparentAFAIK they went closed source the other day which triggered backlash and now they're opening back up. reply jth1 12 hours agorootparentMy understanding is they were never closed source. Some of their code is GPL and some is proprietary, but all is source-available on GitHub. There was a bug where you couldn't build their client without a proprietary dependency, but they have fixed that so you can now build their client with only GPL code again. reply palata 8 hours agorootparentI don't think it was a bug.

This seems to me to still be a “nobody can fork this [and still have a viable iOS app] but us”. reply cxr 16 hours agoparentThe last time anyone did a serious published review of the App Store terms for GPL compatibility was probably 10+ years ago. I remember pre-COVID trying to validate the popular claim that the App Store terms were incompatible with GPLv3 but being unable to do so. None of the provisions that were originally called out by the FSF were in the App Store terms anymore at that point. Certainly nothing I found in the terms at the time indicated any incompatibility. reply FateOfNations 15 hours agoparentprevWhenever I've heard about someone having problems publishing a fork on the App Store, it was a trademark rather than a copyright issue.

Besides recently there was a blocker bug on iOS and on Reddit I found out it happened earlier as well. They didn't even want to debug it and when I suggested this and asked whether they have any issue logged on Github where I could provide logs they went radio silent. Follow ups went completely unanswered. And yeah before that they had given a solution (because reinstall/re-login nothing had worked) - export your data, delete your account, create the account again, and re-import your data - that \"should\" work. Honestly it was worse than \"restart your computer\". I guess it's time for another FOSS player here. It's fine, such things are cyclical I guess.

I'm confused what you're responding to. You're making it sound like this was a bad decision and your anecdote was another thing for the pile, but this is a good decision. reply hnbad 11 hours agorootparentSomeone else linked the GitHub issue that triggered this change and most of the replies are in the same tone as the comment you're responding to. Which is all the more ridiculous as this looks like it wasn't really a big license change decision but more of a \"forgot to change the license on a component from our internal default\". Assuming malice seems like the most boneheaded reaction to this given that there are no other indications Bitwarden was trying to do anything nefarious and the previous license state would have made every single library or tool depending on it non-free. This is different from criticisms of Mozilla for example which often boil down to \"Mozilla positioned itself as privacy-focused but adds a privacy-violating feature you have to opt out of while claiming it's actually fine\". Bitwarden never was 100% FLOSS to begin with but introducing downstream license problems is clearly against their own interest. Unless you believe Bitwarden is run by evil idiots who do evil things for no good reason (business or otherwise) whatsoever and then quickly cover their tracks only when called out, \"oops\" is the only explanation that passes the sniff test. Here's what someone from Bitwarden said in that issue: https://github.com/bitwarden/clients/issues/11611#issuecomme...

    "originBody": "ai atlas apple event Tech Mobile With Apple Intelligence on the Horizon, a Quarter of Smartphone Owners Are Unimpressed by AI A CNET survey found many consumers aren't sold on mobile AI offerings from companies like Apple, Google and Samsung -- especially if they have to pay for access. Abrar Al-Heeti Oct. 25, 2024 5:00 a.m. PT 5 min read Apple Intelligence is designed to simplify a range of tasks on your iPhone. But do consumers care enough to upgrade to the latest devices? Apple/Tharon Green/CNET Key takeaways: A quarter of smartphone owners (25%) don't find AI features helpful, 45% are reluctant to pay a monthly subscription fee for AI capabilities and 34% have privacy concerns. A little over half (52%) of smartphone owners have no interest in purchasing a foldable phone. The biggest motivation for US adult smartphone owners to upgrade their devices is longer battery life (61%), followed by more storage (46%) and better camera features (38%). Just 18% say their main motivator is AI integrations. As smartphone makers including Apple, Google and Samsung place a growing emphasis on AI features in their latest devices, a CNET survey found a quarter of smartphone owners don't find those capabilities particularly useful, and just 18% say AI integrations are their main motivator for upgrading their phone. Watch this: The iPhone 16 Comes With AI Drama 07:37 In fact, the biggest drivers for buying a new device, according to respondents, is longer battery life (61%), more storage (46%) and better camera features (38%). This comes as Apple gears up for the public launch of its Apple Intelligence suite of AI features next week, which includes capabilities like a smarter Siri, AI-powered writing tools and ChatGPT integration. Apple Intelligence will be available on iPhone 15 Pro models and the iPhone 16 lineup. Google also leaned heavily into AI features when it unveiled the Pixel 9 series in August, spending much of its keynote discussing new Gemini functions like Live, which lets you have a natural-sounding, back-and-forth conversation with the virtual assistant. And at its July Unpacked event, Samsung similarly touted Galaxy AI, which can simplify tasks like translating messages and editing photos. While these new features rely on generative AI to produce text or images or to enhance digital assistants, AI itself has been embedded in smartphones for years. For instance, your phone's camera uses AI to process images and blur backgrounds in Portrait mode, and Siri and Google Assistant have always been AI-based (albeit using less advanced versions of the tech). But because this new wave of AI introduces ways to more explicitly accomplish tasks on your phone, rather than blending into existing features, it may take some time for people to warm up to. AI could soon cost you -- and not everyone is sold As tech giants continue to roll out these AI functions, consumers may soon have to pay the price if they want to keep using them. Samsung's website says its Galaxy AI features \"will be provided for free until the end of 2025 on supported Samsung Galaxy devices.\" To utilize Gemini's full power across Google's apps, you'll need to subscribe to Gemini Advanced. And it's likely Apple could also someday charge for some of its AI-powered iPhone features. Many consumers aren't sold. Nearly half of smartphone owners say they're not willing to pay extra money to access AI on their phones. That's not much of a surprise, given how much subscription fatigue is already weighing people down. Another CNET study from April found that US adults spend an average of $91 on subscription services every month. Two-thirds of respondents said at least one of their subscriptions got more expensive within the last year. Adding yet another monthly fee, therefore, may not be so enticing. Still, there are those who are eager to tap into AI on their phones, with Gen Zers and Millennials being the most enthused: 20% of respondents from each generation say they're excited about AI capabilities and find them helpful. Additionally, 15% of Gen Zers and 16% of Millennials use AI on their phones for tasks like photo editing, image creation and summarizing or writing text. Also, 20% of Gen Zers and 19% of Millennials regularly use an AI tool like ChatGPT or Google Gemini on their smartphones. Privacy remains a key concern when it comes to AI, with one-third (34%) of smartphone owners flagging their unease in that department. Tech giants have placed a growing emphasis on privacy considerations during their AI-focused keynotes. At its Worldwide Developers Conference in June, for instance, Apple noted many of its AI models run on-device, which is generally considered more private, since information doesn't have to travel over the internet. When a task calls for more computational power, relevant data will be sent to Apple Silicon servers, and that data won't be stored or made accessible to Apple, the company says. The biggest reasons to upgrade a phone With AI being among the last reasons consumers want to upgrade their smartphones, other considerations like longer battery life, more storage and better camera features still dominate. Other motivators include phone display and screen size (32%); keeping the same ecosystem, like iOS or Android (24%); and phone color (10%). With the high cost of devices (many flagship phones will cost you anywhere between $800 and $1,200), consumers may not want to upgrade their devices as frequently. According to our survey, 44% claim they only get a new device when their current phone breaks or needs replacing. Further, 30% hang onto their devices for three years or longer, while 18% upgrade every two years and just 8% get a new phone every year. Luckily for consumers, Apple didn't implement a price hike with the iPhone 16. Still, iPhone users hold onto their devices for longer than other smartphone owners; one-third will will wait three years or more for an upgrade. Foldable phone hype just isn't there yet Companies like Google and Samsung have continued to roll out foldable phones, with the latest being the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and the Galaxy Z Flip and Fold 6, respectively. But consumers still feel lukewarm about the concept of a foldable handheld device. Just over half (52%) of smartphone owners say they're not interested in buying a foldable phone, while 13% say they'd be interested sometime in the next two years. That gives Apple, which has yet to enter the foldable phone space, the opportunity to tap into that interest. Experts have long speculated that a foldable iPhone could be what it takes to spur wider adoption of foldable smartphones. But it may be several years before that happens, if it ever does. Methodology All figures, unless otherwise stated, are from YouGov Plc. Total sample size was 2,484 adults, including 2,387 smartphone owners. Fieldwork was undertaken Aug. 28-30, 2024. The survey was carried out online. The figures have been weighted and are representative of all US adults (aged 18-plus).

Four months later they announced the Mini, but I wasn't willing to replace a four-month-old phone. Then they discontinued the Mini line after 13. When I was ready to buy a new phone, there were no iPhone Mini models for sale. It took more than a year, but I finally found an iPhone 13 Mini in stock on the Apple Refurbished store. Now I'm hoping to keep this phone alive until they finally release another small iPhone. reply SoftTalker 2 hours agorootparentprevI'm using an iPhone 12 mini, and it's bigger than I'd ideally like. reply ktosobcy 1 hour agorootparentprevAre you sure they bought different flavours because of the screen size or because of naming marketing \"pro is better than regular\" and \"mini obviously has to be worse\"? reply gen220 38 minutes agorootparentprevSpeaking for myself, I 100% would have bought an iPhone Mini, but I purchase new phones on a 5-6 year cycle. My iPhones were the 4S and the XS. Now that I'm ready to buy a new iPhone, the Mini has been discontinued! I think the Mini would have been and in fact was successful, but it's not successful \"enough\" to justify a separate model – they must have observed that people \"like me\" would still buy a flagship iPhone, even though we aren't 100% satisfied with the form factor. Apple would rather have us buying a higher-margin flagship model and have an NPS of 65+ than a lower-margin mini model with an NPS of 80+. My friend with similar instincts as me recently got a refurbished 13 Mini instead of the latest flagship. I'll probably get the flagship, because I value the satcom a little bit more than the form factor. reply HumblyTossed 1 hour agorootparentprev> I've been hearing this sentiment for 10+ years, but it's been tried and each time it's tried it doesn't sell well enough.

For them it’s not worth to pursue something as small as a billion dollar market but they still have enough market power to suppress any competitor who wants to deliver such a product. That’s why we are seeing less and less innovation and diversity compared to the 1980s to around 2000 reply iscrewyou 2 hours agorootparentprevIt’s a package of devices Apple is selling. They sell under powered smaller screen macs. They sell iMacs. They sell small iPads. They sell smaller watches. Some of these just don’t sell as well as their other offerings. They should sell small phones. Because the whole family will be in on the brand, features, and services. I’ve heard many family members and friends say that they won’t give up their older small phones because Apple no longer makes new ones. The idea that they don’t sell well is not a good enough reason when you are trying to capture the whole market for not just hardware but the lock in for services, apps, games, music, etc. reply yreg 2 hours agorootparentHow can you be confident in this when you don't even see their sales data? Still, I would like to see a smaller regularly updated phone. Bonus points if there is a high-end version, because small shouldn't mean budget (like with iPhone SE). reply hedora 2 hours agorootparentThe last small flagship (iPhone 13 mini) sold poorly, but it was much more expensive than the SE2. This was at the tail end of covid, but before faceid worked with masks, so the SE's touch id was a huge selling point. Other than that and the camera, the only functional difference I can find are that the SE line is still missing the UWB antenna. I'd happily upgrade to a newer small iPhone if they made one. As it is, it looks like the only option is repeatedly repairing my 13 mini (and dealing with the hilariously bad 5G battery drain forever) or downgrading to a newer SE3. I know there are a lot of people in this boat. I predict they'll produce another small phone in a few years. It'll sell well due to pent up demand, and someone will be declared a genius for selling 100M's of extra phones that year. reply rsynnott 1 hour agorootparentprevThey have repeatedly attempted to sell small phones.

That's how you get mediocre products, which is where we are now. reply dageshi 1 hour agorootparentI'm sorry to say this, but again just face the reality of the fact that not enough people truly want this size of phone. There's a congregation of people on HN who do, I suspect they're also the type of people who'll run their phones for 5+ years where their bigger phone buying brethren are replacing every year or two at most.

Particularly once the bubble pops and money stops being shoved into things just sticking an LLM in a pretty package with little to no value. Some of the things coming in iOS like notification summaries and similar features are big examples. It's clearly LLM based but it's not a lot of the shoving AI needlessly into things that we are seeing now and provides a true improvement given the notification overload that we have right now. reply KeytarHero 11 minutes agoparentExactly. Ask customers \"do you want AI in your phone?\" and their response will probably be \"meh\", as shown in the article. But ask \"do you want notification summaries, a better camera in low light, Siri to be able to look up more things, searchable photos, etc?\" - and they absolutely will. reply slashdave 1 hour agoparentprevPhoto manipulation is another example. You can see the wisdom of how Apple is approaching this. In particular, to be on device whenever possible so as not to be dependent on network bandwidth, and to tie features to new hardware (to drive sales). reply mondobe 3 hours agoprevI have a hard time seeing how this isn't obvious. 95% of everyday AI needs (for the people that even bother to interact with it) are covered by ChatGPT, and most of that is the same stuff that Google was handling before. From personal experience, the only thing that changed when replacing the \"old\" Google Assistant with the Gemini-powered one on my Pixel was that it's no longer able to create reminders. reply ffsm8 2 hours agoparentThe only thing that changed for me was a that it couldn't control my smart Home devices anymore, nor activate navigation, nor send messages via Whatsapp (I.e. while driving). Literally every thing I used it for got answered via \"I cannot do that yet\" after it randomly opted me into that. Pure garbage. reply piyush_soni 1 hour agorootparentThen why are you using it? I tried using Gemini once on my Pixel 6. Couldn't play music on Youtube music on verbal instructions, I switched back to Google Assistant. Will try it again after 6 months now. :) reply TeMPOraL 1 hour agorootparentIsn't that obvious? They tried to switch back to Google Assistant, but each time they asked Gemini, it said it can't do that yet! reply ffsm8 53 minutes agorootparentprev> Then why are you using it? I'm not, I pretty much just accepted that Google doesn't care about usability whatsoever and haven't prompted it in a very long time. To be clear, the only time I've ever used it was via \"ok Google\" in contexts in which I'm unable to interface with the phone directly, i.e while driving. If it doesn't work you'll learn that you can't start driving before queueing the navigation anymore. The voice assistant was a nice feature, but not important enough to waste my time trying to figure out which feature they opted me into and how to get back out of it. reply xur17 50 minutes agorootparentprevIn my case it just kinda.. switched over at some point, and frankly I didn't care enough to figure out how I might switch it back (if I even could). I had a similar frustration to GP that it stopped working for 100% of the queries I used to use it for. That said, at some point it started working better, but there was a good 6-12 months where it was a tire fire. reply swatcoder 2 hours agoparentprevI'm not sure that's true. Not everybody is hounding for information from the web in the first place. Apple's approach of using current-boom AI to help you navigate and digest your own private trove of multimedia content (photos, videos, apps, notes, structured data, etc) is absolutely useful to people as well, and for some of us, one of the only personal uses of this AI that seems compelling at all.

[1]: https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/openai_conversati... reply grahamj 2 hours agorootparentI have it set up with ollama. It’s… interesting. HA commands are provided to the model as tools so it works as well as the model is able to determine when and how to use tools. From experimenting with that and my own tool use code I’ve found that models vary greatly in their ability to wield tools and none that I’ve tried are exceptional. It’s neat that you can intermix general chatting with HA commands but you’re probably going to find that the old assist is more reliable for commands. What I do like is that you can use a template as your system prompt so you can provide the state of a number of entities and then ask for them with natural language. That works well. I have an Alexa/Echo voice announcement system set up and have recently tied that into assist so I can do automations like if the garage opens I prompt for “what is the state of the garage?” and announce the result. Makes it feel more humane than the same plain announcements all the time. reply TeMPOraL 1 hour agorootparentprevDo try it. I've been running it ever since it got integrated into the core, mostly to control A/C units around our flat, and it's the best voice assistant experience I had to date. I mean honestly, how is it possible Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft[0] all keep screwing this up for over a decade now? I literally spent 15 minutes hooking up GPT-4 to the Home Assistant integration, and I was able to semi-reliably[1] control actual devices[2] like air conditioners and smart lights, in a completely natural and ad-hoc way, by talking to my smartwatch on the go, or to a phone, whatever was more convenient at the moment. It's a really magical experience, a step closer to Star Trek reality. And what makes it possible is not just LLMs being able to deal with natural language, but more importantly, \"bring your own API key\" model allowing to cut away all the bullshit that FAANG assistants are stuck in. -- [0] - Ever since they dropped MS Speech API in Windows, and did the Cortana thing. Some 15 years passed, at this point, and I'd still prefer to work with the Speech API than to touch any of the FAANGs' voice assistant - it worked, and worked off-line! [1] - Works ~90% of the time; some 5% of the time the voice model (from Home Assistant Cloud) misunderstands me, and 5% of the time the LLM gets confused. It's still worth it, because I can actually talk to it like to a person, without thinking of style or grammar or magic keywords. [2] - Which, given the level of integration of Home Assistant companion app with the phone, can be easily turned into an equivalent of on-phone voice assistant that can do more than the one I got from Google. Critically, there are ways to couple Home Assistant app and Tasker, so it's not hard to make it do arbitrary things on your phone. And, if you don't like low-ish code Tasker experience, you can trivially shell out from Tasker to Termux, at which point sky is the limit.

Again, they should be competent enough to discern the differences between when it is and isn’t appropriate.

Flights for example would require your calendar program to reliably pull data from an API regarding the flight information that is current and effectively real time.

Either you go use-case by use-case (flights, restaurants, calendars… etc) and never get traction or you just start scanning emails and open up huge data risks. Today, this is nearly available, nearly. Probably only something Google/apple can realistically offer. Apple “intelligence” has started to read your notifications and rewrite them for you, so it shouldn’t be a big leap to listen for a United App notification and decide it’s urgent enough take action.

One aspect of which is the ability to adapt to new circumstances that you haven’t experienced before. There has been considerable success in programming computers to draw inferences, for example, but not actual reasoning. You can mimic some forms of reasoning but you can’t take one ML set - like recognizing photos with mountains, then expect it to correctly identify a similar geographical element - a hill. It can’t do that. It may correctly identify that it’s not a mountain but that isn’t the same thing as actually learning it’s similar to a mountain but not the same, which would be a rudimentary definition of a hill that an intelligent entity could conceivably use if it knew what a mountain was but not a hill. Machine Learning was always a more honest place to have This discourse. I am indeed pushing back on the idea that we should be calling ChatGPT or anything like it intelligence. It’s Machine Learning, clever algorithms, Large language Models, among other things, that are trained on ways to mimic certain aspects of intelligence, but it does not actually possess any real intelligence. Look at the LLM hallucination problem for example. It can’t be self corrected because it’s not an intelligent system. Moving the goal post on what AI means (and pushing AGI as some new goalpost) is disingenuous, and relatively recent.

Apple's latest devices have gone to an electrically released sort of adhesive (versus the older pull-strip removeable adhesive, which is a big step up from the \"glue it in\" approach many vendors take), and for a given volume, you get more battery if you can rely on the phone to protect it from damage - which is why almost everything with an internal battery uses some variety of pouch cell. They're quite a bit more fragile than the hard-cased batteries, but you get a lot more battery in the volume than you do with the hard cased ones.

I suppose \"stability improvements in WebKit\" doesn't do much for Apple's stock price compared to SiriGPT.

E.g. if it sees that I always reopen an application 2 seconds after the OS kills it in the background, then maybe it shouldn't be killed. Or if I wake up 3 minutes before the alarm would go off, and take a trip to the toilet, maybe it shouldn't blow up the speaker while I'm frantically pulling up my underpants, but recognize that I'm already awake, or at least wait with the alarm until I'm around the phone again. Or automatic backlight shouldn't go crazy when I walk in the night under the streetlamps, it should recognize that lamps are coming and going, and that backlight adjustment every 5 seconds is silly and annoying.

I'd also love to be able to give commands that traverse multiple apps (e.g. take my google sheet and venmo request everyone the specified amount). Most likely this would happen by teaching an AI tool use and having apps expose an API. I'd love to be able to give voice commands for certain things (e.g. flipping through recipes when my hands are wet) and have the phone be able to do the actual thing I want.

Battery replacements are a thing. They're apparently not a common thing, unfortunately, because that might impact new phone sales... and even on devices where it's trivial, people don't seem to do it. A decade ago or so I was doing a lot of Nexus 5 battery swaps for people because one of the battery OEMs was shipping junk and the batteries were shot in a year. I really wish OEMs would put bigger batteries in phones. It improves everything. Not only do you get longer initial battery life, you can handle far more \"battery aging\" before things stop working right. You still have a day's battery life (which I expect is what most people actually mean - they want their phone to last the day without thinking about it) even with capacity loss, and a larger battery can have more internal resistance increase (another factor of battery aging) before it sags too badly under the load to keep voltage up. Based on the fact that easily 90+% of phones I see in the wild have cases on them, physical size and thickness isn't a big factor (and those newer folding screen devices are massive when folded). Another few mm doesn't matter when phones live in purses, men's pockets, or jackets. ... or just go back to a modern flip phone sort of device, get a week and a half battery life, and stop worrying about remembering to charge your phone. ;) reply jandrese 1 hour agoparentI just did a battery replacement on a Pixel 6a. It wasn't terribly expensive, $18 for the whole kit, but the process was very nerve wracking. Unlike Apple's relatively friendly rubber cement Google used some kind of industrial adhesive to glue everything together. You need a good amount of heat to loosen it, but not too much because that will damage the phone. There's a fine line. They do include a helpful strap for removing the battery, but you have that awful glue to deal with. The cherry on top is the slippery little spring clip connector you need to remove without damaging the board underneath. All in all it made me pine for the days when you could just pop the back off of the phone and yank the battery out to replace it. Personally I think I could live with a 0.8mm thicker phone that still has this feature. Also a headphone jack while you are at it. reply Sohcahtoa82 2 hours agoparentprev> Based on the fact that easily 90+% of phones I see in the wild have cases on them, physical size and thickness isn't a big factor Everyone says this, but I wonder if the sales data says otherwise, because device manufacturers, especially Apple, REALLY love to advertise how thin their devices are. Personally, I don't want a super thin device because I feel like the slightest bending force is going to snap it in half. It's absolutely wild to me that people will store their phones in their back pocket. reply Syonyk 2 hours agorootparentApple's mobile division still seems to struggle with the ghost of Jony Ive. At least their laptop division was willing to rethink things with the Apple Silicon transition and go back to things that worked. The late Intel-era portable Macs were simply broken, because of Ive's apparent obsession with \"thin for thin's sake.\" Or, more probably, \"thin for the sake of industrial design awards.\" They innovated 20% too much on keyboard design with the butterfly keyboard that was simply a bad design. I don't know what else to call a keyboard that reliably breaks after a few years of service. But, bad though that it is, it was even worse because you couldn't replace the keyboard. You had to replace the whole top case and battery, at something like $700, when one key went bad, because the whole thing was integrated to save a mm or two. Not only did they un-solve a solved problem (reliable laptop keyboards), they even un-solved the ability to replace a keyboard when it gets mangled, or something spills in it, or a random failure happens. But, worse, they went with the USB-C only design (the thinnest port!), meaning that every owner of one of those laptops I knew had a pile of assorted adapters in their bag so they could do things that most people want to do every now and then with a laptop, like drive an external display for a presentation, read a USB-A storage device, or read a micro SD card. Yes, the laptop was thinner, but at the cost of needing to carry extra stuff with you to work around the lack of ports. And then, because it was so thin, they didn't have space to properly cool the zorching-fast Intel chips they put in them, and the chips would throttle badly while baking the machine. The M-series laptops, shocking me incredibly, threw all that \"design\" out the window, and went back to something actually useful. They cool well (admittedly, that's mostly the Apple Silicon barely needing cooling), they fixed the keyboard, and the machines have a useful set of ports on the side for \"common tasks with a laptop\" (SD, HDMI, headphone, plus the USB-C/Thunderbolt ports - still no A ports, though). And then enough battery to last just about forever. Anyway, I hope their phone division works this sort of thing out too. reply NoboruWataya 2 hours agoparentprev> Based on the fact that easily 90+% of phones I see in the wild have cases on them, physical size and thickness isn't a big factor Well, people are probably going to put cases on their phone regardless, so the phone has to be thin enough that even with a case it's still a manageable size. But I agree that battery is where phones ultimately fail most of the time. I have had a Samsung S10 for a bit over 5 years now and it is the battery that is going to force me to retire it and get a new one. Speed, storage, screen quality, camera quality are all perfectly fine for my use case. But the battery rarely lasts a full day with any kind of usage now which is annoying. I would love a phone with a replaceable battery. But I agree that the average consumer won't bother, they will just get a new one (or they will have upgraded before battery life ever becomes an issue). reply marcosdumay 1 hour agorootparentPeople didn't put cases on all phones at the time they could survive small falls and were thick enough to handle. reply Syonyk 2 hours agorootparentprevSo replace the battery?

But as well as looking like a bit of a PITA to do it, I'm not particularly confident my phone will be good as new after I melt the glue and pry it open. My point is that it would be great if replacing the battery was as simple as clicking off (or even unscrewing) the case and taking it out, like it used to be. Granted, I probably couldn't take my phone swimming with me, but I think I could get over that. reply jandrese 58 minutes agorootparentprevIMHO the era of \"we assume you're going to have a case on this\" was cemented in place the instant the camera bump appeared. If you can't set you phone down on a service without it being all tippy thanks to the off center camera bump then you're clearly expected to stuff it into a case that is at least that thick. reply Syonyk 17 minutes agorootparentYup. I'd rather the phone be that much thicker, loaded with battery. reply notpushkin 1 hour agoprevHeadsup: CNET is one of those sites playing videos (maybe relevant, maybe not) even on mobile.

This chat bot approach is only one paradigm for using AI and it's probably the worst one in most use cases. Amazon Rufus, for example, falls into this category and it's hard to even remember to engage with it. On the other hand, Amazon is happy to serve me absolute trash search results. What most people probably want is an AI that can, for example, help organize their calendar transparently. Have a meeting coming up with a client? What if the AI can use tools to go find the latest info about the client? Check their LinkedIn, check their X, check their blog, research their company, give you a tear sheet on topics to discuss based on this in the calendar notes. If a user has to directly interact and instruct the AI, it feels like it defeats the purpose. reply mouse_ 3 hours agoprevI would pay extra to -not- have AI in my phone.

Apple, especially, wants to leverage their excellent silicon to do “AI” locally in the name of privacy purely as a marketing advantage, but the tradeoffs there are major (burning my battery instead of data center AC power, plus, my phone will never be better or faster than some big metal GPU with fans), and the privacy issue could just as well be solved by doing a good job designing the server side architecture and educating people that unlike when talking to a person, it’s trivial for a model to “not learn anything from” a conversation, and that that’s in fact automatically how it works unless you’re logging the conversations and purposely feeding them back in. reply xvector 2 hours agorootparentYou can use their cloud instead of local compute if you'd like: https://security.apple.com/blog/private-cloud-compute/ Building a privacy aware cloud is a lot harder than you think it is.

On-device processing reduces the trust required, although of course it doesn't eliminate it. The common response to this is to point out that I'm trusting Apple or Google anyway just by using their phones, which is true, but (1) since phones are directly accessible to security researchers, there's more potential to find out about malfeasance if data is exfiltrated from the phone in a way that it shouldn't be, and (2) even if I have complete trust in Apple or Google, I also have to trust that they'll be able to protect my data from malicious actors, and, the less data I give them, the less I have to worry when they fail. reply jdlyga 2 hours agoprevGPT-4o is helpful, and so is NotebookLM.

The image clean-up feature is utterly useless, and I think it's one of the areas where we can clearly see the difference between a company for whom Generative AI is an afterthought (Apple), and the competition. I paid $1500 for the new iPhone Pro Max and a great part of the deal was the Apple Intelligence support, but frankly, I might as well switch to Android at this point because I'm really disappointed at Apple's take on AI. I'll probably wait until the official Apple Intelligence is introduced but tbh I don't think there will be much improvements over this version. And as for Siri: It's as stupid as it ever was. I ask it to convert something from lbs to kg and it responds \"there's no music playing\". If anything, its natural language comprehension has degraded. Currently, there's no context awareness, so I still can't ask Siri \"how do I respond to this email?\".

The results highlight the importance of ongoing research to boost the functioning of this waste-clearance system, called the glymphatic system. Images showing visualization of perivascular spaces in a human brain. The left image is derived from enhancing the T2/FLAIR image on the right. Piantino lab, Oregon Health & Science University, PNAS Though less well-known than the body’s blood vessels, the lymphatic system is also vital to health. The network of lymphatic vessels threaded throughout the body removes dead cells and other waste from the bloodstream. It also helps transport the immune cells that fight infections. It was once thought that the lymphatic system didn’t reach into the brain. But over the last dozen years, researchers have found a system of vessels containing cerebrospinal fluid in brain tissue in mice. These vessels appear to connect to the lymphatic system and to help clear toxins from the brain. Studies suggest that age-related or physical damage to this brain waste-clearing system, called the glymphatic system, may contribute to the development of Alzheimer’s disease and other cognitive disorders. Researchers have observed the real-time workings of the glymphatic system in mice. Studies using human brain samples taken after death found hints of such vessels. But to date, the existence of a functioning glymphatic system hadn’t been confirmed in living people. In a new study, funded in part by NIH, researchers led by Dr. Juan Piantino from Oregon Health & Science University recruited five volunteers who needed surgery to remove a brain tumor. During this surgery, the volunteers received an injection of a dye called gadolinium into their cerebrospinal fluid. They then underwent MRI scans to track the passage of dye into the brain. Results from the study were published on October 7, 2024, in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. One volunteer underwent MRI using a technology called T2/FLAIR at 12 and 24 hours after surgery, and the other 4 underwent T2/FLAIR imaging at 24 and 48 hours after surgery. The scans showed cerebrospinal fluid flowing into the brain through distinct channels—along the perivascular spaces, the fluid-filled spaces that run alongside blood vessels in the brain. These findings match earlier imaging results seen in mice. Dye could also be seen moving from these spaces into the functional tissue of the brain. “This shows that cerebrospinal fluid doesn’t just get into the brain randomly, as if you put a sponge in a bucket of water,” Piantino says. “It goes through these channels.” Other studies have suggested that the glymphatic system may be most active during sleep. These new results support the importance of efforts to boost or repair the glymphatic system, such as improving sleep quality for people at risk for Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias. —by Sharon Reynolds Related Links Study Shows How Aura May Lead to Migraine Headache Gaps Allow Substances to Move in and Out of the Brain Immune Cells Control Waste Clearance in the Brain Boosting Brain’s Waste Removal System Could Improve Alzheimer’s Outcomes Impaired Brain Drainage in Aging and Alzheimer’s Brain Cleaning System Uses Lymphatic Vessels Lymphatic Vessels Discovered in Central Nervous System How Sleep Clears the Brain New Brain Cleaning System Discovered Brain Basics References: The perivascular space is a conduit for cerebrospinal fluid flow in humans: A proof-of-principle report.

I think the NIH confirmation is running behind in the science, independent research is quite a bit ahead of them. I came across the paper on this last year and implemented a very simple page with the parameters they used [2]. There is a number of disease models that show reduced or no glymphatic clearance and as such these people need treatments to clear out their brains and these image routines seem to help. A lot of people find this pattern extremely taxing to watch especially for the recommended number of cycles, you can feel the effect on the brain its hard to describe the sensation its a bit numbing and the image has the sensation of changing as the cycle runs like its a visual trick. You might get left feeling like you have been clubbed over the head the first time.

These versions end with an an additional off period, as a 'cool down' from the flicker. Framerate of 24Hz differs from the 120Hz as presented in the paper, but here there is no 40Hz flicker attempt so it shouldn't be an issue.

We can look at images of food and get a physical reaction like hunger, or look at macabre images and feel disgust, or stare at animations for one minute and then be affected for many minutes afterwards when we look away. It doesn't surprise me we're still discovering new mechanisms for triggering physical reactions in our bodies.

New religions and mystery cults explode across the planet; much of the Net is unusable, flattened by successive semiotic jihads. India and Pakistan have held their long-awaited nuclear war: external intervention by US and EU nanosats prevented most of the IRBMs from getting through, but the subsequent spate of network raids and Basilisk attacks cause havoc. Luckily, infowar turns out to be more survivable than nuclear war – especially once it is discovered that a simple anti-aliasing filter stops nine out of ten neural-wetware-crashing Langford fractals from causing anything worse than a mild headache. reply Karellen 32 minutes agorootparent(2005) reply shaganer 7 hours agorootparentprevI'm interested to hear your reasons why you think it's closer to reality. I don't see why the discovery of the brain wastage system would help a brain crash from being possible. Edit: Just looked back at the post and that it involves an image causing the glymphatic system to react. reply haccount 6 hours agorootparentprevIt's possible. But only for the brains of people with severe or undertreated epilepsy of carefully selected varieties. You can trigger a potentially fatal seizure by showing them an appropriately stimulating image. Which likely was a known concept to the author of the story. For the rest of us the negative feedback along the optical axis puts a stop to such shenanigans. reply altruios 4 hours agorootparenthttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCollough_effect is evidence to the contrary. This seems to rewire something outside the optical pathway. The effect can last for months. Works on almost all brains, no epilepsy required... reply haccount 4 hours agorootparentThat sounds more like a learned visual effect, something quite different from frying the brain of anyone with a basilisk. Experiments with cats( https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1111849/ ), and the outcome of patients with strabismus/lazy eye(effective blindness on defective eye), suggests that seeing (or not seeing) is a learned trait. Which is a few steps removed from being a backdoor to epileptic seizures or remote controlling heart activity reply altruios 3 hours agorootparentExert from that same wiki page about the anti-McCollough effect, I may have the two confused. Given that AMEs do transfer interocularly,[8] it is reasonable to suppose that they must occur in higher, binocular regions of the brain. Despite producing a less saturated illusory color, the induction of an AME may override a previously induced ME, providing additional weight to the argument that AMEs occur in the higher visual areas than MEs.[8] reply candiddevmike 5 hours agorootparentprevGenAI images sometimes do this to me. Not anything scary per say, but some of the faults make my brain feel weird as it tries and fails to interpret parts of the image that were \"AI smeared\". reply theGnuMe 5 hours agorootparentprevSure, we know imagery can cause fatal seizures so... yes. reply feoren 9 hours agoparentprevStaring at the v0.3 produces an effect similar to something I'm able to do trigger manually on command. I've always had the feeling that I'm somehow triggering a \"flow\" in my brain, but I have no way to confirm what's actually going on. It's actually stronger when I trigger it manually, and it feels like it flows down my spine and eventually some weak signal reaches my extremities. (Maybe that means it's not CSF after all?) Oddly, I do feel like I can think more clearly afterward, but the brain is very bad at judging itself, so it's more likely to be an illusion than anything real. Anyone else able to manually trigger a feeling like this in their brains? reply shaganer 7 hours agorootparentI'm interested in how you accomplish this. I can do something along the lines of that by getting myself heated. I actually get a hothead and a tingling comes up to my brain like it's passing in a channel. It could simply be a sensation rising within the brain though, without an actual transport of something. I can focus better after but it doesn't clear my head, just use that frustration or anger to become determined. reply cassianoleal 6 hours agorootparentprevYep, I can do that. It's similar to the effect of being hit with big news (good or bad), and the \"sinking\" feeling that comes with it, becoming suddenly introspective and oddly calm under pressure. At least to me, of course. I have no idea if others have that same reaction. reply sithadmin 7 hours agorootparentprevThat just sounds like ASMR, which some folks can induce without external stimuli. reply hobs 6 hours agorootparentI think you are thinking of Frission https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisson reply sithadmin 5 hours agorootparentNo, the prior post's reference to having some degree of control over the sensation, plus a prolonged impact on mental state makes it distinctly ASMR, as opposed to frission which is usually a short-lasting involuntary response.

Now the question is if this provocation and resulting CSF flow is actually beneficial. Do you spike activity and get a rebound attempt at waste clearing due to waste accumulation of the neural spike, or is this like a massage for the brain that gives you a invigorating CSF dump? I suspect it might not be a health improving activity. (I also suspect that you can get even more CSF flowing if you spin yourself at 6G in a full body centrifuge and that this too would not be conductive to health) reply shaganer 7 hours agoparentprevI wonder how this will work with hypophantic and aphantic individuals (people with little to no \"mind's eye\" visual imagery), such as myself. Like would the effect still be registered the same as anyone else, or would it cause the imagery effect to lessen or be ineffective altogether? reply jdthedisciple 10 hours agoparentprevIt seems to have no effect on me. Am I an outlier? reply fny 59 minutes agorootparentWhy do you assume you're supposed to feel an immediate effect? Increased CSF flow aids in clearing metabolic waste, distributing nutrients, and reduced oxidative stress. You'll feel none of this after a 3 minute session. A lot of the reactions here reek of placebo. reply PaulKeeble 9 hours agorootparentprevIts very much experimental so we don't know if there are people for whom this has no impact, all the people in the studies respond so the question is whether your cerebral spinal fluid is being pumped around and flushing your brain and you don't feel an impact or whether you get no cerebral spine fluid movement at all. Someone would need to recreate this experiment with you in the MRI to find out which it is. reply LinuxBender 9 hours agorootparentWhat is one supposed to experience or feel? Maybe my computer is too slow or my monitor is too small? I used to collect gifs that were similar to this just because they had a neat visual effect but neither those nor this image gives me any kind of experience. If I could find a private business that has an MRI I would pay cash to get a full body scan and then just a brain scan as I have always wanted one but hospitals around me want me to go through their process and give me strange looks when I just want to pay cash and be scanned. I think it would be interesting to see what effect assorted images have. There was another type of scanner, I forgot what it was called ... that would show a 3D image of the brain during activity and would show when parts of the brain that should be responding are not. In that study it was used primarily on kids/teens that were prone to crime. I can not remember what it was called. This was quite some time ago. The patient would have many wires attached to their head. It would effectively show animated holes so to speak when part of a persons brain was not functioning correctly due to physical trauma, drugs, etc... reply PaulKeeble 8 hours agorootparentAfter focussing on the dot for a few seconds the images appear to produce a tunnel or other change in effect from just images flipping, maybe a moving star. Then when the grey image appears you get an after effect of the overall image for about a second. Some feel a form of pressure or even light seizure sensation in the brain and have auditory experience like there was a sound that disappears each time the grey clearing screen appears.Then afterwards some people feel a bit cognitively fatigued, drunk even for a few minutes to hours. It feels odd, its hard to describe it feels like something weird is happening in the brain. reply LinuxBender 8 hours agorootparentInteresting. So I do get the over-shadow effect for about 1.5 seconds but I get that from any bright light that transitions to a grey background mostly from taking high dose benfotiamine, along with lutein and astaxanthin and chelated copper as my nervous system was being depleted of thiamine due to a dumb self induced issue that I have nearly resolved. Maybe I am not a good test subject for that reason. Or perhaps my monitor is too bright. Edit: I reduced the brightness, contrast and changed the black mode of the monitor and went through several cycles. I still get the over-shadow effect for anywhere from 1.5 to 2 seconds but no other effects. Perhaps my supplements are interfering or confounding. I guess it may be useful to note what supplements the test subject is consuming along with dosage to determine if that is a confounding factor. reply anal_reactor 7 hours agorootparentprevI don't feel anything either. Not sure why reply giantg2 8 hours agorootparentprevThe places that specialize in full body scans will do it for cash. I think technically you need a script for any MRI, so you may still need to speak with a doctor ar their facility first. My understanding is it's more streamlined there and will be way cheaper than any hospital. If you talk to your primary or can get a telemedicine appointment online then they might be willing to write you the script and you can go to a local MRI. I would avoid the hospital as they are 5x higher in cost than my local outpatient imaging facility. reply LinuxBender 8 hours agorootparentI think technically you need a script for any MRI I'm in the US. I am guessing a script is the same thing wherever you are as what is called a referral here. I will ask around. Thankyou for the idea. I will research what outpatient imaging facilities are around me. Would they use some kind of mirror system to watch this image? I can't imagine a PC could be near the MRI. reply wyldfire 6 hours agorootparent\"script\" is \"prescription\" (here in US and possibly elsewhere). Imaging techniques generally require them because medicine considers the potential harm of giving patients an inconclusive diagnosis or a conclusive diagnosis for which there's no treatment. Without a symptom to weigh against these risks, it makes some sense to consider them as not \"over the counter\". But in practice I think you can show up at any imaging center and get some kind of \"full body MRI\" to screen for cancer or some other risk. They'll probably ask about family history and other predispositions but even if you didn't have those they'd still take your money. reply LinuxBender 4 hours agorootparentI will give that a shot. A family member was a signalman for the railroad for over 40 years and got melanoma back when there was no treatment for it. Perhaps that may suffice. reply amelius 7 hours agorootparentprevMaybe try it again at the end of the workday? reply jdthedisciple 2 hours agorootparentI tried it again several hours later, being more tired, and on my 22\" fullscreen instead of my phone.

Curious, could seizures caused by strobe light be related to the effects of draining of this fluid? reply khafra 12 hours agorootparentFrom the paper, it seems like that the blood flow changes and the seizures are both caused by the increased processing load in the visual cortex; with the seizures also resulting from some faulty wiring in localizing that increased load to only the visual cortex. So, more like A->B and A->C instead of A->B->C.

Good to see it verified in the study. Having a partner and sleeping in the same bed can lead to alterations from the optimal sleeping position, especially sleeping on the back is not good. Sleeping on the back is also one of the main causes of snoring, which often occurs in people which have a big belly and can’t really sleep lateralish anymore. Sleep quality is important too and one big factor is not to go to sleep with a full stomach. Sleep quality will suffer because of the active digestion which probably will not let the glymphatic transport do it’s job properly. Also good to know that “…low doses of alcohol (0.5 g/kg) increased glymphatic clearance…”. reply pragma_x 3 hours agorootparentprevThat's great that there's a way to passively optimize that process every day.

That seems like a long time. People get brain MRIs with contrast all the time, is there any reason why this never showed up? Because no one was looking? Or because it's a slow mechanism? reply jhrmnn 12 hours agoparentLooking up “brain MRI with contrast”, the biggest difference seems to be that in a regular MRI the contrast goes to the blood, but here it goes straight to the brain cerebrospinal fluid. You need open brain for that, so indeed doesn’t seem trivial. reply elric 9 hours agorootparentCerebrospinal fluid is produced in the brain, I would imagine that the contrast would end up in newly produced fluid as well, but maybe that assumption is wrong. reply sithadmin 7 hours agorootparentEven assuming that the contrast could show up in newly excreted CSF (maybe, maybe not), MRI contrast elimination half lives are very short (mostly all under ~2 hrs, excepting cases like renal dysfunction), and cerebrospinal fluid doesn’t replenish particularly quickly. reply NeuroCoder 9 hours agoparentprevTwo things: 1. Blood brain barrier and CSF should be separate for all but tiny molecules. It's why CT angiograms are able to visualize distinct vessels. So it is pretty hard to directly interact with this sort of thing in vivo 2. A good chunk of the neuro community have been operating under the assumption that some of those mouse model findings are mechanisms in humans too. Since we couldn't easily prove it, people used a bunch of next best tools with fancy imaging that demonstrated it was very likely. On top of furter proof, this sort of study allows us to begin pinpointing exactly how close our next best tools are at estimating in vivo processes without opening up the head. reply rozab 8 hours agoparentprevThey injected a dye into the cerebrospinal fluid to confirm the pattern of diffusion into the brain. I imagine this procedure would have to be confirmed safe in humans first.

    "originBody": "Why Safety Profiles Failed Document #:Date: 2024-10-24 Project: Programming Language C++ Audience:Reply-to: Sean BaxterContents 1 Abstract 2 C++ is under-specified 2.1 Inferring aliasing 2.2 Inferring lifetimes 2.3 Inferring safeness 3 Lifetime safety is static typing 4 Lifetime parameters don’t cause soundness bugs 5 C++ is too irregular for Profiles 5.1 C++ cannot enforce exclusivity 6 Carcinization 7 C++ in the future 8 References 1 Abstract As for dangling pointers and for ownership, this model detects all possible errors. This means that we can guarantee that a program is free of uses of invalidated pointers. – A brief introduction to C++’s model for type- and resource- safety[type-and-resource-safety-2015] Safety Profiles were introduced in 2015 with the promise to detect all lifetime safety defects in existing C++ code. It was a bold claim. But after a decade of effort, Profiles failed to produce a specification, reliable implementation or any tangible benefit for C++ safety. The cause of this failure involves a number of mistaken premises at the core of its design: “Zero annotation is required by default, because existing C++ source code already contains sufficient information”[P3465R0] “We should not require a safe function annotation”[P3446R0] “Do not add a feature that requires viral annotation”[P3466R0] “Do not add a feature that requires heavy annotation”[P3466R0] The parameters of the problem make success impossible. This paper examines the contradictions in these premises, explains why the design didn’t improve safety in the past and why it won’t improve safety in the future. Note that this document is specifically about the lifetime safety claims in [P1179R1] and [P3465R0]. The wider set of analyses in [P3081R0] that deal with rejecting specific operations like reinterpret_cast, union access, variadic arguments, etc., are not considered here. 2 C++ is under-specified Zero annotation is required by default, because existing C++ source code already contains sufficient information. – Pursue [P1179R1] as a Lifetime Safety TS[P3465R0] C++ source code does not have sufficient information for achieving memory safety. A C++ function declaration lacks three things that are critical for lifetime safety: Aliasing information. Lifetime information. Safeness information. Functions involving parameter types with pointer or reference semantics have implicit aliasing, lifetime and safeness requirements. Safety Profiles cannot recover these properties from C++ code, because there are no language facilities to describe them. These requirements are only specified in documentation, if they are specified at all. 2.1 Inferring aliasing A C++ compiler can infer nothing about aliasing from a function declaration. A function parameter with a mutable reference might always alias other parameters, it might never alias other parameters, or it might not care about aliasing other parameters. // i and j must always alias. They must refer to the same container. void f1(std::vector::iterator i, std::vector::iterator j) { // If i and j point into different vectors, you have real problems. std::sort(i, j); } // vec must not alias x. void f2(std::vector& vec, int& x) { // Resizing vec may invalidate x if x is a member of vec. vec.push_back(5); // Potential use-after-free. x = 6; } // vec may or may not alias x. It doesn't matter. void f3(std::vector& vec, const int& x) { vec.push_back(x); } f1 and f2 have aliasing requirements. In f1, both iterators must point into the same container. In f2, x must not come from the container vec. These requirements are only visible as documentation. The compiler cannot infer a function’s aliasing requirements from its declaration or even from its definition. If the safety profile enforces no mutable aliasing, then the definitions of f1 and f3 will fail to compile, breaking your program. int main() { std::vector vec1, vec2; // *Incorrectly* permits call. // UB, because the iterators point into different containers. f1(vec1.begin(), vec2.end()); // *Incorrectly* rejects call. // This is the correct usage, but mutable aliasing prevents compilation. f1(vec1.begin(), vec1.end()); // *Correctly* rejects call. f2(vec1, vec1[2]); // *Incorrectly* rejects call. f3(vec1, vec1[2]); } Profiles chose the wrong convention for several uses. It permits the incorrect call to f1 to compile, but rejects a correct usage of f1 on the grounds of mutable aliasing. An unsound call to f2 is correctly rejected, but a sound call to f3 is also rejected. Rejecting or permitting code (rightly or wrongly) is a matter of coincidence, not intelligence. Without language-level aliasing information, compile-time memory safety is not possible. This requirement is the motivation for Rust’s borrow type. A mutable borrow cannot alias other borrows. That’s enforced by the borrow checker. Raw pointers have no aliasing requirements, but are unsafe to dereference. In general, things that can be checked by the compiler are checked, and things that can’t be checked are unsafe to use. (Compiler Explorer) #include#includevoid func(std::vector& vec, int& x) { vec.push_back(1); x = 2; // A write-after-free when x is a member of vec! } int main() { std::vector vec; vec.push_back(1); func(vec, vec[0]); std::cout& map, const int& key) { return map[key]; } // The returned reference is constrained by the lifetime of both x and y // parameters. const int& f5(const int& x, const int& y) { return std::min(x, y); } // The returned reference is not constrained by the lifetime of any // reference parameter. const int& f6(const int& key) { static std::map map; return map[key]; } These three functions have different lifetime requirements, which are indicated by comments. This information is available to developers but not to the compiler. What’s the strategy to uphold these lifetime requirements? Read the documentation, read the code, and don’t make mistakes. int main() { std::map map; // r4 is constrained by lifetimes of map and 40. int& r4 = f4(map, 40); // *Incorrectly* rejects usage of r4. r4 is constrained to the lifetime // of the temporary 40, which expired at the end of the above statement. int x = r4; // r5 is constrained by lifetimes of 50 and 51. const int& r5 = f5(50, 51); // *Correctly* rejects usage of r5. The reference refers to one of the // two expired temporaries. This use would be a use-after-free. int y = r5; // r6 is constrained by the lifetime of 60. const int& r6 = f6(60); // *Incorrectly* rejects usage of r6. // The return reference r6 should not be constrained by the lifetime of 60. int z = r6; } Profiles take a similarly conservative approach to lifetimes as they do with aliasing. The lifetime of a returned reference is constrained by the lifetimes of all of its arguments. This is fortuitous for a function like std::min, which returns a reference to either of its function parameters. It’s bad for a function like std::map::operator[], which takes a key argument by reference but returns a reference that’s only constrained by the lifetime of this. Since the compiler has no information about function parameter lifetimes, it can’t accurately flag out-of-contract function calls. f4 and f6 take references to temporary objects but return references that should not be constrained to that temporary. In both cases, the safety profile rejects a subsequent use of the reference as a use-after-free, because it applies a too-conservative convention. The need for explicit lifetime information in function types is the motivation for Rust’s lifetime arguments. A returned reference must be annotated with a lifetime parameter that is constrained by a function parameter on the same function, or it must be static. The alternative is to be deluged with an impossible quantity of use-after-free false positives. (Compiler Explorer) #include#includeconst int& f4(std::map& map, const int& key) { return map[key]; } int main() { std::map map; const int& ref = f4(map, 200); int x = ref; } :11:11: warning: dereferencing a dangling pointer [-Wlifetime] int x = ref; ^~~ :10:32: note: temporary was destroyed at the end of the full expression const int& ref = f4(map, 200); ^ The Safety Profiles reference implementation can’t accurately deal with lifetimes because C++ doesn’t provide lifetime information. The tool doesn’t test for correctness, it only tests if your code conforms to a pre-chosen convention. 2.3 Inferring safeness We should not require a safe function annotation that has the semantics that a safe function can only call other safe functions. – (Re)affirm design principles for future C++ evolution[P3446R0] Recall what “safe” actually means: A safe function has defined behavior for all valid inputs. An unsafe function has soundness preconditions. Calling an unsafe function with out-of-contract inputs may result in undefined behavior. A C++ compiler can infer nothing about safeness from a function declaration. It can’t by tell by looking what constitutes an out-of-contract call and what doesn’t. A safe-specifier indicates the presence of soundness preconditions. An unsafe-block permits the user to escape the safe context, prove the preconditions, and call the unsafe function. template class vector { public: size_t size() const noexcept safe { return _len; } T& operator[](size_t index) noexcept safe { // Can call size() because it's a safe function. if(index >= size()) panic(\"Out-of-bounds vector::operator[]\"); unsafe { // Pointer operations only allowed in unsafe context. // Safety proof: // The allocation has size() valid elements and indexvoid sort( RandomIt first, RandomIt last ); Let’s consider another example: the std::sort API that takes two random-access iterators. This is an unsafe function because it exhibits undefined behavior if called with the wrong arguments. But there’s nothing in the type system to indicate that it has soundness preconditions, so the compiler doesn’t know to reject calls in safe contexts. What are sort’s preconditions? The first and last iterators must point at elements from the same container. first must not indicate an element that appears after last. first and last may not be dangling iterators. In the absence of a enforced safeness information, it’s up to the user to follow the documentation and satisfy the requirements. Guidance for calling unsafe functions is essentially “don’t write bugs.” void func(std::vector vec1, std::vector vec2) { // #1 - *Incorrectly* rejects correct call for mutable aliasing sort(vec1.begin(), vec1.end()); // #2 - *Incorrectly* permits out-of-contract call. sort(vec1.begin(), vec2.end()); } In the Profiles model, the correct call to sort #1 is rejected due to mutable aliasing. That’s bad, but permitting the out-of-contract call #2 is worse, because it’s a soundness bug. There’s no realistic static analysis technology to verify that a call to sort meets its preconditions. Even the safety profile with the most conservative aliasing setting lets this call through. This is where safe and unsafe specifiers play an important role. From the caller’s perspective, sort is unsafe because it has preconditions that must be upheld without the compiler’s help. From the callee’s perspective, sort is unsafe because it’s written with unsafe operations. Pointer differencing computes a pivot for the sort, and pointer differencing is undefined when its operands point to different allocations. // No safe-specifier means unsafe. void sort(vector::iterator begin, vector::iterator end); // A safe-specifier means it can only call safe functions. void func(vector vec1, vector vec2) safe { // Ill-formed: sort is an unsafe function. // Averts potential undefined behavior. sort(vec1.begin(), vec2.end()); unsafe { // Well-formed: call unsafe function from unsafe context. // Safety proof: // sort requires both iterators point into the same container. // Here, they both point into vec1. sort(vec1.begin(), vec1.end()); } } The only way to enforce memory safety is to separate safe and unsafe functions with a safe-specifier. In this example, func is safe because it’s defined for all valid inputs. It cannot call sort, because that has soundness preconditions: the two iterators must point into the same container. A call to sort in a safe context leaves the program ill-formed, because the compiler cannot guarantee that the preconditions are satisfied. But by entering an unsafe-block, the user can prove the preconditions and make the unsafe call without the compiler’s soundness guarantees. [P3081R0] does float a [[suppress(profile)]] attribute to turn off certain Profiles checkes. It looks like the equivalent of an unsafe-block. It may permit pointer operations in a definition, but it doesn’t address the other side of the call: without a safe-specifier, how does the Profiles design deal with functions like sort that are inherently unsafe? They must be separated from provably safe functions. User intervention, wrapped up in unsafe-blocks, is needed to satisfy their preconditions. Without this bump of impedance the language cannot guarantee safety, as the property that a safe functions contains no undefined behavior is not transitively upheld. (Compiler Explorer) #include#include#includeint main() { std::vector v1, v2; v1.push_back(1); v2.push_back(2); // UB! std::sort(v1.end(), v2.end()); } Program returned: 139 double free or corruption (out) Program terminated with signal: SIGSEGV The Safety Profiles reference implementation can’t deal with unsafe functions, because C++ doesn’t know which functions are unsafe. This out-of-contract call produces a heap double-free and then segfaults. 3 Lifetime safety is static typing Do not add a feature that requires viral annotation. – (Re)affirm design principles for future C++ evolution[P3446R0] Rust’s safety model incorporates lifetime arguments on every reference (or struct with reference semantics) that occurs in a function type. The authors of Profiles disparagingly call these “viral annotations.” Don’t be scared. C++ has always been full of viral annotations: types are viral annotations. Types establish type safety properties that are enforced by both the caller and callee. These properties are transitive (i.e. viral) because they’re enforced through any number of function calls, creating a network of reasoning from the point where an object is created to all of its uses. Languages that treat types as viral annotations are statically-typed languages. Languages that don’t are dynamically-typed languages. These have well-known trade-offs. Statically-typed languages exhibit higher performance and provide more information to developers; programs in a statically-typed language may be easier to reason about. Dynamically-typed languages are much simpler and can be more productive. Lifetime parameters, which provide crucial information to the compiler to enable rigorous safety analysis, defines another axis of typing. Rust has static lifetimes, which is a high-performance, high-information approach to memory safety. Users can reason about lifetimes and aliasing because those concepts are built into the language. The compiler has sufficient information to rigorously enforce lifetime safety with borrow checking. Most other memory-safe languages use dynamic lifetimes, of which garbage collection is an implementation. Instead of enforcing lifetimes and exclusivity at compile time, the garbage collector manages objects on the heap and extends their scope as long as there are live references to them. This has the same basic trade-off as dynamic typing: simplicity at the cost of performance.Static lifetimes Dynamic lifetimes Static types Rust Java, Go Dynamic types - Javascript, Python The static types/static lifetimes quadrant is a new area of language design, at least for languages widely used in production. The principles may be unfamiliar. Lifetime annotations feel different than type annotations because they establish relationships between parameters and return types rather than on individual parameters and objects. Instead of answering the question “What are the properties of this entity?” they answer “How does this entity relate to other entities?”. Profiles fail because they reject, as a design principle, the specific language improvements that provide necessary lifetime information for compile-time safety. 4 Lifetime parameters don’t cause soundness bugs Annotations are distracting, add verbosity, and some can be wrong (introducing the kind of errors they are assumed to help eliminate). – Profile invalidation - eliminating dangling pointers[P3446R0] This is not right. In a memory-safe language you can’t introduce undefined behavior with mere coding mistakes. That’s the whole point of memory safety. If you put the wrong lifetime annotation on a parameter, your program becomes ill-formed, not undefined. A mistaken use of lifetime parameters can be an ergonomics bug, or it can mask undefined behavior when wrapping an unsafe function in a safe interface, but it can’t cause undefined behavior. (Compiler Explorer) fn f1(x:&'a i32, y:&'b i32) -> &'b i32 { return x; } error: lifetime may not live long enough --> lifetime1.rs:5:104fn f1(x:&'a i32, y:&'b i32) -> &'b i32 {-- -- lifetime `'b` defined here|lifetime `'a` defined here 5return x;^ function was supposed to return data with lifetime `'b` but it is returning data with lifetime `'a`= help: consider adding the following bound: `'a: 'b` Lifetime constraints are a contract between the caller and callee. If either side violates the contract, the program is ill-formed. In the code above, the lifetime constraints are violated by the callee. The lifetime of the x parameter does not outlive the lifetime of the returned reference. We used the wrong annotation, but instead of leading to undefined behavior, the compiler produces a detailed message that explains how the lifetime contract was not met. (Compiler Explorer) fn f2(x:&'a i32, y:&'b i32) -> &'b i32 { // Well-formed. The lifetime on y outlives the lifetime on // the return reference. return y; } fn f3() { let x = 1; let r:&i32; { let y = 2; r = f2(&x, &y); } // Ill-formed: r depends on y, which is out of scope. let z = *r; } error[E0597]: `y` does not live long enough --> lifetime2.rs:15:1614let y = 2;- binding `y` declared here 15r = f2(&x, &y);^^ borrowed value does not live long enough 16}- `y` dropped here while still borrowed ... 19let z = *r;-- borrow later used here Let’s fix the implementation of the callee and test a broken version of the caller. The returned reference depends on y, but it’s used after y goes out of scope. The compiler rejects the program and tells us “y does not live long enough.” The use of lifetime annotations on parameters is the same as the use of type annotations on parameters: it turns an intractable whole-program analysis problem into an easy-to-enforce local-analysis problem. Lifetime annotations, which exist to guarantee safety, do not jeopardize safety. 5 C++ is too irregular for Profiles Do not add a feature that requires heavy annotation. “Heavy” means something like “more than 1 annotation per 1,000 lines of code.” – (Re)affirm design principles for future C++ evolution[P3446R0] We have an implemented approach that requires near-zero annotation of existing source code. – Pursue [P1179R1] as a Lifetime TS[P3465R0] Central to Safety Profiles is the claim that annotations are exceptional rather than the norm. For this to be true, the great bulk of C++ would need to be written according to some preferred convention. [P1179R1] chooses “no mutable aliasing” and constrains reference return types to all reference parameters. Let’s consider a number of Standard Library functions and compare their aliasing and exclusivity requirements to those conventions. Functions that don’t adhere to these conventions must be annotated, and those annotations must be virally propagated up the stack to all callers, as aliasing and lifetime requirements are transitive. Only functions that have no soundness preconditions can be considered safe. Let’s start inand work through alphabetically, indicating how functions deviate from the Safety Profile’s aliasing and lifetime conventions: // Unsafe! // Precondition: `first` and `last` must alias. template bool all_of( InputIt first, InputIt last, UnaryPred p ); template bool any_of( InputIt first, InputIt last, UnaryPred p ); template bool none_of( InputIt first, InputIt last, UnaryPred p ); // Unsafe! // Precondition 1: `first` and `last` must alias. // Lifetime: The return type is not constrained by the lifetime of `value` template InputIt find( InputIt first, InputIt last, const T& value ); template InputIt find_if( InputIt first, InputIt last, UnaryPred p ); template InputIt find_if_not( InputIt first, InputIt last, UnaryPred q ); // Unsafe! // Precondition 1: `first` and `last` must alias. // Precondition 2: `s_first` and `s_last` must alias. // Lifetime: The return type is not constrained by the lifetime of `s_first` // or `s_last`. template InputIt find_first_of( InputIt first, InputIt last, ForwardIt s_first, ForwardIt s_last ); // Unsafe! // Precondition 1: `first` and `last` must alias. template ForwardIt adjacent_find( ForwardIt first, ForwardIt last ); // Unsafe! // Precondition 1: `first1` and `last2` must alias. // Lifetime: The returned Input1 is constrained only by `first1` and `last1` // Lifetime: The returned Input2 is constrained only by `first2`. template std::pair mismatch( InputIt1 first1, InputIt1 last1, InputIt2 first2 ); // Unsafe! // Precondition 1: `first` and `last` must alias. // Precondition 2: `s_first` and `s_last` must alias. // Lifetime: The returned ForwardIt1 is constrained only by `first` and `last` template ForwardIt1 search( ForwardIt1 first, ForwardIt1 last, ForwardIt2 s_first, ForwardIt2 s_last ); The functions inmostly involve iterators which are inherently unsafe. Additionally, the lifetime convention chosen by Profiles is frequently wrong: the lifetime of a returned reference rarely is constrained by the lifetimes of all its parameters. You’d need annotations in all of these cases. Consider these conventions against the API for a container. Let’s look at : // Aliasing: the `key` parameter may alias `*this`. // Lifetimes: the returned T& is only constrained by `*this` and not by `key`. T& map::at( const Key& key ); T& map::operator[]( const Key& key ); // Aliasing: the `key` parameter may alias `*this`. // Lifetimes: the returned iterator is only constrained by `*this` and not by // `value`. iterator map::find( const Key& key ); iterator map::lower_bound( const Key& key ); iterator map::upper_bound( const Key& key ); // Aliasing: the `value` parameter may alias `*this`. // Lifetimes: the returned iterator is only constrained by `*this` and not by // `value`. std::pair map::insert( const value_type& value ); // Unsafe! // Precondition 1: `pos` must point into `*this` // Aliasing: the `value` parameter may alias `*this` or `pos` // Lifetimes: The returned iterator is only constrained by `*this` and not by // `value`. iterator map::insert( iterator pos, const value_type& value ); // Aliasing: The `k` and `obj` parameters may alias `*this`. // Lifetimes: The returned iterator is only constrained by `*this` and not by // `k` or `value`. template std::pair map::insert_or_assign( const Key& k, M&& obj ) // Unsafe! // Precondition 1: `hint` must point into `*this` // Aliasing: The `k` and `obj` parameters may alias `*this` and `hint`. // Lifetimes: The returned iterator is only constrained by `*this` and not by // `k` or `value`. template iterator insert_or_assign( const_iterator hint, const Key& k, M&& obj ); This is only a few of the map APIs which would either be unsafe or require annotations in the Profiles model. The conservative aliasing rules gets most member functions wrong: a reference returned from a member function is typically constrained only by the *this/self parameter. That’s what Rust’s lifetime elision rules do. Regardless of the convention chosen, expect annotations every time the function does something different. With C++ code, it does something different very often. #includeint main() { std::map m; m[1] = 2; // Temporary 1 expires. Profiles considers `value` a dangling reference. int& value = m[1]; // Profiles should flag this apparent use-after-free. value = 2; } Profile’s inability to deal accurately with lifetimes means that an implementation would reject much valid code. In this example the subscript to map::operator[] is a temporary. It goes out of scope at the end of the statement. Under the Profile’s conservative lifetime convention, the returned reference (stored in value) would be considered a dangling reference and the subsequent use would make the program ill-formed. I do not believe that C++ code, with its countless unstated soundness preconditions and inconsistent aliasing and lifetime requirements, can be made memory safe with fewer than “1 annotation per 1,000 lines of code.” In fact, legacy C++ code will have many more annotations than equivalent Rust code. Rust often chooses object relocation to pass parameters by value rather than pass them by reference. This reduces the number of lifetime constraints that the system deals with. Additionally, it has simpler, safe versions of facilities which are unsafe in C++: the Rust iterator, for example, keeps both the data pointer and length in the same struct to completely alleviate the aliasing concerns that prevent safety analysis in C++. 5.1 C++ cannot enforce exclusivity The density of annotations required to vet existing code is not the biggest problem facing Profiles. C++ overload resolution has created a knot that cannot be untangled. Its standard conversion rules are one reason why C++ is considered inherently unsafe. For many accessor-style C++ APIs, there are two overloads: A candidate that binds a const object and a returns a const reference (or pointer or iterator). A candidate that binds a mutable object and returns a mutable reference (or pointer or iterator). If the mutable candidate can be chosen, it is chosen, no matter what the result object is used for. void f1(const int& x, const int& y); void f2(std::vector vec) { // The mutable overload of operator[] is called here. f1(vec[0], vec[1]); } This code will not pass an exclusivity test. vec is a mutable object, so vec[0] calls the mutable version of operator[] and produces a mutable reference result object. While that mutable loan is in scope (it remains in scope until f1 returns), vec[1] calls the mutable version of operator[] to produce its mutable reference result object. But you’re not allowed more than one mutable reference to the same place. This is an exclusivity error! Rust avoids this problem in two ways: In general there is no function overloading. As a convention, if there are mutable and const versions of a function, the mutable one is named with a _mut suffix. There is syntax sugar which maps subscript operations to either index or index_mut. The latter is chosen in a mutable context, which is the left-hand side of an assignment. We can’t ditch function overloading and remain C++. But we can change how overload resolution evaluates candidates. The standard conversion is responsible for binding references to expressions. C++ chooses the wrong (for safety purposes) subscript candidate because the standard conversion is able to bind mutable references to lvalue expressions. (Compiler Explorer) void f3(const int^ x, const int^ y) safe; int main() safe { std2::vector vec { }; // Okay. f3(vec[0], vec[1]); // Ill-formed: mutable borrow of vec between its mutable borrow and its use. f3(mut vec[0], mut vec[1]); } safety: during safety checking of int main() safe borrow checking: example.cpp:13:22 f3(mut vec[0], mut vec[1]); ^ mutable borrow of vec between its mutable borrow and its use loan created at example.cpp:13:10 f3(mut vec[0], mut vec[1]); ^ Safe C++ changes the standard conversion to work around this language defect. In this extension, standard conversions do not bind mutable references. vec[0] chooses the const candidate, which permits aliasing, and mut vec[0] chooses the mutable candidate, which does not. By opting in to mutation, you get aliasing by default. (Compiler Explorer) #feature on safety int main() safe { int x = 1; int^ ref = x; // Ill-formed! Can't bind mutable reference to lvalue. } error: example.cpp:5:14 int^ ref = x; ^ cannot implicitly bind borrow int^ to lvalue int The mut keyword[mutation] puts the subexpression into the mutable context and restores the restricted functionality. In the mutable context, the compiler will bind mutable references to expression: (Compiler Explorer) #feature on safety int main() safe { int x = 1; int^ ref = mut x; // Ok. Can bind mutable references in mutable context. } Now, the const overload of a function is chosen unless the user escapes with the mut keyword. This addresses a language defect head-on. What option does Profiles have? In its full generality, the mutable binding default makes for an exceptionally thorny analysis problem. Does Profiles replace calls to mutable candidates with calls to similarly-named const candidates? That’s a presumption. Does it retroactively classify mutable loans as shared loans depending on usage? I’m not a soundness maverick. This is getting close to touching a live wire. Legacy C++ errs on the side of mutability, making it too unconstrained to test for soundness. Old code is what it is. 6 Carcinization The development of new product lines for use in service of critical infrastructure or NCFs (national critical functions) in a memory-unsafe language (e.g., C or C++) … is dangerous and significantly elevates risk to national security, national economic security, and national public health and safety. – CISA, Product Security Bad Practices[cisa] [P3466R0] insists that “we want to make sure C++ evolution … hews to C++’s core principles.” But these are bad principles. They make C++ extra vulnerable to memory safety defects that are prevented in memory-safe languages. The US Government implicates C++’s core principles as a danger to national security and public health.Static lifetimes Dynamic lifetimes Static types Rust Java, Go Dynamic types - Javascript, Python Reconsider this table. We want to evolve C++ to live in the static types/static lifetimes quadrant. Since Rust is the only species in that design family (at least among production languages), a new entry is necessarily going to resemble Rust (at least in its memory safety treatment) more than it does other languages. An earnest effort to pursue [P1179R1] as a Lifetime TS[P3465R0] will compromise on C++’s outdated and unworkable core principles and adopt mechanisms more like Rust’s. In the compiler business this is called carcinization: a tendency of non-crab organisms to evolve crab-like features. Standard C++ doesn’t have aliasing information. We need a new reference type that upholds the “mutation XOR aliasing” rule as a program-wide invariant. Standard C++ doesn’t have lifetime information. We need lifetime parameters to indicate constraint relationships between function parameters and return references. Safety is a transitive property. It has to be upheld with a safe-specifier on functions to establish the absence of soundness preconditions and an unsafe-block to call unsafe operations. Lifetime constraints are a transitive property. They must be upheld by both caller and callee as viral annotations. Lifetime constraints on functions do not follow any particular convention. Constraints that deviate from a default (such as the lifetime elision rules) require annotation, even heavy annotations that may exceed 1 per 1,000 lines of code. The standard conversion rules make exclusivity enforcement impossible. We have to change the language default, establishing no implicit mutation in order to support aliasing in functions that take const references. 7 C++ in the future I think it is worth pursuing this compatible path first before, or at least at the same time as, trying to graft another foreign language’s semantics onto C++ which turns C++ into “something else” and/or build an off-ramp from C++. – Pursue [P1179R1] as a Lifetime TS[P3465R0] Who does this provincialism serve? The latest Android security study “prioritizes transitioning to memory-safe languages.”[android-security] The off-ramp from C++ is an increasingly viable and attractive strategy for projects looking to reduce CVE exposure. The off-ramp is happening and its benefits are measurable. As the Android study observes, “once we turn off the tap of new vulnerabilities, they decrease exponentially, making all of our code safer.” All focus should be on turning off the tap of new vulnerabilities. Incorporating Rust’s safety model into C++ helps in two ways: It provides an off-ramp from unsafe C++ to Safe C++ within a single toolchain. Projects can follow best practices for Safe Coding[safe-coding] without retraining the whole engineering staff in a new programming language. It can hasten the migration to Rust by improving C++/Rust interop. By extending C++ with representations of all Rust constructs that can appear in function declarations (such as Rust enums, borrows and lifetimes, ZSTs, traits, etc) the number of common vocabulary types is greatly increased. This allows interop tooling to map between C++ and Rust declarations at a more expressive level than the current C-level API. C++ can be made memory safe, but not by dismissing everything that works, which is what the authors of Safety Profiles do. The language must evolve to be more explicit in how it expresses aliasing, lifetime and safeness properties. C++ can meet the security needs of its users, both in a principal role, and, for those projects determined to take the off-ramp, in an important supporting role. 8 References [android-security] Eliminating Memory Security Vulnerabilities at the Source. https://security.googleblog.com/2024/09/eliminating-memory-safety-vulnerabilities-Android.html?m=1 [cisa] Product Security Bad Practices. https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/product-security-bad-practices [csharp] unsafe (C# Reference). https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/unsafe [mutation] https://safecpp.org/draft.html#explicit-mutation [P1179R1] Herb Sutter. 2019-11-22.

The first and last iterators must point at elements from the same container. 2. first must not indicate an element that appears after last. 3. first and last may not be dangling iterators. This is a fundamental problem in C++ where a range is specified by the starting point and the ending point. This is because iterators in C++ are abstractions of a pointer. D took a different approach. A range in D is an abstraction of an array. An array is specified by its starting point and its length. This inherently solves points one and two (not sure about three). Sort then has a prototype of: Range sort(Range); reply SubjectToChange 19 hours agoprevAt this point I'm wondering if the purpose of safety profiles is simply to serve as a distraction. In other words, safety profiles are just something people can point to when the topic of memory safety comes up, that’s it. The objectives of the initiative always seemed hopelessly optimistic, if not absurd. In particular, I don't understand why littering a codebase with auto, const, constexpr, inline, [[nodiscard]], noexcept, etc is wonderful, yet lifetime annotations are somehow an intolerable tyranny. reply rswail 12 hours agoparentIt's a tick-the-box-for-compliance item like when Microsoft had a POSIX layer for Windows NT. reply pjmlp 6 hours agorootparentMicrosoft eventually learned that keeping full POSIX support would have been a better outcome in today's server room if they had done it properly instead. Likewise, pushing half solutions like profiles that are still pretty much a paper idea, other than what already exists in static analysers, might decrease C++'s relevance in some domains, and eventually those pushing for them might find themselves in the position that adopting Safe C++ (circle's design) would have been a much better decision. The problem with ISO driven languages, is who's around in the room when voting takes place. reply badmintonbaseba 3 hours agorootparentAdopting what static analyzers do is a no-go, as they rely on non-local reasoning, even across translation units for lifetime and aliasing analysis. Their output highly depend on what they can see, and they generally can't see the source code for the whole program. I also doubt that they promise any kind of stability in their output across versions. This is a not a jab against static analyzers, by all means use them, but I don't think they are a good fit as part of the language. reply pjmlp 2 hours agorootparentYeah, yet that is exactly the approach being pushed by those on the profiles camp. Further, the clang tidy and VC++ analysis based on some of the previous work, e.g. lifetime analysis paper from 2015, barely work, full of false positives. I was looking forward to it in VC++, and to this day in VC++ latest, it still leaves too much on the table. reply klodolph 3 hours agorootparentprevWe can dream of what it would be like with full POSIX support on Windows, but it was a pipe dream to begin with. There are some major differences between Windows and POSIX semantics for things like processes and files. The differences are severe enough that Windows and POSIX processes can’t coexist. The big issue with files is that on POSIX, you can conceptually think of a file as an inode, with zero or more paths pointing to it. On Windows, you conceptually think of a file as the path itself, and you can create mandatory locks. There are other differences. Maybe you could address these given enough time, but WSL’s solution is to basically isolate Windows and Linux, which makes a ton of sense. reply pjmlp 2 hours agorootparentThis wasn't the case with the subsystems approach, which is also validated by all micro-computers from IBM and Unisys still in use, being further developed, with incompatible differences between their mainframe heritage and UNIX compatability workloads. reply ameliaquining 17 hours agoparentprevI think maybe it's because lifetime annotations can get arbitrarily complicated. If you look at enough Rust code you'll definitely see some function signatures that make your head hurt, even if they're vastly outnumbered by simple ones. A guarantee that the comprehension complexity of that part of your code will always be below some low ceiling is tempting. reply estebank 14 hours agorootparentThe thing is, if you were to make the same design in C++ the code might look \"cleaner\" because there is less code/fewer annotations, but the other side of that coin is that the developer also has less information about how things are meant to fit together. You not only lose the compiler having your back, you also don't have useful documentation, even if that documentation would be too complicated to grasp at once. Without that documentation you might be fooled into thinking that you do understand what's going on even if you don't in reality. reply saghm 3 hours agorootparentWhat's interesting to me about this is that from what I understand, lifetime annotations are not present in Rust because of a desire to include information for the use of developers, but because without them the compiler would need to brute-force checking all potential combinations of lifetimes to determine whether one of them is valid. The heuristics[0] that the compiler uses to avoid requiring explicit annotations in practice cover most common situations, but outside of those, the compiler only acts as a verifier for a given set of lifetimes the user specifies rather than attempting to find a solution itself. In other words, all of the information the compiler would need to validate the program is already there; it just wouldn't be practical to do it. [0]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/lifetime-elision.html reply steveklabnik 3 hours agorootparentThere’s some truth to both. What’s good for computers is often good for humans, but there’s a balance to be had. The elision rules are an acknowledgment that being 100% explicit in surface syntax is going a bit too far, even if it’s important info for the computer to have. reply saghm 3 hours agorootparentFair enough! The part that always stuck out to me is that there were other potential designs that could have been made around how (and which) lifetime information would be specified. I think sometimes people might not realize that the we didn't get stuck with the requirements we have for lifetime annotation today due to validation requiring exactly that set of information or an indifference to the burden it might place on the programmer to specify it; the developer experience was at the forefront of deciding how this should work, and as you say, weighing all of the factors that entails is a balance. reply steveklabnik 2 hours agorootparentFor sure. And I do find https://cfallin.org/blog/2024/06/12/rust-path-generics , for example, interesting. It’s certainly not like what Rust does today is the only way things could ever be. Heck, I’m sad we never got elision on structs in 2018 like we were talking about. reply yellow_lead 13 hours agorootparentprevThat's a good point. There's many times in a C++ codebase, where I'd see or write a seemingly innocuous function, but it has so many assumptions about lifetimes, threads, etc that it would make your brain hurt. Of course we try to remove those or add a comment, but it's still difficult to deal with. reply bluGill 6 hours agorootparentThere are reasonably good c++11 conventions for lifetimes - if it is a unique_ptr you own it, otherwise you don't and shouldn't save a copy. Almost nobody follows them, but they are good conventions and you should, and write up a bug if someone else isn't. Similar, for threads, keep your data confined to one thread, but explicit where you move/copy it to a different thread (note I said move or copy - the first thread should lose access in some way) - with the only exception of data explicitly marked as thread safe. The above is forced by Rust, which would be nice, but the conventions are easy enough if you try at all. But most developers refuse to write anything more than C++98. reply duped 4 hours agorootparent> But most developers refuse to write anything more than C++98. I think the bigger mistake is equating memory safety with C++11 smart pointers. They buy you a little, but not the whole buffet.

There are plenty of best practices that would give memory safety but nobody uses them (and not for cases where in rust you would have to use unsafe and thus there is good reason). Which is why safety profiles are so interesting, they are something I should be able to turn on/off on a file by file basis and thus easily force the issue. Of course profiles don't exist yet (and what is proposed is very different from what this article is arguing against) and so it remains to be seen if they will be adopted and if so how useful they will be. reply steveklabnik 3 hours agorootparentSafe C++ is also something you turn on file by file. reply bluGill 2 hours agorootparentWhat matters is tool support. Anything in the standard I expect to get tool support for (eventually), while everything else - lets just say I've been burned a lot by tools that are really nice for a few years but then they stop maintaining it and now I have to rewrite otherwise perfectly good code just so I can upgrade something else. Standard C++ isn't going anyplace soon and I feel confident that if something makes it into the standard tools will exist for a few decades at least (long enough for me to retire). Will Rust or Safe C++ still be around in 10 years, or just be another fad like so many other languages that got a lot of press for a few years and now are not used much (you probably cannot answer this other than a guess) reply steveklabnik 2 hours agorootparentI fully agree, this thread is about two possible futures for getting that support in the standard: Safe C++ and profiles. reply Analemma_ 3 hours agorootparentprev> There are reasonably good c++11 conventions for lifetimes [...] Almost nobody follows them [...] I swear I'm not trying to be snarky or rude here, but is it actually a \"convention\" if almost nobody follows it? This seems like one example of my general issue with C++, in that it could be great if everyone agreed to a restricted subset, but of course nobody can coordinate such agreement and it doesn't exist outside companies large and important enough to enforce their own in-house C++ standards (e.g. Google). reply bluGill 2 hours agorootparentWhat we have is a human problem. The convention exists in enough places (though in slightly different forms) to call it a convention, but it needs more adoption. Every once in a while someone who writes a lot of Rust will blog about some code they discovered that was 'unsafe' and after looking close they realized it wasn't doing something that fundamentally required unsafe (and often fixing the code to be safe fixed real bugs). C++ and Rust have to leave people enough rope to hang themselves in order to solve the problems they want to solve, but that means people will find a way to do stupid things. reply orf 14 minutes agorootparentWhat arguments like this fail to understand is that conventions without guardrails, culture and/or guarantees are next to useless. That’s not a human problem. It’s like saying “this motorway is pitch black, frequently wet and slippery and has no safety barriers between sides, so crashes are frequent and fatal. What we have is a human problem - drivers should follow the convention of driving at 10mph, when it doesn’t rain and make sure they are on the right side of the road at all times”. reply bluGill 6 minutes agorootparentWhich is what this whole story is about: how can we add those things to C++? There are lots of options, which should we try.

Lifetimes are complicated. Complicated codes make them even harder. Not annotating is not making anything easier. reply HelloNurse 3 hours agorootparentprevWhat are the \"arbitrarily complicated\" cases of lifetime annotations? They cannot grow beyond one lifetime (and up to one compilation error) per variable or parameter or function return value. reply ameliaquining 3 hours agorootparentMostly involving structs. Someone at work once posted the following, as a slightly-modified example of real code that they'd actually written: pub struct Step { pub name: &'a str, pub stage: &'b str, pub is_last: bool, } struct Request { step: &'a Step, destination: &'c mut [u8], size: &'b Cell>, } To be sure, they were seeking advice on how to simplify it, but I imagine those with a more worse-is-better technical sensibility arguing that a language simply should not allow code like that to ever be written. I also hear that higher-ranked trait bounds can get scary even within a single function signature, but I haven't had cause to actually work with them. reply steveklabnik 3 hours agorootparentIn general, you can usually simplify the first one to have one lifetime for both, and in the second, you’d probably want two lifetimes, one for destination and the others all shared. Defaulting to the same lifetime for everything and then introducing more of them when needed is better than starting with a unique lifetime for each reference. I think you two are ultimately talking about slightly different things, your parent is trying to point out that, even if this signature is complex, it can’t get more complex than this: one lifetime per reference means the complexity has an upper bound. reply HelloNurse 2 hours agorootparentprevBut you are specifying that all members of Request except step.is_last have arbitrary unrelated lifetimes (shouldn't some of them be unified?) and you are simply exposing these lifetime parameters to Request client code like you would expose C++ template parameters: a trivial repetition that is easy to read, write and reason about. reply thadt 15 hours agorootparentprevIt's deceptively easy to look at a number of examples and think: \"If I can see that aliasing would be a problem in this function, then a computer should be able to see that too.\" The article states \"A C++ compiler can infer nothing about aliasing from a function declaration.\" Which is true, but assumes that the compiler only looks at the function declaration. In the examples given, an analyzer could look at the function bodies and propagate the aliasing requirements upward, attaching them to the function declaration in some internal data structure. Then the analyzer ensures that those functions are used correctly at every call site. Start at leaf functions and walk your way back up the program until you're done. If you run into a situation where there is an ambiguity, you throw an error and let the developer know. Do the same for lifetimes. Heck, we just got 'auto' type inference working in C++11, shouldn't we be able to do this too? I like not having to see and think about lifetimes and aliasing problems most of the time, and it would be nice if the compiler (or borrow checker) just kept track of those without requiring me to explicitly annotate them everywhere. reply seanbax 14 hours agorootparentFrom P3465: \"why this is a scalable compile-time solution, because it requires only function-local analysis\" From P1179: \"This paper ... shows how to efficiently diagnose many common cases of dangling (use-after-free) in C++ code, using only local analysis to report them as deterministic readable errors at compile time.\" Local analysis only. It's not looking in function definitions. Whole program analysis is extremely complicated and costly to compute. It's not comparable to return type deduction or something like that. reply HelloNurse 8 hours agorootparentWhole program analysis is also impossible in the common case of calling functions given only their declarations. The compiler sees the standard library and the source files it is compiling, not arbitrary external libraries to be linked at a later stage: they might not exist yet and, in case of dynamic linking, they could be replaced while the program is running. reply account42 9 hours agorootparentprevMaking programmers manually annoate every single function is infinitely more costly. reply nickitolas 4 hours agorootparentAre you also a proponent of nonlocal type inference? Do you think annotating types is too costly for programmers? reply dwattttt 9 hours agorootparentprevThat rather depends. Compile time certainly wouldn't scale linearly with the size of a function, you could well reach a scenario where adding in a line to a function results in a year being added to the compile time. reply SkiFire13 12 hours agorootparentprev> Start at leaf functions and walk your way back up the program until you're done.

This assumes no recursive functions, no virtual functions/function pointers, no external functions etc etc > Heck, we just got 'auto' type inference working in C++11, shouldn't we be able to do this too? Aliasing is much trickier than type inference. For example aliasing can change over time (i.e. some variables may alias at some point but not at a later point, while types are always the same) and you want any analysis to reflect it because you will likely rely on that. Granularity is also much more important: does a pointer alias with every element of a vector or only one? The former is surely easier to represent, but it may unnecessary propagate and result in errors. So effectively you have an infinite domain of places that can alias, while type inference is limited to locals, parameters, functions, etc etc. And even then, aliasing is quadratic, because you want to know which pairs of places alias. I hope you can see how this can quickly get impractical, both due to the complexity of the analysis and the fact that small imprecisions can result in very big false positives. reply thadt 10 hours agorootparentHence the term 'deceptively'. Even if a sufficiently advanced proof assistant could internally maintain and propagate constraints up through functions (eg. 'vec must not alias x'), your point about small imprecisions cascading into large false positives is well made. Bottom up constraints become increasingly difficult to untangle the further away they get from their inception, whereas top down rules such as \"no mutable aliasing\" are much easier to reason about locally. reply myworkinisgood 14 hours agoparentprevnext [2 more] [flagged] CoastalCoder 5 hours agorootparent> You are more correct than you think you are!!!

The profiles proposal focuses on a lack of annotations (I think there’s reasonable criticism that this isn’t achieved by it though…), and believing they can get 80% of the benefit for 20% of the effort (at least conceptually, obviously not those exact numbers). They aren’t shooting for full memory safety. The Safe C++ proposal asks “how do we achieve 100% memory safety by default?”. And then asks what is needed to achieve that goal. reply ameliaquining 13 hours agorootparentWhat's with the \"this model detects all possible errors\" quote at the beginning of the post, then? reply steveklabnik 5 hours agorootparentThat’s a claim about dangling pointers and ownership. Profiles do not solve aliasing or concurrency, as two examples of things that Safe C++ does that are important for memory safety. reply ameliaquining 2 hours agorootparentConcurrency, sure, I can see thinking of that as a separate thing (as some people from Google have advocated for). But aliasing isn't a memory safety violation, it's a cause of memory safety violations (and other kinds of bugs besides). The first example from the linked post is straightforwardly a dangling pointer dereference, and I don't understand how the people behind safety profiles can claim that it's out of scope just because it involves aliasing. Did they say something like \"this assumes your code follows these non-machine-checkable aliasing rules, if it doesn't then all bets are off\"? reply steveklabnik 2 hours agorootparentSure, I said “aliasing” to mean “these rules do not prevent memory unsafety due to misusing aliased pointers.” I hesitate to answer your question, but my impression is the answer is that they’re just not shooting for 100% safety, and so it’s acceptable to miss this kind of case. reply CoastalCoder 5 hours agoparentprevI wonder if the unstated issue here is: C++ is so complex that it's hard to think through all the implications of design proposals like this. So practically speaking, the only way to prove a design change is to implement it and get lots of people to take it for a test drive. But it's hard to find enough people willing to do that in earnest, so the only real way to test the idea is to make it part of the language standard. reply rurban 5 hours agoprevAdditionally I still cannot understand why they didn't make iterators safe from the very beginning. In the alias examples some iterators must alias and some not. With safe iterators the checks would be trivial, as just the base pointers need to be compared. This could be done even at compile-time, when all iterators bases are known at compile-time. Their argument then was that iterators are just simple pointers, not a struct of two values base + cur. You don't want to pass two values in two registers, or even on the stack. Ok, but then call them iterators, call them mere pointers. With safe iterators, you could even add the end or size, and don't need to pass begin() and end() to a function to iterate over a container or range. Same for ranges. A iterator should have just have been a range (with a base), so all checks could be done safely, the API would look sane, and the calls could be optimized for some values to be known at compile-time. Now we have the unsafe iterators, with the aliasing mess, plus ranges, which are still unsafe and ill-designed. Thanksfully I'm not in the library working group, because I would have had heart attacks long time ago over their incompetence. My CTL (the STL in C) uses safe iterators, and is still comparable in performance and size to C++ containers. Wrong aliasing and API usage is detected, in many cases also at compile-time. reply sirwhinesalot 4 hours agoparentWe're talking about a commitee that still releases \"safety improving\" constructs like std::span without any bounds checking. Don't think about it too much. reply munificent 2 hours agoparentprevThe C++ committee and standard library folks are in a hard spot. They have two goals: 1. Make primitives in the language as safe as they can. 2. Be as fast as corresponding completely unsafe C code. These goals are obviously in opposition. Sometimes, if you're lucky, you can improve safety completely at compile time and after the safety is proven, the compiler eliminates everything with no overhead. But often you can't. And when you can't, C++ folks tend to prioritize 2 over 1. You could definitely argue that that's the wrong choice. At the same time, that choice is arguably the soul of C++. Making a different choice there would fundamentally change the identity of the language. But I suspect that the larger issue here is cultural. Every organization has some foundational experiences that help define the group's identity and culture. For C++, the fact that the language was able to succeed at all instead of withering away like so many other C competitors did is because it ruthlessly prioritized performance and C compatibility over all other factors. Back in the early days of C++, C programmers wouldn't sacrifice an ounce of performance to get onto a \"better\" language. Their identity as close-to-the-metal programmers was based in part on being able to squeeze more out of a CPU than anyone else could. And, certainly, at the time, that really was valuable when computers were three orders of magnitude slower than they are today. That culture still pervades C++ where everyone is afraid of a performance death of a thousand cuts. So the language has sort of wedged itself into an untenable space where it refuses to be any slower than completely guardrail-less machine code, but where it's also trying to be safer. I suspect that long-term, it's an evolutionary dead end. Given the state of hardware (fast) and computer security failures (catastrophically harmful), it's worth paying some amount of runtime cost for safer languages. If you need to pay an extra buck or two for a slightly faster chip, but you don't leak national security secrets and go to jail, or leak personal health information and get sued for millions... buy the damn chip. reply zozbot234 18 minutes agorootparentRust is unique in being both safe and nearly as fast as idiomatic C/C++.

Put another way, you can’t draw new conclusions without new available assumptions. In Sean’s “Safe C++” proposal, he extends C++ to enable new code to embed new assumptions, then subsets that extension to permit drawing new conclusions for safety by eliminating code that would violate the path to those safety conclusions. reply steveklabnik 20 hours agoprevReally glad to see this thorough examination of the weaknesses of profiles.

I've broken down the arguments for why this is, and why it's a good thing, elsewhere [1]. Google's recent analysis on their own experiences transitioning toward memory safety provide even more evidence that you don't need to fully transition to get strong safety benefits. They incentivized moving new code to memory safe languages, and continued working to actively assure the existing memory unsafe code they had. In practice, they found that vulnerability density in a stable codebase decays exponentially as you continue to fix bugs. So you can reap the benefits of built-in memory safety for new code while driving down latent memory unsafety in existing code to great effect.

The idea that sustained bugfixing could occur on a project that was not undergoing active development is purely wishful thinking, as is the idea that a project could continue to provide useful functionality without vulnerabilities becoming newly exposed. And the idea of a meaningfully safer C++ is something that has been tried and failed for 20+ years. Eventually everything will be rewritten in Rust or successors thereof. It's the only approach that works, and the only approach that can work, and as the cost of bugs continues to increase, continuing to use memory-unsafe code will cease to be a viable option. reply gpderetta 9 hours agorootparent> The idea that sustained bugfixing could occur on a project that was not undergoing active development is purely wishful thinking yet the idea that a project no longer actively developed will be rewritten in rust is not? reply lmm 7 hours agorootparent> yet the idea that a project no longer actively developed will be rewritten in rust is not? Rewriting it in Rust while continuing to actively develop the project is a lot more plausible than keeping it in C++ and being able to \"maintain a stable codebase\" but somehow still fix bugs.

Rust is nice, but every time I think I should write this new code in Rust I discover it needs to interoperate with some C++ code. How to I work with std::vector in rust - it isn't impossible but it isn't easy (and often requires copying data from C++ types to Rust types and back). How do I call a C++ virtual function from Rust? The above issue is why my code is nearly all C++ - C++ was the best choice we had 15 years ago and mixing languages is hard unless you limit yourself to C (unreasonably simple IMO). D is the only language I'm aware of that has a good C++ interoperability story (I haven't worked with D so I don't know how it works in practice). Rust is really interesting, but it is hard to go from finishing a \"hello world\" tutorial in Rust to putting Rust in a multi-million line C++ program. reply zozbot234 40 minutes agorootparentRust/C++ interop is in fact complex and not obviously worthwhile - some of the underlying mechanisms (like the whole deal with \"pinned\" objects in Rust) are very much being worked on.

Yeah, but it's also not going to be rewritten in safe C++. reply pavon 17 hours agorootparentWhy not? C++ has evolved over the years, and every C++ project I have worked on, we've adopted new features that make the language safer or clearer as they are supported by the compilers we target. It doesn't get applied to the entire codebase overnight, but all new code uses these features, refactors adopt them as much as possible, and classes of bugs found by static code scanning cause them to be adopted sprinkled through the rest of the code. Our C++ software is more stable than it has ever been because of it. Meanwhile, throwing everything away and rewriting it from scratch in another language has never been an option for any of those projects. Furthermore, even when there has been interest and buy-in to incrementally move to Rust in principle, in practice most of the time we evaluate using Rust for new features, the amount of existing code it must touch and the difficulty integrating Rust and C++ meant that we usually ended up using C++ instead. If features of Circle C++ were standardized, or at least stabilized with wider support, we would certainly start adopting them as well. reply ameliaquining 17 hours agorootparentWhat I'm really hoping is that https://github.com/google/crubit eventually gets good enough to facilitate incremental migration of brownfield C++ codebases to Rust.

Nothing in the Rust front end would need to know about C++. It’s a sub command that would passthrough clang. If you were worried about clang flag stability not being as stable as Rust, you could also include clang as part of llvm-tools. This would add an extra step to set up, but is still easier than today. Of course, in both cases there’s still the work of having rust up (or rustc, depending on the strategy) set up the sysroot.

Improved C++'s safety means that the C++ code underlying several JVM implementations, CLR, V8, GCC and LLVM, CUDA, Unreal, Godot, Unity,... also gets a way to be improved, without a full rewrite, which while possible might not be economically feasible. reply wyager 18 hours agorootparentprevActually, this subthread is about whether this is a \"really important project\" reply tptacek 17 hours agorootparentto the C++ language reply jmull 3 hours agorootparentprev> It seems to me like we already have a lower-overhead approach ... Rust Rewriting all the existing C++ code in Rust is extremely high-cost. Practically speaking, that means it won't happen in many, many cases. I think we want to find a more efficient way to achieve memory safety in C++. Not to mention, Rust's safety model isn't that great. It does memory safety, which is good, but it's overly restrictive, disallowing various safe patterns. I suspect there are better safe alternatives out there for most cases, or at least could be. It would make sense to consider the alternatives before anyone rewrites something in Rust. reply zozbot234 23 minutes agorootparent> It does memory safety, which is good, but it's overly restrictive, disallowing various safe patterns The \"safe\" patterns Rust disallows tend to not account for safe modularity - as in, they impose complex, hard-to-verify requirements on outside code if \"safety\" is to be preserved. This kind of thing is essentially what the \"unsafe\" feature in Rust is intended to address. reply steveklabnik 3 hours agorootparentprevFolks who want to propose alternatives should do so! Right now, you’ve only got the two: profiles and Safe C++. There are also two that aren’t proposals. It have a semblance of a plan: “graft Hylo semantics instead of Rust semantics” and “scpptool.” Realistically, unless something else concrete and not “could be” is found at the eleventh hour, this is the reality of the possible choices. reply jmull 2 hours agorootparentDon't forget the comment above proposes another alternative, \"rewrite it in Rust\". The problem with such a proposal is that the cost is impossibly high for many, many cases. Effectively, across the entire existing C++ code base, you get \"X% rewrite it in Rust plus (1-X)% do nothing at all\", where X is probably a lot closer to 0 than 1. If your goal is to address as many vulnerabilities as possible, you might want to look for a better plan. I don't have a ready plan, but the general approach of incrementally improving the safety of existing C++ seems likely to be more effective than rewrites to me -- it could let the X in my formula move a lot closer to 1. Possibly one of the existing mechanisms for this is already better than \"RIIR\". Edit, I meant to add: For many, many things it's not the eleventh hour. For a lot of existing C++ code, no one has reached a final decision point. Many haven't really started at all and are at the 0th hour. reply umanwizard 18 hours agorootparentprevFor new projects on mainstream architectures that don't have to depend on legacy C++ baggage, Rust is great (and, I think, practically always the better choice).

There were many similar issues when it came to the earlier attempts to add concepts to C++ (which would improve template dispatch), although the outcome was more about improving C++ programmer's lives, not safety. It turned out trying to encapsulate all the things C++ functions, even in the standard library, as a list of concepts, was basically impossible. There are so many little corner-cases in C++ which need representing as a concept, the list of 'concepts' a function needed often ended up being longer than the function itself. reply favorited 18 hours agoprevI know Sean said on Twitter that he probably won't submit this to WG21, but I wish he would...

Still love the language though :p reply pjmlp 8 hours agorootparentC++ became my favourite language after Object Pascal, as it provided similar safety levels, added with the portability. I never been that big into C, although I do know it relatively well, as much as anyone can claim to do so, because it is a key language in anything UNIX/POSIX and Windows anyway. One of the appealing things back then were the C++ frameworks that were provided alongside C++ compilers, pre-ISO C++98, all of them with more security consideration than what ended up landing on the standard library, e.g. bounds checking by default on collection types. Nowadays I rather spend my time in other languages, and reach out to C++ on a per-need basis, as other language communities take the security discussion more seriously. However, likewise I still love the language itself, and is one of those that I usually reach for in side projects, where I can freely turn to 100% all the safety features available to me, without the usual drama from some C++ circles. reply saagarjha 16 hours agorootparentprevSome of them are unfortunately on language committees. reply randomNumber7 8 hours agoprevThis is a great article and shows why its so hard to program in C++. When you do not deeply understand the reasons why those examples behave as they do, your code is potentially dangerous. reply MathMonkeyMan 2 hours agoprevWhy is `f3` safe? My thought (which is apparently wrong) is that the `const int& x` refers to memory that might be freed during `vector::push_back`. Then, when we go to construct the new element that is a copy of `x`, it might be invalid to read `x`. No? Is this related to how a reference-to-const on the stack can extend the lifetime of a temporary to which it's bound? I didn't think that function parameters had this property (i.e. an implicit copy). reply seanbax 2 hours agoparentIf the vector has to be resized in push_back, the implementation copy-constructs a new object from x. It resizes the buffer. Then it move-constructs the copy into the buffer. The cost is only a move construct per resize... So it's on the order of log2(capacity). Very efficient. But don't get used to it, because there are plenty of other C++ libraries that will break under aliasing. reply embe42 2 hours agorootparentI think the implementation in C++ does not do realloc on push_back, but allocates new memory, creates the new element and only then deallocates it. I believe the reason f3 is safe is that the standard says that the iterators/references are invalidated after push_back – so push_back needs to be carefully written to accept aliasing pointers. I am pretty sure if I were writing my own push_back it would do something like \"reserve(size() + 1), copy element into the new place\", and it would have different aliasing requirements... (For me this is a good example of how subtle such things are) reply MathMonkeyMan 2 hours agorootparent> allocates new memory, creates the new element and only then deallocates it.

Why would someone use this new proposed C++-with-Rust-annotations in place of just Rust? reply ijustlovemath 18 hours agoparentBecause the millions of lines of existing C++ aren't going anywhere. You need transition capability if you're ever gonna see widespread adoption. See: C++'s own adoption story; transpiling into C to get wider adoption into existing codebases. reply leni536 13 hours agoparentprevFeatures C++ has that Rust doesn't: * template specialisations * function overloading * I believe const generics is still not there in Rust, or its necessarily more restricted. In general metaprogramming facilities are more expressive in C++, with different other tradeoffs to Rust. But the tradeoffs don't include memory safety. reply ynik 9 hours agorootparentThe main big philosophical difference regarding templates is that Rust wants to guarantee that generic instantiation always succeeds; whereas C++ is happy with instantiation-time compiler errors. The C++ approach does make life a fair bit easier and can maybe even avoid some of the lifetime annotation burden in some cases: in Rust, a generic function may need a `where T: 'static` constraint; in C++ with lifetimes it could be fine without any annotations as long as it's never instantiated with structs containing pointers/references. Template specializations are not in Rust because they have some surprisingly tricky interactions with lifetimes. It's not clear lifetimes can be added to C++ without having the same issue causing safety holes with templates. At least I think this might be an issue if you want to compile a function instance like `void foo()` only once, instead of once for each different string data lifetime. reply tialaramex 3 hours agorootparentprevYou definitely can't have all of \"Non-type template parameters\" (the C++ equivalent of const generics) in Rust because some of it is unsound. You can certainly have more than you get today, it's much less frantically demanded but I should like to be able to have an enum of Hats and then make Goose Goose Goose and so on, which is sound but cannot exist today. For function overloading this serves two purposes in C++ and I think Rust chooses a better option for both: First, when there are similar features with different parameters, overloading lets you pretend the feature set was smaller but making them a single function. So e.g. C++ offers a single sort function but Rust distinguishes sort, sort_by and sort_by_key Obviously all three have the same underlying implementation, but I feel the distinct names helps us understand when reading code what's important. If they're all named sort you may not notice that one of these calls is actually quite different. Secondly, this provides a type of polymorphism, \"Ad hoc polymorphism\". For example if we ask whether name.contains('A') in C++ the contains function is overloaded to accept both char (a single byte 'A' the number 65) and several ways to represent strings in C++ In Rust name.contains('A') still works, but for a different reason 'A' is still a char, this time that's a Unicode Scalar Value, but the reason it works here is that char implements the Pattern trait, which is a trait for things which can be matched against part of a string. So name.contains(char::is_uppercase) works, name.contains(|ch| { /* arbitrary predicate for the character */ }) works, name.contains(\"Alex\") works, and a third party crate could have it work for regular expressions or anything else. I believe this more extensible alternative is strictly superior while also granting improved semantic value. reply lmm 10 hours agoparentprev> Why would someone use this new proposed C++-with-Rust-annotations in place of just Rust?

Simply making C++ compilers compatible with one another is a constant struggle. Making Rust work well with existing C++ code is even more difficult. Thus, it is far easier to make something like Clang understand and compile C++-specific annotations alongside legacy C++ code than making rustc understand C++ types. Moreover, teams of C++ programmers will have an easier time writing annotated C++ than they would learning an entirely new language.

The GitHub activity is purely for documentation. I don’t know about real world adoption, nor do I think it’s really about what I’m saying. The proposal was made public a few weeks ago.

Now that virtual address space is cheap, it's possible to recompile C (or presumably C++) with a fully-safe runtime (requiring annotation only around nasty things like `union sigval`), but this is an ABI break and has nontrivial overhead (note that AddressSanitizers has ~2x overhead and only catches some optimistic cases) unless you mandate additional annotation. reply mananaysiempre 19 hours agoparent> AddressSanitizer has ~2x overhead I’ve got some programs where the ASan overhead is 10× or more.

The point is, the overhead can vary a lot depending on e.g. how many mallocs your code does. This does not contradict your point in any way, to be clear.

Except that's a really harsh and unproductive way to phrase it. The existence of \"unsafe\" is not a \"confession\" that safe code is impossible so why should even try.

Or strlen(malloc(100))? reply TinkersW 6 hours agorootparentIt seems to me that it would handle the sort case fine, you would read/write an invalid page and it would fall over(assuming all allocations had invalid pages at the end of the allocation & no 2 allocations share a page). The strlen could be made safe by having the malloc return the address 100 bytes before the end of the page. If it did make it to the end of the 100 bytes it would fall over safely. Result would be nonsense of course. Of course if you read bytesassuming all allocations had invalid pages at the end of the allocation & no 2 allocations share a page This assumption doesn't hold for real world systems -- most allocations are small, so heap allocators typically support a minimum allocation size of 16 bytes. Requiring each allocation to have its own page would be a 256x memory overhead for these small allocations (assuming 4k pages, and even worse as systems are moving to 16k or 64k page size). Not to mention destroying your TLB. Also, guard pages only solve the problem if the program tries to access the entire array (like when sorting or reading a string). For other types of out-of-bounds array access where an attacker can control the index accessed, they can just pass in an index high enough to jump over the guard page. You can \"fix\" this with probing, but at that point just bounds-checking is much simpler and more performant. reply o11c 10 hours agorootparentprevWith a safe runtime, a pointer is really something like a `struct { u32 allocation_base, allocation_offset;}`. (it may be worth doing fancy variable-bit-width math to allow many small allocations but only a few large ones; it's also likely worth it to have a dedicated \"leaf\" section of memory that is intended not to contain any pointers) An implementation of `sort` would start with: `assert (begin.allocation_base == end.allocation_base)`. Most likely, this would be implicit when `end - begin` or `beginit will be necessary to heap-allocate stack frames.

This makes no sense. Safety is a whole-program concern and you should analyze the whole program to check it.

Your function would look like this in Rust: fn f4(map: &'a Map, key: &i32) -> &'a i32 { ... } You don't need much more than a superficial understanding of Rust's lifetime syntax to understand what's going on here, and you have much more information about the function. reply jerf 5 hours agorootparent\"Whole-program analysis is not tractable (i.e., not scalable),\" The search term for those who'd like to follow up is \"Superoptimization\", which is one of the perennial ideas that programmers get that will Change the World if it is \"just\" implemented and \"why hasn't anyone else done it I guess maybe they're just stupid\", except it turns out to not work in practice. In a nutshell, the complexity classes involved just get too high. (An interesting question I have is whether a language could be designed from the get-go to work with some useful subset of superoptimizations, but unfortunately, it's really hard to answer such questions when the bare minimum to have a good chance of success is 30 years of fairly specific experience before one even really stands a chance, and by then that's very unlikely to be what that person wants to work on.) reply gpderetta 2 hours agorootparentprev [–] Something I would like to know is how much lifetime annotation you can infer (recursively) from the function implementation itself. Compiler driven, IDE integrated, automatic annotation would be a good tool to have. Some amount of non-local inference might also be possible for templated C++ code that already lack a proper separate compilation story. reply steveklabnik 2 hours agorootparent [–] At the limit, the answer is “between zero and completely.” Zero because you may only have access to the prototype and not the body, say if the body is in another translation unit, or completely if a full solution could be found, which is certainly possible for trivial cases. The reason to not do this isn’t due to impossibility, but for other factors: it’s computationally expensive, I’d you think compile times are already bad, get ready for them to get way worse. Also, changing the body can break code in competently different parts of your program, as changing the body changes the signature and can now invalidate callers. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

Joe Biden said, “Supporting Israel is the best $3 billion investment we make. Were there not an Israel, the United States of America would have to invent an Israel to protect her interests in the region.” Israel is a satellite state of the US in all but name. You'd have a better shot at dissolving the UN entirely than suspending Israel. What ive always wondered is why the US hasn't put Israel on the security council, considering it is a nuclear armed state. reply dragonwriter 18 hours agorootparent> Israel is a satellite state of the US in all but name. The US is more reflexively pro-Israel than Israel is pro-US in international policy, the opposite of what you’d expect if Israel was a US vassal. > What ive always wondered is why the US hasn't put Israel on the security council There are lots of reasons, but one that renders all the others secondary is that the US can’t add permanent Security Council members. > considering it is a nuclear armed state. India, Pakistan, North Korea, and, when it was a nuclear-armed state, South Africa also are (and were) not permanent UNSC members, a set whuch hasn't expanded, though two seats have switched hands, since the UN was founded. reply renegade-otter 17 hours agorootparentYet Russia, a country the leader of which is wanted for war crimes - is on the permanent Security Council.

Escalating conflict in the ME, such as with Israel and Lebanon, regardless of who is at fault, is not in the interest of the US. The administration feels attempts to deescalate are falling on deaf ears, but is in a politically precarious situation. reply tmnvix 13 hours agorootparentprevThere are two points here. The first is due to AIPAC. I would say the second is debatable. reply 7thpower 5 hours agorootparentThat’s fair. reply invalidname 13 hours agorootparentprevThis is often repeated but is historically VERY incorrect. Yes, Israel does lobbying in the states and does influence (like every other country). The current Israeli government is indeed terrible and blatant at that. However, Israel left Gaza in 2005 with no deal as part of US pressure (which led to the current situation). Israel offered a Palestinians a country which included east Jerusalem twice based on US pressure. Israel left Lebanon alone due to such pressure. Israel didn't attack Lebanon for a year and tried to settle due to US pressure despite an average of 25 rockets per day towards civilian population. Imagine a country being attacked and fired on for nearly 20 years (by Hamas) and keeping reposes \"moderate\". That's US pressure and influence right there. Israel delayed going into Rafah due to US pressure, it turns out Sinwar and quite a few hostages were there... The reason it seems that US pressure isn't working is mostly because no one knows what to do exactly. Hostages are still held by Hamas. Hezbollah is still firing rockets/drones even now. I'm 100% for a hostage exchange but right now there's no deal, part of that is because of Netanyahu (who is terrible) but not all of it. The US can't fire Netanyahu (I wish they could...), and that's a problem. They want to strengthen anti-Netanyahu forces within Israel while still moderating its actions, that's a very tight rope to walk on. reply throwaway920333 10 hours agorootparentIsrael never left Gaza. They surrounded it. They controlled the entire land border and didn't let ships sail or planes take off from Gaza. It's as if, after a prison riot, all of the guards just said fuck 'em and decamped to a perimeter around the prison with machine guns with orders to shoot to kill. Gaza is way too small and densely populated to be remotely self-sufficient. Now, just to short-circuit the reply chain, you're going to say that Hamas would have just used the borders to move in weapons. Sure, that's true. In fact, they dug a bunch of tunnels under the Israeli controlled border crossings and smuggled in a bunch of weapons. Normal stuff like food and medicine though were constantly blocked or delayed. By the way, I don't know how to solve this problem well at this point. Both sides have done enough evil shit to each other that they will want to kill each other for generations. Israel though, has never withdrawn from Gaza, and Israel has never agreed to abide by the terms of UN Resolution 242 that obligates them to withdraw from the 1967 occupied territories. What I expect to happen based on the ground reality and statements from members of the Israeli government is that the Palestinians in Gaza will either die or have their lives be made so intolerable that they leave, and then Israel will annex the land, just as they have in Jerusalem and many areas of the West Bank. reply invalidname 8 hours agorootparentIsrael didn't \"surround Gaza\". It exists around Gaza. Gaza also has a border with Egypt who controlled it in the past and didn't want it back. In fact they used that border to smuggle weapons and sex slaves (not an exaggeration). Israel supplied Gaza with water, electricity and everything necessary. It's as if Israel gave Gaza a chance to prove itself and it immediately elected Hamas, started building war tunnels and rockets. Peace requires proof and unfortunately Hamas proved the opposite. You're assuming that if Israel would have relaxed its defenses things would have been better, Israel relaxed its defenses before October 7th. Hamas is the organization that sent suicide bombers into the middle of Tel Aviv. It blew up busses full of civilians in order to stop the peace process and prevent the prospect of a Palestinian state. Their slogan in Arabic is \"from the river to the sea Palestine will be Arab\", the river and the sea are the borders of Israel and its tantamount to \"kill all the Jews\". Israel elected Liberals who tried to create a peace process and give back almost everything. Hamas blew that up and triggered the rise of the Israeli right-wing. I think there's only way out of this mess and its through. As long as Hamas exists in a functioning form there can be no peace. It's horrible and tragic but I don't see any other way out of this mess. Hopefully, Israel will be able to recover after that and return to its liberal/humane roots. reply aguaviva 1 hour agorootparentTheir slogan in Arabic is \"from the river to the sea Palestine will be Arab\", the river and the sea are the borders of Israel and its tantamount to \"kill all the Jews\". There are many variants of the slogan of course, but for some reason you're picking one of the more uncommon (and more virulent) versions. However, he \"official\" versions (for example from the PLO) use the phrase to call for a single democratic state for Arabs and Jews, that would replace Israel, and from which nobody will be expelled. This is of course also in line (albeit in somewhat simplified form) with the version one sees almost uniformly on the streets these days, \"From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free\", and if you ask people what they mean by that, most of them will tell you something equivalent to the PLO version. Meanwhile since 1977 Likud has used essentially the same slogan, but in reverse, minus any aspirations of democratic equality, and with racial supremacy baked in: \"Between the sea and the Jordan there will only be Israeli sovereignty.\" reply invalidname 38 minutes agorootparent> However, he \"official\" versions (for example from the PLO) The PLO recognizes that Israel has a right to exist and has abandoned official \"armed resistance\" approaches. They understand that this never worked and ultimately only hurt the Palestinian people. I'm explicitly talking about Hamas and making a clear distinction between them and the Palestinian people at large. > use the phrase to call for a single democratic state for Arabs and Jews That was suggested in the past and has gone back in vogue for some extreme liberals but it's probably not what any side wants. I don't think it's something that's workable. See Lebanon as a case in point where three different conflicting cultures are constantly violently clashing. > This is of course also in line (albeit in somewhat simplified form) with the version one sees almost uniformly on the streets these days, \"From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free\", and if you ask people what they mean by that, most of them will tell you something equivalent to the PLO version. Well... What *some* people mean doesn't really mean anything. There was a Nordic Journalist who recorded pro-Palestinian demonstrations and the Arabic slogans people yelled were VERY different. But even without that. Hamas is looking at these protests and seeing them as Israel losing support. So they keep fighting, keep holding hostages and keep sending children as carriers. Netanyahu points at these demonstrations as how the world is turning anti-semetic so Israelis MUST fight for their home. And yes, Israelis 100% hear \"Palestine will be free of Jews\". Trump is pointing at them as a failure of the liberals... These protests are only helping bad people and increasing strife. If they were indeed pro-Palestinian they would carry both flags in support of a two state solution. They would also support the cause of returning the hostages. They are now for peace, they are anti-Israel protests. > Meanwhile since 1977 Likud has used essentially the same slogan, but in reverse, minus any aspirations of democratic equality, and with racial supremacy baked in: \"Between the sea and the Jordan there will only be Israeli sovereignty.\" That was not an official slogan but yes people on the more extreme right did sing it. People still do and also say worse things. There are several big problems with whataboutism... Palestinians are the weaker part of this situation, violence will always end up worse for them. That's why the PLO abandoned that approach (at least officially excluding lynch mobs), it doesn't help Palestinians to keep that rhetoric. Also the Likud was the party that voted to leave Gaza. That included Netanyhau who signed that law. A PM who originated from the Likud offered a Palestinian state in 2008. reply aguaviva 26 minutes agorootparentI'm aware of just one \"official\" Hamas formulation of the slogan, via the 2017 charter as quoted below. Can you point to any others? We do have that quote from Khaled Meshaal as well, but one doesn't hear it so often. Hamas’ 2017 charter states that in principle, it “rejects any alternative to the full and complete liberation of Palestine, from the river to the sea.” In a 2012 speech, Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal said, “Palestine is ours from the river to the sea and from the south to the north. There will be no concession on any inch of the land.” https://forward.com/fast-forward/568788/from-the-river-to-th... (Might get back to the other stuff you wrote later) reply invalidname 13 minutes agorootparentSee https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_the_river_to_the_sea من المية للمية / فلسطين عربية, \"from the water to the water / Palestine is Arab\" Notice that this is nitpicking since the intention is clear to Israelis/Palestinians even in the moderate version of the slogan. This hurts Palestinians because it discourages their leaders from compromises that might have ended this conflict (see the 2000 and 2008 statehood rejections). It also strengthens the sense within Israelis that there's no partner for peace on the other side. It's like using the N-word. Once you said that you have that label and feeling, nothing you say will matter to any side. disgruntledphd2 7 hours agorootparentprev> As long as Hamas exists in a functioning form there can be no peace. I think the big problem with this approach is that actions taken now, which lead to deaths, lead to the friends & family of said people becoming more radicalised and thus to more terror attacks/wars in the future. I read recently in the FT that 60% of current Hamas fighters have lost family to previous conflicts, suggesting that this isn't going to end. And more generally, it's basically impossible for conventional armies to defeat guerilla fighters who have the support of the population (c.f. Irish/English conflicts, Iraq, Afghanisation (multiple times) etc). Like, fundamentally the only way this can end is through either extermination or negotiation. Given the relative power imbalances, it'll be extermination of the Palestinians, which would be terrible (and incredibly depressing given that a lot of Israeli citizens are descended from survivors of the Holocausts and the various pogroms in European history). reply invalidname 4 hours agorootparentI used to be of that mindset and no longer am. Hamas killed more people in a single day than the IRA killed in its entire existence. The Irish conflict which is more similar to the conflict Israel has in the west bank, is mostly a territorial conflict. If it were true that violence breeds violence then Jews would have blown up post war Germany with suicide vests. It was still filled with Nazis and their collaborators. Hamas is a different story, there's no amount of negotiations or compromise that will placate a fanatic. They will probably keep doing these things forever just like Isis didn't fully go away. But once the leadership got cut down Isis found it much harder to pull off the same level of terror. I agree that this needs to be a dual motion. Young frustrated people are kindle for these organizations and this won't work without a peace process that would give hope to the people. That's why I don't have any faith in the current Israeli government. I hope it can be replaced so there would be a parallel process that would help rebuild and pave a way for peace again. reply disgruntledphd2 2 hours agorootparentI agree that the Irish conflict is more like the West Bank (but that's super super bad and has been for a long time) and that October 7th was much more destructive than anything in the Troubles. Like, it's worth noting that the core of the nationalist and unionist terrorists still live in Ireland and engage in a bunch of criminality. These organizations don't disband, they just die off/become politicians. The big problem with Israel making peace is that it appears a solid majority don't want that, which depresses the hell out of me. reply invalidname 1 hour agorootparentA solid majority is for peace and has been for a while. Oct 7th might have screwed the numbers, but they will bounce back. The Oslo accords wouldn't have happened with out a solid majority. Netanyahu himself had to make a speech where he specifically supported the idea of a Palestinian state in order to get elected (see the Bar Ilan Speech). There are many peace activists on both sides but also a lot of fatigue and disillusionment. Don't let that get you down too. I think once the dust settles things could change. The pendulum always swings to the other side, we just need patience and to set an environment receptive for that. If Trump wins this election things will probably get much worse before they get better. But I think that they will get better even in that worst case scenario. reply weatherlite 9 hours agorootparentprevIsrael did withdraw from Lebanon though, this wasn't effective at all at promoting peace as we're now seeing, and same thing has happened in Gaza; Israel did uproot all the settlers from Gaza and there was no single Israeli soldier left in Gaza - you can say the Gaza withdrawal was incomplete but saying it never happened at all is incorrect. Unfortunately Israelis only learned that withdrawals from enemies who have sworn to destroy you only make things worse for them. reply aguaviva 1 hour agorootparentprevIsrael offered a Palestinians a country which included east Jerusalem twice based on US pressure. On which occasions? reply invalidname 1 hour agorootparentThere were two separate offers made by Barak to Arafat in 2000 and by Olmert to Abu Mazen in 2008. reply boomboomsubban 18 hours agorootparentprev>What ive always wondered is why the US hasn't put Israel on the security council, considering it is a nuclear armed state. That isn't the criteria for being a council member, if it were they'd need to allow India, Pakistan, and North Korea. Plus, pretty sure the US does not officially recognize Israel as a nuclear power, it's one of those open secret things Besides that, how would the US benefit from another country being able to veto anything they want to do in the UN? Sure, they'd probably agree with far more things than Russia or China, but the US wouldn't gain anything from them being there. reply throwaway9917 15 hours agorootparentprevThe thing is, Israel doesn’t protect U.S. interests in the middle east. All the U.S. has really ever wanted there is oil, and because of U.S. support for Israel, we’ve been the subject of two oil embargoes. Israel provides us zero military bases, even when Arab countries provide us dozens. Despite all of the support we give them and have given them, they have repeatedly escalated conflicts when the U.S. asked them to stop. Today, we are unable to ship goods through the Red Sea because the Houthis are upset over Israel’s actions in Gaza. reply dlubarov 14 hours agorootparentHas the US asked for a base? They do have Site 512, not a typical base but still a base. In many ways Israel does the US' dirty work, like crippling Hezbollah which is responsible for numerous attacks against US (and other Western) personnel. The Houthis are squarely to blame for the disruption of Red Sea shipping; Israel's military operation in a different country isn't a legitimate reason to attack (almost) random ships. reply throwaway9917 14 hours agorootparentI think you’re missing the point here. The only reason the U.S. cares about Hezbollah is because they attack Israel. The only reason Hezbollah exists is because of Israel. The reason the Houthis are attacking shipping is because the U.S. supports Israel. Being an ally to Israel has imposed huge costs on the U.S. and virtually no benefits. Many in the U.S. feel that protecting Israel is a moral cause, but it is undeniably a strategic albatross for us. reply weatherlite 9 hours agorootparent> The only reason the U.S. cares about Hezbollah is because they attack Israel. The only reason Hezbollah exists is because of Israel You can't know that. The Iranian Islamic revolution happened not because of Israel. Iran would have probably tried to gain influence through proxies and destabilize the Middle East regardless of Israel. It would have joined forces with Russia and China. It would have probably tried acquiring nuclear weapons and it would have hated the U.S (which it calls Big Satan to this day). In short Iran would have been a huge headache and security risk for the U.S and the West even if Israel didn't exist imo. The U.S is definitely strong enough to deal with Iran without Israel, but its helpful to have allies in a very very unstable neighborhood. reply dragonwriter 14 hours agorootparentprev> The only reason the U.S. cares about Hezbollah is because they attack Israel. No, another is that they are proxies of Iran, which the US has problems with that go beyond attacking Israel. reply Tostino 5 hours agorootparentNow go back a few years and take into account the US meddling with Iran. You'll notice some cause -> effect with our intended consequences coming back to bite us for decades. reply ioblomov 18 hours agorootparentprevExcellent point. But assuming you're not being facetious, the Security Council is largely a historical artifact: all five permanent members were the victors of WWII. (Why occupied France was included is something I never understood.) reply cma 15 hours agorootparentCouncil came first for some, but they were also the first 5 nuclear powers. In one case, Mainland China got the bomb in '64 and replaced Taiwan on the security council within a decade. reply ioblomov 12 hours agorootparentWhile it's true nuclear proliferation began with the five permanent members, at the time the UN and Security Council were founded in 1945, only the US had the bomb. The USSR didn't test one until 1949, the UK in 1952, France in 1960, and China (as you mentioned) in 1964. The Soviet Union had an early start because of their spies in the Manhattan Project, while the UK contributed to it during the War. 15 years would pass before another permanent member caught up. And Russia took the USSR's seat just as China did Taiwan's. reply ycomb-acct 18 hours agorootparentprevyou've got it backwards. the US is a vassal of isreal. look at apaic. look at every member of blackrocks board. look at the presidential cabinets, whomever gets elected. isrealis control the US, not the other way around. reply flappyeagle 16 hours agorootparentThere are no Israelis in the cabinet as far as I know.

Worth considering that in terms of relative size, Israel has a population of 10 million, Jews in the world number ~14 million. Whereas the Arab world, which tends to be relatively anti-Israel, numbers ~220 million. And Muslims, which tend to be anti-Israel as well, number 1.2 billion. So just in terms of number of voices, the natural pro-Israel voices [1] are vastly outnumbered by the natural anti-Israel voices. Think about how this impacts what you hear, how this impacts the votes in the UN (which is not democratic but votes are by country), how this impacts economic reactions (number of consumers), etc. [1] This is a sweeping generalization, but it is statistically true that Jews are usually pro-Israel and Arabs and Muslims are usually anti-Israel.

Western media often aligns with Israeli perspectives due to strategic alliances, lobbying influence, and media ownership dynamics, framing Israel’s actions as defensive while sidelining broader Arab or Palestinian views. Online, pro-Israel narratives are reinforced by organized digital campaigns and moderation practices that shape public discourse. Meanwhile, pro-Palestinian voices lack comparable resources and organization in Western spaces, limiting their visibility.

Do not accept the notion that a powerful military and intelligence apparatus is helpless. They could prosecute this war differently. They have made a choice not to. You're now making a false dichotomy - Israel can choose to prosecute the war differently, but it doesn't, implying that they are choosing to kill human shields on purpose. The reality is that you're coming up on the spot with a dozen ways to defeat an insurgency, without taking into account that they are just as smart and just as motivated as you, and planned for years to make them impossible to hit without significant civilian casualties. This is incredibly well documented. Sure, you can pretend there is always a secret third option - and there sometimes is. And there sometimes isn't. And the more you let militants using civilians as human shields deter you, the more the militants are incentivized to use human shields, so even in a best case scenario, you're kicking the can down the road. None of this is to say that Israel's actions are perfect or even good - that's a separate argument.

This is nonsense propaganda that keeps getting repeated. Israel has some army bases in or close to civilian areas, as do most countries - e.g. the Pentagon. The reason is that some army bases are used for intelligence, software development or other administrative tasks, which usually involves older officers and many civilians, so it makes sense to have these be in cities. But note key differences between this and what Hamas is accused of doing: 1. These are administrative buildings. These are not weapons storage facilities, combat factilities, etc. And it's especially not where missile launch sites or things of a similar nature are located. Shooting missiles from within houses, as e.g. Hezbollah does, or from under refugee camps, as Hamas does, is a different thing entirely - because to stop the actual rockets being shot at Israel, Israel has to shoot at them, which kills civilians. That is not what Israel does with those bases. 2. Israeli bases are not built under civilian buildings.

Do you really think there was no other way, to deal with the problem? Personally, for me the most absurd aspect of the situation is that you're creating an enormous amount of members for the Hamas' of the future. However good a person is, and however quiet by nature, they wouldn't be human if a percentage of them wouldn't look for revenge, after having all their relatives killed, endured surgeries without anesthetics, and seen there was no good justification for that.

In addition, Western rags took Israeli statements as gospel, platformed way more guests from the Israeli side, and intensively questioned all pro-Palestine guests on their position on Oct 7 (while treating Israeli guests with more respect than necessary for a media interview).

Israeli civilians have faced decades of risk (which I think also benefits the right wing of Israeli politics), and this is not a new conflict.

This policy is an effective deterrent against enemies, but it should be obvious that with such a policy it will never be possible to end any conflict unless absolutely all enemies and all their relatives or friends are killed. There have been times when the relations between the parties in this conflict had improved a lot and there was some hope for a peaceful resolution of the conflict. Nevertheless on both sides, but especially in Israel, there are people who benefit a lot from the existence of the conflict, so any opponents have been removed by any means possible, including assassination, until the mutual relationships have become as bad as today, when no hope for any kind of peace remains. Most people in Israel are quite nice, but they are deeply scared by the thought that that at any time someone coming from the neighbors of Israel could come and cut their throats, so they work continuously very hard at their jobs, believing that they must provide thus their individual contributions so that Israel will maintain its military and economic dominance over their enemies, in order to ensure their safety. The workers of Israel have worked all the time since WWII pretty much as hard as those of USA during its short participation to WWII.

Indeed, this picture came out much later: https://www.instagram.com/israelmfa/p/C7Q1v38tKql/ Shows what appears to be the famous \"bloody pants\" soldier sitting on the floor close to other presumably injured soldiers after some sort of combat. Isn't that the most obvious way of getting \"bloody pants\"?

It presents no evidence for such a claim through the entire article. It covers debunked claims of sexual violence on October 7th, it does contain a reference to one hostage who was sexually assaulted during her kidnapping who was since thankfully successfully released reply Sam713 11 minutes agorootparentFrom the article: “The United Nations and other organizations have presented credible evidence that Hamas militants committed sexual assault during their rampage. The prosecutor for the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, said Monday he had reason to believe that three key Hamas leaders bore responsibility for “rape and other acts of sexual violence as crimes against humanity.” I’m not going to dig up and post links to videos showing Hamas parading female captives with blood on their pants, or partially disrobed bodies. Videos which were filmed by Hamas members themselves I might add. Here is an article instead from BBC with testimony from survivors: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67629181.amp I don’t want to assume that you are arguing in bad faith, but there are numerous reputable sources showing that other atrocities occurred beyond the murder of civilians. It’s bad enough that Hamas directly targeted and killed over 700 civilians. reply nujabe 9 hours agorootparentprevThat article you linked does not support your claims at all. The UN was pressured by Israel to send a delegation, but they would not cooperate fully and refused a full investigation. From the UN report [1]: >In the medicolegal assessment of available photos and videos, no tangible indications of rape could be identified. >The mission team examined several allegations of sexual violence. It must be noted that witnesses and sources with whom the mission team engaged adopted over time an increasingly cautious and circumspect approach regarding past accounts, including in some cases retracting statements made previously. Some also stated to the mission team that they no longer felt confident in their recollections of other assertions that had appeared in the media. >It was determined by the mission team that the crime scene had been altered by a bomb squad and the bodies moved, explaining the separation of the body of the girl from the rest of her family. Allegations of objects found inserted in female genital organs also could not be verified by the mission team due in large part to the limited availability and low quality of imagery. How does any of this information from the report lead you to believe that the allegations of mass rape are 'very credible'? See this interview from Pramila Patten who is the special representative that wrote this report [2] >“May I just ask, why not put the responsibility and blame the atrocities quite simply on the perpetrators and say, ‘it was Hamas who did it?’” the host demanded. >Patten replied that the mission of her visit to Israel was “only for the purpose of gathering and analyzing information,” not for attributing alleged crimes to any perpetrator. >“It is pretty clear who did it, after talking to survivors who returned – it wasn’t the Belgians who did it,” chortled the host. >“I think it’s up to your government to give access, and that was one of my first recommendations,” Patten responded. I would suggest you stop peddling these baseless allegations as these lies are being used to justify civilian massacres to this day.

What strikes me after 50 years of this little spat getting top billing in geopolitical circles because of oil is that... Change is coming. Global warming will make the region hotter and dryer. EV and alt energy (and the US oil independence with shale) will sap oil of its value and geopolitical primacy. Israel's enemies are about to learn what it is like being a world afterthought like the tigray war and innumerable other hotspots. The Palestinians are 8 million people without a functional economy, surviving on oil money. If that oil money dries up, the world will let them starve to death.

While under the watch of the UN. But apparently Israel is supposed to just do nothing about it and accept it going on for as long as Hezbollah likes. Absolutely no other country on this planet would.

Are you trying to go back to 1948 here? I mean why stop there we could say this is all stems from the assassination of Franz Ferdinand leading to the invasion of and break up of the Ottomon empire. But we have to live in the reality we have today. In this reality Hezbollah started attacking Israel after Oct 7 in support of Hamas’s attack on Israel. But for that happening Israel would not be invading southern Lebanon to try and put and end to these attacks now. There is nothing at all wrong with criticizing Israel, I am deeply annoyed with a lot they do, the right wing element and the West Bank settlers are really ruining the ability to reach a two state solution. (Palestinian leaders also share blame in not reaching this outcome too sadly.) The problem is that people so often have double standards and expectations of Israelis they would never apply to anyone else. And they definitely never seem to have similar expectations for Hezbollah or Hamas. This isn’t constructive and gets kind of antisemitic after a while (Jews are different, hence unrealistic expectations, they should just take the rocket fire and never respond). It’s a weird lack of empathizing with Israelis as also being real humans behaving as real humans anywhere would. This really doesn’t help bring about any kind of peace. reply ahdignfndj 2 hours agorootparentJust because other countries started by brutally colonizing the natives does not mean we should let Israel continue doing it.

People living in Israel are not going to up and leave. They’re not going to say “sure take my house” any more than you would.

Of the vetoed resolutions, 33 pertained to the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories or the country’s treatment of the Palestinian people. > The first time the U.S. used its veto to support Israel was in September of 1972, when it vetoed a resolution that called on Israel to cease its aggression in Lebanon. reply dragonwriter 21 hours agorootparentThere's a mechanism for bypassing the Security Council by the GA during deadlocks caused by vetoes (Emergency Special Sessions convened under Uniting for Peace—5 of the 11 convened so far have concerned the Arab/Israeli conflict, including one of the two that is currently open, which is now on its 27th year), but no combination of countries otherwise willing to act to constrain the conflict has the capacity to effectively act against both Iran and its proxies and the Israel (directly) backed by the US. reply cma 15 hours agorootparentThere is no enforcement power for outcomes of those. reply dragonwriter 4 hours agorootparentThere is the same enforcement power as there is for Security Council resolutions, the coordinated action of member states.

Watch out when something affirms your preconceptions because that's when you are most vulnerable to being manipulated. When you listen to a Westerner, especially an American journalist, explain what Hamas, Palestine, Israel, Hezbollah or Iran is doing, they are filtering it through their own biases and preconceptions and are almost certainly flat-out incorrect.

Was the French Resistance a terrorist organisation? Or the Polish Resistance? Given the brutal occupation executed by Israel in Palestine why is armed resistance, in your eyes, taboo? This is not a football match between two equal sides. This is, and always has been, asymetric warfare where one side is armed to the teeth by the west. Where is Hezbollah's air force? Or its tanks? reply rendall 11 hours agorootparentYou have it precisely inverted. Hezbollah, Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood are not \"freedom fighters\". They are a supremacist, revanchist, Islamist movement hiding behind the notion of \"occupation\", funded by the government of Iran. The French and Polish resistance movements in WWII aimed to liberate their countries from Nazi occupation and restore legitimate governments, operating with support from the Allied forces as part of a recognized war effort. Their tactics targeted military objectives, respecting international humanitarian laws. In contrast, Hezbollah and Hamas have broader ideological goals, including regional control and, for Hamas, the eradication of Israel, using tactics such as rocket attacks and civilian-targeted violence, which violate international law. Unlike WWII resistance fighters who returned to civilian life post-conflict, Hezbollah and Hamas retain military power within their political structures, acting as armed entities beyond immediate defense. Hezbollah and Hamas are internationally designated as terrorist organizations, unlike the WWII resistance movements, which had legitimate standing under international law. reply rendall 18 hours agoprevnext [6 more] [flagged] sangnoir 17 hours agoparent> UNIFIL has not done this. ...and therefore they deserve to be shot at, maimed or killed? reply rendall 16 hours agorootparent>> UNIFIL has not done this. >...and therefore they deserve to be shot at, maimed or killed?

    "originBody": "Smarter than 'Ctrl+F': Linking Directly to Web Page Content 19 Oct 2024 Historically, we could link to a certain part of the page only if that part had an ID. All we needed to do was to link to the URL and add the document fragment (ID). If we wanted to link to a certain part of the page, we needed to anchor that part to link to it. This was until we were blessed with the Text fragments! What are Text fragments? Text fragments are a powerful feature of the modern web platform that allows for precise linking to specific text within a web page without the need to add an anchor! This feature is complemented by the ::target-text CSS pseudo-element, which provides a way to style the highlighted text. Text fragments work by appending a special syntax to the end of a URL; just like we used to append the ID after the hash symbol (#). The browser interprets this part of the URL, searches for the specified text on the page, and then scrolls to and highlights that text if it supports text fragments. If the user attempts to navigate the document by pressing tab, the focus will move on to the next focusable element after the text fragment. How can we use it? Here’s the basic syntax for a text fragment URL: https://example.com/page.html#:~:text=[prefix-,]textStart[,textEnd][,-suffix] Following the hash symbol, we add this special syntax :~: also known as fragment directive then text= followed by: prefix-: A text string preceded by a hyphen specifying what text should immediately precede the linked text. This helps the browser to link to the correct text in case of multiple matches. This part is not highlighted. textStart: The beginning of the text you’re highlighting. textEnd: The ending of the text you’re highlighting. -suffix: A hyphen followed by a text string that behaves similarly to the prefix but comes after the text. Aslo helpful when multiple matches exist and doesn’t get highlighted with the linked text. For example, the following link: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Fragment/Text_fragments#:~:text=without%20relying%20on%20the%20presence%20of%20IDs This text fragment we are using is “without relying on the presence of IDs” but it’s encoded. If you follow this link, it should look like the following: We can also highlight a range of text by setting the startText and the endText. Consider the following example from the same URL: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Fragment/Text_fragments#:~:text=using%20particular,don't%20control The text fragment we are using is “using particular” followed by a comma then “don’t control”. If you follow this link, it should look like the following: We can also highlight multiple texts by using ampersands. Consider the following: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Fragment/Text_fragments#:~:text=using%20particular&text=it%20allows If you follow this link, it should look like the following: One of the interesting behaviors about text fragments, is if you’re linking to hidden content that’s discoverable through find-in-page feature (e.g. children of element with hidden attribute set to until-found or content of a closed details element), the hidden content will become visible. Let’s look at this behavior by linking to this article from Scott O’Hara’s blog. The blog contains the details element that is closed by default. If we linked to the text fragment inside the details element, it will open automatically: https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2022/09/12/details-summary.html#:~:text=Oh%20hi%20there.%20Forget%20your%20summary,%20didja Note that this behavior is only available in Google Chrome as it’s the only browser to support discoverable content. Styling highlighted fragments If the browser supports text fragments, we can change the style of the highlighted text by using the ::target-text pseudo-element ::target-text { background-color: yellow; } Note that we are only allowed to change the following properties: color background-color text-decoration and its associated properties (including text-underline-position and text-underline-offset) text-shadow stroke-color, fill-color, and stroke-width custom properties Browser support and fallback behaviour Text fragments are currently supported in all the browsers. The pseudo-element ::target-text is not yet supported is Safari but it’s now available in the Technology Preview version. If this feature is not supported in the browser, it will degrade gracefully and the page will load without highlighting or scrolling to the text. The default style for the highlight is different based on the browser. The color of the highlight is different across the different browsers. The highlighted area is bigger in Safari spanning the whole line-height. In Firefox and Chrome, only the text is highlighted and the spaces between the lines are empty. We can detect if the feature is supported or not using document.fragmentDirective. It will return an empty FragmentDirective object, if supported or will return undefined if it’s not. Closing thoughts My first encounter with text fragments was through links generated by Google Search results. Initially, I assumed it was a Chrome-specific feature and not part of a broader web standard. However, I soon realized that this functionality was actually built upon the open web, available to any browser that chooses to implement it. I’d love to see this feature used more broadly, particularly by responsible generative AI systems. Imagine AI that can provide direct, context-sensitive links to the exact content you’re interested in, using text fragments for precise references. This would not only increase transparency but also improve the user experience when navigating AI-generated content. Looking ahead, it would be fantastic if text fragments were more accessible to all users, not just those with technical knowledge. What if browsers offered built-in features that allowed non-technical users to highlight text and generate links to specific paragraphs with ease? This could be through a native browser feature or even a simple browser extension—either way, it would make deep linking a breeze for everyone. Finally, I’d like to express my sincere thanks to Hannah Olukoye and Jens Oliver Meiert for the time they’ve taken to share their invaluable feedback and corrections. Update, 20th Oct, 2024 It turns out that the ability to generate a link to a specific piece of text is already built into Chromium-based browsers, as Hostam Sultan clarified on X (formerly Twitter). If you’re using Chrome, simply highlight some text, right-click, and you’ll find the “Copy link to highlight” option in the context menu.

If it was simply a matter of being used in the way outlined in the article, when someone creates a a link that references a particular piece of text, then fine, someone has deliberated intended the link to behave like that. And then we have the lovely folk at Google search... who think it's fun to drag my attention off to a random part of a page that isn't where I want to be, forcing me to right-click, remove annotation and scroll back up to the top of the page.

Bonus: you can use regular expressions. It pains me to see the web having strayed so far from its focus on interlinking. It's easy to make a parallel when on one side device makers have taken control back by removing access to files and putting applications first (this is the only model on mobile), to the point that those makers have enormous control over apps' existence, and the web where applications are now the only way to access content, to the point that content may or may not available if the right API exists. reply c-linkage 4 hours agoparentThe world wide web has moved beyond documents to apps.

The easiest thing to do would be to check for this specially-crafted fragment in the URL and store it. I think though that this is a pretty niche feature though, so it's unlikely to be a big source of data. In my experience, the median sophistication web user has discovered that the browser's Back button exists and can Open in New Tab. Bookmarks, zoom, ctrl-F are all too confusing.

While the reason of text fragments it to allow for similar linking where there isn't an element with an id, most pages with non-changing text tend also to have non-changing layout and element ids. If you generate links that include and depend on #:~:text= to make sense, accept that it will confuse users whose browsers do not support it. They will be linked to the top of the document and no text will be highlighted.

Firefox developers can't do anything else to improve the support. There's no reason to suspect this feature is not implemented in a reliable way. The onus is now on users that use Firefox. You're right that many Firefox users don't run the newest version, and you can't in general rely on a Firefox user having a browser new enough to support this feature.

As I said in my earlier reply, that is not what “reliable” is referring to in the context of browser support. “Reliable” means “We can rely upon our users having it available in their browser”. This feature does not have reliable support and will not have reliable support until common browser support matrices – of which Firefox ESR is a part – includes support.

They should be documented somewhere. reply pythonlover2153 5 hours agorootparentprevCTRL+L works for that too on Chromium / Firefox. reply Sophira 5 hours agorootparentNot if you choose to have separate URL and search bars. In that case, Ctrl-L goes to the URL bar, and Ctrl-K goes to the search bar. reply DrammBA 4 hours agorootparentHonest question, what's the use case for separate url and search bars? reply arusahni 4 hours agorootparentI keep them separate for two reasons: one privacy, and another preference: 1. If I'm interacting with the URL/address input, I'm either entering a full URL, or searching through my local history to jump to a previously-visited page (or, in Firefox, a tab I may have open on another device). I don't want that shipped off to my search provider for autocomplete suggestions. 2. If I'm interacting with the search input, I want autocomplete suggestions. Additionally, because it retains the value of the last term I searched for, I can use it as a shortcut to jump back to the results if I no longer have the tab handy. reply antiframe 4 hours agorootparentprevIt prevents you from leaking data in cases where you like live search suggestions (like completions from your search engine based on partial text entered) but didn't want your search engine recording all the URLs you visit outside of search. reply n_plus_1_acc 4 hours agorootparentprevAnd F6 is one of them, but I can't remember which one. reply taco_emoji 4 hours agoparentprevSometimes it's fine if a page is lazy-loading content, in which the browser's CTRL+F does not work because the text isn't all in the DOM at that moment. reply xp84 5 hours agoparentprevMaybe this is a hot take then, but I think most sites I've seen that do this, are surprisingly good at doing their One Job correctly such that I haven't resented it the way I resent things like overridden context menus, links that are not really links, etc. e.g. GitHub. If I'm on a source file and I hit Ctrl-F, yes, in fact I do want to search the source code and not GitHub's UI -- and their search bar for that purpose is delightfully simple and not distractingly different than the normal search I expected to see when I hit that key. What would make me rage throw my computer through a window would be if I hit Ctrl-F and it loaded a full-screen modal which showed a search results page of result snippets or something. So I'm impressed with the restraint shown by the front-end developers (or their \"UX designer\" taskmasters) in this case. reply xp84 5 hours agoprev [–] This also works perfectly in Microsoft Edge and has for a long time.

    "originBody": "Quit Social Media September 21, 2016 Anti-Social Grumblings I recently gave a deliberatively provocative TEDx talk titled “quit social media” (see the video above). The theme of the event was “visions of the future.” I said my vision of the future was one in which many fewer people use social media. Earlier this week, Andrew Sullivan published a long essay in New York Magazine that comes at this conclusion from a new angle. Sullivan, as you might remember, founded the sharp and frenetic political blog, The Daily Dish (ultimately shortened to: The Dish). The blog was a success but its demands were brutal. For a decade and a half, I’d been a web obsessive, publishing blog posts multiple times a day, seven days a week…My brain had never been so occupied so insistently by so many different subjects and in so public a way for so long. In recent years, his health began to fail. “Did you really survive HIV to die of the web?”, his doctor asked. Finally, in the winter of 2015, he quit, explaining: “I decided, after 15 years, to live in reality.” This might sound like an occupational hazard of a niche new media job, but a core argument of Sullivan’s essay is that these same demands have gone mainstream: And as the years went by, I realized I was no longer alone. Facebook soon gave everyone the equivalent of their own blog and their own audience. More and more people got a smartphone — connecting them instantly to a deluge of febrile content, forcing them to cull and absorb and assimilate the online torrent as relentlessly as I had once. Twitter emerged as a form of instant blogging of microthoughts. Users were as addicted to the feedback as I had long been — and even more prolific. As he summarizes: “the once-unimaginable pace of the professional blogger was now the default for everyone.” As I noted in my talk, one of the most common rationales for social media use is that it’s harmless — why miss out on the interesting connection or funny ephemera it might occasionally bring your way? Sullivan’s essay is a 6000 word refutation of this belief. Social media is not harmless. It can make your life near unlivable. Sullivan attempts to end with a note of optimism, saying “we are only beginning to get our minds around the costs,” before adding a more resigned coda: “if we are even prepared to accept that there are costs.” I agree that we’re not yet ready to fully face this reality, and cheeky TED talks by curmudgeonly young professors like me probably won’t move the needle. But when heavyweights like Sullivan join the conversation, I can begin to feel a cautious optimism grow. On Deep Breaks Nassim Taleb’s (Implied) Argument Against Social Media",

Pretty dystopian. The Onion did a sketch illustrating the problem a few years ago: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFpK_r-jEXg By this definition, HN is halfway to being social media. There are metrics, but they aren't displayed publicly. reply jolmg 1 hour agorootparentI never thought that votes, etc. would be that important to what defines social media and would have included forums in it. But if I think of social media as \"that thing that's addicting\", then yeah, the feedback metrics are what make it addicting. Otherwise, I would think of \"social media\" as places where visitors get the opportunity to be equal participants. Anyone can post, anyone can comment in places like these (including forums), but in a blog only one can post and the rest comment. reply 0xDEAFBEAD 16 minutes agorootparentIMO, the popularity metrics are the cause of the Lord of the Flies dynamics you so often see on Reddit, X, etc. Popularity metrics facilitate popularity contests. And popularity metrics facilitate mob rule. Lone voices of dissent get steamrolled. Reddit is especially bad, IMO. It's almost like it was designed as a confirmation bias engine. The frustrating part is that voting systems also solve a genuine quality-filtering problem. HN does a good job of balancing the costs and benefits, but I suspect there are other viable approaches. reply Apocryphon 2 hours agorootparentprevHN is simply pre-Web 2.0 social media, a la Slashdot, Metafilter, the WELL, kuro5hin, etc. reply 0xDEAFBEAD 23 minutes agorootparentIIRC, the term \"social media\" came about with Facebook/Twitter/Youtube. Before that, we had forums/blogs/wikis. That was the sweet spot IMO. The days before things were constantly \"going viral\". Sometimes memetic speedbumps are a good thing. reply Apocryphon 10 minutes agorootparentI agree with that, however I would consider large forums (especially those that arose after the rise of the Web- so not BBS- and those that were more than simply vBulletin/phpBB message boards) to be basically photo-social media, even if they predate the term and concept. I think we need more forums outside of mega-communities like Reddit or even HN, but at least there are many that are still alive: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41783682 Also, things were going viral even before the mid00s when the concept consolidated.

Social media isn’t real; it’s a type of video game for adults. The unreality fosters the growth of so many other things which are even less concerned with truth: fake news, engagement bait, daily outrages, chasing followers in a vain attempt to “build a personal brand.” The vacuousness of influencer culture has only accelerated these trends since Newport wrote this post. In some sense, some of us already live online essentially through these social networks. Almost always this means some level of addiction, with concomitant real life consequences. Is it really worth it? reply gilbetron 6 hours agoparentProblem is that it is becoming a new reality. You can tune out, but you can't turn it off, and it (and society) will continue without it. And I say this as someone who thinks we should largely turn it off. Society will adapt, which means society is becoming something different. reply mattgreenrocks 6 hours agorootparentI don’t buy it. We’re probably past peak social media at this point. And the outer reality will always have a higher status than any of the inner ones. reply gilbetron 5 hours agorootparentWe might be past peak \"bulk\" social media, where people would be public, more or less, with their posts/videos. Now everything is closing and many people have \"group chats\" as they realize that free-for-all chatting/posting doesn't work. reply gspencley 3 hours agorootparentIn other words, people are returning to how online communication worked before Facebook. Offline, people have always tended to come together around common interests and values. My wife and I, for example, are part time performing magicians and we're a member of a local magic group that meets IRL. Prior to what we have come to call \"social media\", existed forums. Forums were this wonderful utopian paradise of yesteryear where people engaged in long form discussions, often heated but mostly civil, about special interests that they cared about. The term \"social media\" didn't start to catch on until the news feed was a thing. That was the \"contribution\" of both Facebook and Twatter and it was a big PART of what changed everything. The other factor was the so-called \"mobile revolution.\" Forums are great when you're at a keyboard. They start to lose their appeal when you are engaging using a small touch screen. What you are describing sounds like people returning to the state of the world as it existed before social media. Where people come together around common interests and values instead of using the news feed where you get fire-hozed with random shit that \"the algorithm\" thinks might trigger you into engaging with it. reply mrweasel 14 minutes agorootparent> people are returning to how online communication worked before Facebook. Except now it's all on Facebook and it's incredibly hard to leave Facebook, because all communications with any type of group happens on Facebook. I have friends who can't leave Facebook, because their kids soccer team holds them hostage. Leave Facebook and we'll kill your child's social life. I can't even join the parents group for my child's school, almost no one else will do it, because it takes time, so they are lacking parents, but it is coordinated on Facebook. I used to organise playtime for toddlers once a week, no one else wanted to do, but the kids loved it. Everyone was used to everything being organised via Facebook, where I don't have an account. So the communication was done by someone else in the umbrella organisation for all local sports, gymnastics, e-sport etc. More than once I showed up to get everything ready only to learn that the space was booked for something else that day, being cleaned or renovated. Everyone else had been informed, expect me, the guy who was suppose to be in charge of the damn thing, because the organisation had no real website or mailing list to speak of and just expected everyone to be on Facebook. Everything is on f-ing Facebook, Sports, clubs, hobbies, reselling, announcements of everything local, and only on Facebook. The only exception is professional meetups, which Linkedin will happily inform you about two weeks after the meetup, stupid, brain dead, algorithmically power \"news\" feed. I want mailing-lists and Usenet, but everyone else want a mobile app and apparently Facebook. reply hiatus 5 hours agorootparentprevPrivate spaces where small groups collect may be social media by its definition, but it feels starkly different from something like posting on a facebook wall or making a public linkedin post where the audience largely consists of strangers. reply TheCapeGreek 3 hours agorootparent>Private spaces where small groups collect may be social media by its definition Kind of, depending on the platform, if you squint your eyes at it? I suppose it doesn't matter what it's actually called. I call it community in general. Communities in this sense are the middle ground between your direct personal network (which is also the deepest form of relation), and social media as the widest (the shallowest form of relation) form of reach. reply codyvoda 5 hours agorootparentprevI think this is the one benefit of recent \"AI\" advancements, it accelerates the downfall with even cheaper garbage. death to the internet, long live the internet reply interludead 51 minutes agorootparentprevHoping for reevaluation reply rchaud 4 hours agorootparentprevYou don't have to buy it.

BUT. I'm think the term \"social media\" is too broad to be useful in this kind of critique. This conversation we're having is a bit meta, but it's also \"real\", to me. We both considered Cal Newport's stance, Matt Green shared some thoughts about it, and Chris Weekly responded to it. Those are real people interacting in a potentially useful way. Being \"addicted\" to ideas and conversations is not necessarily unhealthy. /$.02 reply mattgreenrocks 2 hours agorootparentThe danger of the point I'm making is that the less-realness that I'm arguing justifies poor behavior online. It does not. Many posters become seduced by the less-realness of online contact that they disconnect their own notions of what decent behavior is. > Those are real people interacting in a potentially useful way. Being \"addicted\" to ideas and conversations is not necessarily unhealthy. Agree! Addiction is compulsive use and the need to continually engage. My HN use is subject to a max of 15m a day with a browser extension that enforces it. I can at least try to curb it from blossoming into something more disruptive. reply ToucanLoucan 2 hours agorootparentprevI think there's a lot of value, both social and emotional, to social media. That doesn't change the fact that social media products as they exist are not only not creating that value, they are outwardly, openly hostile to it. HN being a notable exception and why I spend a lot of time here. The discussions are thoughtful and the topics are (usually) at least somewhat relevant to my career and life. That said, the more mainstream social medias are not relevant to me, they are not stimulating or thoughtful, and they are not valuable. I have Instagram and TikTok installed because both of my partners send me things from them that made them think of me, and in this way, and only this way, they are relevant and nurturing to my existence. That said, I never engage with them outside of that context, because it's just an endless barrage of vacuous bullshit, as are the rest, with TikTok personally, I think, being the largest firehose of stupid, worthless, intellectually bankrupt, pointless shit ever constructed by mankind. Holy fuck. Like they're all bad, but TikTok... it's just the modern social media apparatus refined and polished to a mirror shine. Takes absolutely no effort to engage with, and if you're sufficiently numb to outside stimulus, you will scroll it for literal hours. If social media is a drug, TikTok is black-tar heroin. reply goosejuice 3 hours agoparentprevUnfortunately, it can be worth it. Having a social media audience can be very valuable to entrepreneurs. Someone who lives online with a personal brand can replace tens of thousands of dollars in ad spend with a single tweet. As someone who hasn't had a social media presence for most of my adult life, and happy about that, I'm now seeing the downsides. I don't have Ivy League connections like some of my peers. Social media may be the only way I could build a network like the one they cultivated in university. reply mattgreenrocks 2 hours agorootparentI feel this. However I also remind myself that social media connections are never as strong as those we've made in real life, and that there have been former influencers who've hung up their hat and lamented that their residual social connections regress to something close to a mean a lot quicker than they would've liked. Ultimately, the act of winning at social media seems a bit too subordinate to me. reply gspencley 4 hours agoparentprev> engagement bait, daily outrages, I have a pet theory as to why social media causes many people to feel like it's draining them, and why I avoid news on social media like the plague ... I also tend to mute or silence people that share political content (regardless of partisan affiliation). Social media, unless you are trying to build a business, is ultimately offering the service of entertainment. Even if you use Twitter or Facebook as your news aggregator, unless you're engaged in some kind of productive and time-scoped research project, you're doing this on your leisure time. That means that you just got done work, or you're on a break, or you finally got the kids to sleep or finished all of your household chores and you're now in a position where you can \"enjoy\" a bit of leisure time. Which means that you approach social media PRE-drained. You're already tired and you're looking for cute cat memes when what should happen ... you get hit with a rage-bait headline, or one of those douche bags that vote differently from you just posted an opinion about a controversial topic that you have very strong feelings about. We (on HN) all know that the algorithm is trying to promote what gets engagement, and anything that provokes a strong emotional reaction is likely to trigger engagement. My thesis is that people turn to social media when they are already in an emotional state that is incredibly inappropriate for engaging with \"serious\" topics on a rational level. So everyone just gets angrier and angrier at each other and you leave social media feeling even more exhausted than you were before you signed on looking for entertainment to spend your precious leisure time with. And then you realize that you just wasted that short precious time that you needed to use for relaxation ... and if you don't do anything to rectify it then your stress levels just gradually creep up, your sleep starts to suffer, you might start to compensate with stress eating or consuming more alcohol or cannabis than is healthy and it just spirals. reply cryptopian 2 hours agorootparentEven without considering all of the contentious topics, the infinite scroll of the home feed trains people to triage posts faster and faster, because there's always more content, and who knows what you've missed? Because the topics are flattened, you're context-switching on a second by second basis, and your mind is alert to something awful you might be about to see - cute cat, war crimes, Dan's birthday celebration, medical fundraiser, political campaign, sponsored ad... I'm really starting to see the value of legitimate boredom reply interludead 53 minutes agoparentprevA game where the \"points\" are likes, followers and engagement reply nonameiguess 3 hours agoparentprevI agree with this, but it's worth noting the quote is from a journalist/blogger who was not talking about social media. He was talking about keeping up with a 24 hour news cycle by any means. The problem here isn't specific to social media. It's with overwhelming information flow, the vast majority of which is not actionable to the person consuming it. People come down with a type of awareness FOMO such that they feel like they need to know all things as they happen, even though the information is incomplete, often wrong, misleading, and doesn't impact their everyday real lives in any way. This is what Andrew Sullivan was getting at. People should worry themselves with information that actually concerns and impacts their real lives. All else is entertainment. If it stops being entertaining and starts being anxiety-inducing, stop consuming it. reply motohagiography 3 hours agoprevI was one of those security/privacy people in the 00's who declined to join facebook or do any of the social media stuff. Feels like it was the right call. Meta was the best possible company name for the social media machine, because when you turn it all off, you really do become less meta. I'd suspect it's a bit like being a vegan, where it's a self-imposed constrant that makes you aloof from others and makes them treat you like an exception. It reduces some of the invites you get, and you just aren't up on the news about your friend groups as a result. We imagine it signals some kind of purity or difference, as though to say we're not like those regular IT people, maybe there's an air of mystery about what we might know, but it's just kind of fussy and it creates a polarizing filter where people really have to like you a lot to put up with the conditions you put on hanging out. I still see the internet as a machine I operate for money and entertainment, and not the substrate of my identity or reality. This is also a fairly masculine coded view, as it dismisses the public sphere of gossip and narratives as separate from a Real made of consequences and competence, where the internet is not a dominion of truth the way real friendships are. It sounds marginal in the current discourse, but really there are still operators around who know ways out of this hallucination a lot of people were born into and can't see the edges of. It's not a mystery, you just turn the phone off for a bit and then live and relate according to the results. reply mrweasel 8 minutes agoparentIt's probably easier on your social life to be a vegan, compared to not being on Facebook. reply theboogieman 1 hour agoparentprevI’ve been saying for a while that I expect the next big “veganeque” movement to be some kind of modern luddites. Maybe not as detached from modern society as the Amish, but a more 90s-like tech scene. No cell phone on them at all times (but maybe some equivalent to a car phone/pay phone), placing the restriction to consciously “log on” to the internet, no (at least ad-based) social media, and maybe keep their online persona to appearances on mostly decentralized forums. Personally, I know it would benefit me to detach from the one social media platform I have left and am fully addicted to (YouTube), but it’s hard when that is the platform that videos are stored on (though if I really cared, I would only subscribe to channels via RSS and watch them or individually search for things I wish to see instead of infinitely scrolling.) It’s also hard to keep up with group activities or the best classifieds listings or local music/arts events without Facebook. I don’t believe that there will ever be a true competitor for services that can operate at scale like Facebook and YouTube (especially the latter), but I expect these modern luddites to accept this and reject those platforms even if it is socially ostracizing (much like veganism). To fill the void, they’ll create platforms and devices for them specifically. I imagine the goal of the platforms will be to avoid unnecessary bloat and keep hosting/maintenance costs low, which seems relatively easy if sucking every last second of retention out the user is not financially incentivized like it is in ad-based platforms. I expect the hardware to prioritize cost-efficiency, repairability, and a minimal feature set that doesn’t require frequent upgrades. Then I imagine for a time, the movement will become trendy and people will begin flooding those platforms. The challenge then becomes to avoid capitalizing on the influx and keep the initial morals in mind and not start showing ads/trying to increase retention time. I think those projects may need to be decentralized and/or established as nonprofits with stated non-retractable tenets from their creation (“We shall never serve advertisements”, “We shall prioritize the distribution of useful information above all else”, etc.) It’s a utopian view of the future, but I think it is possible. I think we’ll hit a day when we realize that spending 10+ hours a day staring at glowing rectangles is not bringing us closer to real fulfillment. I expect that as long as capitalism is the dominant economic force, businesses will always embrace the newest technology to avoid a massive gap in their output when compared to competitors, and the tech companies will always be pushing new addictive technology as long as it isn’t globally regulated, but after work, the people will wake up to the fact that they at least have a choice on whether or not they spend the rest of their leisure time staring at glowing rectangles. Yet I still haven’t woken up myself. reply freediver 21 hours agoprevI would rephrase it to “quit ad-based social media”. The incentives are perverse, there is an inherent conflict of interest in the business model and there is an intermediary between the user and information/community they want to participate in. This leads to most problems we see in legacy, ad-based, social media. Most successful social circles are ones where there is a barrier to entry. In life we do not let everyone into the friend circle. Having a barrier to entry model may work well for an online community, although this remains to be seen. Were there any successful experiments with paid social media? reply ryandv 19 hours agoparentI would rephrase it further to \"quit ad-based media.\" The problems and conflicts of interest introduced by an ad-based revenue model were discussed long before the advent of the modern Web and social media; the relationship between the advertisement industry and mass media (television, radio) was already discussed in depth in the late 20th century [0]: The advertisers' choices influence media prosperity and survival. The ad-based media receive an advertising subsidy that gives them a price-marketing-quality edge, which allows them to encroach on and further weaken their ad-free (or ad-disadvantaged) rivals. Advertisers will want, more generally, to avoid programs with serious complexities and disturbing controversies that interfere with the \"buying mood.\" They seek programs that will lightly entertain and thus fit in with the spirit of the primary purpose of program purchases - the dissemination of a selling message. [0] https://archive.org/details/manfacturingconsentnahomchomsky/... reply tropdrop 14 hours agorootparentInterestingly this changed somewhat with the clickbait-based model – now, I would disagree that advertisers \"want, more generally, to avoid programs with serious complexities and disturbing controversies.\" I think this does describe legacy advertisers (and TikTok, for different reasons) – we might remember Tumblr's hyper-specific LGBTQ-friendly (often NSFW) communities being completely liquidated in the transfer of Tumblr to Verizon, arguably killing Tumblr on that date. Verizon's handling of Tumblr validates Chomsky. But ad-fueled journalism seems to operate from exactly the opposite principle, so long as the controversies that drive engagement do not threaten the sensibility of specific large funders. I've seen a few times in recent memory where an article from the New York Times aired something quite sensational, only to quietly update later that what was initially reported didn't quite occur as depicted. But by that point it is too late, and profit was made. The overall point still stands – that ad-based always results in a conflict of interest. reply ryandv 12 hours agorootparentAs possible counterpoint consider the departure of several advertisers from X following the Musk acquisition, whose controversial online antics and positions (irrespective of one's potential value judgments of them) were deemed bad for business and a damper on the \"buying mood.\" In general though it is true that ragebait and sensationalism do tend to drive \"engagement\" and thus ad revenue (often to the detriment of society). reply michaelt 8 hours agorootparentWell, this is the kind of argument you can make in both directions. A site is full of ragebait, hot takes and pictures of boobs? The ad economy has pushed them towards things that get a lot of engagement. Clicks are money! A site is devoid of ragebait, hot takes and pictures of boobs? The ad economy forces everything to be brand-safe and censored. reply ryandv 7 hours agorootparentSure. Chomsky et al continue in the cited chapter, In addition to discrimination against unfriendly media institutions, advertisers also choose selectively among programs on the basis of their own principles. With rare exceptions these are culturally and politically conservative. There are two options; either Chomsky et al are incorrect in their assertion, or they are correct. If they are incorrect, then non-conservatives are of equal power and culpability in discriminating for or against which content they will sponsor. This would seem to be your position, and points to a state of affairs in which content and communities exist in disjoint bubbles which thrive off of entirely separate streams of ad revenue, up to the principles of the advertisers that choose to direct funding at particular media institutions. Otherwise, if they are correct, then your assertion that this argument can be made \"in both directions\" is shown to be false by supposition, and the ad economy pushes users towards conservative content - in which case, one had best boycott and abstain from ad-driven media and social media unless they want to finance conservative thought. reply lynx23 11 hours agorootparentprevStill, his \"Go f--- yourself\" reply was one of the best things ever since sliced bread.

One of the clubs I know of requires you to go on three hikes before they'll make you a member and give you access to their website.

Their activities revolved around visiting a different church every Sunday. And also doing activities on weekends that involved a lot of car travel and significant admission fees, if only viewing a film at the mall cinema. I had a real commitment to my home parish at the time. I was involved in ministries weekly, where I could not simply flit about anywhere I wanted. Sure, as a group we could meet many strangers on this itinerary, but I risked severing all ties with my spiritual home! The activities were sometimes active and sometimes passive, such as hiking, dancing, or going to a festival or something. And I quickly gave up on everything, because it seemed like the group was not really oriented to pairing people off, but more of a self-sustaining club where people gained \"volunteer responsibilities\" and were thus pressured into staying in the \"singles group\" no matter what their relationship status. Also, having no vehicle of my own, I'd either opt out of traveling, or I'd hit someone up to carpool, and that wasn't always copacetic. I also found, on dating websites, this mentality that single Catholics would be jet-setters, traveling all over the world on pilgrimage. That they would generate a steady stream of photographs and social media posts from their adventures. That they would have marvelous, expensive hobbies and be so active in volunteerism. For crying out loud! I wondered how these people would ever have space in their lives for a significant other! All I wanted to do was hang around home, go for walks, prepare a nice meal at home once in a while. But the dating sites seemed geared exclusively for high-maintenance and upper-middle-class go-getters. Again, I felt like it was a clique of \"professional singles\" who didn't really expect to pair off and get married. reply aspenmayer 9 hours agorootparentWell, Paul did say (paraphrasing), maybe it would be better if you did not marry... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Epistle_to_the_Corinthia... Perhaps these Catholics are onto something. There's nothing wrong per se with individuals in a singles group or the group itself proper having no expectations of dating or marriage. It's probably not the norm, but I think it's actually somewhat better that way, especially for those who don't intend to date/marry. Community and fellowship in a church environment should not be withdrawn from those who choose to remain single or celibate. I think that historically many church groups have silently discouraged being single by ostracism or judgement, which is definitely not what Jesus would do, in my opinion. I'm sure there is someone for you out there. All relationships are valid. Modern society has such intense focus on external sources of validation, such as a partner or spouse, but good friends are always in short supply. As the proverb says, a friend can be closer than a brother. reply ErikAugust 20 hours agoparentprevIt’s not a coincidence that Facebook started out as a college-only social network.

Nothing about the \"new\" social media platforms makes them at all attractive for me to take a second look and join back up. If anything, things are worse. It's even more \"algorithmic\" and engagement-focused, continuing to promote outrage culture. Platforms like TikTok have turned addictive endless scrolling into a science.

Once every 6 months or so I'll sign into Facebook for some specific purpose (like looking up someone's contact information when it's for some reason not stored in any of my usual places). Out of curiosity I'll scroll down the feed, and it's just kinda crap. Stuff from people I don't actually follow, stuff from people I do follow but is kinda boring, and interestingly the feed is dominated by the same 15 or so people (even though I'd amassed a little over 1k \"friends\" before I quit). I limit myself to no more than five minutes, and I don't post, comment, or even like anything. The last time I signed into Instagram (probably two or three years ago), the experience was awful. I remember when it was just a reverse-chronological feed of the people I follow (and only the people I follow). But now (well, 2-3 years ago) the majority of items in my feed are either ads or promoted/reshared posts from people I don't follow at all. Stuff from people I follow is maybe one out of every five or six items. And it's all out of order, so I'd see something that someone posted a week ago, followed by, 20 items later, something that they posted a couple days ago.

I ditched Twitter, came back to it briefly, then ditched it again when it was purchased because I found my mental health growing increasingly fragile with the constant outrage, the need to keep track of who the main character of the day was or risk the ire of your circle, and the increasing filtering of my timeline. I quit Facebook, other than keeping an account for announcing major life events to the older people who were still on it, because I was frustrated that I never received any posts from family or close friends in the heavily filtered timeline, I kept receiving time-sensitive posts (say about a hurricane event) for weeks after the post was no longer relevant, and Meta's increasingly metastasized privacy practices. I joined Mastodon and found a calm, down to earth, almost boring place.

How exactly does knowing unsubstantiated details about an event immediately male one’s life better? reply kelnos 18 hours agorootparentThis is what I always wonder. Any time I see a news story (even on MSM) marked as \"BREAKING\" or \"EXCLUSIVE\", I'm like... who cares? That just means you either a) rushed to publish without making sure you got your details right, or b) you paid someone to not shop their story around to other outlets (which is gross). My life would not have been impacted in the least knowing about the Trump assassination attempt a few hours later (or even the next day), rather than minutes after it happened. The MSM has enough problems these days with journalistic integrity and practices. I don't think the teeming mobs on Twitter are an improvement, though. reply krapp 18 hours agorootparentprevIt isn't important. The vast majority of \"journalism\" is as worthless as the vast majority of \"discourse\" around it. If it doesn't affect you personally, you can likely safely ignore it and if it does affect you personally, you probably won't need the news to tell you about it. \"Breaking news\" used to be relevant in that it was news that \"broke into\" existing programming. It didn't necessarily make people's lives better but at least it tended to cover matters of high national interest like Presidential assassinations or disasters or wars. But now that everything is breaking news all the time everywhere, the term no longer means anything other than being a synonym for \"current news,\" which isn't even really impressive anymore. reply swatcoder 20 hours agorootparentprevUnless it's regarding immediate local emergency that you might need to respond to, breaking news has zero value besides a brain tickle and something to talk about.

It can help you to view the subsequent news bulletins with a critical eye and interest and it can give you a richer depth of understanding than you would otherwise get. If it’s an event that you’re not particularly interested in, then there’s not much value in getting details in advance. Another thing, it’s not just hours. Sometimes it’s months (or in rare cases years) before a recurring topic on social media finally makes it to the news, because it’s controversial/narrative-defying, so it takes them a long time to work out how to talk about it. I don’t want to mention specific examples because it would be distracting, but there are a few topics I see mentioned daily/weekly on the news today that were pretty much absent a few years ago, yet were heavily discussed on Twitter at the time, and I am very glad I was aware of them. reply throw_pm23 21 hours agorootparentprevor indeed, not at all? :) reply whoitwas 11 hours agorootparentprevAt what cost?

There’s also something about it being video which makes it feel harmful but in a different way than a text based platform.

Unfortunately, a lot of magazines and newspapers are also really bad now also. The Wall Street Journal has fallen off a cliff, turning into something between Cosmopolitan and Business Insider, and I am cancelling my subscription this year. The Economist has done a good job keeping up the quality level.

    "originBody": "Software 161 This article is more than 1 year old Boeing 787s must be turned off and on every 51 days to prevent 'misleading data' being shown to pilots 161 US air safety bods call it 'potentially catastrophic' if reboot directive not implemented Gareth Corfield Thu 2 Apr 2020 // 14:45 UTC The US Federal Aviation Administration has ordered Boeing 787 operators to switch their aircraft off and on every 51 days to prevent what it called \"several potentially catastrophic failure scenarios\" – including the crashing of onboard network switches. The airworthiness directive, due to be enforced from later this month, orders airlines to power-cycle their B787s before the aircraft reaches the specified days of continuous power-on operation. The power cycling is needed to prevent stale data from populating the aircraft's systems, a problem that has occurred on different 787 systems in the past. According to the directive itself, if the aircraft is powered on for more than 51 days this can lead to \"display of misleading data\" to the pilots, with that data including airspeed, attitude, altitude and engine operating indications. On top of all that, the stall warning horn and overspeed horn also stop working. This alarming-sounding situation comes about because, for reasons the directive did not go into, the 787's common core system (CCS) stops filtering out stale data from key flight control displays. That stale data-monitoring function going down in turn \"could lead to undetected or unannunciated loss of common data network (CDN) message age validation, combined with a CDN switch failure\". Boeing 787 software bug can shut down planes' generators IN FLIGHT READ MORE Solving the problem is simple: power the aircraft down completely before reaching 51 days. It is usual for commercial airliners to spend weeks or more continuously powered on as crews change at airports, or ground power is plugged in overnight while cleaners and maintainers do their thing. The CDN is a Boeing avionics term for the 787's internal Ethernet-based network. It is built to a slightly more stringent aviation-specific standard than common-or-garden Ethernet, that standard being called ARINC 664. More about ARINC 664 can be read here. Airline pilots were sanguine about the implications of the failures when El Reg asked a handful about the directive. One told us: \"Loss of airspeed data combined with engine instrument malfunctions isn't unheard of,\" adding that there wasn't really enough information in the doc to decide whether or not the described failure would be truly catastrophic. Besides, he said, the backup speed and attitude instruments are – for obvious reasons – completely separate from the main displays. Another mused that loss of engine indications would make it harder to adopt the fallback drill of setting a known pitch and engine power (see sidenote) setting that guarantees safe straight-and-level flight while the pilots consult checklists and manuals to find a fix. Sidenote Pitch and power is a simple concept. If you have the throttles, say, three-quarters open and the nose of the aeroplane is pointing a few degrees above the horizon, chances are you're probably flying straight and level at a safe speed. Training manuals normally contain a number of precise pitch and power settings (they vary between aeroplane types) so if display systems start failing, pilots can fall back to these with confidence. A third commented, tongue firmly in cheek: \"Anything like that with the aircraft is unhealthy!\" A previous software bug forced airlines to power down their 787s every 248 days for fear electrical generators could shut down in flight. Airbus suffers from similar issues with its A350, with a relatively recent but since-patched bug forcing power cycles every 149 hours. Persistent or unfiltered stale data is a known 787 problem. In 2014 a Japan Airlines 787 caught fire because of the (entirely separate, and since fixed) lithium-ion battery problem. Investigators realised the black boxes had been recording false information, hampering their task, because they were falsely accepting stale old data as up-to-the-second real inputs. More seriously, another 787 stale data problem in years gone by saw superseded backup flight plans persisting in standby navigation computers, and activating occasionally. Activation caused the autopilot to wrongly decide it was halfway through flying a previous journey – and manoeuvre to regain the \"correct\" flight path. Another symptom was for the flight management system to simply go blank and freeze, triggered by selection of a standard arrival path (STAR) with exactly 14 waypoints – such as the BIMPA 4U approach to Poland's rather busy Warsaw Airport. The Polish air safety regulator published this mildly alarming finding in 2016 [2-page PDF, in Polish]. This was fixed through a software update, as the US Federal Aviation Administration reiterated last year. In addition, Warsaw's BIMPA 4U approach has since been superseded. The Register asked Boeing to comment. ® Editor's note: An earlier version of this article mentioned the Boeing 787 CCS uses a Wind River VxWorks real-time OS product at its heart. While this is true, Wind River has been in touch to remind us \"the CCS is made up of 80 to 100 applications,\" as well as VxWorks, and said the bug described in this article is not the fault of its operating system. \"The functions of VxWorks have nothing to do with the data issue you are highlighting in the 787,\" a spokesperson added.

That said, a household smoke detector runs on next to no power. Obviously not the same device but surely it can operate on the same principle. reply mrguyorama 4 hours agorootparentprev>It always surprised me that there aren’t small, local lithium batteries to provide backup power for critical components like the smoke detectors There is, well, only lithium on the 787. If all power generation is dead, then the most critical flight instruments and gauges get about 20-30 minutes of power from the plane's batteries, things like your backup old fashioned gauges, the engine computers, and maybe some basic flight computer on newer planes. The RAT is intended to keep flight surfaces operational when everything else is utterly fucked, so it usually produces the same kind of energy as whatever the primary flight control system uses, which until recently was hydraulic power. On civilian airliners they generate tens of kilowatts. Airliners do not want to carry around an EV sized battery for the extremely rare occasions when you lose all systems, because that's a waste of gas. The RAT provides the same functionality for lower weight. When the RAT is deployed, you do not care much whether a smoke detector is powered, you are already vectoring towards an attempted landing. reply fphhotchips 14 hours agorootparentprevI feel like it's not the RAT you'll notice from inside the plane, it will be the silence from the engines. That combined with at least a momentary flicker of the lighting (I'm not sure if a RAT on a 787 will run cabin lighting but I doubt it), and you'll know. reply rolandog 19 hours agorootparentprevUsername does not check out. Jokes aside...

I just want to understand why we would hear the RAT when there wasn’t an emergency overhead. I supposed planes regularly test them? reply rogerrogerr 14 hours agorootparentThey don’t. reply inferiorhuman 13 hours agorootparentI'm not going to bother slogging through everything to be able to speak in specifics for every airplane ever built, but: A RAT provides backup electrical and/or hydraulic power for control surfaces (and other goodies). A RAT would certainly be inspected during a heavy check and likely even during line checks (e.g. an \"A\" check or equivalent). How often is gonna depend on the airplane. But to suggest that a critical piece of equipment isn't checked regularly is just silly. Additionally, it's pretty much guaranteed that if an airplane comes with a RAT the RAT is required to be functional for ETOPS flights. That alone means you're gonna be inspecting it pretty frequently. ETOPS certification has three parts: airplane, airline, and humans. You'd want to look at the ETOPS Maintenance Document at whatever airline to be sure. Outside of Asia (where domestic widebody flights are still common) I'd guess many if not most 787 flights are ETOPS flights. reply skissane 9 hours agorootparent> Additionally, it's pretty much guaranteed that if an airplane comes with a RAT the RAT is required to be functional for ETOPS flights. That alone means you're gonna be inspecting it pretty frequently. I remember a decade or more ago I was on a US domestic flight - I forget exactly what, I think it was American from SFO to LAX - so I doubt it needed ETOPS. But the captain announced - while we were still at the gate - that he was getting an error in the cockpit saying the RAT was faulty. And he called maintenance, and they told him to try resetting something (a computer or circuit breaker or whatever) to see if that cleared the error - and when it didn’t, he announced we could not take off and would all have to go back into the terminal. Thankfully they had a spare plane a few gates over and they put us all on that (same crew, same passengers) so we only lost an hour or two. reply inferiorhuman 8 hours agorootparentRight. In the context of this discussion ETOPS buys you significantly increased inspection and maintenance requirements. That's why I don't playing this game of telephone. Someone told someone else that something else did something else. Were everything to have unfolded as transcribed here there almost certainly would've been a high profile investigation. Back to your flight, both the FAA and EASA require airliners to have a minimum equipment list (MEL). It's entirely unrelated to ETOPS (overwater flights). This list describes what equipment is required to be functional, what you can fly without and when. What's on the list is all going to come down to what kind of plane we're talking about. Could be you're not allowed to fly without a functional RAT ever. Could be that you can fly without a RAT as long as something else (e.g. APU) is functional. Could be you can only make a certain number of flights with a non-op RAT. A real world example is that ATR 72 crash in Brazil recently. One of the PACKs (air conditioning / cabin pressurization) was not functioning on the accident plane. Per the MEL you can dispatch an ATR in that condition, but you're limited to a service ceiling of 17,000 ft. Unfortunately that put the flight in direct conflict with the weather. reply smcleod 21 hours agorootparentprevI thought the guy I was speaking mentioned something about instrumentation but I wasn't 100% sure and that sounded more serious so didn't mention it - but if the aux engine failing would do that - I guess that lines up! reply jiggawatts 21 hours agoparentprevModern two-engine planes like the 787 have an auxiliary power unit (APU) in the tail. This is a small turbine that runs a generator and a pump for the hydraulics. It’s typically only turned on when the plane is on the ground, or if there’s an emergency in mid-air. It is also needed to start the main engines so if the APU is faulty the plane will probably be stuck where it is. In theory a 787 can take off with just one engine but this is not very safe and wouldn’t be done in all but the most exceptional circumstances. There are variations on this depending on the plane model, of course. Some older planes can use an external starter for their engines, but I think that’s very rare now. reply thecosmicfrog 21 hours agorootparentAircraft with INOP APUs can generally be \"air started\" with a ground-based high-pressure air system. It's relatively common and I've been on a plane that had to do the procedure. It was entirely undramatic other than engines being started before the pushback, but I doubt most passengers even noticed. Now, interestingly, the 787 is a \"bleedless\" aircraft, so it doesn't use high-pressure air from the APU to spool up the engines. I believe it can use its hefty bank of lithium-ion batteries to start its engines if the APU (and associated electrical generator) is INOP. Not a pilot/engineer - just an enthusiast. Someone more au fait with the 787 might be able to correct me on the above. reply hinkley 20 hours agorootparentMy understanding is that there was a push to modify the U shaped tow trucks they use to position planes to have a battery powered system to start the engines. The idea being that the APU isn't particularly clean burning, not compared to power plant emissions. It's been a long while since I've heard anything about that plan, for or against. reply thecosmicfrog 18 hours agorootparentInteresting! Although it'd (presumably) only be useful for the 787, short of heavy modification to existing aircraft. Even the Airbus A350, an aircraft from the same era, uses a traditional bleed system. If planes continue down the bleedless route I can see it happening. reply inferiorhuman 16 hours agorootparentprevYeah the 787 can be started electrically but it takes a ton of juice. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W_RtawHVvw reply mrguyorama 3 hours agorootparentprev>Modern two-engine planes like the 787 have an auxiliary power unit (APU) Where \"modern\" here includes jet airliners made in the 70s yes. >It is also needed to start the main engines The engines need an air source, and the APU can be an air source, but at one point at least, big airlines preferred using ground hookup provided air sources for starting, in order to save gas. Next time you fly, look at the jetway. There will be a large yellow duct system underneath it that can be hooked up to the plane to provide pneumatic pressure and air conditioning air without starting the APU. There are similar hookups for electrical power so that a plane won't drain its battery during routine turnover operations. The bottom price flights I've taken recently don't seem to hook either up though, preferring instead to start the APU during taxi to the gate while shutting down one engine, shut down the other engine once they are at the gate, and reverse the process to taxi back out to the runway. The turnaround time is so short, and the required work to clean and restock the cabin so little, I bet they just don't pay for ground hookups. reply Dylan16807 22 hours agoprevPrevious: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22761395 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33233827 More interesting, a root cause analysis: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33239443 https://ioactive.com/reverse-engineers-perspective-on-the-bo...

IEEE 754 double can only represent integers up to 2^53 without precision loss, so if you naively average two numbers greater than 2^52, you get an erroneous result. It just so happens that 2^52 nanoseconds is a little bit over 52 days.

That makes the commercial jetliner software development and deployment process by far the safest and highest reliability ever conceived by multiple orders of magnitude. We are talking in the 10-12 9s range. And just to get ahead of: “Well what about the 737 MAX”, that was a system specification error, not due to “buggy” software failing to conform to its specification. The software did what it was supposed to do, but it should not have been designed to do that given the characteristics of the plane and the safety process around its usage. reply shiroiushi 15 hours agorootparent>“Well what about the 737 MAX”, that was a system specification error, not due to “buggy” software failing to conform to its specification. The software did what it was supposed to do Exactly: the system was designed to fly the plane into the ground if a single sensor was iced up, and that's exactly what the software did. Boeing really thought this system specification was a good idea. reply Veserv 10 hours agorootparentThat is a massive over-simplification and that invites patently false characterizations like it was a \"stupid mistake\" that would have been fixed if they were not stupid (i.e. adopted average development process). That is absolutely not the case. They were really capable, but aerospace problems are really, really hard, and their safety capability regressed from being really, really capable. They modified the flight characteristics of the system. They tuned the control scheme to provide the \"same\" outputs as the old system. However, the tuning relied on a sensor that was not previously safety-critical. As the sensor was not previously safety-critical, it was not subject to safety-critical requirements like having at least two redundant copies as would normally be required. They failed to identify that the sensor became safety critical and should thus be subject to such requirements. They sold configurations with redundant copies, which were purchased by most high-end airlines, but they failed to make it mandatory due to their oversight and purchasers decided to cheap out on sensors since they were characterized as non-safety-critical even if they were useful and valuable. The manual, which pilots actually read, has instructions on how to disable the automatic tuning and enable redundant control systems and such procedures were correctly deployed at least once if not multiple times to avert crashes in premier airlines. Only a combination of all of those failures simultaneously caused fatalities to occur at a rate nearly comparable to driving the same distance, how horrifying! A error in UX tuning dependent on a sensor that was not made properly redundant was the \"cause\". That is not a \"stupid mistake\". That is a really hard mistake and downplaying it like it was a stupid mistake underestimates the challenges involved designing these systems. That does not excuse their mistake as they used to do better, much better, like 1,000x better, and we know how to do better and the better way is empirically economical. But, it does the entire debacle a disservice to claim it was just \"being stupid\". It was not, it was only qualifying for the Olympics when they needed to get the gold medal. reply mass_and_energy 5 hours agorootparentI really don't think it takes a mastermind of software design to go \"okay I've built a system that takes control of the plane's maneuverability, let's make sure we have redundant sensors on this\". Furthermore, descriptions of MCAS and its role were dangerously under played so that they didn't have to tell their customers to retrain their pilots. An egregious breach of public trust in a company we put a whole lot of faith into. reply salawat 3 hours agorootparentprev>They failed to identify that the sensor became safety critical and should thus be subject to such requirements. Whistleblower testimony indicated it wasn't a failure to identify it as safety critical, but a conscious decision not to mention it as such to the regulator, and not implement it as a dual sensor system as doing so would have caused the design to require Class D simulator training; which Boeing was relying on the abscence of as a selling point to prevent existing airlines from defecting to Airbus. >They sold configurations with redundant copies, which were purchased by most high-end airlines, but they failed to make it mandatory due to their oversight and purchasers decided to cheap out on sensors since they were characterized as non-safety-critical even if they were useful and valuable. Incorrect. All MAX's have two AoA vanes, each paired to a single Flight Computer. The plane has two Flight Computers, one on each side of the cockpit, and the computer in command is typically alternated between each flight. One computer per flight will be considered in-command (henceforth referred to as Main), the other will be henceforth referred to as operating as \"auxillary\". The configuration you're thinking of is an AoA disagree light, implemented by enabling a codepath in software running on the Main FC whereby a cross-check of the value from the AoA vane networked to the auxillary FC would light up a warning light to inform pilots that system automation would be impacted, because the AoA values between the MFC and AFC differed. A pilot would be expected to recognize this as and adapt behavior accordingly/take measures to troubleshoot their instruments. Importantly, however, this feature had zero influence on MCAS. MCAS only took into account inputs from the vane directly wired to the Main FC. While a cross-check happened elsewhere for the sole purpose of illuminating a diagnostic lamp, there was no cross-check functionality implemented within the scope of the MCAS subsystem. The MCAS system was not thoroughly documented in any delivered to the pilot documentation. The program test pilot got specific dispensation to leave that out of the flight manual. See the Congressional investigation, final NTSB, and FAA report. >The manual, which pilots actually read, has instructions on how to disable the automatic tuning and enable redundant control systems and such procedures were correctly deployed at least once if not multiple times to avert crashes in premier airlines. The documentation, which included an Airworthiness Directive and NOTAM, informed pilots any malfunction should be treated in the same manner as a stabilizer trim runaway. Said problem is characterized in aviation parlance as a continual uncommanded actuation of trim motors. MCAS, notably is not that. It is periodic, and in point of fact, it ramps up in intensity over time until over 2° of travel are commanded by the computer per actuation event, with the timer between actuations being reset to 5 seconds by use of the on yoke Stab trim switches. This was ncommunicated to pilots. Furthermore, there were design changes to the Stab-Trim Cutout switches between 737NG (MAX's predecessor), and MAX. In the NG, the Stab Trim cutout could isolate the FC alone, or both FC and yoke switches from the Stab Trim motor. In MAX, however, the switches were changed to never isolate the FC from the Stab trim motors, because MCAS being operational was required for being able to checkmark FAR compliance for occupant carrying aircraft. So when that cutout was used, all electrically assisted actuation of the horizontal stabilizer became unavailable. The manual trim wheel would be the only trim input, and in out-of-trim attitudes, would result in such excessive loading on the control surface that physical actuation without electronic assistance was not feasible on the timescales required to recover the plane. There was a maneuver known to assist with these conditions (when they occurred at high altitude) called \"roller coastering\" in which you dive further into the undesired direction to unload the control surface to render it actuable. This technique has not been in official documentation since Dino 737 (Pre-NG). The events you're referring to when uncommanded actuations were recovered on other flights, happened at high altitudes, and were recovered with countered electrical stab switch actuation followed by Stab trim cutout within the reset 5 second watchdog timer prior to MCAS activation subsequent to a Stab-trim yoke control switch actuation. This procedure, and the implementation details needed to fully understand its significance, were undocumented prior to the two crashes. Furthermore, this procedure to cut out MCAS/the MFC from the stab trim motor and finishing the flight in a completely manually trim controlled configuration meant that technically you were flying an aircraft in a configuration that could not be certified to carry passengers when taking the FAR's prescriptively, and uncompromisingly rules-as-written with zero slack offered for convenience, because MCAS was necessary for grandfathering the MAX under the old type cert, and without MCAS functional, it's technically a new beast, which is non-compliant with control stick force feedback curves when approaching stalls, which by the way, just to make it clear, a compliant curve has been a characteristic of every civil transport in all jurisdictions worldwide for well over 50 years. This was not documented and only became apparent after investigation. Again, see the House findings, FAA report, and NTSB. >Only a combination of all of those failures simultaneously caused fatalities to occur at a rate nearly comparable to driving the same distance, how horrifying! Oh, the multi-billion dollar aircraft maker built a machine that crashes itself, gaslit it's regulators, pilots, airlines, and the flying public to juice the stock price so executives could meet their quarterly incentives, and diverted tunds away from it's QA and R&D functions to do stock buybacks, move HQ away from the factory floor, and try to union bust. With over 300 direct measurable deaths within a couple of months and multiple years worth of grounding and mandated redesigns to fix all the other cut corners we've been unearthing, and veritable billions of dollars of loss incurred in delays. Heavens, it could happen to anybody. How could you possibly see this as something to get upset about? /s reply Veserv 1 hour agorootparentThank you for providing a more thorough and complete technical explanation. As you can see from my final statement, I made no argument that it was not a travesty. It was ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE. This is not a defense of their inadequacy. I was pointing out how it is absolutely incorrect to claim that it was a \"stupid mistake\". That argument is used by people implicitly arguing that \"If only Boeing used modern software development practices like Microsoft/Google/Crowdstrike/[insert big software company here] then they would have never introduced such problems\". That is asinine. As can be seen from your explanation, the problem is multi-faceted requiring numerous design failures in both implementation, integration, and incentives. In fact, the problems are even more subtle and pernicious than in my original explanation that was derived from high level summaries rather than the investigation reports themselves. I do not know if this has changed in the last few years, but at Microsoft you were required to have 1 whole randomly-selected person, with no required domain expertise, say they gave your code, in isolation, a spot check before it could be added. This is the same process applied regardless of code criticality, as they do not even has a process to classify code by criticality. This is viewed as a extraordinary level of process and quality control that most could only dream of achieving. Truly if only Boeing threw out whatever they were doing and adopted such heavyweight process by \"best-in-class\" software development houses they would have discovered and fixed the 737 MAX problems. Boeing does not need to adopt modern software development \"best practices\" and whatever crap they use at Microsoft/[insert big software company here] that introduces bugs faster than ant queens. The processes in play that created the 737 MAX already make Microsoft and its peers look like children eating glue, but they are inadequate for the job of making safe aerospace software and systems. What Boeing needs to do is re-adopt their old practices that make the 737 MAX development processes look like a child eating glue. The 737 MAX was not stupid, it was inadequate. BOTH ARE UNACCEPTABLE, but the fix is different. reply jcgrillo 19 hours agorootparentprevSo what should we make of these issues described in the article? When, not if, this kind of thing kills people will it be a specification error? Will we blame it on maintenance? Surely it can't be the software's fault! reply Veserv 19 hours agorootparentFirst of all, who got blamed for the 737 MAX? Boeing did. This is one of the few industries where the responsibility does not get easily sloughed off. Second, 787s have been flying for ~13 years and ~4.5 million flights [1]. Assuming they were unaware of the problem for the majority of that time, their unknowing maintenance and usage processes avoided critical failures due to the stated problems for a tremendous number of flights. Given they now know about it and are issuing a directive to enhance their processes to explicitly handle the problem, we can assume it is even less likely to occur than previously which was already experimentally determined to be ludicrously unlikely. Suing someone into oblivion for a error that has never manifested as a serious failure and that is exceedingly unlikely to manifest is a little excessive. Third, they should be remediating problems as they arise balanced against the risks introduced by specification changes and against the alternative of other process modifications. Given Boeing’s other recent failings, they should be given strict scrutiny that they are faithfully following the traditional, highly effective remediation processes. It should only be worrisome if they are seeing disproportionately more problems than would be expected in a aircraft design of its age and are not remediating problems robustly and promptly.

I appreciate your point of view. The air travel industry is undeniably safe, moreso than any transportation system ever. By a large margin. On the other hand, it is possible to make software systems that do not have the defects described in the article. So how do we get to the place where we choose to build systems that behave correctly? I don't think we get there without severe penalties for failure. reply shiroiushi 15 hours agorootparent>The air travel industry is undeniably safe, moreso than any transportation system ever. I disagree: the Japanese shinkansen bullet train system has never had a fatal accident, except for a single incident 30 years ago when someone was caught in a door and dragged 100 meters. No fatalities from collisions, derailings, etc., ever, since the 1960s. That's far safer than air travel could ever claim to be. Even other train systems have better records than commercial aviation, in general. Plane crashes are rare these days, but they still happen once in a while, and the results are usually catastrophic. Are planes safer than cars? Well of course, but that's a really, really low bar: cars are driven by all kinds of morons who frequently (esp. in the US) have little to no training or testing, are frequently distracted, don't have a copilot who can take over at any time, and are frequently operating in a very, very chaotic environment (like city streets). It's truly a wonder there aren't more fatal crashes. But safer than trains in general? I seriously doubt it. reply Veserv 12 hours agorootparentActually, the Shinkansen seems to average ~100 billion passenger-km per year [1] or ~60 billion passenger-miles per year. Using that as a overestimate for the last 60 years, that is a grand total of 3.6 trillion passenger-miles. US commercial aviation averages ~1 trillion passenger-miles per year [2]. So if we compare the last 4 years of US aviation that is a comparable number of passenger-miles. Over the last 4 years recorded on this dataset (2019-2022)[3] it looks like there were 5 fatalities total. Over the last 4 years recorded on this dataset (2018-2021)[4] it looks like there were 2 fatalities total. So, while it does not appear to be safer, it is within a few factors on a passenger-mile basis. Furthermore, there are multiple periods of 4 trillion consecutive passenger-miles where there were 0 recorded accidents. It nowhere near obvious that it is “far safer than air travel could ever claim to be” and certainly a much closer race than you believed given your other assertions.

Of course planes are going to look good, since they travel much longer distances than cars or trains, and because planes are more likely to have trouble when taking off or landing than any time in-between. It's not like you can just take a commercial airliner flight to go to your local grocery store, even though statistically you're more likely to get killed on that trip than on a cross-continent flight. reply Veserv 11 hours agorootparentFirst of all, passenger-distance per event (or its inverse) is the standard metric used when comparing transportation safety. You would be hard-pressed to find any broad, rigorous comparison that does not compare on that metric. It encodes the risk of a trip to a location of a certain distance. It is absolutely a fair comparison. Second of all, even if we do use your metric which only cares about passenger-trips per event it still does not matter. The Shinkansen has transported ~6.4 billion people since inception. As seen in the second link I provided above, US commercial aviation serves ~900 million passengers per year. So, that is 7 years of US commercial aviation to transport the same number of people the Shinkansen has ever transported. As seen on the third link the last 7 years (2016-2022) had ~6 fatalities and as seen on the fourth link the last 7 years (2015-2021) had 2 fatalities compared to the 1 fatality on the Shinkansen. Third of all, given that the Shinkansen has transported ~6.4 billion people, but averages 150 million people per year and ~60 billion passenger-miles per year, we can reasonably conclude that I overestimated at ~3.6 trillion passenger-miles and it would likely actually be ~2.4 trillion passenger miles or just 2.5 years of US aviation. From the third link that would be a mere 1 fatality and from the fourth link 0-1 fatalities. If we extend our analysis to the last decade the third link indicates 15 fatalities over ~10 trillion passenger miles, ~2x the Shinkansen rate, and the fourth link indicates 2 fatalities over ~10 trillion passenger miles, ~50% the Shinkansen rate. Again, broadly comparable, but it is hard to truly tell which one is \"safer\" than the other. And again, they are clearly in the same ballpark and not dramatically different as you implied. reply andrewf 12 hours agorootparentprev> So how do we get to the place where we choose to build systems that behave correctly?

Training manuals normally contain a number of precise pitch and power settings (they vary between aeroplane types) so if display systems start failing, pilots can fall back to these with confidence. reply tomudding 22 hours agoprev(2020) reply justmarc 9 hours agoprevThere are just too many worrying signs from Boeing in the last years.

Happened every 24 days approximately and lost one user setting. Had a logic analyser connected to it for days trying to reproduce the issue in some way. Went to go for a piss and get a coffee one afternoon and came back and there it was triggered! What happened? Well it turns out there was a timer that no one used that overflowed and caused an interrupt which wasn’t handled any more, the interrupt handler fell through, caused a halt and the WDT fired fire rebooting it and some idiot hadn’t stored that one setting in the NVRAM. So then we had more problems. 5000 things with EPROMs in that were rebooting every 24 days which were spread all over the planet. Many questions to ask over how the hell it ended up like that. I hope people are asking these sorts of questions at Boeing. Edit: also the source code we had did not match what was on the devices. Turned out the engineer who provided the hex file hadn’t copied that code to the file server and had left a year before hand. We didn’t find that until the WDT fired and piqued our interest and could reproduce it on the dev board because the software was different (should have checked that past the label on the ROM which was wrong!) reply shadowgovt 22 hours agoprevThis is remarkably business-as-usual for airplane electronics. As a more mundane example: the wifi on planes does temporary [edit: DHCP, not NAT] leases. But the system on many has expiration windows on the order of hours, possibly more than a day... Couple that with the number of passengers planes serve and busy routes can easily exhaust the lease pool. The solution: there's a button the flight attendants can push to reboot the router, dumping the lease table. reply JosephRedfern 21 hours agoparentNitpicking here, but you mean DHCP rather than NAT, right? reply shadowgovt 21 hours agorootparentYes; thank you. reply Matheus28 21 hours agoparentprevEven with super long leases, couldn’t they just have a larger subnet?

People on the plane using WiFi are likely to access their corporate networks via VPN, potentially causing routing issues.

It doesn't jive with what I understand about unrouteable address spaces. Is the 10.x.x.x space somehow different than the 192.168.x.x space that millions of people use VPN's out of every day (basically every WFH person on their cheap NAT'd home Wifi)? reply klausa 12 hours agorootparentBecause many of the VPNs have _their_ internal routing using 10.0.0.0/8. If the plane network uses 10.0.0.0/8; and then the VPN you're trying to connect to uses 10.0.0.0/8, stuff breaks. reply globular-toast 12 hours agorootparentprevBecause IPv4 sucks! If you don't have enough publicly routable addresses then you are forced to use reserved ranges like 10/8. That means you'll get collisions, ie. multiple networks using the same addresses. With IPv6 you'd just get a real public IP address and all would be fine. Edit: I feel bad for saying IPv4 sucks. It's one of my favourite pieces of tech and an astonishingly good one at that. It just doesn't have a big enough address space. reply Filligree 21 hours agorootparentprevCouldn't we spare a single extra /8 for airplanes to use?

Tasks are started up at a specific frequency (set per task), run to completion or to the end of their time slot (set per task) and terminated. We had, IIRC, a strict 100ms slot for our bit of LRU software to do everything and it would be launched every 1s (from memory, that was 15 years ago). Information could be stored between executions so partial completion is something you could handle if needed by storing state information and using it at the start of the next iteration (we didn't need that, our tasks finished in the slot). You don't base the start of a future task on the end of the prior one, you base it on a fixed clock for these kinds of systems. reply tedunangst 19 hours agorootparentprevOr maybe it's aliens and their strontium-89 wormhole collapses after 51 days.

The news they can't stay out of is over 4 years old in this case. The model of plane it's about (787) has never had a single fatality despite >15 years of operations and >1,000 units operating today. In all, deaths are probably the worst possible metric to berate Boeing on - including every death (e.g. hijackings, not just engineering failures) their popular 747 line has had comes to 50 years. Despite their ever increasing incompetence on delivery speed, test compliance, and innovation... commercial air travel with Boeing (and other major air manufacturers) has always been one of, if not the, safest mechanisms of travel we've ever executed on. Particularly the last 5 years have been the safest period in terms of air travel deaths or injuries. None of that means we shouldn't criticize Boeing by any means, just that doing it over perceived death and accident counts because of what news headlines imply is complete nonsense in terms of actual numbers no matter how you slice it. It's important those kinds of things are reported but it's equally important to not get swept up in paranoia over it. reply gs17 13 hours agorootparent [–] Agreed, my 737 fears were relieved by researching how many of them are in the air at any moment, how many millions of trips they fly each year, how old airframes can get before they get retired, etc. Even the \"worse\" models are feats of engineering. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

Most people think of feature flags as boolean on/off switches, maybe per user on/off switches. If one is testing shades of colors for a \"But Now!\" button that may be OK. Regarding more complex tests my experience is that there are not a lot of users who tolerate experiments. Our solution was to represent feature flags as thresholds. We assigned a decimal number [0.0, 1.0) to each user (we called it courage) and a decimal number [0.0, 1.0] to a feature flags (we called it threshold). That way not only we enabled more experimental features for most experiment tolerant users, but these were the same users, so we could observe interaction between experimental features too. Also deploying a feature was as simple as rising it's threshold up to 1.0. User courage was 0.95 initially and could be updated manually. We tried to regenerate it daily based on surveys, but without much success. reply withinboredom 10 hours agoparentInteresting. At one place I worked, employees were excluded from experiments (they had to enable the flag personally to see them) by default. At one point, we had so many experiments that literally nobody except employees were using \"that version\" of the software. Everyone else was using some slightly different version (if you counted each feature as a version), and there were thousands and thousands of versions in total. We ended up creating just ~100 versions of our app (~100 experiment buckets), and then you could join a bucket. Teams could even reserve sets of buckets for exclusive experimentation purposes. We also ended up reserving a set of buckets that always got the control group. You've approached it a different way, and probably a more sustainable way. It's interesting. How do you deal with the bias from your 'more courageous' people? reply adontz 6 hours agorootparent>> How do you deal with the bias from your 'more courageous' people? That's a great question. We had no general solution for that. We tried to survey people, but results were inconclusive, not statistically significant. reply withinboredom 6 hours agorootparentI mean that \"courageous\" people are more likely to take risks and accept new features and thus probably more likely to be attracted to novelty (see: Novelty Effect) and require longer experiments to understand the actual impact. reply tauntz 7 hours agorootparentprev> At one point, we had so many experiments that literally nobody except employees were using \"that version\" of the software. Everyone else was using some slightly different version Was this at Spotify by any chance? :) reply withinboredom 6 hours agorootparentNo. reply siva7 9 hours agoparentprevSounds like an overengineered solution to something that can be solved as simple as with a checkbox \"i would like to get access to experimental features\" in the UI. reply jasfi 7 hours agorootparentI'd go with that option too. I don't think users want to be surprised with being experimented on. Some users could take it worse than others. reply adontz 6 hours agorootparentprevI respectfully disagree. Depends on number and severity of experiments. Comparing two decimals is really not harder than checking a boolean, still a single \"if\". I do not see much over-engineering here. reply j45 3 hours agorootparentprevGetting one or a few new features is one thing, getting too many might be too much. Some granularity and agency for the user is valuable. Maybe let them pick everything as a whole or a few features at a time. reply vasco 10 hours agoparentprev> User courage was 0.95 initially and could be updated manually. We tried to regenerate it daily based on surveys, but without much success. Based on this ending, the courage bit sounds clever but is misguided. It adds complexity in a whole other variable, yet you have no way of measuring it or even do a good assessment. I thought you were going to describe how you calculated courage based on the statistical usage of new features vs old features when exposed to them to update courage, meaning people who still keep using the product when it changes have more courage so they see more changes more often. But surveying for courage (or how easy they deal with change) is probably the worse way to assess it. But even that I don't know what purpose would have because now you destroyed your A/B test by selecting a very specific sub population, so your experiment / feature results won't be good. I'm assuming here a product experimentation approach being used, not just \"does it work or not\" flags. reply adontz 6 hours agorootparentMostly functional changes. Like deploying a new parser, which may not support all the old files. There were users which will contact customer support in panic stating that their life is ruined by this change and there were users who's like that fixed by next quarter. reply j45 3 hours agorootparentWhat’s important is if it worked for you and your audience. There’s no standard requiring something to work for everyone, and it being less value if it isn’t. reply remram 3 hours agoparentprevWhat does \"tolerating experiments\" mean? If they can tell it's an experiment, then isn't your change bad? Do you mean \"tolerate change\"? But then you still eventually roll out the change to everyone anyway... Or do you mean that users would see a different color for the \"buy now\" button every day? From a purely statistical point of view, if you select users which \"tolerate\" your change before you measure how many users \"like\" your change, you can make up any outcome you want. reply inhumantsar 35 minutes agorootparentI think you might be mixing things up a bit. the tolerance score wouldn't be tied to a specific change. it's an estimate of how tolerant a person is of changes generally. it's not that different from asking people if they want to be part of a beta testers group or if they would be open to being surveyed by market researchers. targeting like that usually doesn't have a significant impact on the results of individual experiments. reply j45 3 hours agorootparentprevI suspect it’s because some users will actually be pioneers and early adopters vs believing they are. This kind of threshold adds some flexibility into the subjectivity of finding the best cohort to test a feature with. reply remram 2 hours agorootparentWhere the best cohort to test with is the one that agrees with you... You can call this measure \"courage\" but that is not actually what you are measuring. What you measure is not that different from agreement. reply j45 48 minutes agorootparentI didn’t use the word courage, still I understand what you’re saying. reply lucideer 6 hours agoparentprevThis seems like it would skew the data significantly for certain use-cases. Unless you're feature flagging to test infra backing an expensive feature (in which case, in a load-balancer / containerised world, bucketing is going to be much a much better approach than anything at application level), then you most likely want to collect data on acceptance of a feature. By skewing it toward a more accepting audience, you're getting less data on the userbase that you're more likely to lose. It's like avoiding polling swing states in an election. reply vault 10 hours agoparentprevFrom your naming, I would have done the opposite :) Start with courage 0.05 and show experiments whenever it is greater than the threshold. To enable a feature for everybody, you lower the threshold to 0. How did you measure \"experiment tolerance\"? reply adontz 6 hours agorootparentYeah, naming was bad. Courage 0 is maximum courage. >> How did you measure \"experiment tolerance\"? Feedback from CS mostly. No formal method. We tried to survey clients to calculate courage metric, but failed to come up with anything useful. reply skeeter2020 7 hours agoparentprevThis seems really complex, specifically in the area where I find product, CS & marketing least likely to want it: targeting and controlling their audience. Sounds like a cool thought experiment, fun and challening to implement and not really practical or useful. If you have a huge userbase and deploy very frequently FFs are great for experiments, but for the rest of us they're primarily a way to decouple deploys from releases. They help with the disconnect between \"Marketing wants to make every release a big event; Engineering wants to make it a non-event\". I also find treating FFs as different from client toggles is very important for lifecycle management and proper use. More than the binary nature I think the bigger challenge is FFs are almost always viewed as a one-way path \"Off->On->Out\" but what if you need to turn them off and then back on again? It can be very hard to do properly if a feature is more than UI, that might cause data to be created or updated that the old code then clobbers, or issues between subsystems, like microservices that aren't as \"pure\" as you thought. reply adontz 6 hours agorootparentYes, it's not a good solution. Targeting was missing, good catch. I've just shared an unusual experience to inspire further experimenting. reply webda2l 8 hours agoprevA coding world with more standardization will be better world.

Why is this needed above and beyond the standard ways of configuring deployed services? reply ygouzerh 12 hours agoparentDo you mean feature flags? This enable you to change the configuration at the runtime. Ex: A/B Testing and changing a behavior for a subset of users, disable feature when you want it (particularly useful when you are in Trunk Based Development and don't want to deploy a beta feature to everyone for example). reply echoangle 11 hours agorootparentBut why do you need an external service for that? Isn’t that basically a single DB table with a name and an on/off value for each flag (or maybe an integer for multiple options)? reply hobofan 11 hours agorootparentIn it's simplest incarnation, yes it could be just a single DB table with boolean flags. However there are a lot of connected needs that most real world-usages run into: - Per-user toggles of configuration values - Per-user dynamic evaluation based on a set of rules - Change history, to see what the flag value was at time of an incident - A/B testing of features and associated setting of tracking parameters - Should be controllable by e.g. a marketing/product manager and not only software engineers That can quickly grow into something where it's a lot easier to reach for an existing well thought out solutions rather than trying to home-grow it. reply random_kris 11 hours agorootparentIn microservice world. Do you want to track features in each service or have a source of truth using flagd I prefer central source of truth reply jacobr1 6 hours agorootparentIn a microservice world obviously you'd have a feature-flag service. But you still have a build/buy consideration. reply j45 3 hours agorootparentprevGreat summary. The more parties involved with more and more configurations the more management of details is needed. reply fire_lake 11 hours agorootparentprevNo I mean an entire framework and set of software components for doing feature flags. reply skeeter2020 7 hours agorootparentIf you have a single database than maybe you can (and should?) just start with a basic, single table approach, but as you grow in size and complexity FF management can become a challenge, with reporting gaps and feature release management. I usually see two charateristics with the former approach: growth in the # of FFs over time and a messy Excel report for what they are, do and if anyone still hits the old code.

    "title": "Brush – A new compatible Gaussian splatting engine",
    "originLink": "https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush",
    "originBody": "Brush - universal splats teaser_compressed.mp4 Brush is a 3D reconstruction engine, using Gaussian splatting. It aims to be highly portable, flexible and fast. 3D reconstruction shouldn't require special hardware. Brush can render and train on a wide range of systems: macOS/windows/linux, AMD/Nvidia cards, Android, and in a browser. To achieve this, brush is built using WebGPU compatible tech, that can run practically anywhere! It uses the Burn framework, which has a portable wgpu backend. This project is currently still a proof of concept, and doesn't yet implement any of the extensions to gaussian splatting that have been developed, nor is the performance optimal yet. Try the (experimental) web demo NOTE: This only works on desktop Chrome 129+ currently (Oct 2024). Firefox and Safari are hopefully supported soon, but currently even firefox nightly and safari technical preview do not work Features The demo can load pretrained ply splats, and can load datasets to train on. Currently only two formats are supported. A .zip file containing: A transform_train.json and images, like the synthetic nerf scene dataset. An images & sparse folder with COLMAP data While training you can interact with the splats and see their training dynamics live, and compare the current rendering to training / eval views as the training progresses. Web combined_compressed.mp4 Rerun rerun_dash_compressed.mp4 While training, additional data can be visualized with the excellent rerun. To install rerun on your machine, please follow their instructions. Open the ./brush_blueprint.rbl in the viewer for best results. Mobile brush_android_compressed.mp4 Live training on a pixel 7 Why Machine learning for real time rendering has a lot of potential, but at the same time, most popular ML tools don't align well with r. Rendering requires low latency, usually involve dynamic shapes, and it's not pleasant to attempt to ship apps with large PyTorch/Jax/CUDA deps calling out to python in a rendering loop. The usual fix is to write a seperate training and inference application. Brush on the other hand, written in rust using wgpu and burn, can produce simple dependency free binaries, and can run on nearly all devices. Getting started Install rust 1.81+ and run cargo run or cargo run --release. You can run tests with cargo test --all. Brush uses the wonderful rerun for additional visualizations while training. It currently requires rerun 0.19 however, which isn't released yet. Windows/macOS/Linux Simply cargo run or cargo run --release from the workspace root. Note: Linux has not yet been tested but should work. Windows works well, but does currently only works on Vulkan. Web This project uses trunk to build for the web. Install trunk, and then run trunk serve or trunk serve --release to run a development server. WebGPU is still a new standard, and as such, only the latest versions of Chrome work currently. Firefox nightly should work but unfortunately crashes currently. The public web demo is registered for the subgroups origin trial. To run the web demo for yourself, please enable the \"Unsafe WebGPU support\" flag in Chrome. Android To build on Android, see the more detailed README instructions at crates/brush-android. iOS Brush should work on iOs but there is currently no project setup to do so. Technical details Brush is split into various crates. A quick overview of the different responsibilities are: brush-render is the main crate that pulls together the kernels into rendering functions. brush-train has code to actually train Gaussians, and handle larger scale optimizations like splitting/cloning gaussians etc. brush-viewer handles the UI and integrating the training loop. brush-android is the binary target for running on android, while brush-desktop is for running both on web, and mac/Windows/Linux. brush-wgsl handles some kernel inspection for generating CPU-side structs and interacing with naga-oil to handle shader imports. brush-dataset handles importing different datasets like COLMAP or synthetic nerf data. brush-prefix-sum and brush-sort are only compute kernels and should be largely independent of Brush (other than brush-wgsl). rrfd is a small extension of rfd Kernels The kernels are written in a \"sparse\" style, that is, only work for visible gaussians is done, though the final calculated gradients are dense. Brush uses a GPU radix sort based on FidelityFX (see crates/brush-sort). The sorting is done in two parts - first splats are sorted only by depth, then sorted by their tile ID, which saves some sorting time compared to sorting both depth and tile ids at the same time. Compatibility with WebGPU does bring some challenges, even with (the excellent) wgpu. WebGPU lacks native atomic floating point additions, and a software CAS loop has to be used. GPU readbacks have to be async on WebGPU. A rendering pass can't do this unless the whole rendering becomes async, which has its own perils, and isn't great for an UI. The reference tile renderer requires reading back the number of \"intersections\" (each visible tile of a gaussian is one intersection), but this is not feasible. This is worked around by assuming a worst case. To reduce the number of tiles the rasterizer culls away unused tiles by intersecting the gaussian ellipses with the screenspace tiles. The WGSL kernels use naga_oil to manage imports. brush-wgsl additionally does some reflection to generate rust code to send uniform data to a kernel. In the future, it might be possible to port the kernels to Burns new CubeCL language, which is much more ergonomic and would allow generating CUDA / rocM kernels. It might also be possible to integrate with George Kopanos' Slang kernels. Benchmarks Rendering performance is expected to be very competitive with gSplat, while training performance is still a bit slower. You can run some benchmarks using cargo bench. The performance of the splatting forward and backwards kernel are faster than the legacy gSplat kernels as they use some new techniques for better performance, but they haven't been compared yet to the more recent gSplat kernels. End-to-end training performance is also still slower, due to other overheads. For additional profiling, you can use tracy and run with cargo run --release --feature=tracy. Quality Quality is similair, but for now still somewhat lagging behind the original GS implementation. This is likely due to some suboptimal splitting/cloning heuristics.

I do this quite often. I probably shouldn’t, though. It’s only useful if you’re looking at commit logs or have an inline ‘last changed by [author] on [date]’ helper in your IDE. Then again, even that could be made wrong by future edits. reply Groxx 13 hours agorootparentYeah, there are frequently ways to figure out what date a relative measure is referring to; it's one of the best things about version control being a true norm in this field. But it's a few extra steps (depending on the UI), and many will not take those steps. They'll just trust it (far beyond when it's relevant), or think \"that's probably old\" and doubt it (immediately, because old docs are so common). It's relatively minor, but it's extremely easy to prevent, and just a better habit when communicating with the future. reply codeflo 12 hours agorootparentAnd that’s assuming the repository never gets reorganized in any way that doesn’t perfectly preserve history — which over long timespans, is bound to happen at some point. reply rallyforthesun 5 hours agoprevThank you for releasing this. It is the first option afaik, to generate a 3D Gaussian on a Mac without a gpu (using M1 Pro). It is quite slow, but quick enough to test-train a dataset while onsite, without the need to carry heavy workstations around! I really like the option to use rerun.io for training analytics. Again, thank you. reply ArthurBrussee 4 hours agoparentYou're welcome and thank you for trying it out! Hard at work to make performance better - the \"main\" kernels are at least as fast as gSplat, so now need to remove other overheads. That, and make splatting train more efficiently in general, lots of compute is wasted on small steps. Ps: the web version takes a minute to warm up and is generally slower, do try a native version if you haven't yet! reply rallyforthesun 3 hours agorootparentThanks for the advice, i did compile the repo on my m1 using vs code, but i do compare the speed to my workstation RTX4090, that comparison is not appropriate. reply Ameo 21 hours agoprevWow - the in-browser demo (https://arthurbrussee.github.io/brush-demo/) runs way more performantly and renders much better-looking results than any other I'd tried in the past. It loaded my 50MB .ply file almost instantly. Orbiting around the scene is extremely smooth and everything is free of flickering or artifacts. I never tried out training a Gaussian splat from images/video myself before, but this tool makes me want to give it a go. reply ArthurBrussee 18 hours agoparentLove to hear it!! Most viewers take some shortcuts, like only sorting every so often, it's good to hear the difference is noticable :) Training a splat requires a lot less setup with this, but does still require running COLMAP(https://github.com/colmap/colmap) first, which is still a big barrier... one thing at a time! reply dsp_person 9 hours agorootparentFeel the same as GP here. How expensive is the COLMAP step to run? I was also really impressed with the speed in the demo (but thinking that the shown training was the only step) Could you ELI5 what the training is versus what the COLMAP part is? reply ArthurBrussee 8 hours agorootparentThe input to this are two things - images, and camare poses. The camera poses tell you where each camera was in 3D space (and some of its properties). The training takes this information, to make a 3D model out it, visually matching all your photos. COLMAP can still be quite expensive & a hassle sadly, order half hour, as opposed to seconds. There are modern alternatives like https://lpanaf.github.io/eccv24_glomap/, or even deep learning based systems like https://github.com/naver/dust3r This is definitely still a big blocker to adoption. The goal is to get to a more all-in-one system. The splatting optimization can also help align cameras, if they don't start out entirely random, so any system to quickly provide a good \"initial guess\" will help here. At least for mobile devices, initialization from ARCore / ARKit poses should be enough. Keep an eye out :) reply wellthisisgreat 9 hours agoparentprevhow do you get the .ply file to load into it? which software do you use to generate those files? reply aDyslecticCrow 4 hours agoprevI expect this tech to make big waves in the backend of robotic systems soon. Accurate SLAM with accurate semantic tagging of objects is a big deal. An efficient and accurate reality-to-simulator translation, allowing reinforcement learning in simulated environments to be directly applicable to reality. Begone lidar units for basic robot tasks! All praise, normal cameras! (though, its far to slow to run on autonomous cars, since the environment changes so rapidly) reply porphyra 42 minutes agoparentAccurate SLAM with accurate semantic tagging would be a big deal, yes, but this project still relies on pretrained data with COLMAP so how is that relevant to your comment? reply peej555 7 hours agoprevWhats cool about this is the visualisation gives you a good intuition on how the training is working. Sometimes i feel like it should be able to get more details in certain areas but its always looking at things holistically. I wish you could give it a 3d bounding box and say - \"work on this area only\" which i think is something that should be possible? reply ArthurBrussee 6 hours agoparentThat was in some way the original motivation for the project! I think if you are reconstructing your own data the algorithm better just work, without input, ideally. But, imagine you could add in generated videos. Lay down a camera path, tell it what to generate, and add it to the reconstruciton.

In Rust\" is enough of a trope around here that it brings very specific crowds of people out to argue the same points each time, whether it's even remotely relevant to the link or not. Better to just avoid it unless the \"in rust\" part is somehow intrinsically relevant (e.g. it's in rust for specific reasons that were previously too hard in other languages) reply rc00 17 hours agorootparentThere is still brigading that happens regardless. I understand trying to minimize the battles but when there are actors propping up these same posts, it ends up having the opposite effect. (There are coordinated audiences on Discord and Mastodon looking to swarm these posts and game things like the front page of HN.) Better to suppress these posts if the desire is to avoid the inevitable arguments with the bonus that it can be automated rather than requiring manual intervention. Otherwise, it likely ends up a well-intentioned but poisonous pill. I don't know if this will stop the most motivated members though. reply Groxx 17 hours agorootparentPart \"yes, you have a point\" and part \"this is letting perfect be the enemy of good\". There is apparently enough time and energy for manual intervention, given that it just happened - if it isn't making things worse, it may still be worth doing.

Plastic recycling is just another American \"we tried nothing and are out of ideas.\" Much of the lack of recycling for plastics, when it comes to bottles, isn't some grand conspiracy so much as people just throwing bottles in the trash or on the side of the road, because: * There aren't omnipresent recycling bins to go alongside trash cans. * There aren't local programs for recycling pick up. * Some people can't be bothered and the government isn't punching them in the face, as it should.

You can package milk in glass bottle 5 percent of the weight of the product made at thousands of degrees from burning fossil fuels or you can package it in an inert HDPE container, that is processed at several hundred degrees and weighs say 0.5% of the product contained within. lighter packaging means less fuel burned to ship it. Lower processing temperatures means less fuel burned to make it. Ethylene polymerized into plastic for milk jugs doesn't end up in the air as CO2. Plastic feed stocks directly compete with fuel feed stocks. The less fuel we need to burn to ship things the more carbon is kept out of the atmosphere and the more carbon made into plastic that is stable when buried for thousands of years the less ends up in the air. You can make a lighter foam egg carton for less cost, that better protects the eggs than a paper one. Paper is no more a natural material than plastic.

I think things would actually get cheaper. reply morpheos137 1 hour agoprevThe blind irrational hatred of \"plastics\" is bordering on a religion or mass hysteria. HN is supposed to be a forum of educated, rational people capable of critical thought. Here are some basic facts. 1. Plastic is often presented in the media as some kind of monolithic hazardous compound where it is not. There are different kinds of plastic. Alternatives are usually economically and environmentally inferior. 2. The most common types of plastic for consumer applications are polyethylene and polypropylene, followed by polyvinyl chloride and polystyrene. PE and PP are biologically and chemically inert. The same reason why they don't break down is the reason why they are harmless. Polystyrene derived from a naturally occuring compound styrene found in some plants and can and does breakdown under attack of UV light, acids, microorganisms. All three PE, PP, and PS are most commonly manufactured without harmful additives. Only PVC uses significant quantities of plasticizers some of which are harmful. Unless you are chewing on your shower curtain you have little to worry about. 3. At least several hundred billion tons of commodity plastics have been mass produced over the last 70 years with little to no quantified, attributable environmental damage from these plastics. Most microplastic is essentially inert dust that is no different from other organic or inorganic dust such as pollen or clay. Plastics are not allergens because they are non reactive and do not stimulate an immune response. It is very likely that blood of animals contains plastic molecules along with thousands of other molecules in trace quantities doing no more harm than natural silt in a river system. 4.The fact that commodity plastics do not readily rot or degrade is a good thing. Petroleum carbon made into stable plastic and buried in a landfill is kept out of the atmosphere. 5. Plastic items are less energy demanding to recycle and produce in the first place because of lower thermal processing requirements than glass, metal or wood. 6. Lignin in wood is a natural plastic. 7. Most of the macro plastics in the ocean comes from Asia and the fishing industry. In the west it is buried in a landfill where it helpfully sequesters carbon. 8. Plastic items are often lighter to ship also consuming less energy that way versus alternatives. 9. Most microplastics in the ocean are from synthetic fibers and tire abrasion. I have yet to see a non handwaving study that these actually result in significant environmental harm. Maybe we should research more durable tire materials. Perversely electric vehicles wear tires quicker than ICE vehicles due to a more aggressive torque curve. Cotton has to be planted (diesel tractor), sprayed with fertilizers and pesticides, picked (diesel), spun, woven, etc. just because it's natural doesn't mean it's better for the environment at mass scale.

This neo Luddite Puritanism is just dumb and unscientific.

Why do you consider that empirical study to be new Luddite Puritanism? And if the plasticizer can leach out of plastics, which has been shown in numerous studies over the years, why do you consider them inert? It's not enough to assert, loudly, that you are right and we are all wrong and everything is fine let's all go back inside and let the chemists keep doing what they're doing. You have to explain also why PE and PP never under any circumstances ever contain any plasticizers. Regarding plastics and microplastics in the oceans, I've seen tons of pictures of dead birds that after autopsy have filled their crops with broken plastic pieces instead of food. This is not good, and having all of our sea birds die is not an insignificant environmental harm. So hand-waiving that away doesn't change the fact that introducing plastics have caused new and exciting forms of harm in our biosphere. reply tirant 41 minutes agoparentprevElectric vehicles have extremely precise traction control due to the nature of their motors so even with higher torque they keep traction much better than their ICE counterparts.

    "originBody": "«prev next» Logic Now let’s talk about one more seemingly unrelated topic just so we can “surprise” ourselves when we realize it’s category theory. By the way, in this chapter there will be another surprise in addition to that, so don’t fall asleep. Also, I will not merely transport you to a different branch of mathematics, but to an entirely different discipline - logic. What is logic Logic is the science of the possible. As such, it is at the root of all other sciences, all of which are sciences of the actual, i.e. that which really exists. For example, if science explains how our universe works then logic is the part of the description which is also applicable to any other universe that is possible to exist. A scientific theory aims to be consistent with both itself and observations, while a logical theory only needs to be consistent with itself. Logic studies the rules by which knowing one thing leads you to conclude (or prove) that some other thing is also true, regardless of the things’ domain (e.g. scientific discipline) and by only referring to their form. On top of that, it (logic) tries to organize those rules in logical systems (or formal systems as they are also called). Logic and mathematics Seeing this description, we might think that the subject of logic is quite similar to the subject of set theory and category theory, as we described it in the first chapter - instead of the word “formal” we used another similar word, namely “abstract”, and instead of “logical system” we said “theory”. This observation would be quite correct - today most people agree that every mathematical theory is actually logic plus some additional definitions added to it. For example, part of the reason why set theory is so popular as a theory for the foundations of mathematics is that it can be defined by adding just one single primitive to the standard axioms of logic which we will see shortly - the binary relation that indicates set membership. Category theory is close to logic too, but in a quite different way. Primary propositions A consequence of logic being the science of the possible is that in order to do anything at all in it, we should have an initial set of propositions that we accept as true or false. These are also called “premises”, “primary propositions” or “atomic propositions” as Wittgenstein dubbed them. In the context of logic itself, these propositions are abstracted away (i.e. we are not concerned about them directly) and so they can be represented with the colorful balls that you are familiar with. Composing propositions At the heart of logic, as in category theory, is the concept of composition - if we have two or more propositions that are somehow related to one another, we can combine them into one using a logical operators, like “and”, “or” “follows” etc. The results would be new propositions, which we might call composite propositions to emphasize the fact that they are not primary. This composition resembles the way in which two monoid objects are combined into one using the monoid operation. Actually, some logical operations do form monoids, like for example the operation and, with the proposition 𝑡 𝑟 𝑢 𝑒 serving as the identity element. However, unlike monoids/groups, logics study combinations not just with one but with many logical operations and the ways in which they relate to one another, for example, in logic we might be interested in the law of distributivity of and and 𝑜 𝑟 operations and what it entails. Important to note that ∧ is the symbol for and and ∨ is the symbol for 𝑜 𝑟 (although the law above is actually valid even if and and 𝑜 𝑟 are flipped). The equivalence of primary and composite propositions When looking at the last diagram, it is important to emphasize that, propositions that are composed of several premises (symbolized by gray balls, containing some other balls) are not in any way different from “primary” propositions (single-color balls) and that they compose in the same way (although in the leftmost proposition the green ball is wrapped in a gray ball to make the diagram prettier). Modus ponens As an example of a proposition that contains multiple levels of nesting (and also as a great introduction of the subject of logic in its own right), consider one of the oldest (it was already known by Stoics at 3rd century B.C.) and most famous propositions ever, namely the modus ponens. Modus ponens is a proposition that is composed of two other propositions (which here we denote 𝐴 and 𝐵 ) and it states that if proposition 𝐴 is true and also if proposition ( 𝐴 → 𝐵 ) is true (that is if 𝐴 implies 𝐵 ), then 𝐵 is true as well. For example, if we know that “Socrates is a human” and that “humans are mortal” (or “being human implies being mortal”), we also know that “Socrates is mortal.” Let’s dive into this proposition. We can see that it is composed of two other propositions in a 𝑓 𝑜 𝑙 𝑙 𝑜 𝑤 𝑠 relation, where the proposition that follows ( 𝐵 ) is primary, but the proposition from which 𝐵 follows is not primary (let’s call that one 𝐶 - so the whole proposition becomes 𝐶 → 𝐵 .) Going one more level down, we notice that the 𝐶 propositions is itself composed of two propositions in an and, relationship - 𝐴 and let’s call the other one 𝐷 (so 𝐴 ∧ 𝐷 ), where 𝐷 is itself composed of two propositions, this time in a 𝑓 𝑜 𝑙 𝑙 𝑜 𝑤 𝑠 relationship - 𝐴 → 𝐵 . But all of this is better visualized in the diagram. Tautologies We often cannot tell whether a given composite proposition is true or false without knowing the values of the propositions that it is made of. However, with propositions such as modus ponens we can: modus ponens is always true, regardless of whether the propositions that form it are true or false. If we want to be fancy, we can also say that it is true in all models of the logical system, a model being a set of real-world premises are taken to be signified by our propositions. For example, our previous example will not stop being true if we substitute “Socrates” with any other name, nor if we substitute “mortal” for any other quality that humans possess. Propositions that are always true are called tautologies. And their more-famous counterparts that are always false are called contradictions. You can turn each tautology into contradiction or the other way around by adding a “not”. The simplest tautology is the so called law of identity, the statement that each proposition implies itself (e.g. “All bachelors are unmarried”). It may remind you of something. Here are some more complex (less boring) tautologies (the symbol ¬ means “not”/negation. We will learn how to determine which propositions are a tautologies shortly, but first let’s see why is this important at all i.e. what are tautologies good for. Axiom schemas/Rules of inference Tautologies are useful because they are the basis of axiom schemas/rules of inference. And axiom schemas or rules of inference serve as starting point from which we can generate other true logical statements by means of substitution. Realizing that the colors of the balls in modus ponens are superficial, we may want to represent the general structure of modus ponens that all of its variations share. This structure (the one that looks like a coloring book in our example) is called axiom schema. And the propositions that are produced by it are axioms. Note that the propositions that we plug into the schema don’t have to be primary. For example, having the proposition 𝑎 (that is symbolized below by the orange ball) and the proposition stating that 𝑎 implies 𝑎 ∨ 𝑏 (which is one of the tautologies that we saw above), we can plug those propositions into the modus ponens and prove that 𝑎 ∨ 𝑏 is true. Axiom schemas and rules of inference are almost the same thing except that rules of inference allow us to actually distill the conclusion from the premises. For example in the case above, we can use modus ponens as a rule of inference to proves that 𝑎 ∨ 𝑏 is true. All axiom schemas can be easily applied as rules of inference and the other way around. Logical systems Knowing that we can use axiom schemas/rules of inference to generate new propositions, we might ask whether it is possible to create a small collection of such schemas/rules that is curated in such a way that it enables us to generate all other propositions. You would be happy (although a little annoyed, I imagine) to learn that there exist not only one, but many such collections. And yes, collections of this sort are what we call logical systems. Here is one such collection which consists of the following five axiom schemes in addition to the inference rule modus ponens (These are axiom schemes, even though we use colors). Proving that this and other similar logical systems are complete (can really generate all other propositions) is due to Gödel and is known as “Gödel’s completeness theorem” (Gödel is so important that I specifically searched for the “ö” letter so I can spell his hame right.) Conclusion We now have an idea about how do some of the main logical constructs (axioms, rules of inference) work. But in order to prove that they are true, and to understand what they are, we need to do so through a specific interpretation of those constructs. We will look into two interpretations - one very old and the other, relatively recent. This would be a slight detour from our usual subject matter of points and arrows, but I assure you that it would be worth it. So let’s start. Classical logic. The truth-functional interpretation Beyond the world that we inhabit and perceive every day, there exist the world of forms where reside all ideas and concepts that manifest themselves in the objects that we perceive e.g. beyond all the people that have ever lived, there lies the prototypical person, and we are people only insofar as we resemble that person, beyond all the things in the world that are strong, lies the ultimate concepts of strength, from which all of them borrow etc. And although, as mere mortals, we live in the world of appearances and cannot perceive the world of forms, we can, through philosophy, “recollect” with it and know some of its features. The above is a summary of a worldview that is due to the Greek philosopher Plato and is sometimes called Plato’s theory of forms. Originally, the discipline of logic represents an effort to think and structure our thoughts in a way that they apply to this world of forms i.e. in a “formal” way. Today, this original paradigm of logic is known as “classical logic”. Although it all started with Plato, most of it is due to the 20th century mathematician David Hilbert. The existence of the world of forms implies that, even if there are many things that we, people, don’t know and would not ever know, at least somewhere out there there exists an answer to every question. In logic, this translates to the principle of bivalence that states that each proposition is either true or false. And, due to this principle, propositions in classical logic can be aptly represented in set theory by the boolean set, which contains those two values. According to the classical interpretation, you can think of primary propositions as just a bunch of boolean values. Logical operators are functions that take a one or several boolean values and return another boolean value (and composite propositions are, just the results of the application of these functions). Let’s review all logical operators in this semantic context. The negation operation Let’s begin with the negation operation. Negation is a unary operation, which means that it is a function that takes just one argument and (like all other logical operators) returns one value, where both the arguments and the return type are boolean values. The same function can also be expressed in a slightly less-fancy way by this table. p ¬p True False False True Tables like this one are called truth tables and they are ubiquitous in classical logic. They can be used not only for defining operators but for proving results as well. Interlude: Proving results by truth tables Having defined the negation operator, we are in position to prove the first of the axioms of the logical system we saw, namely the double negation elimination. In natural language, this axiom is equivalent to the observation that saying “I am not unable to do X” is the same as saying “I am able to do it”. (despite its triviality, the double negation axiom is probably the most controversial result in logic, we will see why later.) If we view logical operators as functions from and to the set of boolean values, than proving axioms involves composing several of those functions into one function and observing its output. More specifically, the proof of the formula above involves just composing the negation function with itself and verifying that it leaves us in the same place from which we started. If we want to be formal about it, we might say that applying negation two times is equivalent to applying the identity function. If we are tired of diagrams, we can represent the composition diagram above as table as well. p ¬p ¬¬p True False True False True False Each proposition in classical logic can be proved with such diagrams/tables. The and and or operations OK, you know what and means and I know what it means, but what about those annoying people that want everything to be formally specified (nudge, nudge). Well we already know how we can satisfy them - we just have to construct the boolean function that represents and. Because and is a binary operator, instead of a single value the function would accept a pair of boolean values. Here is the equivalent truth-table (in which ∧ is the symbol for and.) p q p ∧ q True True True True False False False True False False False False We can do the same for 𝑜 𝑟 , here is the table. p q p ∨ q True True True True False True False True True False False False Task: Draw the diagram for or. Using those tables, we can also prove some axiom schemas we can use later: For and 𝑝 ∧ 𝑞 → 𝑝 and 𝑝 ∧ 𝑞 → 𝑞 “If I am tired and hungry, this means that I am hungry”. For or: 𝑝 → 𝑝 ∨ 𝑞 and 𝑞 → 𝑝 ∨ 𝑞 “If I have a pen this means that I am either have a pen or a ruler”. The implies operation Let’s now look into something less trivial: the implies operation, (also known as material condition). This operation binds two propositions in a way that the truth of the first one implies the truth of the second one (or that the first proposition is a necessary condition for the second.) You can read 𝑝 → 𝑞 as “if 𝑝 is true, then 𝑞 must also be true. Implies is also a binary function - it is represented by a function from an ordered pair of boolean values, to a boolean value. p q p → q True True True True False False False True True False False True Now there are some aspects of this which are non-obvious so let’s go through every case. If 𝑝 is true and 𝑞 is also true, then 𝑝 does imply 𝑞 - obviously. If 𝑝 is true but 𝑞 is false then 𝑞 does not follow from 𝑝 - cause 𝑞 would have been true if it did. If 𝑝 is false but 𝑞 is true, then 𝑝 still does imply 𝑞 . What the hell? Consider that by saying that 𝑝 implies 𝑞 we don’t say that the two are 100% interdependent e.g. the claim that “drinking alcohol causes headache” does not mean that drinking is the only source of headaches. And finally if 𝑝 is false but 𝑞 is false too, then 𝑝 still does imply 𝑞 (just some other day). It might help you to remember that in classical logic 𝑝 → 𝑞 ( 𝑝 implies 𝑞 ) is true when ¬ 𝑝 ∨ 𝑞 (either 𝑝 is false or 𝑞 is true.) The if and only if operation Now, let’s review the operation that indicates that two propositions are equivalent (or, when one proposition is a necessary and sufficient condition for the other (which implies that the reverse is also true.)) This operation yields true when the propositions have the same value. p q p ↔ q True True True True False False False True False False False True But what’s more interesting about this operation is that it can be constructed using the implies operation - it is equivalent to each of the propositions implying the other one (so 𝑝 ↔ 𝑞 is the same as 𝑝 → 𝑞 ∧ 𝑞 → 𝑝 ) - something which we can easily prove by comparing some truth tables. p q p → q q → p p → q ∧ q → p True True True True True True False False True False False True True False False False False True True True Because of this, the equivalence operation is called “if and only if”, or “iff” for short. Proving results by axioms/rules of inference Let’s examine the above formula, stating that 𝑝 → 𝑞 is the same as ¬ 𝑝 ∨ 𝑞 . We can easily prove this by using truth tables. p q p → q ¬p q ¬p ∨ q True True True False True True True False False False False False False True True True True True False False True True False True But it would be much more intuitive if we do it using axioms and rules of inference. To do so, we start with the formula we have ( 𝑝 → 𝑞 ) plus the axiom schemas, and arrive at the formula we want to prove ( ¬ 𝑝 ∨ 𝑞 ). Here is one way to do it. The formulas that are used at each step are specified at the right-hand side, the rule of inference is modus ponens. Note that to really prove that the two formulas are equivalent we have to also do it the other way around (start with ( ¬ 𝑝 ∨ 𝑞 ) and ( 𝑝 → 𝑞 )). Intuitionistic logic. The BHK interpretation […] logic is life in the human brain; it may accompany life outside the brain but it can never guide it by virtue of its own power. — L.E.J. Brouwer I don’t know about you, but I feel that the classical truth-functional interpretation of logic (althought it works and is correct in its own right) doesn’t fit well the categorical framework that we are using here: It is too “low-level”, it relies on manipulating the values of the propositions. According to it, the operations and and or are just 2 of the 16 possible binary logical operations and they are not really connected to each other (but we know that they actually are.) For these and other reasons, in the 20th century a whole new school of logic was founded, called intuitionistic logic. If we view classical logic as based on set theory, then intuitionistic logic would be based on category theory and its related theories. If classical logic is based on Plato’s theory of forms, then intuitionism began with a philosophical idea originating from Kant and Schopenhauer: the idea that the world as we experience it is largely predetermined of out perceptions of it. Thus without absolute standards for truth, a proof of a proposition becomes something that you construct, rather than something you discover. Classical and intuitionistic logic diverge from one another right from the start: because according to intuitionistic logic we are constructing proofs rather than discovering them as some universal truth, we are off with the principle of bivalence. That is, in intuitionistic logic we have no basis to claim that each statements is necessarily true or false. For example, there might be a statements that might not be provable not because they are false, but simply because they fall outside of the domain of a given logical system (the twin-prime conjecture is often given as an example for this.) Anyway, intuitionistic logic is not bivalent, i.e. we cannot have all propositions reduced to true and false. One thing that we still do have there are propositions that are “true” in the sense that a proof for them is given - the primary propositions. So with some caveats (which we will see later) the bivalence between true and false proposition might be thought out as similar to the bivalence between the existence or absense of a proof for a given proposition - there either is a proof of it or there isn’t. This bivalence is at the heart of what is called the Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov (BHK) interpretation of logic, something that we will look into next. The original formulation of the BHK interpretation is not based on any particular mathematical theory. Here, we will first illustrate it using the language of set theory (just so we can abandon it a little later). The and and or operations As the existence of a proof of a proposition is taken to mean that the proposition is true, the definitions of and is rather simple - the proof of 𝐴 ∧ 𝐵 is just a pair containing a proof of 𝐴 , and a proof of 𝐵 i.e. a set-theoretic product of the two (see chapter 2). The principle for determining whether the proposition is true or false is similar to that of primary propositions - if the pair of proofs of 𝐴 and 𝐵 exist (i.e. if both proofs exist) then the proof of 𝐴 ∧ 𝐵 can be constructed (and so 𝐴 ∧ 𝐵 is “true”). Question: what would be the or operation in this case? The implies operation Now for the punchline: in the BHK interpretation, the implies operation is just a function between proofs. Saying that 𝐴 implies 𝐵 ( 𝐴 → 𝐵 ) would just mean that there exist a function which can convert a proof of 𝐴 to a proof of 𝐵 . And, (it gets even more interesting) the modus ponens rule of inference is nothing more than the process of functional application. i.e. if we have a proof of 𝐴 and a function 𝐴 → 𝐵 we can call this function to obtain a proof of 𝐵 . (In order to define this formally, we also need to define functions in terms of sets i.e. we need to have a set representing 𝐴 → 𝐵 for each 𝐴 and 𝐵 . We will come back to this later.) The if and only if operation In the section on classical logic, we proved that two propositions 𝐴 and 𝐵 are equivalent if 𝐴 implies 𝐵 and 𝐵 implies 𝐴 . But if the implies operation is just a function, then proposition are equivalent precisely when there are two functions, converting each of them to the other i.e. when the sets containing the propositions are isomorphic. (Perhaps we should note that not all set-theoretic functions are proofs, only a designated set of them (which we call canonical functions) i.e. in set theory you can construct functions and isomorphisms between any pair of singleton sets, but that won’t mean that all proofs are equivalent.) The negation operation So according to BHK interpretation saying that 𝐴 is true, means that that we possess a proof of 𝐴 - simple enough. But it’s a bit harder to express the fact that 𝐴 is false: it is not enough to say that we don’t have a proof of 𝐴 (the fact that don’t have it, doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist). Instead, we must show that claiming that 𝐴 is true leads to a contradiction. To express this, intuitionistic logic defines the constant ⊥ which plays the role of False (also known as the “bottom value”). ⊥ is defined as the proof of a formula that does not have any proofs. And the equivalent of false propositions are the ones that imply that the bottom value is provable (which is a contradiction). So ¬ 𝐴 is 𝐴 → ⊥ . In set theory, the ⊥ constant is expressed by the empty set. And the observation that propositions that are connected to the bottom value are false is expressed by the fact that if a proposition is true, i.e. there exists a proof of it, then there can be no function from it to the empty set. The only way for there to be such function is if the set of proofs of the proposition is empty as well. Task: Look up the definition of function and verify that there cannot exist a function from any set to the empty set Task Look up the definition of function and verify that there does exist a function from the empty set to itself (in fact there exist a function from the empty set to any other set. The law of excluded middle Although intuitionistic logic differs a lot from classical logic when it comes to its semantics, i.e. in the way the whole system is built (which we described above), it actually doesn’t differ so much in terms of syntax, i.e. if we try to deduce the axiom schemas/rules of inference that correspond to the definitions of the structures outlined above, we would see that they are virtually the same as the ones that define classical logic. There is, however, one exception concerning the double negation elimination axiom that we saw earlier, a version of which is known as the law of excluded middle. This law is valid in classical logic and is true when we look at its truth tables, but there is no justification for it terms of the BHK interpretation. Why? in intuitionistic logic saying that something is false amounts to constructing a proof that it is false (that it implies the bottom value) and there is no method/function/alghorithm that can either prove that a given proposition is either true and false. The question of whether you can use the law of excluded middle spawned a heated debate between the classical logic proponent David Hilbert and the intuitionistic logic proponent L.E.J. Brouwer, known as the Brouwer–Hilbert controversy. Logics as categories Leaving the differences between intuitionistic and classical logics aside, the BHK interpretation is interesting because it provides that higher-level view of logic, that we need in order to construct a interpretation of it based on category theory. Such higher-level interpretations of logic are sometimes called algebraic interpretations, algebraic being an umbrella term describing all structures that can be represented using category theory, like groups and orders. The Curry-Howard isomorphism Programmers might find the definition of the BHK interpretation interesting for other reason - it is very similar to a definition of a programming language: propositions are types, the implies operations are functions, and operations are composite types (objects), and or operations are sum types (which are currently not supported in most programming languages, but that’s a separate topic). Finally a proof of a given proposition is represented by a value of the corresponding type. This similarity is known as the Curry-Howard isomorphism. Task: The Curry-Howard isomorphism is also the basis of special types of programming languages called “proof assistants” which help you verify logical proofs. Install a proof assistant and try to see how it works (I recommend the Coq Tutorial by Mike Nahas). Cartesian closed categories Knowing about the Curry-Howard isomorphism and knowing also that programming languages can be described by category theory may lead us to think that category theory is part of this isomorphism as well. And we would be quite correct — this is why it is sometimes known as the Curry-Howard-Lambek isomorphism (Joachim Lambek being the person who formulated the categorical side). So let’s examine this isomorphism. As all other isomorphisms, it comes in two parts: The first part is finding a way to convert a logical system into a category - this would not be hard for us, as sets form a category and the flavor of the BHK interpretation that we saw is based on sets. Task: See whether you can prove that logic propositions and the “implies” relation form a category. What is missing? The second part involves converting a category into a logical system - this is much harder. To do it, we have to enumerate the criteria that a given category has to adhere to, in order for it to be “logical”. These criteria have to guarantee that the category has objects that correspond to all valid logical propositions and no objects that correspond to invalid ones. Categories that adhere to these criteria are called cartesian closed categories. To describe them here directly, but instead we would start with a similar but simpler structures that we already examined - orders. Logics as orders So, we already saw that a logical system along with a set of primary propositions forms a category. If we assume that there is only one way to go from proposition 𝐴 , to proposition 𝐵 (or there are many ways, but we are not interested in the difference between them), then logic is not only a category, but a preorder in which the relationship “bigger than” is taken to mean “implies”, so ( 𝐴 → 𝐵 is 𝐴 > 𝐵 ). Furthermore, if we count propositions that follow from each other (or sets of propositions that are proven by the same proof) as equivalent, then logic is a proper partial order. And so it can be represented by a Hasse diagram, in which 𝐴 → 𝐵 only if 𝐴 is below 𝐵 in the diagram. This is something quite characteristic of category theory — examining a concept in a more limited version of a category (in this case orders), in order to make things simpler for ourselves. Now let’s examine the question that we asked before - exactly which categories orders represent logic and what laws does an order have to obey so it is isomorphic to a logical system? We will attempt to answer this question as we examine the elements of logic again, this time in the context of orders. The and and or operations By now you probably realized that the and and or operations are the bread and butter of logic (although it’s not clear which is which). As we saw, in the BHK interpretation those are represented by set products and sums. The equivalent constructs in the realm of order theory are meets and joins (in category-theoretic terms products and coproducts.) Logic allows you to combine any two propositions in and and or or relationship, so, in order for an order to be “logical” (to be a correct representation for a logical system,) it has to have 𝑚 𝑒 𝑒 𝑡 and 𝑗 𝑜 𝑖 𝑛 operations for all elements. Incidentally we already know how such orders are called - they are called lattices. And there is one important law of the and and or operations, that is not always present in all lattices. It concerns the connection between the two, i.e. way that they distribute, over one another. Lattices that obey this law are called distributive lattices. Wait, where have we heard about distributive lattices before? In the previous chapter we said that they are isomorphic to inclusion orders i.e. orders of sets, that contain a given collection of elements, and that contain all combinations of a given set of elements. The fact that they popped up again is not coincidental — “logical” orders are isomorphic to inclusion orders. To understand why, you only need to think about the BHK interpretation — the elements which participate in the inclusion are our prime propositions. And the inclusions are all combinations of these elements, in an or relationship (for simplicity’s sake, we are ignoring the and operation.) The or and and operations (or, more generally, the coproduct and the product) are, of course, categorically dual, which would explain why the symbols that represent them ∨ and ∧ are the one and the same symbol, but flipped vertically. And even the symbol itself looks like a representation of the way the arrows converge. This is probably not the case, as this symbol is used way before Hasse diagrams were a thing — for all we know the ∨ symbol is probably symbolizes the “u” in “uel” (the latin word for “or”) and the and symbol is just a flipped “u”) — but I still find the similarity fascinating. The negation operation In order for a distributive lattice to represent a logical system, it has to also have objects that correspond to the values True and False (which are written ⊤ and ⊥ ). But, to mandate that these objects exist, we must first find a way to specify what they are in order/category-theoretic terms. A well-known result in logic, called the principle of explosion, states that if we have a proof of False (which we write as ⊥ ) i.e. if we have a statement “False is true” if we use the terminology of classical logic, then any and every other statement can be proven. And we also know that no true statement implies False (in fact in intuitionistic logic this is the definition of a true statement). Based on these criteria we know that the False object would look like this when compared to other objects: Circling back to the BHK interpretation, we see that the empty set fits both of these conditions. Conversely, the proof of True which we write as ⊤ , expressing the statement that “True is true”, is trivial and doesn’t say anything, so nothing follows from it, but at the same time it follows from every other statement. So True and False are just the greatest and least objects of our order (in category-theoretic terms terminal and initial object.) This is another example of the categorical concept of duality - ⊤ and ⊥ are dual to each other, which makes a lot of sense if you think about it, and also helps us remember their symbols (althought if you are like me, you’ll spent a year before you stop wondering which one is which, every time I see them). So in order to represent logic, our distributive lattice has to also be bounded i.e. it has to have greatest and least elements (which play the roles of True and False). The implies operation As we said, every lattice has representations of propositions implying one another (i.e. it has arrows), but to really represents a logical system it also has to have function objects i.e. there needs to be a rule that identifies a unique object 𝐴 → 𝐵 for each pair of objects 𝐴 and 𝐵 , such that all axioms of logic are followed. We will describe this object in the same way we described all other operations — by defining a structure consisting of a of objects and arrows in which 𝐴 → 𝐵 plays a part. And this structure is actually a categorical reincarnation our favorite rule of inference, the modus ponens. Modus ponens is the essence of the implies operation, and, because we already know how the operations that it contains (and and implies) are represented in our lattice, we can directly use it as a definition by saying that the object 𝐴 → 𝐵 is the one for which modus ponens rule holds. The function object 𝐴 → 𝐵 is an object which is related to objects 𝐴 and 𝐵 in such a way that such that 𝐴 ∧ ( 𝐴 → 𝐵 ) → 𝐵 . This definition is not complete, however, because (as usual) 𝐴 → 𝐵 is not the only object that fits in this formula. For example, the set 𝐴 → 𝐵 ∧ 𝐶 is also one such object, as is 𝐴 → 𝐵 ∧ 𝐶 ∧ 𝐷 (not going to draw all the arrows here, because it will get too (and I mean too) messy). So how do we set apart the real formula from all those “imposter” formulas? If you remember the definitions of the categorical product (or of its equivalent for orders, the meet operation) you would already know where this is going: we recognize that 𝐴 → 𝐵 is the upper limit of 𝐴 → 𝐵 ∧ 𝐶 and 𝐴 → 𝐵 ∧ 𝐶 ∧ 𝐷 and all other imposter formulas that can be in the place of 𝑋 in 𝐴 ∧ 𝑋 → 𝐵 . The relationship can be described in a variety of ways: We can say that 𝐴 → 𝐵 is the most trivial result for which the formula 𝐴 ∧ 𝑋 → 𝐵 is satisfied and that all other results are stronger. We can say that all other results imply 𝐴 → 𝐵 but not the other way around. We can say that all other formulas lie below 𝐴 → 𝐵 in the Hasse diagram. So, after choosing the best way to express the relationship (they are all equivalent) we are ready to present our final definition: The function object 𝐴 → 𝐵 is the topmost object which is related to objects 𝐴 and 𝐵 in such a way that 𝐴 ∧ ( 𝐴 → 𝐵 ) → 𝐵 . The existence of this function object (called exponential object in category-theoretic terms) is the final condition for an order/lattice to be a representation of logic. Note, by the way, that this definition of function object is valid specifically for intuinistic logic. For classical logic, the definition of is simpler — there 𝐴 → 𝐵 is just ¬ 𝐴 ∨ 𝐵 , because of the law of excluded middle. The if and only if operation When we examined the if and only if operation can be defined in terms implies, that is 𝐴 ↔ 𝐵 is equivalent to 𝐴 → 𝐵 ∧ 𝐵 → 𝐴 . We have something similar for categorical logic as well — We say that when two propositions are connected to each other, then, particularily when we speak of orders, they are isomorphic. A taste of categorical logic In the previous section we saw some definitions, here we will convince ourselves that they really capture the concept of logic correctly, by proving some results using categorical logic. True and False The join (or least upper bound) of the topmost object ⊤ (which plays the role of the value True) and any other object that you can think of, is… ⊤ itself (or something isomorphic to it, which, as we said, is the same thing). This follows trivially from the fact that the join of two objects must be bigger or equal than both of these objects, and that there is no other object that is bigger or equal to the ⊤ is ⊤ itself. This is simply because ⊤ (as any other object) is equal to itself and because there is by definition no object that is bigger than it. This corresponds to the logical statement that 𝐴 ∨ ⊤ is equal to ⊤ i.e. it is true. Hence, the above observation is a proof of that statement, (an alternative to truth tables). Task: Think of the duel situation, with False. What does it imply, logically? And and Or Above, we saw that the join between any random object and the top object is the top object itself. But, does this situation only occur when the second object is ⊤ ? Wouldn’t the same thing happen if ⊤ it is replaced by any other object that is higher than the first one? The answer is “Yes”: when we are looking for the join of two object, we are looking for the least upper bound i.e. the lowest object that is above both of them. So, any time we have two objects and one is higher than the other, their join would be (isomorphic to) the higher object. In other words, if 𝐴 → 𝐵 , then 𝐴 ∧ 𝐵 ↔ 𝐵 Implies For our first example with implies, let’s take the formula 𝐴 → 𝐵 , and examine the case when 𝐴 and 𝐵 are the same object. We said that, 𝐴 → 𝐵 ( 𝐴 → 𝐴 in our case) is the topmost object 𝑋 for which the criteria given by the formula 𝐴 ∧ 𝑋 → 𝐵 is satisfied. But in this case, the formula is satisfied for any 𝑋 , (because it evaluates to 𝐴 ∧ 𝑋 → 𝐴 , which is always true), i.e. the topmost object that satisfies it is… the topmost object there is i.e. (an object isomorphic to) 𝑇 𝑟 𝑢 𝑒 . Does this make sense? Of course it does: in fact, we just proved one of the most famous laws in logic (called the law of identity, as per Aristotel), namely that 𝐴 → 𝐴 is always true, or that everything follows from itself. And what happens if 𝐴 implies 𝐵 in any model, i.e. if 𝐴 ⊨ 𝐵 (semantic consequence)? In this case, 𝐴 would be below 𝐵 in our Hasse diagram (e.g. 𝐴 is the blue ball and 𝐵 is the orange one). Then the situation is somewhat similar to the previous case: 𝐴 ∧ 𝑋 → 𝐵 will be true, no matter what 𝑋 is (simply because 𝐴 already implies 𝐵 , by itself). And so 𝐴 → 𝐵 will again correspond to the 𝑇 𝑟 𝑢 𝑒 object. This is again a well-known result in logic (if I am not mistaken, it will be a deduction theorem of some sort): if 𝐴 ⊨ 𝐵 ), then the statement ( 𝐴 → 𝐵 ) will always be true. «prev next» Contents About Sets Categories Monoids Orders Logic Functors Subscribe for updates Created by Jencel Panic personal blog email mastodon twitter Github Support this project Ko-fi Patreon Made with Jekyll Book Boilerplate.

I still would vote to learn it from Milewski though. Learning this is a journey and the author of ct-illustrated is, i think, still in the middle of it. Milewski has made that trip multiple times already. The book and his blog are great places. https://github.com/hmemcpy/milewski-ctfp-pdf Book https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-p...

No way i will use that method to understand the subject. reply dkarl 2 hours agorootparentYou might be looking for a kind of understanding that doesn't exist in math. John von Neumann said, \"In mathematics, you don't understand things. You just get used to them.\" So even one of the greatest mathematicians of all time didn't feel like he \"understood\" concepts that he was adept at applying to both abstract and real-world problems. This is why there are monad tutorials that use dozens of different analogies for monads, and nobody feels like they understand anything better after reading them. But if you use monads enough, eventually you get used to how they work and how to accomplish things with them. And then you stop caring if you \"understand\" them. reply Krei-se 2 hours agorootparentSpeak for yourself, monads are easily understood from the philosophical pov: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(philosophy) which they are derived from in category theory, so maybe go that way if you still need foundation for the concept of the concept that bore all concepts? reply chongli 1 hour agorootparentCategory theory does not derive the idea of a monad from philosophy, it merely reuses the word for an entirely unrelated purpose. It's like how a frog [1] to a farrier has nothing to do with the frog [2] from everyday use, nor to the frog [3] from railroading.

Looking at that link, the term has been used by many different philosophers with many different meanings. Leibniz's monads are the most famous, and they have nothing in common with category theory monads except the name.[0] The mathematical concept was in use for years before anybody decided to call it a \"monad\" anyway. According to Wikipedia: \"The notion of monad was invented by Roger Godement in 1958 under the name 'standard construction'. Monad has been called 'dual standard construction', 'triple', 'monoid' and 'triad'. The term 'monad' is used at latest 1967, by Jean Bénabou.\"[1] [0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monadology#Summary [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(category_theory)#Termin... reply Krei-se 1 hour agorootparentSo what? If you call it god around 0 BC and monad in the 1970 it's still the same concept. If the notation and meanings change in your pov and that gives you headaches, that's maybe related to the fact, that you cannot call an absurd function, but you can derive structure from combining it. reply jasomill 20 minutes agorootparentIn other words, God is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors‽ reply barberpole 56 minutes agorootparentprev> Leibniz's monads [...]have nothing in common with category theory monads except the name.[0] The monad is something about which you can reason but you cannot look inside because it is windowless. No quibbling, please. reply ahoka 1 hour agorootparentprevHow does it make it easy? That’s like saying to understand object oriented programming one just needs to study Plat’s theory of forms. reply Krei-se 1 hour agorootparentIts the point where you start from in CT. Having the problem of not being able to talk about a concept is the absurd function and part of Chapter 1 (!!) in books about category theory. So instead of circling around this topic, welcome, this means you are inside the problem domain of category theory ;) reply Koshkin 59 minutes agorootparentprevNot such a bad idea TBH reply umanwizard 1 hour agorootparentprevAs far as I can tell this is totally unrelated to the concept of monad in mathematics or programming. reply Krei-se 3 hours agorootparentprevYeah, but that's kinda the point i made in my original post: You can work towards the general math terms while translating your domain model into higher abstractions, but this will have consequences on your personal life. You can see this clearly in the ct-illustrated author that interweaves his struggle while learning the matter and wrote a journal about both his life and the topic. As Milewski teaches the subject, he is in a position to match both personal life, work and the topic into one book, so this is the goal, but it will entail you leaving the narrow perspective of your work. He can talk from math to math, but you have to - similar to the author of ct-illustrated - find your own way from translating your specific model into a more general one. If you want a handle to start: Think of a line that extends into + and - infinity: It will create a circle. Even though a circle is a 2 dimensional object, it's made of infinetly many distinct 1-dimensional lines. The same is true for your work: Even though it is made out of a distinct countable number of interwoven objects in your domain, this structure is part of a bigger abstraction. Doing more work, like drawing more distinct new objects will not take you onto the more general abstraction, but thinking about what all your domain models have in common. Try to work less, be lazy and the underlying mathematical models will appear in a language you already speak. In your case: Abstraction your work domain model into multiple clients (1 employer --> multiple employers in a similar line of work) will a) lead into your termination b) show how you can abstract your work away from 1 source of income and purpose into multiple ones. Good luck! reply Koshkin 46 minutes agorootparentA circle is a 1-dimensional manifold (which, indeed, could be embedded in a space that has more dimensions). This follows exactly from your own (correct) image of it as being created from (i.e. being locally homeomorphic to) straight lines. But the entire thing (\"the territory\") always turns out to be more than the set of parts it is \"built from,\" and if you ignore this, not only you are bound to lose the forest for the trees, your understanding of the whole may end up being completely wrong. reply iman453 3 hours agorootparentprevWould you be willing to share more about your domain modeling and how category theory helped? reply Krei-se 3 hours agorootparentHe can abstract more models in general frameworks (This is true for every job). He just is hesitant taking the leap to go all Camus and derive money from absurdism ;) reply psychoslave 4 hours agoprevDiscussed at the time, though with an other URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28660131 (2 comments) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28660157 (112 comments) reply tezka 2 hours agoprevAny body can share a success story of using category theory gainfully to any CS/SWE problem that couldn't have been solved without? No Monads isn't one, you would invent it naturally when the situation calls for it. I spent a year studying in grad school and I ultimately abandoned it. reply dambi0 1 hour agoparentDetermining whether something is useful because it’s the only way that a problem can be solved is quite a high bar. We could say the same about computers in general. Admittedly even with a less stringent criteria I don’t have any examples. So I understand your point reply Krei-se 1 hour agorootparentBrainfuck is turing complete, why would we worry about any other structure preserving compilers? Brainfuck will do just fine /s CT is outside most problem domains in computation, as its outside the time and space constraints of a machine. Knowing whether a program will never finish is part of CT for software developers. So handling this case is a maybe in CT while it's a must in software (running endlessly means crashing). reply rnhmjoj 1 hour agoparentprevReformulating something you already understanding in a more general framework can give more insight into what it really means, isolate the essence from messy details. From my very limited understanding of it, characterising an object with universal properties is an important part of category theory. Another practical utility of category theory is providing a common language for computer scientists, mathematicians and physicists to speak. You can imagine collaboration is not easy when everyone calls the same pattern with different names with slightly incompatible definitions that requires you to understand unfamiliar theories. reply j2kun 1 hour agoparentprevThe closest I know of is the work on UMAP. I interviewed Leland McInnes who explained to me in detail how category theory was a big part of helping him connect the dots, even though the final result does not strictly need it in the actual code. Given the relative improvement over the previous state of the art (t-SNE), it's the only example that really makes me reconsider my poo-pooing the way category theory is discussed in software. https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03426 reply Krei-se 1 hour agoparentprevYou are very close. CT is about structure, not which problem this structure solves. Compilers are closest in what i can think of in this regard: They don't resolve one problem domain, but many. Which one you apply it on is up to you. One tool for one job is a simple rule you can adapt as a systems architect allowing you to build clear structure for the problem domain you come across. esbuild comes to mind as an example - the job was solved before, but keeping one purpose in mind and writing it from scratch solves the problem WAAAY faster. So no, no problem is solved inside the domain of product software development, but outside of it, you as a developer can (if you want and for speed) derive any structure from the absurd function instead of combining foreign frameworks. reply Koshkin 19 minutes agorootparent> CT is about structure No, this is exactly what CT is not about. (It is about morphisms.) reply platz 2 hours agoparentprevabstractions never solve problems that couldn't have been solved without them. reply Koshkin 16 minutes agorootparentSure; it's just that doing calculations with the Roman numerals takes longer. reply javajosh 47 minutes agoparentprevMy cynical understanding of category theory is that it's the mathy Peter principle: category theory is when meta mathematics starts to lose all value. Except two professional mathematicians, of course, in which case the value is almost purely economic. \"He who is employed to teach something that cannot be understood will always have a job.\" reply umanwizard 1 hour agoparentprevIt is really not useful at all in software engineering except possibly in some very niche case. reply overhead4075 3 hours agoprevCircles in circles doesn't really scale well if the inner circles are always vertically centered. reply Krei-se 2 hours agoprev [–] Oh i just realized the blog author himself created this post: Boris we love you!

    "originLink": "https://cerebras.ai/blog/cerebras-inference-3x-faster",
    "originBody": "Today we’re announcing the biggest update to Cerebras Inference since launch. Cerebras Inference now runs Llama 3.1-70B at an astounding 2,100 tokens per second – a 3x performance boost over the prior release. For context, this performance is: 16x faster than the fastest GPU solution 8x faster than GPUs running Llama3.1-3B, a model 23x smaller Equivalent to a new GPU generation’s performance upgrade (H100/A100) in a single software release Fast inference is the key to unlocking the next generation of AI apps. From voice, video, to advanced reasoning, fast inference makes it possible to build responsive, intelligent applications that were previously out of reach. From Tavus revolutionizing video generation to GSK accelerating drug discovery workflows, leading companies are already using Cerebras Inference to push the boundaries of what’s possible. Try Cerebras Inference using chat or API at inference.cerebras.ai. Benchmarks Cerebras Inference has been rigorously tested by Artificial Analysis, a third-party benchmarking organization. We reproduce their performance charts below. In output speed per user, Cerebras Inference is in a league of its own – 16x faster than the most optimized GPU solution, 68x faster than hyperscale clouds, and 4-8x faster than other AI accelerators. Time to first token is critical for real time applications. Cerebras is tied second place in first token latency, showing the advantage of a wafer-scale integrated solution vs. complex networked solutions. Total response time – measuring a full turn of input and output – is a good proxy for multi-step agentic workflows. Here Cerebras Inference completes a full request in just 0.4 of a second vs. 1.1 to 4.2 seconds on GPU based solutions. For agents, this means getting up to 10x more work done in the same time. For reasoning models, this enables 10x more reasoning steps without increasing response time. Cerebras Inference running Llama3.1 70B is now so fast that it outruns GPU based inference running Llama3.1 3B. The Wafer Scale Engine runs an AI model 23x larger at 8x speed for a combined 184x performance advantage. Optimized kernels, stack, and ML The first release of Cerebras Inference in August set new speed records and made Llama3.1-70B an instantaneous experience. While it was incredibly fast, it was the first implementation of inference on the Wafer Scale Engine and utilized only a fraction of its peak bandwidth, compute, and IO capacity. Today’s release is the culmination of numerous software, hardware, and ML improvements we made to our stack to greatly improve the utilization and real-world performance of Cerebras Inference. We’ve re-written or optimized the most critical kernels such as MatMul, reduce/broadcast, element wise ops, and activations. Wafer IO has been streamlined to run asynchronously from compute. This release also implements speculative decoding, a widely used technique that uses a small model and large model in tandem to generate answers faster. As a result of this feature, you may observe a greater variance in output speed – 20% higher or lower than the 2,100 tokens/sec average is normal. Model precision is unchanged – all models continue to use 16-bit original weights. Model output accuracy is likewise unchanged as verified by Artificial Analysis. What fast inference enables The impact of Cerebras Inference’s unprecedented speed is already transforming how organizations develop and deploy AI apps. In pharmaceutical research, Kim Branson, SVP of AI and ML at GSK, says: “With Cerebras’ inference speed, GSK is developing innovative AI applications, such as intelligent research agents, that will fundamentally improve the productivity of our researchers and drug discovery process.” The dramatic speed improvement is game-changing for real-time AI applications, as demonstrated by LiveKit, which powers ChatGPT’s voice mode. As CEO Russ d’Sa explains: “When building voice AI, inference is the slowest stage in your pipeline. With Cerebras Inference, it’s now the fastest. A full pass through a pipeline consisting of cloud-based speech-to-text, 70B-parameter inference using Cerebras Inference, and text-to-speech, runs faster than just inference alone on other providers. This is a game changer for developers building voice AI that can respond with human-level speed and accuracy.” Fast inference is the key enabler for next gen AI applications that leverage more test-time compute for greater model capability. As demonstrated by models like GPT-o1, the ability to perform extensive chain-of-thought reasoning directly translates to breakthrough performance in reasoning, coding, and research tasks. Using Cerebras Inference, models think deeply before responding without the typical minutes-long latency penalties. This makes Cerebras Inference the ideal platform for developers looking to build systems that deliver both greater runtime intelligence and responsive user experiences. Conclusion Today’s 3x performance improvement shows what’s possible when realizing the full potential of the Wafer Scale Engine for inference. At 2,100 tokens per second for Llama3.1-70B, we’ve delivered the equivalent of more than a hardware generation’s worth of performance in a single software release. Our team continues to optimize both software and hardware capabilities, and we will be expanding our model selection, context lengths, and API features in the coming weeks.

Respectfully, you're not thinking big-picture enough. There are LLMs today that are amazing at coding, and when you allow it to iterate (eg. respond to compiler errors), the quality is pretty impressive. If you can run an LLM 3x faster, you can enable a much bigger feedback loop in the same period of time. There are efforts to enable LLMs to \"think\" by using Chain-of-thought, where the LLM writes out reasoning in a \"proof\" style list of steps. Sometimes, like with a person, they'd reach a dead-end logic wise. If you can run 3x faster, you can start to run the \"thought chain\" as more of a \"tree\" where the logic is critiqued and adapted, and where many different solutions can be tried. This can all happen in parallel (well, each sub-branch). Then there are \"agent\" use cases, where an LLM has to take actions on its own in response to real-world situations. Speed really impacts user-perception of quality. reply phito 11 hours agorootparent> There are LLMs today that are amazing at coding, and when you allow it to iterate (eg. respond to compiler errors), the quality is pretty impressive. If you can run an LLM 3x faster, you can enable a much bigger feedback loop in the same period of time. Well now the compiler is the bottleneck isn't it? And you would still need human check for bugs that aren't caught by the compiler. Still nice to have inference speed improvements tho. reply vineyardmike 10 hours agorootparentSomething will always be the bottleneck, and it probably won’t be the speed of electrons for a while ;) Some compilers (go) are faster than others (javac) and some languages are interpreted and can only be checked through tests. Moving the bottleneck from AI code gen step to the same bottleneck as a person seems like a win. reply tjoff 13 hours agorootparentprevIf the speed is used to get better quality with no more input from the user then sure, that is great. But that is not the only way to get better quality (though I agree that there are some low hanging fruit in the area). reply OhNoNotAgain_99 12 hours agorootparentprevTo be honest most LLM's are reasonable at coding, they're not great. Sure they can code small stuff. But the can't refactor large software projects, or upgrade them. reply regularfry 11 hours agorootparentUpgrading large java projects is exactly what AWS want you to believe their tooling can do, but the ergonomics aren't great. I think most of the capability problems with coding agents aren't the AI itself, it's that we haven't cracked how to let them interact with the codebase effectively yet. When I refactor something, I'm not doing it all at once, it's a step by step process. None of the individual steps are that complicated. Translating that over to an agent feels like we just haven't got the right harness yet. reply vineyardmike 10 hours agorootparentprevHonestly, most software tasks aren’t refactoring large projects, so it’s probably OK. As the world gets more internet connected and more online, we’ll have an ever expanding list of “small stuff” - glue code that mixes and ever growing list of data sources/sinks and visualizations together. Many of which are “write once” and leave running. Big companies (eg google) have built complex build systems (eg bazel ) to isolate small reusable libraries within in a larger repo. Which was a necessity to help unbelievably large development teams to manage a shared repository. An LLM acting in its small corner of the wold seems well suited to this sort of tooling, even if it can’t refactor large projects spanning large changes. I suspect we’ll develop even more abstractions and layers to isolate LLMs and their knowledge of the wold. We already have containers and orchestration enabling “serverless” applications, and embedded webviews for GUIs. Think about ChatGPT and their python interpreter or Claude and their web view. They all come with nice harnesses to support a boilerplate-free playground for short bits of code. That may continue to accelerate and grow in power. reply hmaxdml 4 hours agorootparentWhat's your favorite orchestration solution for this kind of lightweight task? reply jeswin 13 hours agorootparentprev> The biggest time sink for me is validating answers so not sure I agree on that take. But you're assuming that it'll always ne validated by humans. I'd imagine that most validation (and subsequent processing, especially going forward) will be done on machines. reply tjoff 13 hours agorootparentIf that is the way to get quality, sure. Otherwise I feel that power consumption is the bigger issue than speed, though in this case they are interlinked. reply threatripper 12 hours agorootparentHumans consume a lot of power and resources. reply croes 11 hours agorootparentThe basic efficiency is pretty high. reply croes 11 hours agorootparentprevAnd who validates the validation? reply exe34 10 hours agorootparentthe compiler/interpreter are assumed to work in this scenario. reply yunohn 12 hours agorootparentprevHow does the next machine/LLM know what’s valid or not? I don’t really understand the idea behind layers of hallucinating LLMs. reply ben_w 12 hours agorootparentBy comparison with reality. The initial LLMs had \"reality\" be \"a training set of text\", when ChatGPT came out everyone rapidly expanded into RLFH (reinforcement learning from human feedback), and now there's vision and text models the training and feedback is grounded on a much broader aspect of reality than just text. reply croes 11 hours agorootparentGiven that there are more and more AI generated texts and pictures that ground will be pretty unreliable. reply ben_w 9 hours agorootparentPerhaps. But CCTV cameras and smartphones are huge sources of raw content of the real world. Unless you want to take the argument of Morpheus in The Marix and ask \"what is real?\" reply croes 8 hours agorootparentSo let’s crank up total surveillance for better auto descriptions of a picture. We aren’t exchanging freedom for security anymore, what could be reasonable under certain conditions, we just get convenience. Bad deal. reply ben_w 6 hours agorootparentThat's one way to do it, but overkill for this specific thing — self-driving cars or robotics, or natural use of smart-[phone|watch|glass|doorbell|fridge], likely sufficient. Total surveillance may be necessary for other reasons, like making sure organised crime can't blackmail anyone because the state already knows it all, but it's overkill for AI. reply yunohn 12 hours agorootparentprevCould you link to a paper or working POC that shows how this “turtles all the way down“ solution works? reply ben_w 11 hours agorootparentI don't understand your question. This isn't turtles all the way down, it's grounded in real world data, and increasingly large varieties of it. reply croes 11 hours agorootparentHow does the AI know it’s reality and not a fake image or text fed to the system? reply ben_w 9 hours agorootparentI refer you to Wachowski & Wachowski (1999)*, building on previous work including Descartes and A. J. Ayer. To whit: humans can't either, so that's an unreasonable question. More formally, the tripartite definition of knowledge is flawed, and everything you think you know has a Munchausen trilemma. * Genuinely part of my A-level in philosophy reply croes 8 hours agorootparentSo we get the same flaws as before with a higher power consumption. And because it’s fast and easy we now get more fakes, scams and disinformation. That makes AI a lose-lose not to mention further negative consequences. reply Workaccount2 4 hours agorootparentSooner or later someone is going to figure out how to do active training on AI models. It's the holy grail of AI before AGI. This would allow you to do base training on a small set of very high quality data, and then let the model actively decide what it wants to train on going forward or let it \"forget\" what it wants to unlearn. reply ben_w 5 hours agorootparentprevNot if you source your training data from reality. Are you treating \"the internet\" as \"reality\" with this line of questions? The internet is the map, don't mistake the map for the territory — it's fine as a bootstrap but not the final result, just like it's OK for a human to research a topic by reading on Wikipedia but not to use it as the only source. reply yunohn 9 hours agorootparentprevI wasn’t expecting your response to be “the truth is unknowable”, but was hoping for something of more substance to discuss. reply ben_w 6 hours agorootparentThen you need a more precisely framed question. 1. AI can do what we can do, in much the same way we can do it, because it's biologically inspired. Not a perfect copy, but close enough for the general case of this argument. 2. AI can't ever be perfect because of the same reasons we can't ever be perfect: it's impossible to become certain of anything in finite time and with finite examples. 3. AI can still reach higher performance in specific things than us — not everything, not yet — because the information processing speedup going from synapses to transistors is of the same order of magnitude as walking is to continental drift, so when there exists sufficient training data to overcome the inefficiency of the model, we can make models absorb approximately all of that information. reply exe34 1 hour agorootparentprevDoes the AI need to know or the curator of the dataset? If the curator took a camera and walked outside (or let a drone wander around for a while), do you believe this problem would still arise? reply croes 11 hours agorootparentprevExactly, validating and rewriting the prompt are the real time consuming tasks. reply fancyfredbot 10 hours agoprevWow, software is hard! Imagine an entire company working to build an insanely huge and expensive wafer scale chip and your super smart and highly motivated machine learning engineers get 1/3 of peak performance on their first attempt.

Are there any significant legitimate uses beyond just spamming AI-generated SEO articles and fake Amazon books more quickly and cheaply? reply Workaccount2 4 hours agoparentThe way things are going it looks like tokens/s is going to play a big role. O1 preview devours tokens and now Anthropic computer use is devouring them too. Video generation is extremely token heavy too. It sort of is starting to look like you can linearly boost utility by exponentially scaling token usage per query. If so we might see companies slowing on scaling parameters and instead focusing on scaling token usage. reply adwn 9 hours agoparentprevHow about just serving more clients in parallel? I don't see why human reading-speed should pose any kind of upper bound. And then there are use cases like OpenAI's o1, where most tokens aren't even generated for the benefit of a human, but as input for itself. reply odo1242 13 hours agoprevWhat made it so much faster based on just a software update? reply anon291 12 hours agoparentEx-cereberas engineer here. The chip is very powerful and there is no 'one way' to do things. Rearchitecting data flow, changing up data layout, etc can lead to significant performance improvements.

Today’s release is the culmination of numerous software, hardware, and ML improvements we made to our stack to greatly improve the utilization and real-world performance of Cerebras Inference. We’ve re-written or optimized the most critical kernels such as MatMul, reduce/broadcast, element wise ops, and activations. Wafer IO has been streamlined to run asynchronously from compute. This release also implements speculative decoding, a widely used technique that uses a small model and large model in tandem to generate answers faster. reply germanjoey 12 hours agoparentprevThey said in the announcement that they've implemented speculative decoding, so that might have a lot to do with it. A big question is what they're using as their draft model; there's ways to do it losslessly, but they could also choose to trade off accuracy for a bigger increase in speed. It seems they also support only a very short sequence length. (1k tokens) reply bubblethink 12 hours agorootparentSpeculative decoding does not trade off accuracy. You reject the speculated tokens if the original model does not accept them, kind of like branch prediction. All these providers and third parties benchmark each other's solutions, so if there is a drop in accuracy, someone will report it. Their sequence length is 8k. reply majke 11 hours agoprevI wonder if there is a token/watt metric.

    "originLink": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd7n3zyp114o",
    "originBody": "Disposable vapes to be banned from June EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock The government plans to introduce legislation to ban the sale of disposable vapes from 1 June 2025 The sale of single-use disposable vapes will be banned in England and Wales from June next year, the government has confirmed. Ministers in England said the move, first announced in January by the previous government but not enacted before the general election, is intended to protect children's health and prevent environmental damage. The government said it had worked closely with the devolved nations and they would \"align coming into force dates\" on bans, with Wales already confirming it will follow suit. Vaping industry leaders have warned the move could fuel a rise in illegal sales of the products. Single-use vapes had been due to be banned in Scotland from April of next year - but the Scottish government has said the ban will now be delayed until 1 June to align with England and Wales. The Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs (Defra) said vape usage in England had grown by more than 400% between 2012 and 2023, with 9% of the British public now buying and using the products. The number of people who vape without ever having smoked has also increased considerably over recent years, driven mostly by young adults. It is illegal to sell any vape to anyone under 18, but disposable vapes - often sold in smaller, more colourful packaging than refillable ones - are a \"key driver behind the alarming rise in youth vaping\", the previous government said when it first set out its plan. Public health minister Andrew Gwynne said banning disposables would \"reduce the appeal of vapes to children and keep them out of the hands of vulnerable young people\". Vaping is substantially less harmful than smoking, but it has not been around for long enough for its long-term risks to be known, according to the NHS. Getty Images The previous government said disposable vapes were a \"key driver\" behind a rise in youth vaping The ban will not apply to rechargeable or refillable devices. Single-use vapes are difficult to recycle and typically end up in landfill, where their batteries can leak harmful waste like battery acid, lithium, and mercury into the environment, the government said. Batteries thrown into household waste also cause hundreds of fires in bin lorries and waste-processing centres every year. Defra estimates almost five million single-use vapes were either littered or thrown into general waste each week last year, a nearly four-fold increase on the year before. In 2022, vapes were discarded containing a total of more than 40 tonnes of lithium, enough to power 5,000 electric vehicles, it said. Defra minister Mary Creagh, whose role focuses on reducing waste in the economy, said disposable vapes were \"extremely wasteful and blight our towns and cities\". Paediatric respiratory consultant Dr Claire Hogg told BBC Radio 5 Live that disposables had \"lead to an absolute epidemic of nicotine addiction and a group of children... who are having disrupted sleep, disrupted concentration and really struggling with problems with addiction\". She said her son had previously vaped and thought the ban was \"brilliant news\" as he had been \"addicted to nicotine through false marketing\" since he was around 14-years-old. Disposable vapes - often priced at about £5 - are usually cheaper upfront than many refillable vape kits - often priced at about £8-12 - and can be bought from non-specialist retailers. But the long-term costs associated with refillable kits are lower than for disposables. Ireland and Belgium have recently outlined plans to ban the products, while countries including New Zealand, Australia, South Korea, India and Brazil already have restrictions in place. How dangerous is vaping? Sharp rise in vaping among young adult non-smokers 'I found my son's vape stash in roof tile - we need this ban' 'Black market' John Dunne, director general of the UK Vaping Industry Association, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that a ban would \"fuel\" illegal sales. \"We have a black market in vaping products already that the authorities can't really keep up [with], so now this is going to be dropped right on their lap as well,\" he said. Mr Dunne said the association had called on the government to alternatively introduce a licensing scheme for retailers and distributors of the products, \"which will include things like mandatory age verification processes\". The government plans to introduce legislation to ban the sale of single-use vapes from 1 June 2025, allowing retailers time to sell their remaining stock. It will cover all single-use vapes, regardless of where they are imported from. Online shops and major retailing platforms will be expected to use \"online takedown procedures\" to stop illicit suppliers when the ban comes into force, the department for health and social care said. The devolved governments have previously announced an intention to bring in similar bans, and the UK government said it was working with them to align the dates on which the bans come into force. Welsh Deputy First Minister Huw Irranca-Davies said introducing the bans on the same date across the nations would enable \"high levels of compliance and consistent approach to enforcement across the UK\". The measure is separate from government plans to end smoking by banning the sale of cigarettes to anyone born after January 2009. Health Secretary Wes Streeting said on Monday a bill to enact that ban would be introduced to parliament before Christmas.

The e-waste involved in that sub-industry must be absolutely horrifying. Tens of millions of tiny little batteries, surrounded in plastic, lingering quantities of nicotine-rich liquids… Glad this is happening. I’ll take the inconvenience on the chin lol reply prophesi 2 hours agoparentI'm not sure how it is in the UK, but in the USA it's also next to impossible to find a disposable vape that doesn't have an insanely high amount of nicotine. If anyone is unfortunate enough to try a disposable as their introduction to nicotine, they'll be as hooked as a pack a day smoker in no time. I switched to vaping after the pandemic and saw in realtime vapes come out with higher and higher nicotine levels, replacing the lower nic vapes on the shelves. The only reason I had to use disposables was that I couldn't get replacement coils & nicotine juice for several months. They can't use traditional shippers, and the services they use vary wildly in quality; I probably still have a shipment gathering dust in a storage warehouse after several failed delivery attempts. For anyone trying to quit smoking, my best advice would be to go to a vape store that has a lot of custom vape equipment and not just peddling disposables. They should be able to tell how much nicotine salt / freebase liquid you should use given your current smoking habits and goals for quitting. reply cyberpunk 2 hours agorootparentI switched to vapes for a while and genuinely my lung health was worse than smoking. In the end it was Allen Carr’s book that got me off them, and it was surprisingly easy. The author died in 2006 so I wouldn’t even feel too bad about pirating it, I’m quite sure he wouldn’t mind. reply ZeroGravitas 1 hour agorootparentOne of the things that stuck with me about that book was the author instructing you not to give it to someone else once you'd quit and to get them to buy their own copy so he may well mind it being pirated from the the grave. reply prophesi 1 hour agorootparentprevYeah at this point, nicotine pouches might be the best smoking alternative. But I'm seeing the same thing happen there. Zyns start at 3mg which is already higher than the usual 2mg for tobacco pouches. Off brands are going as high as 8mg+, and I imagine it'll keep rising as their consumers raise their tolerance. edit: This discussion is really bumming me out; quitting feels hopeless when we're preyed upon like this. reply willy_k 3 minutes agorootparentI was able to successfully use Psilocybin mushrooms as a shortcut to quit vaping, all I did was say out loud to myself that I was done using and when I woke up the next day I just didn’t have that deep need to use it anymore. I still had the thought from time to time, but instead of the next thought being “maybe just a little bit” driven by an immobile subconscious need, I was able to refuse myself with relatively little effort. So if you get too fed up, don’t discount the more “magic” solutions (neuroplasticity seems pretty darn powerful). That being said those types of solutions do produce more or less irreversible change, and that change can and does go in either direction. reply nostrebored 1 hour agorootparentprevMy pet theory is that nicotine itself isn't particularly addictive to adults. I think the combination of additives in cigs is what makes them so hard to quit. I have quit various forms of pure nicotine with no withdrawals over the years, and treat it a bit like caffeine -- a stimulant that I use for a few months at a time before cycling off. The only time I've _ever_ desperately craved a nicotine product was after 2-3 days of smoking cigarettes. When getting on a near-day-long flight, the whole time back I was thinking \"wow, it would be great to have a cigarette right now\" every 5-10 minutes. But agreed on lung health with vaping. Also, my whole upper respiratory tract was in shambles. My throat was so dry, and it made me get sick constantly. reply throwup238 1 hour agorootparentThat’s a pretty well established theory: MAO inhibiters in cigarettes (or produced as a metabolic byproduct of smoking or combustion) cause the nicotine to be more addictive [1].

Imagine how much adulteration goes on, especially with bargain basement liquors and beers. Surely, pure ethanol is not our lone enemy in this fight. reply bragr 2 hours agorootparentprevThis is a bit of a US problem. The UK and many other countries limit the strength and amount of vape juice, so they are weaker and give fewer puffs. There's a lot of evidence that this reduces the addictiveness. reply swores 1 hour agorootparentUK disposables do still tend to be as high as they're allowed, while bottles of liquid come in various lower amounts of nicotine to choose from. reply bragr 1 hour agorootparentThat may be, but the max strength in the US is 2.5x that of the UK. reply tstrimple 1 hour agorootparentprevI was an occasional nicotine vaper, usually when taking a T break. The flavor was alright, and I couldn't feel much if anything from the hits in the 3-5% concentration range for e-juice. I never had problems just putting the device away for weeks at a time while enjoying other vices. I picked up some disposables while traveling and the experience was completely different. The flavor profile was much more rich. Things actually tasted fruity. More like a juice than the hint of a flavor I was used to from the freebase liquids I had tried. It hits far smoother. In addition I got a buzz from nicotine in a way I had never experienced before. I was literally high off my first few strong puffs. I don't get high anymore. But I also can't put it away anymore. After a day without, I'm almost constantly thinking about it. Freebase liquids do absolutely nothing to help divert my attention. Supposedly the nicotine salt vape is also only 5%. But holy shit does it feel different. reply 8f2ab37a-ed6c 2 hours agoparentprevI also noticed that the flavors I'd get in disposables taste a lot more \"chemical\" than the ones you can find for a vape mod. I suspect that people buying them in a pinch makes them a lot less discerning about what ends up in them. reply LordDragonfang 1 hour agorootparentIt's also possibly to do with the fact that disposables are almost universally nic salts, where as mod juices are usually freebase nic, and that can affect the flavor. (Of course, I might be wrong, since it's been nearly a decade since I paid attention to the vape scene) reply ajmurmann 1 hour agoparentprevWould it make more sense to properly tax those negative externalities instead of having some authority just picking one use case as \"bad\"? reply nialv7 1 hour agorootparentIt might work if nicotine wasn't addictive. And because it is, the rational actor hypothesis goes out of the window, and taxing it is just going to hurt poor people who are addicted to nicotine. reply changing1999 1 hour agorootparentprevHow would an additional tax address this? Paying more would hardly reduce usage, and definitely won't incentivize users to dispose of vape pens more responsibly. reply dberst 1 hour agorootparentI can imagine a tax so high that it's effectively a ban, and a tax half that size that might be a compromise between black and white ban/no ban reply zarzavat 1 hour agorootparentI would rather the government outright bans things rather than pseudo-banning them via the back door via taxes. At least then they have to expend an appropriate amount of political capital, and there is a proper amount of debate over it. We had in the UK the sugar tax which was an effective ban on added sugar in soft drinks - you can hardly buy any drink without artificial sweeteners now, all of the old formulations were taken off the market because they were uneconomical. However, it never prior received attention as a ban, it was always described as just a \"tax\". reply jsheard 1 hour agorootparentprevThe UK taxed tobacco to high heaven and I don't think it did much to actually curb use. It's subject to the usual 20% VAT, plus an extra 16.5%, plus a flat £6.33 on 20 packs, so well over half of the sale price of tobacco is just tax. https://www.gov.uk/tax-on-shopping/alcohol-tobacco reply corobo 1 hour agorootparentThe people I know that would be affected by this just get duty free from corner shops under the table now. Last I heard it's around 8 quid for 50g of rolling tobacco instead of £38 buying legit.

If they do, maybe the same model would work for this. reply Symbiote 1 hour agorootparentDenmark's bottle return system receives 92% of bottles and cans. reply tomjen3 1 hour agorootparentprevIt could pay for additional people to clean up the streets, or you have a deposit on them, so that they be returned rather than littered. reply bebrbrhrj 1 hour agorootparentprevI think so but the practical issues are: Tax is one big pool of money and I doubt the money will be used to fix the issues created. A similar idea, carbon taxes and carbon credits trading seemed politically dead at least in my country even though it is a fantastic idea. Edit: what might work is a 5-10 British pound ransom, released on return of the disposible to a recycling centre.

But this was just absurd. I wonder if 30+ years don't the line, if maybe resources are scarcer, we'll think about these and say: \"we were fucking crazy\" reply onlyrealcuzzo 2 hours agorootparentI dunno. The earth is pretty big, and vape batteries are tiny, and we keep finding substitutes. I'm all for reducing waste, but it seems unlikely we'll run out of metals in our lifetimes. Keep in mind, things keep getting more efficient, and rich nations are finally tending toward using LESS per capita. Sure, the poor nations might eventually become rich and the global population has not yet peeked, but there's no reason to assume our materials usage will grow exponentially forever. And, even if you assumed we were going to run out of whatever is in these tiny vape pens - the percentage of all usage going to tiny applications like this is a rounding error. It's not what you would attack if you really wanted to move the needle. You'd probably try to reduce the number of people buying new cars, for example. reply Vegenoid 1 hour agorootparent> in our lifetimes Is the key here. We need to think beyond our lifetimes. We should be treating the earth like we're going to live on it for (tens or hundreds of) thousands of years, because I sure as shit hope we (meaning humans) are going to. Yes, reducing creation of cars would certainly have a much bigger impact, and should be done. But it's also a lot harder than dealing with vapes. Anyway, as far as I understand it, the main reason this is happening isn't happening to reduce waste, it's happening to stop a rise in nicotine consumption in children. Preventing waste is more of a nice side effect. reply dotBen 2 hours agorootparentprevThe UK isn't a 'free country' in the way American's use the term.

Don't you just buy the capsules and put them into your regarchable vape? Or if you want to get exotic e liquid. I would assume that's much cheaper than buying a whole device each time much must cost more $$/££. reply Vegenoid 1 hour agoparentIt's because they are inexpensive, require zero maintenance, zero mess, zero additional equipment needed to maintain and use it. You don't have to understand anything about how it works or is put together. You get to have new colors and styles frequently, you naturally keep up with the trends. If you lose it or break it, it doesn't matter. There's no compatibility between the cartridge and the vape to think about. Basically, because they are as easy as possible and stay trendy by their revolving door nature. reply extr 2 hours agoparentprevIMO the main culprit is the over regulation of semi/non-disposable vapes/nicotine which still require more R&D to make accessible and easy to use for any consumer. This disposables are just plain better because the internals of vapes are finicky. Coils, wicking, batteries, juice, all in a very small package. it’s literally easier to just throw the entire thing away than to worry about the specifics, try to buy the separate components and replace them as they age, etc. It’s why semi-disposable pod systems like juul are also quite successful. reply xelamonster 2 hours agoparentprevRechargeable vape pens are incredibly cheap, and disposables aren't noticeably more expensive overall so the cost difference is insignificant. Couple reasons for a preference (personally don't vape nicotine and I've never cared strongly about disposable vs not): - Disposables won't die on you. Unless you're getting massive carts the battery tends to last the whole time and you never worry about charging. - Guaranteed compatible. I've seen seemingly standard carts not work with certain pens which can be very frustrating. - The standard 510 thread cartridge kinda sucks. I'm not sure if it's a design flaw or a lot of bad manufacturers but they tend to leak and develop blockages. reply bloopernova 1 hour agorootparent> Guaranteed compatible. I've seen seemingly standard carts not work with certain pens which can be very frustrating. The carts with longer mouthpieces just fit in my battery/pen, but yeah the cartridges need to be a standard length too. > The standard 510 thread cartridge kinda sucks.

But yeah length can be an issue and width also, for the ones that wrap around the cartridge to be more compact. reply turndown 2 hours agoparentprevOn box mods(the big vapes you might recall starting to see 10-15 years ago) there is a chamber up top you have to manually fill with nicotine. This can be a bit annoying to do but the real problem is remembering to bring liquid to refill with. That’s really the only negative to the large box mods, other than having to recharge 18650 batteries all the time. But disposables are usually much smaller(easier to hide if you’re in school), use nicotine salts(which are much more potent) and they usually last a long time - sometimes 20k hits. So these aren’t “bad” products, they have a lot of selling points. reply bloopernova 1 hour agoparentprevFor THC, they're cheap and convenient. They allow someone to try vaping without buying what people might think is an expensive \"real\" vape. Even though reusable vapes with 510 cartridges don't really cost much more, lots of people don't know that. I tried a couple, once I found a strain/mix that seemed to work with my nerve and back pain, I bought a reusable vape and use cartridges now. reply Closi 2 hours agoprevNext step they should put a minimum price on non-disposable vapes at £50-£100. reply mgraczyk 2 hours agoprevDisposable vapes aren't legal in the US but they are available everywhere reply progbits 2 hours agoprevOh finally.

Julian Thome collaborationtutorialfeatures Domain Specific Languages (DSL) are small, focused languages with a narrow domain of applicability. DSLs are tailored towards their target domain so that domain experts can formalize ideas based on their knowledge and background. This makes DSLs powerful tools that can be used for the purpose of increasing programmer efficiency by being more expressive in their target domain, compared to general purpose languages, and by providing concepts to reduce the cognitive load on their users. Consider the problem of summing up the balances of different bank accounts in a CSV file. A sample CSV file is provided in the example below where the first column contains the name of the account holder and the second column contains the account balance. name, balance Lisa, 100.30 Bert, 241.41 Maria, 151.13 You could solve the problem of summing up balances by using a general-purpose language such as Ruby as in the code snippet below. Apart from the fact that the code below is not very robust, it contains a lot of boilerplate that is irrelevant to the problem at hand, i.e., summing up the account balances. #!/usr/bin/env ruby exit(1) if ARGV.empty? || !File.exist?(ARGV[0]) sum = 0 File.foreach(ARGV[0]).each_with_index do |line, idx| next if idx == 0 sum += Float(line.split(',')[1]) end puts sum.round(2) Below is an example AWK script that solves the same problem. AWK is a DSL that was specifically designed to address problems related to text-processing. #!/usr/bin/awk -f BEGIN{FS=\",\"}{sum+=$2}END{print sum} The Ruby program has a size of 208 characters, whereas the AWK program has a size of 56. The AWK program is roughly 4x smaller than its Ruby counterpart. In addition, the AWK implementation is more robust by being less prone to glitches that may appear in the CSV file (e.g., empty newlines, wrongly formatted data-fields). The significant difference in terms of size illustrates that DSLs, by being more focused on solving specific problems, can make their users more productive by sparing them the burden to write boilerplate code and narrowing the focus of the language on the problem at hand. Some popular DSLs most software developers use on a regular basis include Regular Expressions for pattern matching, AWK for text transformation or Standard Query Language for interacting with databases. Challenges when designing Domain Specific Languages Prototyping, designing and evolving DSLs is a challenging process. In our experience this is an exploratory cycle where you constantly prototype ideas, incorporate them into the language, try them out in reality, collect feedback and improve the DSL based on the feedback. When designing a DSL, there are many components that have to be implemented and evolved. At a very high level there are two main components: the language lexer/parser and the language processor. The lexer/parser is the component that accepts input as per the language definition which is usually specified specified by means of a language grammar. The parsing/lexing phase produces a syntax tree which is then passed onto the language processor. A language processor evaluates the syntax tree. In the example we saw earlier, we ran both the Ruby and AWK interpreters providing our scripts and the CSV file as input; both interpreters evaluated the scripts and this evaluation yielded the sum of all the account balances as a result. Tools such as parser generators can significantly reduce the effort of lexer/parser development by means of code generation. Sophisticated DSL frameworks such as JetBrains MPS or Xtext also provide features that help implement custom language support in IDEs. However, if present at all, the support for building the language processors is usually limited to generating placeholders functions or boilerplate code for the language components that have to be filled-in by the DSL developer. Moreover, such large and powerful DSL frameworks usually have a fairly steep learning curve so that they are probably a better fit for more sophisticated DSLs as opposed to small, easily embeddable, focused languages, which we refer to as micro languages. In some situations, it may be worth considering working around these problems by just relying on standard data exchange formats such as .toml, .yaml or .json as a means of configuration. Similar to the parser generators, using such a format may relieve some of the burden when it comes to parser development effort. However, this approach does not help when it comes to the implementation of the actual language processor. In addition, most standard data exchange formats are inherently limited to representing data in terms of simple concepts (such as lists, dictionaries, strings and numbers). This limitation can lead to bloated configuration files quickly as shown in the following example. Imagine the development of a calculator that operates on integers using multiplication *, addition +. When using a data-description language like YAML in the example below, you can see that even a small simple term like 1 + 2 * 3 + 5 can be hard to reason about, and by adding more terms the configuration file would get bloated quickly. term: add: - 1 - times: - 2 - 3 - 5 This blog post is focused on the design of micro languages. The core idea is to provide a simple, extensible language core that can be easily extended with custom-types and custom functions; the language can evolve without having to touch the parser or the language processor. Instead, the DSL designer can just focus on the concepts that ought to be integrated into the DSL by implementing interfaces and \"hooking\" them into the core language implementation. Lingo: A micro language framework for Go At GitLab, Go is one of our main programming languages and some of the tools we develop required their own, small, embeddable DSLs so that users could properly configure and interact with them. Initially, we tried to integrate already existing, embeddable and expandable language implementations. Our only condition was that they had to be embeddable natively into a Go application. We explored several great free and open-source (FOSS) projects such as go-lua which is Lua VM implemented in Go, go-yeagi which provides a Go interpreter with which Go can be used as a scripting language or go-zygomys which is a LISP interpreter written in Go. However, these packages are essentially modules to integrate general-purpose languages on top of which a DSL could be built. These modules ended up being fairly complex. In contrast, we wanted to have basic support to design, implement, embed and evolve DSLs natively into a Go application that is flexible, small, simple/easy to grasp, evolve and adapt. We were looking for a micro language framework with the properties listed below: Stability: Changes applied to the DSL should neither require any changes to the core lexer/parser implementation nor to the language processor implementation. Flexibility/Composability: New DSL concepts (data-types, functions) can be integrated via a simple plug-in mechanism. Simplicity: the language framework should have just enough features to provide a foundation that is powerful enough to implement and evolve a custom DSL. In addition, the whole implementation of the micro language framework should be in pure Go so that it is easily embeddable in Go applications. Since none of the available FOSS tools we looked at was able to fulfill all of those requirements, we developed our own micro language framework in Go called Lingo which stands for \"LISP-based Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) in Go\". Lingo is completely FOSS and available in the Lingo Git repository under the free and open source space of the Vulnerability Research Team. Lingo provides a foundation for building DSLs based on Symbolic Expressions (S-expressions), i.e., expressions provided in the form of nested lists (f ...) where f can be considered as the placeholder that represents the function symbol. Using this format, the mathematical term we saw earlier could be written as S-expression (+ 1 (* 2 3) 5). S-expressions are versatile and easy to process due to their uniformity. In addition, they can be used to represent both code and data in a consistent manner. With regards to the Stability, Flexibility and Composability properties, Lingo provides a simple plug-in mechanism to add new functions as well as types without having to touch the core parser or language processor. From the perspective of the S-expression parser, the actual function symbol is essentially irrelevant with regards to the S-expression parsing. The language processor is just evaluating S-expressions and dispatching the execution to the interface implementations. These implementations are provided by the plug-ins based on the function symbol. With regards to Simplicity, the Lingo code base is roughly 3K lines of pure Go code including the lexer/parser, an engine for code transformation, and the interpreter/evaluator. The small size should make it possible to understand the entirety of the implementation. Readers that are interested in the technical details of Lingo itself can have a look at the README.md where the implementation details and the used theoretical foundations are explained. This blog post focuses on how Lingo can be used to build a DSL from scratch. Using Lingo to design a data generation engine In this example we are designing a data-generation engine in Go using Lingo as a foundation. Our data generation engine may be used to generate structured input data for fuzzing or other application contexts. This example illustrates how you can use Lingo to create a language and the corresponding language processor. Going back to the example from the beginning, let us assume we would like to generate CSV files in the format we saw at the beginning covering account balances. name, balance Lisa, 100.30 Bert, 241.41 Maria, 151.13 Our language includes the following functions: (oneof s0, s1, ..., sN): randomly returns one of the parameter strings sX (0out.csv && ./computebalance.awk out.csv' timeout 10 watch -e './rtg script.rtg > out.csv && ./computebalance.rb out.csv' The experiment above shows that the files generated by means of RTG can be properly digested by the AWK script which is much more robust since it can cope with the all generated CSV files. In contrast, executing of the Ruby script results in errors because it cannot properly cope with newlines as they appear in the CSV file.

    "commentBody": "Lingo: A Go micro language framework for building Domain Specific Languages (about.gitlab.com)126 points by adityasaky 23 hours agohidepastfavorite48 comments wahern 19 hours agoWhen I think of a DSL, I think of a language with specialized syntax, grammar, or constructs suited to the problem domain. Think SQL, AWK, or regular expressions. This is just a LISP variant with a typical host-side API for registering function names. I'll never get how merely having function names that reflect the use case, plus a stripped down or absent standard library, qualifies as a DSL. I know some people have long used \"DSL\" in this way, especially among LISP fans, but... I just don't get it. If I want a DSL it's because I want something that gives me, e.g., novel control flow constructs a la AWK, or highly specialized semantics a la regular expressions, that directly suit the problem domain. If I'm not getting that kind of power, why tie myself to some esoteric dependency? Either way you're adopting a tremendous maintenance burden; it better be worth your while. I'm a huge fan of Lua and have used it for many projects in different roles, but never once thought of any particular case as having created a DSL, even when stripping the environment to just a few, well-named, self-describing functions. I don't mean to criticize this particular project. Good code is good code. It's just the particular conceptualization (one shared by many others, to be fair) of what a \"DSL\" means that bugs me. reply lispm 11 hours agoparent> I know some people have long used \"DSL\" in this way, especially among LISP fans generally this would be called an \"embedded domain specific language\". Some languages are relatively flexible to change the syntax. For example Common Lisp has reader macros to change the token syntax and macros to change the Lisp syntax. With that one can create all kinds of embedded languages, incl. domain specific languages (languages which are specific to a special domain). Examples would be embedded logic languages, query languages, rule based languages, languages to describe user interfaces, etc. The Common Lisp standard has a notorious example for that, a complex LOOP construct, which uses a very different syntax: https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_loo... There are other real-world examples out there, for example an embedded domain specific language to describe 3d objects in the domain of parametric CAD, for description of technical things like turbines or other parts of an aircraft. reply LordHeini 9 hours agoparentprevI would agree with your sentiment. This is basically a lib with some extra syntax to parse CSV Files. A 'proper' DSL would require a very specific domain where it is applied to. Like document creation, or solving a certain problem and only that but not much else. Turing completeness is usually not required as well. For example Matlab or LaTex are domain specific as well as SQL. Those are used to do math, create documents or do mangle tables. Imho just renaming forEach to Map to parse CSV files does not fit the bill so the linked example is not that great. This project basically a DSL builder thingy with a text processor demo. As an aside: I am missing the most important thing when it comes to CSV which is configuration of the input. Might be because this is more of an example but it is usually a sign of a lets say more academic project. Working with CSV, is usually a source of a lot of \"good fun\" where many hours can be spent. Because your average CSV is often a SSV or TSV in some ISO that is everything but not UTF8. It usually contains line breaks which have been renamed to funny icons by some combo of tool and operating system. Also there are weird escape character in orders which are not consistent on every row. Also sometimes you have titles sometimes not. Dates make no sense, are language depended and in a weird format the intern made up 10 years ago. And even numbers are weird too, like 12e^-25 or '0.00' or '10.000,0'. Then you get columns which really should be 2 or more, or there are lines which span multiple rows. Ihmo it is way better for robust CSV parsing to have a really low level approach where you rigorously check for everything (and return everything to sender that does not fit). reply randomdata 1 hour agorootparent> I am missing the most important thing when it comes to CSV which is configuration of the input. 1. Given that their stated use-case for this tool is generation of data for testing purposes, why would input configuration be relevant? 2. It doesn't have any CSV-associated features to begin with. If for some reason you wanted to use this for that, you would interact with your own bound Go functions to facilitate working with CSV, just as demonstrated in the article. Within those functions, you can setup any configuration your heart desires. reply kitd 10 hours agoparentprevDSLs don't need to be supported by a separate lexer/parser. Some (for better or worse) use standard formats like yaml or json. Some (ie embedded DSLs) are represented using terms defined in a programming language. Any naming of types, functions or variables that you do while solving a problem in software is creating a \"language\" of terms that are specific to the domain. A well-constructed fluent API can read a lot like what you would call a DSL. A configuration language in YAML is both YAML and a DSL for config. reply BlackFly 10 hours agoparentprevYou might be interested in this classic pdf: http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655/readings/steele.pdf (Growing a language) Without those function names that you talk about, you wouldn't really recognize a language. Those standard library function names give the \"batteries included\" kind of feeling. The size of the community libraries furthers that accessibility and productivity feeling of the language. Furthermore, you can certainly create control flows via libraries--with callbacks specifically--and create any kind of novel branching structure your domain had need of. A good API is a sort of DSL. If it well reflects how you think about the domain and helps you express instructions within that domain. The language can be very different. We experience that in our own language when we hear people talking with heavy use of jargon we don't recognize: they might as well be speaking another language. But overall I agree with you that I would probably save the use of the jargon term DSL for novel syntax targeted at a specific domain. reply creata 15 hours agoparentprev> When I think of a DSL, I think of a language with specialized syntax, grammar, or constructs suited to the problem domain. I think that's too strict. For example, JAX is (imo) an eDSL, but it doesn't have a specialized syntax, grammar or constructs - on the contrary, it's meant to feel just like Numpy. The thing that makes it special is the interpretation of those constructs. reply Archit3ch 10 hours agorootparentJAX isn't an eDSL, because it doesn't obey full Python semantics (namely, changing what a method does at runtime). Mojo just discovered it ain't happening: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41927000 reply skydhash 19 hours agoparentprevI don’t think there’s need to have such strict requirements. No need to invent a whole new paradigm, you can go with the usual ones as long as it works well. More often than not the domain is not that complex or flexible to require a language, it may only requires a few algorithms (libraries) ie even if you do invent a language, few programs will be built with it. You may as well tweak an existing language for a nicer DX reply wbl 16 hours agoparentprevLisp macros can make their own control flow: it's like the relation of LinQ to F#. reply Trufa 19 hours agoparentprevThis is a very good and interesting point, but what if the point itself is to reduce the power and increase things like legibility. If I create this kind of mapped functions DSLs I can assure that things will be done a a certain way vs the borderline infinite possibilities of code. reply czyhandsome 11 hours agoparentprevWell, could you give some good examples of how is lua used in your projects in different roles? I'm curious. reply froh 13 hours agoparentprevlingo is a _framework_ for building your own DSL for your go application. and by DSL they mean \"extension language\". like vimscript or emacs lisp. or guile or python... so you can easily add primitives to your application specific language, in go, specifically. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/vulnerability-research/foss/li... I think this fits nearly with the common understanding \"DSL\" doesn't it? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language reply KPGv2 4 hours agoparentprevYeah. I mean, isn't CSV itself a DSL? It can't execute, but it's a domain-specific markup language for structured data. reply bitexploder 17 hours agoprevDisclaimer: this is a neat project. DSLs are such a trap for most projects that think they need them. Use lua or something off the shelf for scripting. CEL exists for Go and (safely) solves many of the problems you might also want a DSL for. The case for DSLs is often hard to justify in a project that has to be maintained for years. reply randomdata 36 minutes agoparent> CEL exists for Go and (safely) solves many of the problems you might also want a DSL for. Seems like it would be difficult to use for what they are trying to achieve. Lua would be a better fit, however it is noted that they tried it first, but ran into some kind of issue with it. So now Limbo is among the \"off the shelf\" options. reply zelphirkalt 7 hours agoparentprevCEL seems very much in line with the Golang ideology. It looks like CEL doesn't really have any upsides at all, except for being non-turing-complete. It looks like it is more of a convenience food, for people, for whom any other syntax than what they know from mainstream programming languages is \"too adventurous\" or \"too foreign\". As if they cannot be trusted to be able to cope with another syntax. This might even be true, considering the character of Golang itself, which was created as a dumbed down lowest common denominator of several mainstream languages, so that everyone gets it. It was even missing generics for a long time, deeming them to be too complicated. As a DSL CEL is kinda pointless, since it does not create any additional convenience beyond the usual mainstream programming language syntax. It therefore leaves potential on the table, and as a tradeoff appeals to familiarity of syntax. As a configuration language it is usable, probably with reduced risk, compared to using Golang itself (no turing-completeness!). I don't think it actually appeals to anyone, who considers creating a DSL for a good reason. reply xyzzy_plugh 4 hours agorootparentYou're missing the point of DSLs like CEL which is that they can easily be embedded. CEL is quite efficient and supports partial compilation and cost heuristics which makes it very cheap and easy to insert in a hot path that processes arbitrary customer data. reply kristianp 17 hours agoparentprevCEL seems to be for proto-buffers[1], not text? [1] https://github.com/google/cel-spec/blob/master/doc/intro.md CEL-go: https://github.com/google/cel-go reply bitexploder 15 hours agorootparentYes, cel-go. But it is all the same expression language. It is used in a number of places in GCP for example. Attribute based ACLs, and such. reply __turbobrew__ 11 hours agorootparentKubernetes too: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/cel/ reply bezkom 5 hours agoprevThere is already programming language called Lingo, though probably nobody uses it anymore: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingo_(programming_language) reply yayoohooyahoo 3 hours agoparentYou'd think they'd do a quick check on the name before committing to it. I remember using Lingo with Macromedia Director, it was a nice little language reply NAHWheatCracker 1 hour agorootparentYou'd be surprised how people will stick to a name. At my last job, we spent 3 years building an electrical systems product with the same name as an eye scanning company. We had invested in marketing and sales that was practically useless once the executives finally agreed they needed to rebrand. It was the sort of thing that was pointed out on day zero, but the man in charge was too proud of the name. It wasn't even a very good name for our product. And that was a bet-the-company type of choice. Lingo here is just some little library of no import to Gitlab's business. reply allknowingfrog 4 hours agoprevThis is a bit of a tangent, but this is how I would actually solve the problem in Ruby: #!/usr/bin/env ruby require \"csv\" puts CSV.foreach(ARGV[0], headers: true).sum { _1[1].to_f }.round(2) reply wejick 6 hours agoprevUnfortunately the given example doesn't give - mere mortal like me- idea on how this make sense to use. Instead of using whatever scripting language available, or just json. Or probably grule? [1] https://github.com/hyperjumptech/grule-rule-engine reply randomdata 4 hours agoparent> Instead of using whatever scripting language available This is just another scripting language available. It only differs from something like Lua or Javascript in that it claims to have less complexity. Complexity which, while not fully elaborated on, apparently bogged down their efforts when they originally tried using Lua and an embeddable Go engine. reply justinko 4 hours agoprevThe verbosity of “fed through an LLM” articles are becoming unbearable to digest. reply codetrotter 16 hours agoprevNot to be confused with the Lingo programming language that was used in Macromedia Director to create Shockwave content ;) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingo_(programming_language) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Shockwave https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Director reply giancarlostoro 6 hours agoparentWhich is still in use today by hobbyists mainly, but also Habbo Hotel released their old client using their old Lingo code as \"Origins\" it runs as an EXE that embeds the runtime. People are working on emulators that will run it natively on web, and there's a really interesting decompiler for it as well. reply Lyngbakr 20 hours agoprev> Some popular DSLs most software developers use on a regular basis include Regular Expressions for pattern matching, AWK for text transformation or Standard Query Language for interacting with databases. Isn't it Structured Query Language? Or are both variants used? reply shakna 20 hours agoparent> In the early days of the system there was divided preference between Standard Query Language and Structured Query Language but it did not make a whole lot of difference since most people most of the time called it by the acronym SQL. Now the overwhelming but not complete preference is for Structured Query Language. [0] https://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/sql.htm reply Lyngbakr 19 hours agorootparentThanks for that! reply randomdata 9 hours agoparentprevStrictly, it is just SQL. It doesn't stand for anything. The project was originally known as SEQUEL, a fun word play on QUEL (from the Ingress/Postgres camp), but trademark issues saw it later lose the vowels. \"Structured Query Language\" is a so-called backronym. \"Standard Query Language\" fits the pattern as well. As does \"Super Quick Lookup\", if you want to have some fun with it. reply ofrzeta 12 hours agoprevI don't know. Last update two years ago when the project was first posted. Is it worth spending time on it? reply randomdata 10 hours agoparentWhat's missing that would necessitate an update? reply Alifatisk 21 hours agoprevRegarding the Ruby example, why did they use Float(\"...\") instead of #to_f? reply intelekshual 20 hours agoparentProbably because `Float()` is stricter and will raise an error if the string isn't a valid number, whereas `#to_f` will silently return 0.0 or do a best-effort conversion (e.g. \"1.2abc\".to_f => 1.2) reply Alifatisk 10 hours agorootparentOhhh! reply dlock17 22 hours agoprev [–] This seemed like nuclear overkill for most problems I can think of. And where it should be used, I can't imagine you can't find a pre existing language (Cuelang maybe) instead.

Also, this should have a (2022) in the title. reply tony-allan 21 hours agoparentI think that a Domain Specific Language without the scaffolding of a language like python to generate test data is a great use case. You have a specific DSL to generate test data and store code written using your DSL with your test cases. You then have a security model that separates the responsibilities of the test team from that of other developers. The team can generate many test cases in a secure environment. You could then seek community input into your test processes with having to worry about rogue code. reply randomdata 10 hours agoparentprev> Also, this should have a (2022) in the title. Is there something about the current state of world that has invalidated some or all of the content in the article? reply danmur 7 hours agorootparentWhy have a title at all? reply jerf 20 hours agoparentprevIt is nuclear overkill for most problems you can think of. But when you hit a problem that you need something like this for... you need something like this. The attempts to get around it or avoid it or do some unbelievably hacky thing leads to piles and piles of terrible, terrible code. In 2024, though, I do try very hard to embed my DSLs in an existing serialization. It doesn't always work out, but, the case they show of directly embedding an AST into YAML is a worst-case scenario. In real life I've done things like specify a particular field carries an expr[1] expression to do that sort of thing, and then the structure of the rest of the file just follows normal serialization format. [1]: https://github.com/expr-lang/expr , but I'm sure many static languages have something like this. If you don't know one, it's a good tool to put in the belt in case you ever need it. reply dlock17 4 hours agorootparentTo be clear, my problem isn't with requiring a single DSL, it's with writing so many DSL's at work that there's need for a DSL writing framework to crap them out even faster. At what point do you sit back and ask, is there a way to reduce complexity here? Is it not until you're joining a team where the last guy made dozens of DSL's for all his tools? That was the main reason I was expecting more than a few real world use cases rather than generalized examples and no examples from their workplace. reply randomdata 1 hour agorootparent> is there a way to reduce complexity here? Yes, you can generate your test data in the host language. That dramatically reduces upfront complexity. But that doesn't come free. Now it is not easily transferrable to other languages. If you recall rsc's somewhat recent talk on testing, they benefited greatly by being able to use similar DSLs from other projects in tests to ensure feature parity. It can be a huge boon to have your test data scripts in an \"agnostic\" language for 30 years down the line when you are no longer working in the same environment. Tradeoffs, as always. > I was expecting more than a few real world use cases Maybe that's the only use-case they know of? The project was clearly built for a specific purpose. That's not to say that it cannot be found useful elsewhere, but that doesn't mean they have found it to be. If someone else finds it useful in other applications, I'm sure they'll write their own document about it. That's what the web is for, after all. reply 0xCMP 19 hours agoparentprevI wouldn't think of it for generating configuration. The example given implies they use it for fuzzing program inputs. It's purpose in the article is simple: generate a CSV with two columns and floats. However, a DSL could be made to do anything. Generate particular kinds of PDFs, Excel files, intentionally incorrect CSV/TSV files, zipbombs, and etc. All that is required is to wire it up in the Go side of things and then write a script to make use of it. reply kubectl_h 17 hours agoparentprev [–] > I was expecting a section at the end where they demonstrate which services need a new language written just for it's configuration, but nope, just general examples. Heh that was my first instinct as to why they built this as well but more for providing ergonomic ways to generate k8s objects for complex gitlab specific CRDs. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
