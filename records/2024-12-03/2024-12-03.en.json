    "originBody": "Return to home Facebook's Little Red Book Dec 2, 2024 In 2012, Facebook was facing a challenge as it hit a billion users: rapid scaling was outpacing their ability to maintain focus on the big picture. Narratives became fragmented, and with them, the essence of what tied the company to Zuckerberg's vision began to fade. They made a bold move by codifying their story into a Little Red Book. Which they distributed internally. Created by designer Ben Barry, the book distilled Facebook’s ethos—breaking things, thinking big, and moving fast—into a manifesto. More than a handbook, it was a declaration of identity, solving the problem of scaling culture during explosive growth. It reminded employees: This is who we are. This is why we exist. Few copies remain today, and most of the digital versions floating around the internet are low resolution. After years of sporadically checking eBay, I found a copy. It arrived at our office a few weeks ago. Determined to create a better digital version, I reached out to a few public libraries and universities in NYC. One gave me access to their $150,000 DT-BC100 scanner. This isn’t just a scan of a book; it’s a testament to the power of storytelling. Stories build belief. They turn strangers into teammates, teams into movements, and movements into businesses that can change the world. So here it is, the highest quality publicly available version of the Little Red Book, preserved for anyone curious about how great companies scale culture and ideas.

None of the images and ideas conveyed in this book (printing press, cave art, fall of the Berlin wall, Arab Spring, particle accelerators) were outlandish for the time and space it was printed in. Tech was all about optimism and idealism. Everyone in silicon valley knew they were changing the world for the better, and tech was the missing piece all along. Silly people would finally all stop fighting and get along now that they had Facebook and Twitter and iPhones. reply doright 5 hours agoparentI think this is the reason why I feel so much nostalgia for the sort of 2012-era vectorflourish sort of aesthetic. Look at the first Google image result for \"Zune\" for an example[1]. Gradient-type stenciling with references to the organic world and a sort of optimism implied overall (the same sort that proponents of Frutiger Aero talk about but this is not quite the same thing, I think it's somewhat flatter but not ultra-flat like everything is now). This aesthetic represents to me the dead tech-optimist future we were promised but never got. It's a \"ghost future.\" Mark Fisher had a lot of interesting writing about this phenomenon as applied to music, termed hauntology[2]. It's about how some genres/labels of music (like Ghost Box) were characterized as a misremembered past that was perceived as more rosy than in reality. I suspect but cannot be certain that \"vectorflourish\" aesthetics like those and/or simple but not condescendingly dumbed-down ones like Bootstrap 1.0 will experience a resurgence in the coming decade, the same as the \"Windows XP\" aesthetic of ten years prior had a while ago, in the name of reclaiming such a lost future. With today's CSS I imagine it would be much easier to recreate such an aesthetic than in the past when mostly you had to use Photoshop to create all the raster assets.

It is just absurd to see Facebook try to associate themselves with the fall of the Berlin Wall. It reminds me of the 1990s ad campaign Apple used to have about \"thinking different\" featuring people like Einstein, Martin Luther King, and Gandhi, none of whom obviously used Apple's products. reply 1vuio0pswjnm7 13 hours agorootparent\"But except for the Arab Spring of 2011 none of these events had anything whatsoever to do with social media\" There is an argument I saw made in a documentary that the Arab Spring also had nothing to do with social media. reply mu53 6 hours agorootparentI watched the arab spring from online, and I am certain that tech companies were actively involved in fomenting the various rebellions.

Noble's \"The Religion of Technology\" is a quite good read to see how we arrived at this from monastic origins. There are some points in the book that after reading became extremely obvious, like the belief that technology can (and will) overcome human limitations, restoring us to a perfect/divine state; that technological progress is the path to transcend physical and moral limits (all of which we see in the techno-optimism of the tech industry). It's been around forever, we are just seeing a new dress up of it with the information age, the way tech \"leaders\" speak has been mocked to no end in Silicon Valley because of how insufferably close to religion all of this is... reply nitwit005 19 hours agoparentprevYou mean, the marketing was all about that. Even non-technology companies stole a bunch of marketing buzzwords from this era that are still in use today. reply mattmanser 19 hours agoparentprevThis site is from that era, a bunch of posters on this thread are registered from then or before. There was plenty of cynicism in tech back then too, plenty of posters who always complained about 'micro$oft'. How Oracle had been corrupted, etc. What seems to be different now is that the optimism hype fades quicker. Back then Google kept it going for years. Recently things like Tesla and OpenAI the optimism gave way to the harsh reality of greed a lot quicker. reply ern 18 hours agorootparentThere was plenty of cynicism in tech back then too, plenty of posters who always complained about 'micro$oft'. I think the anti-Microsoft sentiment (outside of some internet forums, and justified IE6 hate) had been dialled back by the early 2010s. .NET was a thing, they were post-Gates, post-antitrust, making significant efforts at developer outreach. Windows 7 was a hit. Despite working in the Microsoft ecosystem, I didn't feel trapped, and the walled garden was coming down, with awareness of non-Microsoft technologies being widespread. reply pyrale 13 hours agorootparentprevThere was always a next wave, a new movement to embody ideals. I’m not sure what the fresh utopia is these days. reply tdeck 19 hours agoparentprevI think the movie The Social Network was responsible for bringing this into the public consciousness, and constructing it to some extent. It kind of framed the discussion about the software industry for at least a decade. reply nativeit 11 hours agorootparentI think that’s maybe reversed. The Social Network was telling a narrative through a contemporary lens, and part of the reason it became a phenomenon was because it hit on something people were already feeling. It may have helped a lot of people better articulate their own unease. I know I had already identified the anxieties in myself, and started discussing the potential negative impacts to social cohesion and political polarization, as these things were already fairly stark to anyone who was interested in exploring them. Although, I am not a CS grad, but rather Media Studies, so I had been primed to look for unrest and fraying of social fabric as a result of the communications revolution of the internet, just generally. So maybe mine isn’t the best benchmark perspective on this after all? reply actionfromafar 18 hours agorootparentprevFeels like we watched different movies. reply bbqfog 21 hours agoparentprevnext [6 more] [flagged] JumpCrisscross 21 hours agorootparentOP didn’t make a statement about the facts on the ground, but the culture and myths of the time.

And there is nothing wrong with collective narratives.) reply cdchn 20 hours agorootparentNarrative is the correct word for what this is. This is what Facebook leadership wanted to persuade the Facebook rank-and-file that _this_ is what they're about.

We still dont see it yet today. Not fully reply ajkjk 17 hours agoparentprevMost of us felt exactly the same way about it then that we do now. The only difference is that fewer people take that cringy utopianism seriously now. reply fragmede 16 hours agorootparentIs that based on any sort of actual data or are you just going off the scientifically supported totally unbiased data collection method known as ~:/vibes/:~ ? I imagine the future looked pretty bleak during world war I, and then again during II, and maybe something else during the civil rights movement, or there was also the cold war. Cynics and optimists have existed since there was something to have feelings about. what's different about today to say that the cynics outweigh the optimists, in a way they never could in the past before? reply ajkjk 2 hours agorootparentOf course it's vibes. How would you even get data on that? But just going through life, most of the people you meet now, or met then, are not silicon-valley idealists. Maybe they were if you lived in Silicon Valley? Living elsewhere, everyone I ever knew rolled their eyes at it, and maybe transparently parroted it for the money if their job required it. But every once in a while you came across a person who seemed to genuinely believe the corporate kool-aid they were saying, usually working at Facebook or Microsoft. These people are horrifying: completely manipulated, willing to not only say but believe whatever it took to, basically keep earning their money. I have no doubt that if the winds in America turned towards some kind of communisty cult-of-personality thing they would be first in line: a true believer of anything that it's convenient to believe in. (and I'm thinking of the USSR-type of cult here, the type described in Milan Kundera novels here. Trumpism is rather different.) reply incog_nit0 5 hours agoprevAs a jaded 40+ year old developer this got me choked up. I remember that optimistic view we all had of technology in our youth. For me the optimism was a little earlier than 2012 so maybe it goes hand in hand with being young and less experienced (jaded?). I agree with some of the other commenters that a corporate structure makes altruistic goals like these impossible. Only Wikipedia and The Internet Archive for me carry that feeling of goodwill still. I think OpenAI going from non-profit to profit will similarly erode the product as market incentives push it further away from what benefits the user most.

They just generally don't have time to get into silly arguments about it on HN. reply dowager_dan99 19 hours agorootparentYou're right - but also very wrong. People can be optimistic while still having an existential crisis about what they see/feel is happening. That's what makes them believe they can influence and change the world, and why they even try. What we're seeing in tech today feels like it started in the 80's, and before that point computers, etc. were viewed by some as the downfall of humankind and by others the saviour. reply UncleOxidant 19 hours agorootparentOh, man, I can still remember how when barcodes started showing up on products in the late 70s that there were people saying it was the mark of the beast or a precursor to it or that it was some government ploy. reply int_19h 10 hours agorootparentThey still say that, by the way. reply pie420 18 hours agorootparentprevi'm sure there's lots of tech optimists in absolute numbers, but my personal experience in the bay area has been that a vast majority of my friends in tech and tech adjacent have become highly pessimistic of the current tech landscape, AI, VR, etc. reply wyclif 17 hours agorootparentAll you have to do to see this is to look at how some of the biggest tech CEOs and moguls like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Zuckerberg, Elon, Jeff Bezos, etc. treat giving their children screens to babysit them.

IMHO social media heralded the beginning of the end, although no-one knew that at the time. A lot of the 90s nostalgia is just the same rose-tinted glasses as all generations experience, but I think in this one dimension it truly felt a lot better back then. reply alex1138 20 hours agorootparentI have a serious problem with calling everything social media and (more importantly) how it spells doom for this that and the other If you want to criticize specific companies - yeah.

As well as being experimented on (A/B tests) for dubious reasons. reply aprilthird2021 18 hours agorootparentBut, the data brokerage economy was the only way such a thing could connect people from different economic backgrounds, etc. Without that, to pay for social media, the options would have been paid apps, which would never have had the escape velocity to be what current social media is today reply NetOpWibby 18 hours agorootparent> the data brokerage economy was the only way such a thing could connect people For people profiting from that economy, of course. For everyone else? Not at all. > what current social media is today ...the social media of today is undesirable. People would absolutely pay for social media if the product was good enough. In fact, I believe we're heading towards that future[1]. \"Free\" search exists. However, so does paid[2]. The idea that companies need hyper growth, \"escape velocity,\" or whatever to succeed is outdated. --- [1]: https://socii.network [2]: https://kagi.com reply babypuncher 19 hours agorootparentprevI think it boils down specifically to the social media pivot towards algorithmically curated feeds designed to prioritize engagement above all else. Platforms that did not make this change in the '10s still feel much healthier than dumps like Facebook and Xitter. One of the big selling points of Bluesky right now is that it does not do this and that is why it feels so much like 2010-era Twitter. reply wormius 17 hours agorootparentprev(apologies for the ridiculous length of this, and totally understand if you pass up reading the comment, it's also a bit incoherent/lazy/quickly put together) ---- To me, the real problems are the following. All related to \"social media\" but not social media in itself. 1) The Stream (timeline, whatever you want to call it). Instead of static single \"pages\" that linked to each other as separate entities with their own internal logic, everything became one flow, and more importantly \"impermanent\" (e.g. the way we think of \"content\" is no longer about an archive or repository of things, but rather, moment to moment). A reverse chronological sorting isn't bad in itself. Even the old long form setups like blogging and livejournal etc all supported this method of viewing content - but add in the following issues for a perfect storm. 2) Limited text length (blame Twitter and Facebook, and item 3). By limiting the length of text we create another \"short attention span\" mindset. Twitter, by it's origin, did have a specific need for short text due to its SMS origin. W/FB - the old 420 char entries was limit to what one can say and encourages short, quick, non-discursive entries. This may have been prudent both to reduce data retention costs and keep people \"engaged\" (though I don't think the side-effects of this were intentional at first)... This helps to feed the short dopamine burst/feedback. Neither of these were intended for deep discourse. 3) iPhone (and Android; But, frankly it was the iPhone that really got the phone and modern style of apps/ecosystem to where we are now). Having a smaller screen that was \"always on\" helped to push short text & images instead of longform content, plus the instant feedback loop, wherever you were. 4) \"Always On\" internet via small devices vs \"Log In\" standalone bulky systems. Instead of coming home to a computer as a separate space that you had to intentionally log into (in dial up days; or at least turn on in cable/fiber days), we no longer had to set aside a sort of \"sacred place\". The space no longer being localized, it was everywhere. While this is part of item 3, the form factor of 4 meant that longer form content is still easy to produce whereas with the form factor of 3 means interaction is limited and more difficult to use due to the limitations of onscreen text/keyboards (though advances made it easier, it's still not the same as sitting down and writing a big ass blog post). 4) The death of \"blogging\"/Google Reader. While blogs exist and come and go in fashion, Google killing reader really was a sort of deathknell. This was more due to the rise of \"social media\" though, not a precursor. But it helped to cement that long-form content was \"dead\". Blogs still exist, but aren't near as popular. 5) Images and Embedding/Walled Gardens: The removal of easy interactivity between platforms locking people in to the systems. While in some ways this is a nice convenience (take a URL and past into FB and BAM there's the image all formatted nicely (usually)) - unlike say Livejournal where you still had to type in the img src tags (or use the visual editor that would pop up a window for you to paste the url, that would, after saving/posting the page, would render the image). Sharing memes and other content with a \"share\" button meant you no longer had to create the content, you could just share what someone else said if you thought it was funny, were angry about it, etc. Meme replication become much less intellectual and lazy. \"Engagement\" didn't come to mean actual long thoughtful replies, but just an emotive \"click\" on an emoji to signal ones preferences towards said content. No need to discuss. Sure the option to do so was there, but who has the time when the internet is always on and there's always more content. 6) \"The Algorithm\" - that which keeps the \"engagement\" happening and as fast and deep as possible. Just one more click. One more hit of interaction. Keep the people \"engaged\" as long as possible on a platform. Of course, long form still exists, and forums like HN allows for a better more thoughtful input on these things. But HN isn't really \"social media\". I'd consider blogs and similar forms a proto-social-media (or, with livejournal, honestly I'd consider it the original social media, but without all the algorithmic bullshit that let you organically find people with similar interests). Finally - I think the drive of FB to have everyone put everyone they know IRL and the ease of \"add all your friends from your contacts\" makes that also much easier. By adding IRL people, it changes the dynamic. When a lot of us came online, we were looking for an escape FROM the people IRL. We wanted a new space, away from \"out there\". Eternal September, the normies invaded. They were everywhere, and at all times. And people add them because it's rude not to. And the escape that the online world provided with similar minded people you were hoping to find was reduced back to the friction of \"the real world\" and the same fights. Note that alone isn't bad in itself. A bubble is also a bad thing. But further: 7) Ideological Techno-utopianism that doesn't take into account all the corporate power behind the algorithms, the data sharing, and the means of keeping engagement (by rage-baiting, bad-faith-actors, etc...) I used to be one of them, I used to crow about JPB's \"Declaration of Cyberspace Independence\" in the 90s. Even until maybe 2015 I had hopes. But slowly I began to realize these architectures amplify the worst tendencies of social interaction, purposefully or not. My point with the 90s utopianism is that this Red Book reads like it's 20 years out of date, even by the time it was written, but maybe not. Maybe it just took time for the iPhonization/SocialMedia effects to take root and alter society on the level it has. \"Convenience is the enemy\". I don't know the answer, frankly. I know there are a lot of people who try to bring back \"the old days\" with things like indieweb movement and small shell accounts for kids to try out what the old dial up world was like, and people get interested, but the mass pull of the large places is too great. The power of having an audience (which is the magic of social media - that stream makes it EASY for everyone to just dip their foot in and out whenever they want another nibble from the Dopefish^TM on their feet). There's the tipping point where everyone's friends finally jump ship, this happened with Livejournal and Myspace over to Facebook. Or now Twitter/X to Bluesky. Early adopters watch as the masses come to their little place, sometimes they are happy about it, but other times they see what they thought of as \"their\" space now invaded by an outside culture. Bluesky probably not so much since it's still quite like Twitter, and most of the people coming in are from Twitter, but for other places there are cultural shifts. Another big change I can think of is how Reddit went from a pretty technical place early on to one full of lazy bro joking when Digg users migrated en masse, and the vibe shifted radically even though Reddit was more bountiful with content. Some of this will always be a tradeoff (it's called Eternal September for a reason after all), but some of this are design choices. I wish I could say that those designing these things honestly have the best interest of society at heart, but after watching enshittification play out the past decade+ it really feels like good intentions don't mean shit and a lot of hard work needs to go into making a productive place. It helps when engaged community members are helping run things (whether good reddit mods, or mods on metafilter, or people like dang here on hackernews). Free for all media isn't bad, and I'm not saying every site needs to have mods, etc... But... It does seem like people who have an intentional community and a vibe they are trying to retain can help inculcate a better social atmosphere than shoving everyone into a clowncar walled garden and expecting civil society (especially when algorithms feed on making those dopamine hits for engagement). reply hex4def6 11 hours agorootparentI agree with all of this, but would add: The \"social media\" we see isn't the entire landscape. There are lots of small communities hanging out in spaces like unpopular subreddits, random internet forums, discord servers. It's just the 10GW burning sun that is popular social media can feel like it drowns that all out. And, I think there's a bit of a nagging feeling of irrelevance that can creep in when you're in these niches. In the old days, you were small groups exploring the uncharted. You were in the minority because you were part of a group of pioneers, and I think there was a sense of optimism and excitement around that. I think a lot of the magic is gone precisely because tech is now ubiquitous and mainstream. I can't help but wonder if it's my nostalgia as well, but I feel like 1995 - 2005 was the golden decade. It was at the point that technology was actually good enough to enable a lot of stuff (broadband, large storage media, etc), but it was still enough in its embryonic state that the novelty was still there. reply disqard 4 hours agorootparentprevWow! This really captures several key facets of what's going on. Thank you for making time to write all of that. P.S.

There just aren't any articles written about them. reply PaulHoule 19 hours agorootparentFrom the viewpoint of developer culture I think Facebook is better night and day than Google. Google's culture is hire 15 geniuses from the Ivy League with 130+ IQ and make them fight with a 40 minute C++ build and a balky Kubernetes culture because \"we only hire the best\"; YouTube and the advertising system are a money printing machine, the team works for 3.5 years at something that get canceled at the last minute. Facebook is much more oriented towards greasing the skids with the goal that a fresher developer would be able to push a change to a shared development system the first day on the job. Look at React vs Flutter. Like Microsoft, Google is thrashing around looking for \"the next big thing\", sometimes like a mindless beast. I've met person after person who told me that they went there because they believed they could make an impact and came to the conclusion within a year that they couldn't make any impact at all. Facebook on the other hand is still run by the founder and it is pushing hard to develop a technology that he believes in even if the rest of us don't. It's a riskier strategy than Microsoft or Google who are likely to stumble on another multibillion dollar business despite themselves. reply longdustytrail 15 hours agorootparentWhen I started at Facebook one of things everyone did during orientation was to put up a diff changing the default text of the search bar at the top of the homepage. This was a good way to familiarize people with the end to end flow of making changes. They didn’t say this explicitly but I think it was also intended to give people a “holy shit” moment when you realize that your silly code change is one button press away from 10 figure page views. The idea was you make the change, take a screenshot of the result on your dev instance, get it stamped by your “mentor” and then abandon it. AFAIK this had been going on for a while before I got there.

What's Facebook got? reply dartharva 2 hours agorootparentWas thinking the exact same thing. My hypothesis is that Facebook is behind because just as the Red Book suggests, its overall culture has been to build things primarily for people (freeloaders), and not for enterprises (who are actually the ones paying) like Microsoft (originally) and Google (eventually) do. If you look at Microsoft and Google, a lot of their garage projects are to build products that are useful to enterprises first and are hence more successful because it's easier to bring in cash with them. Their end-user products, meanwhile, eventually end up getting extinguished. reply adamontherun 16 hours agorootparentprevOrion reply dowager_dan99 19 hours agorootparentprevI agree, but you don't get to weigh everything out on a scale and be measured by the balance - even if you could.

Some practices like reading the design proposal doc before starting the discussion about it looks right in general sense, but it usually turns out that almost all people who are invited to these meetings don't actually read that doc (instead are busy working on their tasks) or don't really have the depth to understand what's written in the doc in 15-30 mins. So what ends up happening is a lot of these meetings end up being dominated by whoever is the top dog (usually the guy with higher level in the room) in that meeting and the rest of the attendees end up listening to his/her opinion without much challenge (because most are intent on just getting out of that meeting). The whole 2+ years I was there (left because of 3-days RTO), I felt like it was a cult and some people seem to drink the kool-aid (or they are good at pretending to like the culture), but some like me, who are more skeptical, don't. reply wnolens 14 hours agorootparentI actually think this is one of the few (only?) good Amazon practices. Anyone who can't grok the doc in 30 mins is unlikely to ever open it, and if they do and spend a few hours on it, chances are they don't have much to add and it only served to educate themselves. Instead, you give it your best shot, surrounded by others which helps to focus/eliminate distraction and then get to listen to someone with far more depth critique it - and you get to learn their framing and about a ton of nuance you would never have taken away otherwise. reply ChrisMarshallNY 19 hours agoparentprevMaybe they should shop here: https://despair.com/collections/demotivators reply tdeck 19 hours agorootparentWow I remember seeing these in the 2000s.

It doesn't discount other narratives, such as villain narratives, where FB could have the best or worst of intentions and the outcomes are what we know them to be today regardless. Truth, on the other hand, is reserved for when the dust has settled, the facts are seldomly disputed, and are corroborated. Truth doesn't even need to be precise, it just needs to be accurate.

Twitter was cooler. Myspace was more money. So facebook took a page out of their platforms. In 2012, facebook went to Washington DC. In 2016, Washington DC went to facebook. When did facebook change? When zuck lost control of it after sandberg came on board. When did zuck get control? When zuck changed to be in alliance with the master plan… which was take control of the world… politically. Remember zuck running for election? reply ninth_ant 20 hours agorootparentOh my god, no. Zuck had — and I believe still has — complete control of the company. Demonizing Sandberg and lionizing Zuckerberg is a complete disservice to reality. It was the focus on growth and not money that ruined everything. Many changes occurred in this period. I was there. A big change is that ads became profitable. I think it’s fair to say this change was sudden. Facebook went from being scrappy and underfunded to being wealthy and powerful. At the same time, the growth had eclipsed competitors and Google Plus came and went. The media tone and coverage changed from “oh this startup is doing neat stuff” to a point concern for data privacy and the implosion of journalism revenue. So they became a lot more influential culturally. Being suddenly wealthy and influential but with a cultural mentality of being a scrappy and upstart— something this book accurately reflects — lead to hubris. The focus on hypergrowth which had served them well from a small startup — under the umbrella of this hubris — led to events like the Cambridge Analytica disaster. Insufficient care was being placed on how data could be collected and misused by others, growth took priority. This focus on Hypergrowth meant that changes that responded well in metrics got pushed. The longer-term damage of people not enjoying their experiences wasn’t a high enough ranked metric compared to engagement and user metrics. None of this was Sandberg’s fault. She was an extremely competent manager and is brilliant. Absolutely she was instrumental in leading Facebook to profitability but this push wasn’t a big factor in their decline. Instead, Facebook got too big way too fast and the employees and Zuck didn’t have the mindset shift needed to consider everything as it was happening. Yes, money ruined everything eventually — but that came later. The most crucial damage had already happened — people gave up on trust that Facebook could handle their data responsibly, and trust that they’d have a good experience on the site. I could go on but that’s enough. reply nashashmi 8 hours agorootparentThe points you illustrated is part of what I think caused Zuckerberg to lose control: hyper growth, fast money, an emerging market of personalized ad tracking. Sandberg being the more experienced manager steered the company well enough during this time but in a direction that I don’t think Zuckerberg felt at home with. Hence This red book was a way to bring back some of his spirits. I also think so much potential for political influence had a weight on facebook but was not in the roadmap from Zuck’s POV. But it surely was for Sandberg because she had already been at Google witnessing the power of influence. Her husband’s own successes with SurveyMonkey emphasized some of that. This success+money+potential+(emerging ad tech) for facebook combined with a young startup spirit led to many scenarios that young Zuck was not prepared for. It definitely steered the company away from its founding vision. The company was suddenly infused with professionals that did not embody the spirit. And Zuck was quietly observing during this period. Today, he looks around FB and says that things need to change. “And if people are not happy about this, then I am ok with them finding something else.” (i am paraphrasing). Zuck has doubled down on a different vision now: Oculus VR. It seems his desire for FB social networking has plateau’d. reply cruffle_duffle 18 hours agorootparentprev> The most crucial damage had already happened — people gave up on trust that Facebook could handle their data responsibly, and trust that they’d have a good experience on the site. I think it was also that people were beginning to see the consequences of “over sharing” with people you’d never normally share things with. The vision of connecting everybody sounds great but not everybody needs, wants or even should hear everything everybody else says. And once such a realization comes about, away goes the linear timeline and in comes a more algorithmic approach. Suddenly your own posts get algorithmiclly ranked, sorted and filtered by every person on your friends list. And to get your post to show up on their feed you have to please an algorithm first in order to get permission. Thus comes a whole host of negative social interaction and toxicity. I dunno. Maybe the decline of things like Facebook are simply because society “figured out through lived experience” what the end game of a tool like facebook looks like. reply ninth_ant 16 hours agorootparentYou’re right about how this decline happened. But encouraging people to share to the widest audience was another aspect where short-term growth of metrics was prioritized over long-term health of the platform.

I think I’ve become some variety of techno-determinist pessimist. We are what technology lets us be, including when it comes to ethics and government. And major inventions aren’t guaranteed to push the space of the possible in the right direction—but neither can we avoid these changes, as effectively sounding the alarm early enough to matter, while also correctly calling which are bad and how they’re bad, is too hard to practically happen. Freedom’s a fleeting gift of circumstance, and the world is a machine none of us control and that’s often bad and sometimes destroys important things, I guess is where I’m at now. I’d definite press a button to permanent un-invent the Internet, if someone put it in front of me. reply Nasrudith 19 hours agoparentprevTools which are not invented cannot be used for good, there is some logic behind that. It is necessary but not sufficient for good. There is also fundamentally a tension between freedom and good. Since being free to use technology also includes being able to use it for evil. Not to mention the track record of trying to enforce \"goodness\" has been less than promising historically. And that is before the inherent fundamentals of dual use.

I started reading the book and began to feel rage so I stopped after about 20 pages. Is it the most self-unaware book or just people trying their hand at PR? reply com2kid 22 hours agoparentThis was 2012. There was still hope and optimism in the tech space. The Internet had helped overturn powerful regimes and given voice to the disenfranchised. There was the idea that person to person public discourse could resolve many societal problems. Smartphones had exploded just 6 years prior and they were already making inroads into traditionally underserved and neglected communities around the world, helping farmers improve yields and young women become self sufficient so they could escape forced marriages. The idea that we could join together and share ideas and make the world a better place isn't a wrong idea, it is just one that got subverted once it was realized that inciting anger in users lead to more usage and thus more ad impressions. reply evanelias 20 hours agorootparentSome additional context: morale at Facebook was relatively poor around this time period, partially due to the disappointing stock performance right after the IPO, as well as a one-time company-wide reduction in bonuses a bit after that. So parts of this book may have been intended to help inspire a workforce that was becoming slightly disgruntled over compensation. fwiw they were still giving the red book to all new hires in ~mid 2013. Personally at the time I found parts of it to be interesting from a \"company telling its own history\" perspective, and other parts to be extremely cringe-inducing. That said, I'm sometimes a grumpy cynic, and I'm also familiar with some random rare aspects of FB history due to previously working for Harvard IT. (I started working there a year after Zuckerberg dropped out, so didn't have any overlap, but some of my colleagues there were directly involved in the disciplinary hearings regarding Facemash.) reply jbl0ndie 19 hours agorootparentThere's a school of thought in change management that suggests that a time comes when current stories aren't working for the culture you're trying to move an organisation towards. A few here have said morale was low at FB right then. At times like that, restating some important old stories and legends, salted with some useful new ones can help to galvanize people and create the culture change you want. A good example is someone mentioned in this thread is Zuck's beat up old car. That's a great old story for the early days, but probably needed burying at the Red Book time. Clearly he's not going to drive that forever, so you need some more up to date motivational culture lore which embraces more excess while retaining how the Devs are still world-changing hackers who should work all nighters because 'we're all in this together for mankind, team'. reply evanelias 2 hours agorootparentThe car wasn't beat up (I don't see anyone claiming that here) or even all that old... it was just a very modestly-priced choice of vehicle for someone of Zuckerberg's wealth and position. I believe he was still driving it at the time of the red book. Nor does the book really \"embrace more excess\" financially, at least as far as I can remember (and I don't see any of that flipping through my dusty copy briefly just now either). Instead it's the opposite: \"Facebook was not originally created to be a company\", \"We don't build services to make money, we make money to build better services\", etc. Again, this was a period of disappointing post-IPO stock performance. The market wasn't convinced yet that FB could successfully transition to focusing on mobile. It took about 15 months after the IPO for the share price to start looking more positive. So that was a factor, combined with an obvious desire to keep aspects of \"chaotic small nimble startup\" vibe/culture at a company that was definitely no longer a startup. reply conductr 20 hours agorootparentprevFb did actually accomplish a huge feat. They connected in a defacto social network pretty much everyone in the world that wanted to be connected via a social network. They had just hit a billion users in 2012, took them 8 years, and the internet existed with a lot of hype and similar pretty much failed attempts of this before they succeeded. I think a lot of people probably forget or are too young now to know what even the early successful internet was like. It had a ton of hype, promise, etc. but just doing something simple like talking to other people was kind of clunky. It was cool because it had all the BBS and forums and niche community stuff. But, I'd venture to say for most people it was a solo experience. You got online, did some reading or research or gamed a bit, but didn't really start talking to other humans online until the late 2000s or later. You definitely didn't have a way be connected with people you actually knew, to your social network as we know it today. Sure, you had email, but we all know that has a very specific purpose and is not exactly social or hitting the same spot. This was actually a world changing product, there was a lot to be optimistic about. All that said, I am not much of a social media user and never really used Fb much myself. I see the appeal and I see the bad sides of it. I think we'd be much better off without it. I don't necessarily like the way in which it changed the world, but there was a lot to be excited about at this point in time. Not liking the product/company/industry/etc doesn't negated what they achieved. reply ryandrake 21 hours agorootparentprevI can kind of understand having that kind of optimism back in the Internet of, say, 1998, before we saw how vampiric venture-backed winner-take-most tech companies would be. But by 2012, it would be incredibly naive of tech employees (of any company) to seriously believe they were some kind of force for good. reply Klonoar 21 hours agorootparentThis take feels very out of touch with how tech was in 2012. It was evident where the trends were heading, but that optimism that was heavy throughout the tech boom in the late 2000s was definitely still there. reply throwaway314155 21 hours agorootparentThere _was_ backlash. It just didn't operationalize very effectively. For instance, news organizations mostly saw FB and Google as a way to undermine and ultimately replace vetted news with unvetted, unprofessional hot takes. Anyone above a certain age likely saw these viewpoints and agreed with them but not enough to start a movement. When facebook became generally available I was maybe 14-15, and even back then I remember thinking \"this feels very much like it's going to ruin some young womens' lives\". But what the hell was I going to do? I mean - the platform _was_ used as a sort of early Tinder, where sexual attraction could play out in a semi-anonymized way. This comment is in no way exhaustive either. reply com2kid 20 hours agorootparentThe problem regarding news orgs is that they have previously sounded the alarm about bloggers, insisting that the sky was going to fall down now that any random person was allowed to just say anything they wanted and have other people read it! But many of those blogs (which now take the form of subscription newsletters) had incredibly valuable insight and perspectives that were otherwise not being reported on. The news media's alarmism about bloggers was (IMHO rightfully) ignored. So when a couple of years later they started freaking out about Facebook/Twitter/etc, well, same old story, new platform. The difference this time was that FB and Twitter algorithmically fed articles to people, instead of articles naturally spreading virally from person to person. Not that the platforms were that bad at first! Remember that in the early 2010s Facebook was largely a platform for Farmville! It was drowning in spam for free to play social games, but the feed was still largely a timeline. Twitter only released their Apple client in 2010, and there were still a large number of third party clients in 2012. A few years later Facebook would become inundated with political spam and vitriol, but 2012 was still an insane time of growth and optimism. reply throwaway314155 19 hours agorootparentAll I'm saying is that there were people who would have called it naive to be optimistic about such things- and that they were ultimately correct even though they didn't have the numbers or a proper movement. reply Klonoar 18 hours agorootparentprev> There _was_ backlash. RTFC: > It was evident where the trends were heading I'm stating that tech in general still held the optimistic viewpoint, not that outside groups weren't tiring of techs optimism. reply throwaway314155 18 hours agorootparentThat's a fair point, I would just contend that I imagine a cohort of techies shared my views on the subject although i can't prove that and I wasn't old enough to be employed by a tech company when these issues were around. reply ben_w 21 hours agorootparentprevI was that naïve in 1998, owing to that being roughly when my pocket money first stretched to buying a modem. Almost the first thing I stumbled into was a flame-war. Yet even today, I see people regard the lack of moderation on certain sites as an unadulterated axiomatic good. Is that blindness really naïveté, or is it just a political stance like all others? If so, I would not call that naïveté even if the effect is the same, for it is a thing all suffer from, it's the blind spot in our thoughts, no matter how experienced and sophisticated and pragmatic we may otherwise be. reply dgfitz 21 hours agorootparentprev> There was the idea that person to person public discourse could resolve many societal problems.

In large groups, or when posting online with the need to show in-group behavior, or when posting publicly where everyone in one's social group can later judge, people start doing the herd mentality thing, and they also become rude to anyone not in their same social circle. I have no proof, but I dare say the majority of angry people posting horrible stuff on social media are rather pleasant when around friends and family. But all of a sudden, when they get up on stage, they feel the need to copy the behaviors of those around them, which means anger and vitrol. When I first joined the Internet (1995!), there was more of an expectation of civility (IRC being a notable exception), and that is the behavior pattern I picked up upon. reply godshatter 17 hours agorootparent> When I first joined the Internet (1995!), there was more of an expectation of civility (IRC being a notable exception), and that is the behavior pattern I picked up upon. Also netiquette, learning to lurk before posting, meeting people outside your normal groups and getting along with them and other behaviors I'm sure I'm forgetting. Being a tech person on the early internet, despite the flame wars, was a positive experience for me. People wanted to make this work, and that early internet full of tech-minded people and engineers did work to some degree. The idea that this could become a place where people could be what they wanted to be but were still accepted was the idea going at that time, at least according to my experiences. Niches mostly kept to themselves, you could find the groups you wanted to be a part of, and you could avoid those you didn't. When everything we had started to go mainstream, it started to crack and fray. When everything went commercial, it all came crashing down. I'm thinking mostly of pre-web, and early web.

Diseases get cured every day, more people are able to make art of all kinds than ever before, families can keep in touch all around the world, people with disabilities can use technology to overcome what would have previously been hard limits. It is unfortunate that we have allowed algorithmic social media content to destroy so much, and to allow for targeted ad based services to cause such drastic harm to society. However society pretty much now knows what the root problems are and if there is a will, many of the worst offenders can be legislated away. Remove gacha/lootbox mechanics from games and remove personalized algorithmic social media feeds. It turns out, as a species, it isn't good for us to carry around machines 24/7 that can hit the dopamine center in our brains, or that can deliver targeted outrage on demand. How about all the other stuff though? A connected world where I can play games with people around the globe? Forums that let fans share their love of their favorite media/artist/singer/author. The hundreds of amazing YouTube chefs that have introduced authentic, sometimes hyperlocal, world cuisines to a global audience.

This was the same year as the Arab Spring, after all.) reply junon 21 hours agorootparentYes, this. I was at Uber in SF around 2016 or so when they did their \"pixels and bits\" rebrand which felt very similar. It felt very... \"we are messiahs\"? Most people felt it, only the people with the highest paychecks (or managers) played into it. After hearing the core values of the company thrown around in regular speech so often most people got kind of numb to anything corporate (e.g. \"I really like that you're always hustling so hard but I would love to see you do a bit more toe stepping\"). I left SF a year or so after that so I wonder if that whole approach has changed in the bigger offices or not. Being in Europe now most people here (most ..) wouldn't play into it I don't think. Retrospectively feels very American. --- EDIT: Actually it's kind of hard to find info on the rebrand now. There's the announcement[0] but that only seems to allude to the weird philosophical aspect of it in the description, which leads me to believe they never published it publicly. > The new Uber brand system is made up of primary and secondary components that tell the story of technology moving the physical world. Today, we're rolling out a new look and feel that celebrates the cities we're in and the technology that brings people what they want, when they want it. It was more than just \"primary and secondary components\", they had somehow likened people and pixels together and were trying to create some weird (but similar) narrative of \"connecting everything through transport\" or whatever. I think the idea was that they wanted to start breaking into more verticals, a la UberEATS and whatnot, but I distinctly remember hearing a lot of \"what ifs\" about freight, air, etc. that I think were mostly fluff chatter to hype up the rebrand. Most people, even internally, hated it it, and shortly after that started monthly, then weekly, then at times daily new public scandals about the company or TK, so many people left shortly thereafter.

That some of the boldest statements have fallen by the wayside (\"We don't build better services to make money; We make money to build better services\", \"Build Products around people, not data\") is obviously disappointing, but I'd view what it was trying to do in the light of a piece of art that fell short of its goal rather than merely self-unaware. It was never intended as PR.

It's an example of indoctrination. Marshall McLuhan introduced the idea that the \"medium is the message,\" which is heavily alluded to in this book with images of the printing press, etc. The idea is that changes in how information is shared play a bigger role than the actual content of the messages being exchanged. Chris Cox, the Chief Product Officer, used to regularly talk about McLuhan. McLuhan also envisioned trends in the change of information media culminating in a \"global village,\" which Facebook echoes here in its mission of \"making the world more open and connected.\" McLuhan expected that this would divide us more than it would unite us. So I think what the person you're replying to was saying Facebook's appropriation of Mao Zedong and Marshall McLuhan is... weird.

Under the Constitution, martial law must be lifted when a parliamentary majority demands it. Of the 300 members of parliament, 190 were present and all 190 voted in favor of a motion demanding the lifting of martial law. With the motion's passage, the martial law declaration is void, according to the parliamentary speaker's office.

I don't even know if there is a faster route than impeachment in the US system. reply JumpCrisscross 24 minutes agorootparent> Is there an impeachment process for a constitutional violations There's an impeachment process. Creating a separate, faster one for constitutional violations is just inviting trouble. reply s1artibartfast 6 minutes agorootparentIf I recall correctly, I thought there was some legal provision in the US for the military to disobey unconstitutional orders.

An order to commit a war crime is itself a crime, not a lawful order. The sticky part comes in when the venue for determining the legality of the order often then becomes one's own court-martial and resulting appeals. I'm not sure how much case law there is on the subject. robotnikman 1 hour agorootparentprevAs the saying goes- If you aim for the king, you better not miss reply AnimalMuppet 1 hour agorootparentprevWhich means that the president is ignoring the constitution.

EDIT: This is the first I cannot think of any reason for getting a downvote... ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ reply kijin 1 hour agorootparentThe police kept the protesters out, but eventually let in most members of the national assembly and their staff after checking their ID. Martial law is about using the military to control civilian activities. The police are civilian. Their order is to maintain peace, not to interfere with people who have legitimate business at the facility. If Yoon really wanted to preempt the national assembly, he should have sent in the military earlier. reply notahacker 33 minutes agorootparentThere are reports and photos of actual troops in the building, and reports and photos of people who definitely don't look like civilian police leaving the building. I think the bigger problem with attempting to preempt the national assembly is that the troops didn't particularly want to interfere with people that had legitimate business at the assembly either. reply JumpCrisscross 4 hours agoprevArticle 77 of the Korean Constitution: \"1.

It's just harder to create a veneer of the constitutional necessity of such a move when your own highest profile political allies apparently condemn it and pledge to \"stop it with the people\" instead of queuing up to rubber stamp it and do \"this is a small problem with criminal elements in one party which is all resolved now\" briefings to confused foreigners wondering who the real government of South Korea is.

The current political and social situation does not meet the criteria of \"a time when it is necessary to respond to military needs or maintain public order in wartime or a similar national emergency\" as outlined in Article 77 of the Constitution. Therefore, the emergency martial law is invalid and illegal, and the president should be held accountable. Additionally, martial law is procedurally invalid as there was no cabinet meeting, which is required by Article 2(5) of the Martial Law Act. This martial law is null and void! It is illegal for martial law forces to enter the National Assembly. We demand the immediate lifting of martial law.

It started as a political uprising in Algiers on 13 May 1958 and then became a military coup d'état led by a coalition headed by Algiers deputy and reserve airborne officer Pierre Lagaillarde, French Generals Raoul Salan, Edmond Jouhaud, Jean Gracieux, and Jacques Massu, and by Admiral Philippe Auboyneau, commander of the Mediterranean fleet. The coup was supported by former Algerian Governor General Jacques Soustelle and his activist allies. The coup had as its aim to oppose the formation of Pierre Pflimlin's new government and to impose a change of policies in favor of the right-wing partisans of French Algeria.\" [0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Resurrection [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_1958_crisis_in_France reply skywal_l 3 hours agorootparentDe Gaulle was called by the president of the 4th republic to counter the military insurgents.

The Constitution gives the President many powers under martial law (\"Under extraordinary martial law, special measures may be taken with respect to the necessity for warrants, freedom of speech, the press, assembly and association, or the powers of the Executive and the Judiciary as prescribed by law\"), but it appears to give the President no powers over the National Assembly, so the \"All political activities, including the activities of the National Assembly... are prohibited\" part of his martial law declaration appears to be blatantly unconstitutional. According to the constitution, \"When the National Assembly requests the lifting of martial law with the concurrent vote of a majority of the total members of the National Assembly, the President shall comply.\" [2] Some are saying the constitution doesn't give a timeframe for when the President has to comply, but if he doesn't soon, it definitely appears to be a self-coup.

The warring US tribes certainly made an effort to associate their internal enemy with these (Democrats insinuating Republican subversion by Russians, Republicans insinuating Democrat sympathies with China and Iran).

I don't see it as rational, but there is definitely an argument that the USA ought to remain positioned as number one, having the ability to dictate global politics. I don't think we deserve it, but it's certainly 'better' for us in the sense that it gives us an advantage and thus might improve our quality of life (cheaper imports, blah blah blah). I view that argument as entitled and promoting the status quo. The Chinese people have worked hard. Actually, people all over the world work hard, although the Chinese have gone past industrialization and have a massive and capable population. The idea that they wouldn't have more power and would need to somehow remain under the US's thumb, where we get to say how they treat Taiwan or what currency they can trade in with other countries, just seems absurd. People come up with bullshit reasons for why the US ought to retain some control over their politics or how the rest of the world engages with the Chinese (and we don't just get to do that anyway), e.g., the Chinese are mean to the Uyghurs, as if anyone ever gave a fuck about the Uyghurs or whoever twenty years ago.

At that point the military has been told to take a domestic political role - it wasn't the military's choice. Of course, the military could refuse. In the abstract, I think that might be ideal.

One day I hope to be a good enough writer to put words to how thankful I am to the many people who have helped me reach this point. For now, let me just say that I feel the weight of your care, and I will do my best to honor it. But before I throw myself into new projects, I want to pause and reflect on the last three and a half years at the gallery—it was an important experience for me, and I want to highlight a few lessons I learned. (When I began listing, I realized I had learned a lot so I will only cover a small part of it here, mostly lessons around career stuff and agency. I might write what I learned about making art at a later time, if someone is interested (comment!), and about what I learned from the volunteers at the gallery, a group of high agency 70 and 80-year-olds. So much to say!) If you read Escaping Flatland regularly and feel that the essays are meaningful to you, consider becoming a paid subscriber. Subscribe Lessons I learned working at an art gallery The Artist's Garden at Vetheuil, Claude Monet, 1880-81 1. It is possible to turn a mediocre job into a great one I was the only person who applied for the job at the gallery because it was so shitty: it was basically selling coffee all weekends with lousy pay and no vacations during summers. But in 2021 we had recently moved to Denmark, so I had no professional network and didn’t speak the language, and Rebecka had just been born, and we needed the money—so I couldn’t be picky. I also felt that the place had, as real estate agents say, “good bones”: it was beautiful, they had 6 exhibition halls, and it was a 25-minute bike ride from home. For most of my career, I have worked short gigs or at projects that I started—the longest stretch I’ve been employed was, I think, 4 months at a bio lab when I was 19. No, that’s not right; I worked 8 months in a school when I was going down a rabbit hole about education in 2016/17. My working model has been that being employed kind of sucks. But this time, since I knew I couldn’t afford to quit anytime soon with the baby and all, I figured I could try treating it like one of my projects. So instead of selling coffee, I looked into how we could streamline the café and the cash register so that the volunteers who help out at the gallery felt comfortable doing my job, then I made myself a small office where I sat down to analyze the business and figure out how to improve it. You can imagine how popular this was. I had to backtrack for a few months after the board told me to get back to the café. And this was a good lesson for someone who is used to being self-employed: at an institution, you can’t just do what is best, you also have to build trust and coordinate with others so you are on the same page. This, however, doesn’t mean that you should abdicate your judgment and get in line. I like the approach Sholto Douglas expressed in his interview with Dwarkesh Patel: If I’m trying to write some code and something isn't working, even if it’s in another part of the code base, I’ll often just go in and fix that thing or at least hack it together to be able to get results. [...] I think that's arguably the most important quality in almost anything. It's just pursuing it to the end of the earth. Whatever you need to do to make it happen, you'll make it happen. [...] I’m just going to vertically solve the entire thing. And that turns out to be remarkably effective. Ie. you don’t say, “This is my job and that thing is outside my area”—no, if the value you are trying to promote requires you to go outside your role and learn new skills and politick to get the authority to go ahead: then that is your job. I’m not at the level of Sholto Douglas, but I figured I could at least try. So I made an agreement with my boss, who liked me, that she would let me sit in on the board meetings, and I began mapping out who was who and what they wanted and made sure to talk to all stakeholders when they passed through the gallery, and in 6 months I had a good enough model of what their values and goals were so I could align myself to the mission and make legible to them what I was doing. As my boss learned to trust me, she began to say that my role was “do whatever you think is right,” and eventually, after about a year, “. . . and you work whenever you feel like it.” (It helped that the year I started was the inflection point when the revenue, which had been shrinking or muddling for 5 years, began growing again; this wasn’t all my work, but it made my boss trust me.) For the last 2.5 years I’ve mostly set my own agenda, and I’ve worked in uneven sprints and bursts, sometimes doing 70-hour weeks (my contract was 20 hours per week), and sometimes staying home for 10 days to write essays. This bursty way of working fits my temperament well, and I’ve genuinely loved this job in a way I didn’t think I’d ever love a job. A bunch of my friends envied my role. But no one else applied. 2. The best artists I’ve worked with remind me of the best startup founders I know I’ve worked with . . . ~150 artists from 33 countries. Quite a few of them have been the way artists are typically portrayed: self-centered, hard to work with, a little crazy. These were the amateurs. The best artists I’ve worked with, for example A and B, a husband and wife duo, were not at all like that. Let me give an example. My boss fundraised and sold a large public sculpture A and B had made earlier this year. The day before we were going to install it, A and B came to the gallery and explained that they had found a better electronic component. Not that the old one was bad—it was the best one they had been able to find when they originally made the sculpture. But the new one was a little bit better. So then they proceeded to dismantle the entire sculpture, get their welding kit, and work for seven hours improving the sculpture. Notice three things: A and B had already been paid and the buyer was more than happy. A and B didn’t tell the customer that they had spent 14 man hours improving it; it was just something they did because it was right, nothing they wanted credit for. A and B have earned enough money from their New York gallerist to retire, but they’d rather use that money to make better art. It is this kind of attitude that makes someone succeed at their level, as far as I can tell. They are always pushing themselves to the edge, which makes them grow, and they are so selfless and pleasant to work with that you just want to do more stuff with them all the time. And you need that attitude to do anything ambitious: you need support, and funding, and goodwill, and you don’t get that by being disorganized or self-centered. Maybe at the very top of the art world artists can afford to be annoying again, I don’t know. 3. The worst exhibitions take the most work This is sort of a corollary to the above. When we work with artists like A and B, they answer their emails within the hour and they never complain when we can’t meet an expectation they have and when they come in they work hard and fast and deliver a great exhibition in a few hours. Certain other artists are more like, “oh, I don’t know what I want to do . . .” “can you get me more funding?” “that scratch on the floor makes my art look bad, you need to fix it” “can you build a wall there?” “no that wall wasn’t right after all, can you take it down” and after weeks of this you end up with something mediocre. I got to run something like an experiment on my capacity to predict which exhibitions would end up great, and which would be a waste of time. It was easy. As soon as someone was slow at answering their email, or complained, or wanted us to be their therapist as they worked through the creative worries, I would tell my boss, “I think we should cancel this.” And my boss—whose strength and weakness is that she thinks the best of people and makes everyone feel held—would say, “Ah, but they are just a bit sloppy with email” “if we just fix this thing it will be fine. . .” I was right every time; it ended in pain. And this is quite nice actually: it means it doesn’t take some Tyler Cowen-level taste in talent to figure out who will do good work. I had limited experience with artists. But it turns out that if you are just a bit patient and say, “No, I’m not going to work with anyone who is demanding or confused or slow at answering their email”—then you are basically home. And when you work like that, when you are patient for the right opportunities, you don’t have to do a lot of work at all. You just go around talking to people until you find a good match...and then the work sort of does itself with little effort. Very convenient! It is not that I’m some grumpy person who thinks that some people are great and others aren’t, in some predetermined way—I think you can to a large extent decide which kind you want to be. But if someone else isn’t measuring up, I have no idea how to convince them to do so. So I look for people who have already decided. 4. If you care about beauty, you should care about economic growth, too An art gallery—especially a co-op art gallery with a non-profit board like the one I worked at—is a strange kind of business. The aim is not to earn money but to create beauty and strengthen the community and all of these other hard-to-measure things. Because of this, the gallery attracted people who prefer to think about higher values, rather than stuff like economic growth, which was seen as icky. I am very much in that direction myself; I found it, for example, almost shameful to turn on paid subscriptions on my blog. But something that became clear to me at the gallery, and from working with people like A and B who did art at a high level, is that you simply can’t afford to do good stuff if you don’t figure out the funding part. Our elevator at the gallery, for example, was falling apart, and it would be illegal for us to keep open without one, which meant that we would be unable to do anything if we couldn’t get the money for the elevator—no community, no art, no nothing. My first boss and the board had not realized this, and when I pointed this out, there was a vague feeling that if this happened “the municipality should pay for it because art is so important.” But the municipality on our island is in bad economic shape, and is considering cutting back on care for the elderly to balance their budget—so, to me, it feels unethical to angle for more money for the arts.1 This is the kind of topic that makes me pound the table in fervor as I talk about it; I have often given this sermon to art students. We have a duty to our values and a duty to our community, and we can’t shy away from that because it feels hard, or because we want to be seen in a certain way, and then expect others to bail us out! We should shoulder our responsibility and figure out a way to make the art (or whatever we value) so attractive and meaningful that people feel good about funding it by becoming members or buying art or coffee or whatever. If we want to make the world a better place, we can’t just think about the lofty stuff: we have to get our hands dirty and make sure the economic engine works. 6. There are places in the incentive landscape where the incentives are aligned with your values, and your job is to find them It is not unreasonable to feel icky about the business side of art because the incentives of the market (and the grantmakers . . .) often really do pull in directions that actively threaten the very values that we care about. Yes. But that is only a rough approximation of the truth. If you take the time to actually bang your head against reality and figure out how to fund something, you will discover that there are places in the incentive landscape where the incentives (which are really the desires and needs of other human beings) align with your ineffable values. If you want to bring as much of what you have to give into the world, it is our job to figure out where in the incentive landscape that is. I think of it as two vector fields: The first vector field is our artistic impulses, and ethics, and curiosity, and so on—all the things that we want to express in our lives (or in our institutions). The other vector field is the market. If you put these vector fields on top of each other and add the vectors together, you find that in most places, the vectors point in different directions which makes them pull each other off course. Ie. it is harder to make money if you also want to honor your curiosity; and, inversely, it is easy to lose contact with your values if you are also trying to earn money. But if you are patient enough, and open-minded enough, and willing to work hard, you can iterate your way to parts where the vectors align. And when that happens, the market forces actually boost the artistic process, as when two waves collide forming a double wave. What you see in the biographies of great artists, great writers, great anything is that they are good at figuring out where the vectors align. They are able to keep track of their values and be attuned to themselves, and at the same time be cold-headed about how the world works: not shaping themselves to fit the world, but figuring out how to position what they do so that it becomes possible. 6. Most people are not serious As someone who has been self-employed for most of my life, I have often looked at institutions and felt, “How come they are so slow and bad at their jobs? How hard can it be?” But since I had limited experience, I figured that there was something hard about it that I was too naive to see. I’m no longer sure I was naive. It was, at the gallery at least, very easy to do much (~3x) better than baseline. For example: when I first came on the board, they would talk about the “three legs” of the gallery: fundraising, workshops, and sales (café, shop, tickets). But when I sneaked away to look at the numbers, two of these “sources of income” were actually cost centers: fundraising and workshops cost us more than we earned.2 No one had looked at our bookkeeping to figure out how we earned our income! Also, they hadn’t factored in building maintenance costs, and when you did that it was clear that the current strategy would bankrupt us in 2-3 years. These are not hard things to look up; I’m a very amateurish accountant.3 It is surprising how much edge “let me google that” gives you, 26 years after Google was released. (Not to talk about LLMs.) Most people just seem to come up with an answer in their head and then go with that without checking. To the credit of the board, they did see the problem as soon as I pointed it out, and acted swiftly, and were able to find solutions that I was too inexperienced to find. When we cut back on workshops and fundraising and focused on the parts that worked, we could do that with more care—running experiments, updating our pricing strategies, automating, streamlining, changing the branding, etc—which, as always when you narrow your focus, made a big difference, and we ended up growing revenue by 311 percent. Now the expensive maintenance is either done or scheduled to be done, and we’ve built up a war chest, and we’ve set up a strong board, so I feel confident that the place can live on for another ten years—which was the goal I had. I feel ready to get back to my own projects. In August, King Frederik X, the new Danish King, made an official visit to the gallery during his first tour. Since I’m not in the least a royalist, I was surprised at how sentimental the event made me—seeing him do his weird kingly walk as the preschoolers waved their flags in front of the gallery. I guess it made me feel like I belonged here, and that this country that has given us refuge told us that we were one of them now, that they saw the work we had done to care for this small corner of the whole. It felt like the end of one of the movies of my life, and above my desk as I write this, I keep, as a memento for my years at the gallery, a framed receipt for a sculpture I sold Queen Mary. That was fun. Since this blog is my only income now, I want to remind you that you can become a paid subscriber if you want to read more or support the production of free essays.

On mentors Henrik Karlsson · November 8, 2023 Hercules Segers, The Tomb of the Horatii and Curiatii, ca. 1628-29 Read full story 1 This isn’t only a problem with artists. It seems like most people struggle a lot with seeing how making sacrifices in their area might promote the values they believe in better. I was elected to the popular education board for a year and was part of hearings where we were supposed to give feedback on suggestions to reduce the budget for things like the boy scouts and swimming halls and support for homeschoolers. These meetings were a travesty. The board did everything in their power to argue that all cuts were catastrophic, even though it was clear that some were fine while others were in fact very costly and harmful—which meant they provided no useful information to the politicians, who then had to just randomly cut funding. Also, like, when we, as a community have run out of money, shouldn’t we feel the weight and the joy of the weight of figuring out what we can cut so we can save what we value most? Like, just because I happen to be on the popular education board doesn’t mean I can’t conclude that it might be better for us to scale back support for the boy scouts rather than the hospital. When I tried to point this out, the rest of the board looked at me like I was crazy. I remember in particular an old right-wing politician, something of a heavyweight, who turned to me, angry, when I asked if they didn’t feel we had a duty to figure out how to save money? “We have no legal duty to that,” he said. I resigned. 2 Which is fine if you think that is the best kind of charity you can do, but not if you think you are actually doing it to earn money! 3 It might sound like I’m being coy and want you to think that I am in fact good at this business stuff. But I’m not. I am, I think, a good writer (and since you probably know me through my writing you might overestimate me). But everything I did at the gallery—curating, branding, renovating, and so on—I had no idea how to do that, and had to learn piece by piece as I ran into problems.

Clearly he has opinions. But for example in point 3, he says he can predict which exhibition will be great based on how easy it is to work with the artist. He predicts that some exhibition will be crap and he is right! Which sounds impressive until you notice that he is not measuring his judgement against something objective, but just against his judgement. He decides something will be crap and then he feels crap about it once he sees it. Did others, who did not know that the artist was slow to email back also feel that those exhibitions were mediocre and the others not? Who knows? All we have is this one man’s opinion. Maybe others thought differently. Even more so in his point 6. He writes “What you see in the biographies of great artists, great writers, great anything is that they are good at figuring out where the vectors align.” Which is just plainly and absolutely not true. There were plenty of people who we now recognise as “great artist” who absolutely could not figure out where the “incentive vectors align”. Thus they lived in abject poverty, or needed to support themselves from something other than their art. But if your definition of “great art” is that it is commercially succesfull then of course what you will find that the “great artist” are all like good businesman. But that doesn’t tell you about what it take to be an artist, just only what you value. reply ValentinA23 6 hours agoparenthttps://www.zmescience.com/science/physicist-shows-that-to-b... Albert-László Barabás, a physicist, created a network map that can predict an artist's future success based on their early network connections. His work outlines two key \"laws of success\": - Performance drives success, but when performance can’t be measured, networks drive success. This highlights the importance of networks when objective measures of quality are difficult to establish. - Performance is bounded, but success is unbounded. This indicates that small differences in quality can lead to large disparities in success due to the amplifying power of social networks Barabási's model can predict an artist's career success with surprising accuracy based on the venues of their first five exhibitions. This model underscores the importance of early connections and the venues where an artist exhibits their work, which can significantly influence their long-term success4. reply blitzar 5 hours agorootparentI guess this is why a sucessful genius can tape a banana to a wall while a run of the mill worker can only restore Notre Dame to its original state. reply ValentinA23 3 hours agorootparentThis is a reflexion I made to a friend yesterday: the banana doesn't improve the state of art over Duchamp's Fountain. The real artist, in this case, is the guy who paid 6 millions to eat the banana ! reply burkaman 1 hour agorootparentThe guy that bought it is not an artist, he was just trying to distract from some good-old-fashioned corruption: https://popular.info/p/a-chinese-national-charged-with-fraud Based on the coverage of his purchase it seems like he succeeded. reply blitzar 3 hours agorootparentprevThey are artists all the way down. reply deadbabe 2 hours agorootparentNow someone must eat the artist who ate the banana, for several million dollars. reply blitzar 2 hours agorootparentAn artist has to tape them to a wall first. reply dghlsakjg 2 hours agorootparentI'll do it. But not for less than $12mm reply blitzar 1 hour agorootparentI am an artist. I would do it for the sake of art (and $10mil) reply zcw100 4 hours agorootparentprevMoney laundering is probably what makes a banana taped to a wall successful. reply llamaimperative 5 hours agorootparentprevNo that is more about money laundering reply Aunche 42 minutes agorootparentWhenever an absurdly priced work of art makes it to the news, laypeople immediately jump to the explanation of money laundering, but any artist, art purchaser, or even money launderer would know that this is ridiculous. You'd be an idiot to launder their money in the most publicized auction in the year. If you wanted to launder money, it would most likely be through low-profile private sales. reply neaden 11 minutes agorootparentIn this specific case we know who bought it Justin Sun. He's a Hong Kong based cyrptocurrency investor who ate it. So it seems like in this case it was more about getting some press, and probably a bit of distraction against some of the allegations against him. reply llamaimperative 15 minutes agorootparentprevI agree that any individual piece is not guaranteed to be laundering, but the market as a whole is definitely pushed upwards by more factors than people's desire for historical artifacts or decoration. In any case, in the true upper end of the market, most of these auctions are publicized but the buyers are behind many layers of indirection. reply numpad0 50 minutes agorootparentprevlet's buy that argument for discussion's sake, that doesn't contradict with the notion that networking is important. reply lancesells 4 hours agorootparentprevIt's more about people with a lot of money hoping to sell it for a greater return, while maybe also having shit taste in art. In five years it'll be at an auction and sell to some other person with too much money in hopes of making a profit on it later on. reply neaden 10 minutes agorootparentThe guy who bought it, Justin Sun, ate it. So unless it's going to get really meta (and stinky) he's not going to resell it. reply blitzar 3 minutes agorootparentThat would be a piece of art. llamaimperative 2 hours agorootparentprevNah, it has to do with money laundering, tax evasion, and easy international money transmission. There are tons of interesting tricks you can pull once you have your hands on a small object \"worth\" hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars whose very illiquid + inefficiently priced sales also affects an entire market of similar objects. reply niceice 1 hour agorootparentprevHow does that work exactly? reply llamaimperative 1 hour agorootparentHave you ever tried to move $10MM between jurisdictions before? It's much easier when you can put it in a box that looks like, weighs as much as, and actually is a piece of cloth inside of a box, and then open the box up wherever you want it. (To be clear, the banana piece specifically is probably a bad artwork to use for financial engineering purposes, but for the art market as a whole these dynamics add a lot to the prices near the top end) reply m0llusk 5 hours agorootparentprevWorkers are required to follow the orders they are given which are typically specified such that it is the people paying them that get to exercise aesthetic judgement. That is why Notre Dame was restored to a modernized design that is visibly different from its original state. reply albumen 2 hours agorootparentInteresting...the several articles I've read note how closely it has remained to the original design. What aspects are modernised? reply plagiarist 5 hours agorootparentprevThe world is pretty disappointing in that way. All my life I have been thinking I should develop good skills in my career. But actually I should have been learning how to make connections and talk to people. There's no chance of me selling a single banana for that much. But I could be making a multiple what I do now. reply cpach 59 minutes agorootparentWhy not do both? reply therealcamino 2 hours agorootparentprevIt seems to me like a more valid way to describe that work is that, you can predict an artist's long-term success based on their early success. The first five venues where an artist exhibits isn't wholly based on their social networks, but also tells you how excited the art world is about their work. Since attitudes about the work or the artist are key factors in establishing what their early network is, I don't see how you can conclude that the work and the artist are irrelevant, but the network is relevant. reply llamaimperative 5 hours agorootparentprev> It turns out, however, that you can make it by starting from the outside. It’s not easy, but it can work. You have to go around and show your art as much as possible to as many people as possible. I.e. some portion of “network success strategy” is actually downstream of talent success. reply niceice 1 hour agorootparentprevOr is it that performance creates a network? reply jonnycomputer 5 hours agorootparentprevThis is great to think about. Glad I ran across this comment. reply trhway 5 hours agorootparentprevsounds like startups founding and software engineers career reply irjustin 9 hours agoparentprev> But if your definition of “great art” is that it is commercially succesfull then of course what you will find that the “great artist” are all like good businesman. While the author doesn't explicitly define what is \"great\", I 100% believed that what it is defined as. That \"great\" is being commercially successful. The article is premised around running a non-profit art gallery in a struggling municipality. That he did a good job by \"helping grow the revenues\"[0]. He needed money for his new baby and couldn't afford to lose a job[1] It is a modern day art gallery. These things are businesses first - to support their own operations and then to help artist support themselves and their work. So yes, \"great\" art IS art that sells. Now, what sells is highly highly subjective, and a very large part of that sales process is making the customer _feel good_ about their purchase. And I think this is where you disagree - that there is a higher, objective reality around good vs great art. And for so much art, there really isn't. [0] \"I started was the inflection point when the revenue, which had been shrinking or muddling for 5 years, began growing again\" [1] \"since I knew I couldn’t afford to quit anytime soon with the baby and all\" reply atoav 45 minutes agorootparentOn which timeframe tho? Many great artists did not sell well during their lifetime, Van Gogh being the most famous example. Was Van Gogh a great artist because at some point in the future his works are among the most expensive ones ever sold sold? Or was he a bad artist, that turned great after his death when the market favored him more? If it is the former, every artist could potentially sell well in the remaining time of human civilization — how far in the future do you draw the line? If it is the latter then we get the paradoxical situation, that the same work can be both great and bad depending on the observers time reference. So the same painting is bad, until someone \"discovers\" it and manages ro produce economic hype around it. As someone with a MA of art who has probably seen more exhibitions than most people on this site (including the last 5 Biennales and the last 3 Documentas) my guess is: great art is great even before it is commercially successful. Whether it then turns out to be economically successful as well (and when) hinges on many different factors, like the Zeitgeist, pure chance, where it was exhibited or next to what it was exhibited, how the galerist treats the work, how much the artist puts on the market, how the market feels at the time when it is shown etc. The \"greatness\" of the work is only a very small factor in the economic success it has, some would even argue it doesn't matter as much as one would think. But all of that matters on how we define \"great\". If you are a rich collector that sees art as an investment it is just about the numbers, then great art is only art that you have and that sells for more than you bought it. You'd define it differently depending on who you are: artist, art historian, galerist, lay person, crafts person, journalist, copyright lawyer, restaurator, .. reply krisoft 8 hours agorootparentprev> While the author doesn't explicitly define what is \"great\", I 100% believed that what it is defined as. I understand that is his definition, but then talk about that. Instead of saying that the exhibition ended up \"mediocre\" say that \"ticket sales were lower than expected\" or \"sold less paintings than we hoped for\", or \"didn't bring in anybody\". Because as is he just writes \"after weeks of this you end up with something mediocre\" and \"predict which exhibitions would end up great\". That is very vibes based. Did he just not enjoy those exhibitions? Or is it tied to something objective outside of his head? (such as revenue, or crowd size, or critical acclaim) The first is not interesting, the second is. > That he did a good job by \"helping grow the revenues\"[0]. Or did not do a good job. Base on the very sentence you quote which starts \"It helped that the year I started ...\". Doesn't give me the impression that even the author believes it is all their doing. Very easily someone could write the same story from a differed perspective \"we hired a guy to run the café, but he was way too distracted to keep consistently at it. First he ruffled some feathers with the board then he mellowed out so we kept him around. He pooh-poohed artist who was not as responsive in electronic communication as he would have liked, but we told him softly that is not his decision and to shut it. At the end he was only showing up sporadically and then left to write or something.\" We only have his world on it and even based on that his track record is less than stelar. reply jonnycomputer 5 hours agorootparentYes, this is the situation we are left in. I don't really know of course (and presumably nor do you) whether he was a good employee or made substantive improvements or whatever. It would have helped if he was more specific and concrete in his descriptions. The biggest failing here is a failing of clear and compelling writing. reply krisoft 4 hours agorootparent> I don't really know of course (and presumably nor do you) whether he was a good employee or made substantive improvements or whatever. Yes, absolutely. I don't know anything about him outside of this article. I assume he is a good employee, or they were mostly happy with him (for the simple reason that they kept employing him). Just wrote that part to illustrate that the same facts from his own pen can be also interpreted in a negative light. > It would have helped if he was more specific and concrete in his descriptions. I totally agree with that. reply TheOtherHobbes 8 hours agorootparentprevBy your definition, super-successful kitsch-meisters like Thomas Kinkade are great artists. That's quite a niche view. In fact art is an overlap of many different kinds of markets selling to many different kinds of customers - from people buying phone wallpapers online, to tourists buying souvenirs on holiday, to oligarchs laundering money through prestige purchases. And many others. A community gallery is going to intersect with a couple of those, but not all of them. Sustainable funding is a goal, but maximising income isn't. Financial success doesn't sane wash narcissistic entitlement, of which there is plenty outside of the arts. reply krisoft 8 hours agorootparent> By your definition, super-successful kitsch-meisters like Thomas Kinkade are great artists. And Vincent van Gogh is not. Or was not a great artist, then he died and become a great artist somehow suddenly after his death. (at least by that definition, which just to make it clear, I don't agree with.) reply specialist 4 hours agorootparentI'm fine with \"remembered somehow\" as another useful definition for \"a great artist\". More cynically: van Gogh was only successfully monetized posthumously. reply bradley13 9 hours agoparentprevI have worked a little bit with \"artists\". Too many of them are caught up in their vision, and apparently incapable of dealing with reality. Too many of them believe that their vision is so, so unique that everyone else should sort out any problems. There's one guy where I live, whom I tried to help out several times. I would invest lots of effort handling the practical stuff: flyers, text, web site, etc. Little thanks, because it was his due. Then he would have a new idea, change direction, and it was all for nothing. reply specialist 4 hours agorootparentTrue. Part of Gage Art Academy's mission is to create working artists. Students learn about (and struggle with) how to get paid. Stuff like how to price their works, balancing one's own artistic expression with making stuff that sells, how to pull off an exhibit, etc. https://gageacademy.org/ reply Aunche 1 hour agoparentprev> There were plenty of people who we now recognise as “great artist” who absolutely could not figure out where the “incentive vectors align”. Thus they lived in abject poverty, or needed to support themselves from something other than their art. I don't think this is particularly true anymore. Most of the canonical artists of the past century were successful during their lifetimes. The ones who weren't either died tragically young (e.g. Basquiat), or didn't care for exposure much at all (e.g. Hilma af Kint). reply robenkleene 21 minutes agorootparentI agree with this. I'd be curious if you have any hypothesis about why exactly that is? Personally, I can think of three possible reasons but I'm not convinced by any of them: 1. It's became harder to distinguish quality. Artist training has been streamlined, so technical excellence (which is easier to evaluate) isn't novel anymore. So that means determining quality of art now depends on more difficult to evaluate criteria. 2. Art moves faster now, so it's harder to have an influence on the art world (one of the ways an artist becomes famous) posthumously, because by then the art world has probably moved on from the state where the art would have impact. 3. We're just better at discovering artists. E.g., low-barrier to entry for digital distribution means it's easier for artists to find an audience. Any thoughts? reply fenomas 8 hours agoparentprev> in point 3, he says he can predict which exhibition will be great based on how easy it is to work with the artist I strongly assumed that bit was about him predicting whether each exhibition would be \"great\" from the gallery's perspective - in terms of attendance or revenue or whatever metrics they used. It's not spelled out, but since the whole piece is about him focusing on the business and ops side of things, that bit probably was as well. reply dfxm12 3 hours agoparentprevI think the author's definition of \"best artist\" is \"artist who made my job easiest\". I have no reason to distrust the author about this, but, on the other hand, this information is simply not useful. reply westondeboer 2 hours agoparentprevI have worked for an artist for about 20 years. He releases a print every week, I could not tell you which one is going to sell well or not. reply magicalhippo 8 hours agoparentprev> He writes “What you see in the biographies of great artists, great writers, great anything is that they are good at figuring out where the vectors align.” Which is just plainly and absolutely not true I take it the author means \"great\" as in \"successful\". reply llamaimperative 5 hours agorootparentIt is not true in that case either, or at least “successful” is still poorly defined. It’s defined implicitly in this blog as commercially successful within the timeframe I had to sell their art. Which is a perfectly defensible definition, but should be explicit so people know what argument they’re hearing. reply munificent 7 minutes agorootparentIt was clear to me from the article. The very next section is about how being economically sustainable is important if your goal is to maximize the amount of art you can present to a community. reply magicalhippo 3 hours agorootparentprev> commercially successful within the timeframe I had to sell their art That's what I meant with successful. Not sure what other variations there would be, though I'm not a native speaker. reply llamaimperative 2 hours agorootparentFor example, to receive prestigious awards would also fit under \"successful,\" regardless of monetary components. To be recognized after death as one of the Masters would be successful. reply magicalhippo 2 hours agorootparentThe author is talking about the artistry being aligned with market forces in the paragraph preceding the quote. I don't really see how either of those definitions fit in that context. reply llamaimperative 1 hour agorootparentSure, but now you're just circularly defining it back to what was initially pointed out: this is implicitly a very specific definition of greatness, ergo yeah, you replace the word with \"successful\" and it's implicitly a very specific definition of successful. reply l5870uoo9y 9 hours agoparentprev> The problem here is that I don’t trust the author on being able to tell who is the “best artist”. A prerequisite to be considered a great artist is that the artist master a \"craft\" to perfection be it painting, drawing, sculpting, or something complete different like Burial who created one of the most important electronic album using the basic audio-editing software Sound Forge. reply djtango 9 hours agorootparentIs art really about craft anymore? There's certainly an element of it but it's gotten very meta and abstract these days. What is the craft in a dirty bath tub or a robot endlessly sweeping liquid? Better yet what's the craft in a white canvas: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_invisible_artworks I'm actually not denying there's art here, sometimes I \"get it\" but the art of today has gotten very conceptual and meta. I see similar issues with music - where the need to be accessible vs original are pit against each other. Da Vinci, Monet, Turner, Picasso - the art is fairly accessible. Mozart, Beethoven, Debussy, Holst ditto. But who will be remembered as being accessible and \"serious\" from our generation in music? Probably John Williams - a film composer primarily. I'm not dissing composers, one of my favourites of all time is Nobuo Uematsu but I am not sure what is art anymore. I wonder if art can only emerge with hindsight. What did it feel like to be in the present when people like Chopin and Liszt were in their heyday while Delacroix and Moreau were painting. Or when Ravel and Debussy were writing impressionistic music alongside Monet and Manet painting reply Arkhaine_kupo 5 hours agorootparent> Is art really about craft anymore? It never was, but it is still important as it always has been. > There's certainly an element of it but it's gotten very meta and abstract these days. Art is about many things. I agree that a lot of art can be esoteric nowadays, mostly because its in conversation with specific things, so it can feel like an inside joke, or a private conversation you are not privy to. If I make an art piece critiquing an article from The Economist and you never read business news then my piece will be unparseable for you, regardless of quality. Many art pieces are in response to other art movements, or to niche communities, or to conversations happening in the art world etc. If you jump into a modern art gallery and someone is replying to the art that was in Art Basel Miami, which was a repsonse to internet art, which in itself was a response to figurative early .... and then you go to this art gallery and you cant get a painting because its talking to someone that is not you. > where the need to be accessible vs original are pit against each other. I dont think thats true. There are certainly artists that manage to break new ground while being accesible, while other prime originality over mainstream appeal. That is an artistic choice to be made, in the same way retreading comfortable ground or releasing a Christman Carol album is. > Da Vinci, Monet, Turner, Picasso - the art is fairly accessible. Trying to understand the last supper without knowledge of Christianity would make Da Vinci fairly hard. Monet was a counter culture leader against The Salon in France which prized craft, and execution over more ground breaking attempts like impressionism, so hardly accesible when his entire life was a fight against the culture of the time. Picasso can be called many things, but accesible is not one that comes to mind. Gernika can be considered striking, but cubism, his portraits of women (and their significance), his pottery... there is plenty of his work that needs analysis and is plain ugly on first watch. > But who will be remembered as being accessible and \"serious\" from our generation in music? There will be plenty. Kendrick Lamar won a Pulitzer for his lyrics, to give a simple example his song Swimming Pools about the many faces of alcoholism and its raveging effects on the black community is both a popular song as well as really well written narratively. From the 90s you could easily pull Nirvana for offering grunge as an alternative to the hyper corporate, pro capitalism, runaway train that american political and social life was engaged in, while having incredibly catchy songs. If you wanna go further back Bob Dylan and The Beatles are absolute masters of catchy tunes and powerful lyrics. You said what felt to be in the present with List? Well you had Lisztomania, an absolute uproar of women turning up to see him. This was mocked/replicated by the beatles with Beatlemania. You could argue the Boy band, Justin Bieber phenomenom was that same effect although the musicality, and the corporate interference shows a darker more manufactured side to the art. And in terms of art you have incredible art of every type right now, never has art been more accesible or easy to produce. What we are missing is search tools, surfacing interesting works and specially people curating what stuff is good from the muck. But if a tree falls in a forest, it still makes sound and rn there are countless artists dropping trees you just need to perk your ears up reply djtango 32 minutes agorootparentThanks for the thoughtful reply. I think you've addressed to some degree what I was trying to think around. That art may be difficult to evaluate in its time. Monet may have been a counter culture artist in his time but today he has a somewhat universal appeal. Is that cultural? Are we now primed to like Monet because people have told us to like Monet? No doubt in his time there were factions, those who pandered to the institution and those who fawned over innovation and originality. I'm sure these cycles occur in every present. So then what will be remembered from our time? As you say a lot of today's art is esoteric and holding a conversation not all of us are privy to. I also agree that to some extent we do now have the most art we ever could have. The internet and the creator economy has unlocked creativity in many ways. I recall some discussion the other day about the \"hollowing out of the middle\" in musical instrument proficiency, and more widely a lot of other skills. Technology and convenience has eradicated a need for many skills at a \"mediocre\" level but we also have more access to information and learning than ever before. reply grammarxcore 14 hours agoprevI refuse to believe that not answering every single email within an hour is a good predictor of anything other than being glued to your phone. I think extending it to a reasonable amount of time, maybe a business day max, works out pretty well. Sometimes people respond really fast because they’re taking regular breaks and other times they don’t respond all evening because they’re putting on their kid’s birthday party. Even at work, sometimes very good colleagues are doing things back-to-back for hours and using short windows to do things like go to the bathroom. On the other hand maybe this is some art thing I’m too far away from to understand? Maybe really good artists to work with never need more than twenty minutes of deep focus at a time for anything? reply bleakenthusiasm 11 hours agoparentI read this as \"answer within the hour when preparing an exhibition\". If you are in full swing to get an exhibition up and running and this is the time you decide to throw yourself into deep focus work, you are probably hard to work with. I would also assume if some artist told the author \"look I know we open on Tuesday, but this Friday we have my kid's birthday so from 4 to 8 I won't be easy to reach\", this would probably just be silently dropped from the cou ting of how fast they respond. On the other hand, without warning going dark for 4 work day hours a few days before exhibition would look terrible if any serious question came up. So I don't think it's literally responding within the hour, but it comes pretty dang close. You have to keep in mind that being an artist creating art and being an artist setting up an exhibition are basically two different jobs and if you end up doing them in parallel at the same time, that's your problem right there. reply dkga 8 hours agorootparentI read it like so too. I don’t typically respond to emails immediately unless I have my email application open (which I rarely do as I do enjoy time to do deep work). But in the lead up to a big event there is no way I would go radio silent, unless I’m unconscious in the hospital. reply soco 5 hours agorootparentprevSince when is email expected to be answered immediately??? Anything urgent means a phone call, or a text message. Emails are either for cya reasons (but then my urgency is not necessarily your urgency) or just big stuff needing time - to write, to compose, to think, to analyse. So email answering time is a wrong metric by definition. reply Dylan16807 10 hours agorootparentprevHow long does setting up an exhibition take, and what kind of hours are you expecting? 4-8 are workday hours? And what kind of question needs to be answered that fast, but wasn't important enough to be asked several days earlier? My feeling is that there should be very few such questions, few enough that each artist can safely take half a day if they get one. reply ben_w 9 hours agorootparentA day and a half is slow even in software, and software doesn't have things like the example given of wanting a wall put up then asking for it to be taken down again. Sure, software does have bad communicators who change their minds, but revert is relatively easy. reply Dylan16807 7 hours agorootparent> A day and a half is slow even in software, We're talking about half a day, not a day and a half.

Yes, of course. You should probably be there for most of it too. But once you're covering multiple days, no, a single person should not be expected to respond lightning fast the entire time.

Are you competing on time of response so if you're fast you're getting the deal? reply ljf 9 hours agorootparentI can only speak for myself - I produce exec/board materials. Often a request will go out to several people and I can get ahead by responding first. Sometimes someone will reply to me quickly and the edge I bring is properly digesting their response and then going back quickly to them with questions. Others might accept they have a reply and then wait until they are pulling the paper together to realise they are missing key data. I don’t read or action all emails instantly, but I am very aware of the ones I need to, or when I am in a period of high focus that needs information fast. In an ideal world I’d be in an office with all the people I needed around me, all with the same focus and priorities, but that is rarely the case. So to excel at my job I need to make connections fast and respond fast. (Note this isn’t just email, this is just for my communications in general.) reply 1123581321 2 hours agorootparentprevReplying quickly looks like you care and you already know what's going on. It also suggests that you'd be willing to have even more synchronous conversations (phone calls, trips together, etc.) Doing it during business hours matters more than off hours outside of major deadlines or event prep. With many organizations, if you want to give this impression and also shut down communications to focus, you need blocks of time outside of business hours where you focus. For example, I know a responsive executive who cannot be reached from 6am-9am every weekday, when most people aren't trying to get hold of him. This is when he writes and reads. Even then, his assistant fields communications so he doesn't seem to have disappeared. Not saying you should do this or that it's for everybody. reply lupire 4 hours agorootparentprevI remember one event vividly. Exec asked for some business information information while traveling. I replied promptly, sending a link to a webpage, within the proper process for secure data sharing according to company policy. This required exec to visit our internal website to view the information. A teammate emailed the information directly, violating policy and good data stewardship. CEO replied to teammate's email with a big group thank you for \"emailing the information quickly\". reply 1123581321 2 hours agorootparentThat is classic, but you knew it would go like that when you sent the link, didn't you? :) reply refactor_master 10 hours agorootparentprevMy experience is the complete opposite.

Who said anything about an interruption every 20 minutes? We're talking about an artist doing an exhibition at a gallery, by any measure, this is a pretty significant collaboration that is in the artist's best interest and not something their getting spammed with dozens of a times a day. If you read and digest the article, the point is not to create a litmus test based on time-to-response, it's to recognize there are a lot of people to talk a big game but are unserious about achieving shared goals. If an artist is not responsive because they are so serious about their creative process that they don't have time to respond to a gallery doing an exhibition than maybe that's the right thing for what they are serious about, but it does jack shit for the gallery staffer who is serious about creating an exhibition. reply avg_dev 14 hours agoparentprevi did take some issue with the way that point was phrased as well. but, i took it a little more broadly than it was actually specified: people who are not great about communicating or make it hard for you to work with them at the outset will probably continue to be like that throughout the entirety of your working relationship. i watch some videos on the Tested youtube channel, where the host is Adam Savage, who was one of the hosts/creators of the MythBusters tv show, and he often talks about this point, and how he learned it working with Jamie Hyneman early on in his career where they would take clients, and Jamie explained this principal. reply naming_the_user 10 hours agoparentprevYou’re trying to systematise something that is more like basic human nature.

His story of carving out his own job only to find he had no support from the board is what I’ve tried before. In my low performing organization, I thought I could be a high performer by knowing what needed to be done and doing it well.

I'd argue that independently of how you measure success, all other things being equal, having diligence and other civic virtues will get you further, on average. That said, the most interesting lessons are in the first and sixth (the 2nd 6th, the actual 6th) item: How to do a better/more widely scoped job than what you got hired for (by understanding how interests, incentives and responsibilities align in an org) and the fact that in most places, most people are not serious (meaning they tend to not go deeper, look at the big picture, etc.). reply riazrizvi 3 hours agoparentI think the point is more that there are indicators that a person is in conflict with their own mission. Struggles to respond, complains, focuses on the immaterial. I think OP is completely right. When a person is aligned, they get out of their own way, this people are easy to differentiate. One produces mediocre work, the other produces great stuff. I also agree it’s within the power of the individual to be either. reply thih9 1 hour agorootparentI like this view. Still, this seems a way of reasoning about that artist’s success at that particular gallery - perhaps the artist is busy with art projects that are better aligned with them. reply riazrizvi 2 minutes agorootparentQuite likely, though I think we are talking about different things. OP and I are talking to shared alignment, where they came together to sell art for mutual benefit and how to spot good partners to work with. Sure if a partner isn’t good for you, they might have other places where they work well, but I think that’s out of scope to the article IMO. reply thih9 10 hours agoprev> If we want to make the world a better place, we can’t just think about the lofty stuff: we have to get our hands dirty and make sure the economic engine works. This seems a very narrow if not conformist view of art. Artists doing graffiti, participating in hobby groups, state funded projects, discovered by later generations, etc - they don’t care about making viewers feel good about funding; and yet their art can very much make the world a better place. reply trosi 8 hours agoparentIt is perhaps a narrow view, but not an incorrect one. You mention state funded projects, but the funding has to come from somewhere else. What the author is saying is this: it takes money to run a gallery (or a museum, for that matter), therefore even if it is not the primary objective, we should strive to keep the money flowing so that we can make have better galleries/museums. reply Tade0 7 hours agorootparentThe narrowness makes it incorrect. Galleries are necessarily behind the curve because they're businesses and have to stay afloat. You typically don't go to a gallery to see something new, but to see the works of an already established artist. Meanwhile interesting, innovative art happens outside of galleries, but you have to look for it, as there's an oversupply of aspiring artists. Bottom line is you can't base the whole art scene on the opinions of art galleries, as they play it safe and art is strictly about the opposite. reply thih9 7 hours agorootparentprevActually the money doesn’t have to come from anywhere, that’s my point. If we cut all state funding - I’m sure artists would continue making art, as they did for millenia. We encourage art with state funding because we consider it beneficial to the society[1]. The “keep the money flowing” approach distracts from making art and leads to making art that sells well. Do we really want that to dominate galleries/museums?

Most art galleries are businesses. They exhibits artists and artworks that sell. There is nothing un-authentic or dysfunctional about it; to put it more precisely, dysfunctional art galleries won't last very long, just like any other business that offers products that aren't in demand and don't attract buyers.

Talking to a guy in a gallery (in the US, that sells art for other people), the conversation is usually about me (sizing up a sales prospect). Note that galleries I'm talking about are for-profit - selling people's artwork and paying the rent.

In essence the task-oriented leading was switched to area-of-responsibility leading.

Sort of the Wild West over here reply wslh 4 hours agoprev [–] I grew up immersed in the art world—my father is an artist, and my sister is a curator working on exhibitions for institutions like MoMA and the Reina Sofia Museum, and linked to a known dead artist. Based on my lifelong experience in this environment, here are my thoughts: Art as a Business: Selling art is predominantly a business, and, frankly, quality often doesn't play the leading role. Market dynamics, branding, and influence have a much stronger impact on an artist’s commercial success. Many buyers lack a refined taste for art but are guided by curators, galleries, or social trends to invest in one artist over another. This is particularly true outside the realm of blue-chip artists like Picasso, van Gogh, or Bacon, where established market signals guide decisions. Theory and Practice: while I love the theoretical discussions around art (e.g. Walter Benjamin) I find these ideas largely irrelevant to the business side of the art market. Theory has its place in academia and criticism, but it often feels disconnected from the pragmatic realities of selling and promoting art. If you're interested in understanding how the art world operates, I highly recommend visiting Art Basel or similar art fairs. These events showcase the intersection of commerce, curation, and culture, providing a fascinating snapshot of the art market's priorities and trends. I personally did my own art intervention with technology and received known artists who wanted to participated in the experiment and beyond the project originality it would not work in other contexts without some validation (being in a space in Wynwood [1]).

    "originLink": "https://commoncog.com/c/cases/y-combinator-power/",
    "originBody": "On September 10, 2010, AdGrok founder Antonio Garcia-Martinez was hanging out at co-founder Argyris Zymnis’s San Francisco apartment when he received a call from Rodger Cole. Rodger Cole was a litigator at Fenwick & West, and Fenwick & West was one of the big three Silicon Valley law firms. Getting an unexpected call from your law firm is never a good sign — this was no exception. Cole told them they had just been sued by Adchemy, their former employer. This wasn’t entirely a surprise — when Garcia-Martinez and his co-founders Argyris and Matthew McEachen left Adchemy together to start their new company, Adchemy CEO and their former boss Murthy Nukala made it clear that he was not happy with any of them leaving. Adchemy had sent AdGrok legal warnings a few weeks before filing suit in Santa Clara County Court — these warnings were the “sort of menacing recital of employment-agreement restrictions that serves as the warning shot across the bow in corporate litigation.” The warnings led Garcia-Martinez to secure a preemptive relationship with Fenwick, and explained why it was Cole who received the paperwork. At the time, AdGrok was tiny — all of three guys and their laptops. The startup had gone through the famous Silicon Valley startup accelerator Y Combinator, and had just presented at ‘Demo Day’ — the end-of-program event that marked graduation. Demo Day was a day-long presentation to invited investors, and it marked the start of external fundraising. To say the lawsuit complicated matters was to put it lightly. Adchemy named each of AdGrok’s co-founders personally in the suit, meaning that if they lost, the founders would be personally liable. The amounts involved in the suit effectively meant that all three co-founders would have been financially ruined. The following events, relayed in Garcia-Martinez’s 2016 book Chaos Monkeys, is only one side of the story; it is not the definitive account of the events that transpired. But that definitive account might not exist: none of the other actors ever commented extensively about the battle. That said, the provenance distracts from the purpose of this case. This isn’t really about Garcia-Martinez. Rather, this story is about the actions of Y Combinator, the startup accelerator and investor that Garcia-Martinez allied with, and the moves that its principals executed to protect one of its tiny companies. It is also a story of power in Silicon Valley. The Stakes At the time of the lawsuit, Adchemy had raised nearly $60M dollars, and was much larger than AdGrok’s three person team. AdGrok, on the other hand, was struggling to fundraise, and struggling to get the lawyers from Fenwick to defend them in exchange for equity (this was so that they wouldn’t have to pay the lawyers desperately-needed cash). Through some finagling, Garcia-Martinez got legendary Silicon Valley attorney Ted Wang to agree to a $250,000 loan in payment for their services, to be paid either with cash, or with a combination of equity and equity options. Wang was invested in this for more than just financial reasons; to hear Garcia-Martinez tell it, the attorney was also angry that Adchemy had violated Silicon Valley’s unspoken norms. (For the sake of innovation and the good of the overall ecosystem, it was frowned-upon for large companies to attack fly-sized startups). Fenwick immediately went to work. Litigator Rodger Cole started “firing sharply worded missives” at Santa Clara County court, rebutting Adchemy’s filed claims, offering to provide externally audited code as proof of innocence, and began the process of hostile depositions (which would suck up time and energy from Adchemy’s executives, including Murthy Nukala himself). But this conventional legal battle was mostly a front: AdGrok could not afford a drawn-out legal entanglement. The key to getting out of the lawsuit was to lean on Adchemy’s weaknesses. What weaknesses did Adchemy have? Garcia-Martinez writes that it had two: It had investors, which sat on its board. This mattered, because board members with voting power could elect to kick out the CEO. Adchemy’s venture capital (VC) investors were from famous firms, and not too difficult to find: they were John Johnston from August Capital and Yogen Dalal from the Mayfield Fund. It had potential business partners — which in Adchemy’s case was doubly important, for the company was floundering. Adchemy had — up to this point — only one major customer for its lead-generation product: Accenture. The entire company was running gigantic losses, with no real chance of turning on real product revenue; Murthy needed to pull in a new business partner to look good in time for Adchemy’s next round of fundraising. Through a stroke of luck, Garcia-Martinez discovered that Murthy was working on a major deal with Microsoft. If AdGrok could attack either or both weaknesses, Adchemy was likely to back off. The only question was how. The Knife The first angle of attack was with Adchemy’s investors. Here AdGrok was helped by a change in startup funding dynamics that Garcia-Martinez argues had taken place around the start of the 2010s. The argument he makes goes something like this: traditionally, the earliest stages of startup fundraising was once done either by using up the entrepreneur’s own savings, or from raised funds from friends or families, or from business ‘angels’ — wealthy individuals who for fun or profit were willing to put their personal money into tiny, nascent companies. This changed in the early 2010s, in part due to the emergence of the tech bubble of that decade (propped up, no doubt, by low interest rates). But it was also changed by the emergence of a new generation of rich ex-founders and early-employees — the result of the Google IPO, and also a smattering of startup acquisitions over the course of the late 1990s and 2000s. These newly rich individuals became investors, and some of these folks — such as ex-Googler and prominent angel Chris Sacca — raised small funds in the $20 million to $40 million range. This meant that the angels now had enough firepower to invest $200,000 checks instead of $20,000 checks — and early stage startups could go longer without talking to VC firms. This change in capital environment dovetailed with a change in software development during the time. “The emergence of turnkey, on-demand computation like Amazon Web Services, plus off-the-shelf Web-development frameworks like Ruby on Rails, meant that new ideas were easier than ever to test.” Garcia-Martinez writes, “Many entrepreneurs chose to build shovels rather than dig for gold, creating more complex software building blocks to underpin the innovation, such as back-end services like Parse, accelerating the startup explosion in an almost exponential way.” All of this meant that by the time AdGrok was formed, it was not shocking for a two-month-old company “with a persuasive CEO” to raise $2 million and have the raise be termed a ‘seed’ round. Nor was it shocking to find these startups hitting its milestones in six months, and raising its next round not too long after the ink had dried on the earlier checks. Garcia-Martinez continues (bold emphasis added): With so much money, of all sizes and levels, waiting to invest, the best entrepreneurs had the luxury of choosing investors, rather than vice versa, and many investors found themselves anxiously trying to get into rounds. Due to contracts stipulating that investors in one round had the right to invest in the next, as well as personal ties between investors and entrepreneurs, investors getting in on oversubscribed A rounds had to be there in the seed round to earn that place. And that was true going up the various funding levels. That means VCs who would formerly say “Get back to me when you’re raising a series A or B, kid” were basically blocked from popular companies by investors who had nurtured and supported the company since it had been two guys in a trashy office. Heavyweight funds like Mayfield and August knew this, and started doing seed investing, not to own some little piece of a company (they could write small checks all day and still not invest their entire funds) but merely as an option on the real rounds down the road. This change in dynamic meant that Y Combinator had a unique position in the Silicon Valley ecosystem. Garcia-Martinez continues (again, bold emphasis added): … in the day-to-day, the lifeblood of a VC wasn’t money, it was deal flow. Getting a first look at a potential Uber or Airbnb is what distinguishes a first-class VC from an also-ran. Given Y Combinator’s immense success in drawing the best entrepreneurs, it had a quasi-stranglehold on the best early-stage deal flow in the Valley. And since early-stage deal flow today translated into later-stage deal flow tomorrow, via the follow-on investing phenomena described, Y Combinator was the gatekeeper to the best present and future deals in the Valley. Like control of the water supply in some arid agricultural region, whoever had the most upstream control of the water sluice controlled everything else—which is what Y Combinator’s Demo Day represented. Thus, powerful and haughty VCs who wanted to attend Y Combinator’s showcase pitch event had to kneel and kowtow to a sandal-wearing bear of a man with a distaste for bullshit and a flair for the written word. That man was Paul Graham, without question the canniest tech investor in human history. And it was to Paul Graham we first turned with our existential problem in those desperate days. (...) It was all the more impressive because I had miscast PG as a sort of avuncular, academic presence who dabbled in dense essays about startups, hosted founder dinners, and wrote a few checks. Nothing could be further from the truth. Y Combinator was the sort of unforgiving power player that remembered the names of investors who had crossed portfolio companies in the past, or who had disseminated unflattering portraits of YC, and blacklisted them from any YC dealings, or from the minds of YC founders. This was done with little thought of the size of their funds or their influence in the Valley, leaving more than one self-important VC sputtering at a dressing-down, or left out of a round because the company’s founders had gotten a warning from PG. The harsh reality is this: to have influence in the world, you need to be willing and able to reward your friends and punish your enemies. When Graham first learnt of the lawsuit, he emailed Murthy to discuss the matter. Murthy was polite and deferential, but did not budge on his position. The lawsuit was still on. Undeterred, Graham emailed Garcia-Martinez: “Come meet me at home to discuss this on Saturday. Come alone, don’t bring the others, and try to keep them out of it.” (Graham’s goal: to spare AdGrok’s other co-founders from the drama, so that they could continue building whilst the lawsuit resolved itself). And so Garcia-Martinez arrived at PG’s house in Old Palo Alto. PG shared his anti-Adchemy game plan. In a nutshell: YC would anathematize Adchemy’s VCs, and declare that they’d never do business with YC again unless they straightened this out. Knowing PG, not only would they be disinvited from Demo Day, but PG would probably also steer companies to take money from other funds instead. Given that many if not most YC funding rounds were oversubscribed with investors, an excommunicated investor could be excluded without damaging the fund-raising company at all. At the end of the day, who really gave a shit if the check came from August versus Sequoia? That money was just as green either way. That meant that those funds would start losing YC deals wholesale to their competitors, and, as we reviewed earlier, getting locked out in the early rounds likely meant the same in the even juicier later ones. PG was about to flush a whole chunk of their deal flow down the toilet, just like that. I smiled, imagining the sputtering fits pitched by the partners over at Mayfield and August when PG read them the riot act. YC was actually willing to sever ties with some of the most illustrious names in Valley investing over the piss squirt that was AdGrok. It may seem like nothing to you, reader, who maybe inhabits a normal realm of twenty-first-century economic life where things like tit-for-tat reciprocity enforce social codes. But in the passive-aggressive popularity contest that is Silicon Valley, someone actually going to bat for you—really going to bat, like telling important people to go fuck themselves—that’s rarer and more short-lived than a snowflake in a bonfire. I thanked PG profusely, and then he padded back into the kitchen for his lunch. The next weakness was Adchemy’s big deal with Microsoft. Here Garcia-Martinez turned to (then) fellow YC founder and mentor, Sam Altman. [In 2016, when the book was published] Sam Altman is the current head of Y Combinator, and the person whom Paul Graham has entrusted with transforming his brainchild into a long-lived and scalable institution. In 2010, he was CEO and founder of Loopt, a company that had pioneered the location-check-in product that Foursquare would later eclipse (only to itself stumble), and which Facebook eventually worked into its product. At the time, though, Loopt was still a location player, and Sam would take an hour out of his busy week, usually late afternoon on a Friday, to field whatever questions I had, no agenda required. The boys came along for the first session, and never again. I think they were scared of him, and with good reason. In one of PG’s essays on desirable founder qualities, he had this to say about Sam: “You could parachute him into an island full of cannibals and come back in five years and he’d be the king.” I believed it, as did the boys. His official AdGrok nickname was “Manson Lamps,” after Tony Soprano’s psychotic rival, who possessed an intense and unsettling stare. This was a flip and admittedly unfair comparison; Sam never proved himself anything other than a capable operator and loyal friend to YC companies. ‘Sama’, as Altman was widely known, was a well-connected node in Silicon Valley: “you know him, and you’re not more than two hops from anybody that matters.” Garcia-Martinez emailed Sama to ask if he knew anyone on the Microsoft deal team with Adchemy, explaining, solicitously, what Murthy was attempting to do to AdGrok. Sama called to clarify. Garcia-Martinez describes what happened next: Sam Altman assured me he’d try to do the best he could, and promptly cut off the call. A week went by. Driving on the 280, I saw his number flash on my phone and pulled over; Sam Altman cannot be dealt with at eighty miles per hour. “So I talked to [name redacted], who is Adchemy’s business-development contact at Microsoft. He assures me he brought up the AdGrok issue in one of their meetings with Adchemy. He stated it was going to be problematic if Adchemy was embroiled in litigation while discussing the Microsoft deal.” I almost dropped my phone. This was precisely the decapitated horse’s head in Murthy’s bed that we needed. Murthy, with his back against the wall, running short of cash and with no salable product even remotely on the horizon, needed both the accounting and the marketing win of a big infusion of Microsoft money. Weasel that he was, Murthy had an overriding sense of self-preservation, and was still rational enough to realize that destroying AdGrok was not worth destroying Adchemy in the process. If indeed Microsoft BD had raised a flag about AdGrok, there’s no way Adchemy could continue the suit. It would be suicidal. “Sam, I don’t know how to thank you for this.” “No problem.” Click. The Resolution Garcia-Martinez did not have eyes everywhere, of course. Much later, he learnt that PG’s pressure on Adchemy’s investors was working: One of our investor friends had visited Mayfield Capital on unrelated business. Given the open nature of most VC offices, with all conference rooms and partner spaces facing some airy, sunny central area, he could see that Yogen Dalal, the managing partner for the Adchemy investment and Silicon Valley notable, was in a conference room having what appeared to be a strained conversation with Murthy. Board meetings or advisory sessions (not that Murthy took advice from anyone) should have taken place at Adchemy, not Mayfield, at that stage. That, plus the timing, signaled that this conversation was likely about AdGrok. It seemed that PG had delivered, and Adchemy’s investors had started putting the squeeze on Murthy, using their moral (not to mention financial) suasion to get Adchemy to retire the suit. In late October Adchemy’s tone changed abruptly: where before they were menacing, now they were conciliatory. AdGrok received an offer to dismiss the suit. By February the whole ordeal was over, but for the lawyer’s fees. The three co-founders signed some token agreements, and sent Fenwick a copy of their code for safekeeping (they encrypted the zip archive; so confident were they that nobody would even bother to check). AdGrok had won. But the episode was not without cost. A few years later, on the event of Adchemy’s death in 2014, Garcia-Martinez would post on Facebook: Through the most dogged persistence, we managed to raise a seed round in the teeth of a bitter lawsuit, and continued to fund operations. But the damage had been done. My co-founders and I were tired of the fight, and the startup adventure for us had been a yearlong, unremitting existential battle that had subsumed whatever product vision we had. The company sold to Twitter in May 2011 and the product disappeared. In a way, Murthy won in the end. After raising around $120 million in funding, Adchemy was bought by Walmart Labs for an alleged $30-$40 million — a “fire-sale ‘acquisition’”. Many employees who purchased stock in the company lost their savings, and the investors lost most if not all of their capital. Murthy Nukala, on the other hand, managed to negotiate a $2.4 million golden parachute deal for himself, and various other amounts for a small group of Adchemy executives. All of those deals were multiples of their salaries. If the Business Insider article reporting this arrangement is to be believed, Murthy walked away rich, while stiffing his employees and investors in the back. To our knowledge, Garcia-Martinez never crossed paths with Nukala again.

If you happen to be in YC’s good graces, they will reward you in ways described in the article. If you’re not, they won’t take the time. I was in YC in 2012 (2 yrs after the founder writing this article, and one of the last years PG was directly involved). By that time it was clear that YC had turned into a “spray and pray” accelerator, meaning they started favoring volume of investments over everything else. When they did that, it also required that they split their attention between more companies, which inevitably meant that the sort of anecdotes described in the article still happen, but only for companies YC likes and believes in post-accelerator. YC definitely discriminates from that perspective- they choose which startups they think have the most promise during any given batch, and they give those founders preferential treatment. Which is to be expected. How else can you scale an accelerator? reply rqtwteye 4 hours agoparentWhy does everything need to scale? Why couldn't they stick to taking a few high quality companies every year? There was enough money to be made that way. Seems the belief is that everything needs to scale until it doesn't work anymore. reply dasil003 3 hours agorootparentAs much as I resonate with your sentiment, it's the incentives that investors have that cause them to behave this way, not an inherent belief in scale at all costs. Keep in mind, YC is very early stage. Asking them to pick only winners based on an application and short interview process would be a fool's errand. I believe their acceptance rates tend to be around 2%, so it's not like they aren't being selective up front—it just takes time to really get signal on who is executing and finding traction. Startup investment is high risk and justified by the outliers, so they have every incentive to find them early, it only makes sense that they would give more support to their winners as they emerge. reply tfehring 20 minutes agorootparentprevIt wouldn’t have to scale, but I’m glad that it did. It’s likely that there’s been somewhat more innovation and economic growth in the world over the last ~decade than there would have been if YC stayed smaller. reply light_triad 2 hours agorootparentprevThe need to scale is inevitable if you consider 2 trends: startups have become mainstream and the internet is orders of magnitude bigger. When YC applications consisted mostly of PG essay readers the chance of success per company was higher. Also some niche ideas can now work because of a more developed communications infrastructure, easy payments, better targeting, etc. And knowing which companies are high quality is almost impossible at the early stages. reply llamaimperative 1 hour agorootparentNeither of those lead to a need to scale. Those are enabling factors, at best. reply fragmede 1 hour agorootparentThere needs to be an ROI, YC isn't funding companies out of the goodness of their hearts. So the additional size means they have to bet on Uber and Lyft and Flywheel and every other competitor in that space in order to guarantee a return, because they only win if they bet on every horse. You can't do that if you keep small since the number of entrants got bigger. Hence scaling is necessary for them. reply llamaimperative 16 minutes agorootparentSure, but that's not the argument that was being made. This is just generically: VC works by power laws so larger portfolios are generally preferable to smaller ones. reply itsoktocry 2 hours agorootparentprev>Why couldn't they stick to taking a few high quality companies every year? Because they don't actually have the ability to pick high-quality companies. reply theptip 2 hours agorootparentprevAs the article states, YC’s key asset is their deal flow. You simply don’t get that if you only write 1% of the best seed checks. If you don’t eat the pie, someone else will. If someone else eats more pie than you, they will be stronger than you and eat your pie. Switching analogies, unless you have a defensible niche with a wide moat, your position of power is an unstable equilibrium; in the open market only a monopoly is a stable attractor state. reply uoaei 3 hours agorootparentprevSo you're saying the \"Peter principle\" extends beyond tech employee performance and to tech company funding. reply zeroonetwothree 2 hours agorootparentIf the Peter principle is just “you succeed until you don’t” then it’s tautological and applies in all contexts. reply fsckboy 46 minutes agorootparentprevno, it's not the Peter Principle. The Peter Principle is pointing out that if you keep getting promoted by doing an exceptional job, and you stop getting promoted when you stop, that you have ended up leaving a job you were exceptional at, and landing in a job you are not good at. In a certain sense it's saying \"you should be demoted back to your last job that you were exceptional at\"; it's not suggesting that, it's suggesting a sort of snarky \"this whole system is set up to fail\" because it's from a \"isn't capitalism grubby\" perspective. None of this flavor is in the general YC scaling case, though you may be able to find it in various places within that. reply wat10000 1 hour agorootparentprevTo venture capitalists, “enough money” is a nonsense phrase, much in the same way that a typical computer enthusiast would see the phrase “enough RAM.” reply glaugh 1 hour agoparentprevI was in the S12 batch. A couple years later we were demonstrably failing. I emailed the general YC advice line or something similar with a question, and pg responded with a thoughtful comment that was genuinely useful I don’t think there’s any chance he saw any economic value in us, he took that time because he cared about startups and well-meaning failures like us It’s a small thing, yes, but I’ve always thought it said a lot about him reply conductr 3 hours agoparentprevI think they do this for any portfolio company and nothing is special about AdGrok here, if that’s what you imply with “good graces”. It’s a total power flex move that keeps the valley in check. If they allow this to take place they will have all their portfolio companies consumed in legal disputes in no time. They went after both the company and the VCs to send a message that this behavior won’t be tolerated.

One glaring flaw of well-capitalized large tech (perhaps the only one) is thinking they can build something better internally, when they have enough cash to simply buy best of breed off the market.

They just thought that the internet didn't really matter that much. Google in 2022 knew that LLMs mattered, and had spent a ton of money, but OpenAI just got a better product to market faster. reply miltava 5 hours agorootparentprevI think that maybe we underestimate how hard it is to choose the right companies to “kill” when you’re a competitor. The default mode is to say that they won’t go anywhere because of many factors (they don’t have the resources, the access, the capability, etc). But sometimes they do. And in restrospect it’s obvious, but it’s not by the time you had the chance to stop it. And I think it’s probably good. reply allenjhyang 4 hours agorootparentAlso hard to marshal the resources you need internally to \"kill\" a competitor.

Time is a big investment for such accelerators and as such, diligently choosing which companies to invest time into is their most valuable decision. reply nsedlet 4 hours agoparentprevI do agree. But the thing I would add though is that at least when I was there (W2012 - we were in the same batch!) YC and PG in particular were vocal about principles they believed in, especially the idea that naive young founders get kicked around in Silicon Valley and ought to be treated fairly. PG talked about this constantly and of course it’s a big theme of his essays. I remember one particular instance where a potential investor was behaving questionably and PG offered to step in and talk to them if they crossed a certain line (which they did not in the end). He was clear about what he concerned acceptable and unacceptable and why. And we were nowhere near the cool end of the batch. Yes YC acts in its interests but in my experience they live by good principles and that makes all the difference. The Chaos Monkeys anecdote is an example of that. So I don’t agree with the article’s framing that they throw their weight around to simply exercise whatever power they have over others for financial gain. reply danaris 4 hours agoparentprevScaling is not a right, nor a duty, nor an inevitability. reply brudgers 7 hours agoparentprevfor companies YC likes and believes in post-accelerator.

In the economy as a whole how many people are even business owners? Most people go to work and price take at their job without negotiating, without even moving area, without even studying, etc. You also have multi-company-monopoly effects for lack of a better term, e.g. if there are 10 competitors that make semiconductors - _everyone_ needs semiconductors, then if you pick the appropriate balance and don't buy in at an overvalued time you can invest in all ten and still make money because there is a net flow of funds into the system from outside of it. reply sebastiennight 4 hours agorootparentIs \"oligopoly\" the word you were looking for? reply fragmede 8 hours agorootparentprevBecause it's an imperfect metaphor for how VC investing works to further enrich the wealthy. reply ec109685 10 hours agoprevThe way YC closed ranks was my favorite anecdote from Chaos Monkey’s.

The problem is it's a particularly dysfunctional sort. \"They're against cancel culture... so why didn't they invite me to their house party? What hypocrites!\" reply LittleTimothy 8 hours agorootparentI think the difference between cancel culture and just freedom of association is the difference between \"I don't want to work with you because of X\" and \"I'm going to influence others not to work with you because of X\".

So as much as we want to be able to simplify and not get lost in the weeds of interpersonal drama, we can't just say any behavior in that vague direction is toxic. If X is \"he is a bad person and is going to make false claims and lie and cheat and steal from you, has repeatedly done this, and there is legally admissible evidence of this\", that's a totally different thing from X is \"he looked at me funny and, I dunno, I just feel a bad energy coming from him\" amplified by the social media megaphone. reply 0xDEAFBEAD 6 hours agorootparentprevI think there may be a few other differences. For example, are people ever given the opportunity to change their behavior before the sanction gets applied? Does the punishment fit the crime? Is there public shaming involved? Do we default to public shaming anyone who says a word in defense of the person who is being sanctioned? (I would say that's the single most pathological feature of cancel culture, actually.) Are the rules constantly shifting in line with social media fashions? Are our judgments carefully considered, or are they based on shallow pattern matching? Cancel culture applies to discussions of policy in the public square. The idea is that certain views should be silenced. You can be a believer in free speech, and disagree that those views should be silenced. And then you can work to punish malicious actors in Silicon Valley who violate important investing norms. I just don't think there's a contradiction! reply kmeisthax 24 minutes agorootparent> Do we default to public shaming anyone who says a word in defense of the person who is being sanctioned? (I would say that's the single most pathological feature of cancel culture, actually.) From the article: > PG shared his anti-Adchemy game plan. In a nutshell: YC would anathematize Adchemy’s VCs, and declare that they’d never do business with YC again unless they straightened this out. Knowing PG, not only would they be disinvited from Demo Day, but PG would probably also steer companies to take money from other funds instead. Given that many if not most YC funding rounds were oversubscribed with investors, an excommunicated investor could be excluded without damaging the fund-raising company at all. In other words, yes, YC was engaging in what the US Government would call \"secondary sanctions\": actions taken to cut the sanctioned individual or group off from support. This and the other things you mentioned have both happened and not happened in various instances of cancellation. I think you might have some motivated reasoning going on here. It sounds like you are trying to make a distinction between sanctions imposed by people you agree with and people you don't. This is a distinction without a difference. Secondary sanctions are the most effective form of sanctions[0]. Everyone imposes secondary sanctions if they feel they can get away with it, because sanctions without secondary sanctions have no teeth. [0] Why? Simple: they force everyone in the room to not only make a choice between the intolerant and the sanctioned, but if they choose the intolerant, to also enforce that same decision upon others. In other words, they're \"GPL viral\". reply uoaei 3 hours agorootparentprev> Do we default to public shaming anyone who says a word in defense of the person who is being sanctioned? Defaulting to public debate on the matter isn't as stark a difference from this behavior as we want to believe, especially when the community in which you engage these points is so heavily biased in one direction. Discussions around \"cancel culture\" rarely take into account that the conversations being had are happening within a particular cultural context, one that depends on the venue in which it takes place. Too often I see public shaming framed as reasoned debate on this forum when the intention is otherwise abundantly clear. An amusing corrollary to this is that cancel culture as normally defined is implied to be the majority opinion. I don't think that's true, though, the nature of news media definitely amplifies certain voices over others, getting back to the point about venues above. reply shkkmo 1 hour agorootparentprev> And then you can work to punish malicious actors in Silicon Valley who violate important investing norms. That's a pretty generous way of framing it. It's not like this was a concerted effort to protect all small start ups or change employment law to protect founders from legal action from former employers.

Robert Moses (the subject of the book) was an unparalleled genius when it came to enacting his will, but he was a complete idiot when it came to actually observing the world to see what the impact of his will would be. I think democracy at its best should prevent those kind of people from gaining power (but of course it doesn't). Elon Musk can be easily dismissed as someone who seems to be constantly changing his mind, but is actually deeply unwell, addicted to drugs, and surrounded by sycophants. His mind is about as interesting as his friends Kanye West and Donald Trump: he was very good at one thing, it made him extremely successful, it entirely broke his brain.

But it was also changed by the emergence of a new generation of rich ex-founders and early-employees — the result of the Google IPO, and also a smattering of startup acquisitions over the course of the late 1990s and 2000s. These newly rich individuals became investors, and some of these folks — such as ex-Googler and prominent angel Chris Sacca — raised small funds in the $20 million to $40 million range. This meant that the angels now had enough firepower to invest $200,000 checks instead of $20,000 checks — and early stage startups could go longer without talking to VC firms. I feel like this timeline is off. I lived in San Francisco in the first half of the 2010s and the big turning point wasn't Google's IPO but Facebook's. Cost of living was already inflated by then ($2-3k/mo for a SoMa studio) but after end of the lockout period, the property prices started to really grow out of control and the number of luxury cars driving around SF exploded.

It was a subversion of democracy, but one that required spreading the wealth around. Because Moses never had to run for office (and the one time he did, he failed spectacularly), he pioneered a purely bureaucratic form of corruption that conspired to extract as much money from the federal and state governments as possible and pour all of it into this ever turning hamster wheel of massive public works that weren't really for the public and didn't work, but did enrich the powerful people who took part in it.

    "originBody": "I’ve been using Haskell in production for 8 years. I’ve been using OCaml in production for 8 months. It’s time to compare those two languages. Syntax Haskell probably has the most elegant syntax across all languages I’ve seen (maybe Idris is better because dependently typed code can become ugly in Haskell really quickly). There’s utter joy in expressing your ideas by typing as few characters as possible. OCaml, being a language from the ML family is great too, but still, Haskell is more tacit. Compare a few examples: Sum of all numbers in a string Using just the standard library Haskell -- strSum \"100 -42 15\" = 73 strSum :: String -> Int strSum = sum . map read . words OCaml (* str_sum \"100 -42 15\" = 73 *) let str_sum (str: string): int = str |> String.split_on_char ' ' |> List.filter_map int_of_string_opt |> List.fold_left (+) 0 Defining a new binary tree type Haskell data Tree a = LeafNode a (Tree a) (Tree a) OCaml type 'a tree =LeafNode of 'a * 'a tree * 'a tree Parsing Return the result on successful parsing of lines like the one below where “Status” equals to zero and the result is an even number \"Status: -1Result: 42\" Haskell parseLine :: String -> Maybe Int parseLine line = do [\"Status:\", \"0\", _, \"Result:\", result]Some result_ -> None in let* n = int_of_string_opt result in if n mod 2 = 0 then Some n else None The above are just a few random code snippets. They don’t give an idea of all possible programs that could be written in those languages. But I hope they can quickly highlight the similarities and differences between the two languages. This slowly leads us to the next point. Features Haskell has waaaaaay more features than probably any other programming language (well, C++ can compete). This is both good and bad. It’s good because you have the tools to solve your problems in the best way. It’s bad because you have those tools. They’re distracting. Every time I need to solve a problem in Haskell, I’m immediately thinking about all the ways I can design the solution instead of, ahem, actually implementing this solution. I’m interested in building stuff, not sitting near my pond on a warm summer day, thinking if TypeFamilies + DataKinds would be better than GADTs for making illegal states unrepresentable. If I come to an existing OCaml project, the worst thing previous developers could do to it is have poor variable names, minimal documentation, and 200+ LOC functions. That’s fine, nothing extraordinary, I can handle that. If I come to an existing Haskell project, the worst thing previous developers could do… Well, my previous 8 years of Haskell experience can’t prepare me for that 😅 That’s why I feel more productive in OCaml. I do miss some Haskell features at times. But I’ve seen their ugly side and what they can do to your output. Consider the following table with a full comparison of major features. Feature comparison table Feature OCaml Haskell Expression-oriented syntax ✅ ✅ Immutability by default ✅ ✅ Higher-Order Functions (HOFs) ✅ ✅ Anonymous functions (lambdas) ✅ ✅ Algebraic Data Types (ADTs) ✅ ✅ Pattern Matching ✅ ✅ Parametric Polymorphism ✅ ✅ Type Inference ✅ ✅ Monadic Syntax Sugar ✅ ✅ Garbage Collector ✅ ✅ Multithreading ✅ ✅ GADTs ✅ ✅ Purity by default ❌ ✅ Composable laziness ❌ ✅ Type classes ❌ ✅ Higher-Kinded Types ❌ ✅ Opt-in language features ❌ ✅ First-class modules ✅ ❌ Polymorphic variants ✅ ❌ Objects ✅ ❌ Classes and Inheritance ✅ ❌ Ergonomic mutability ✅ ❌ Ecosystem Let’s be honest, both programming languages are niche FP langs. So you shouldn’t expect first-class support for the latest modern framework that just got published. However, in my experience, despite needing to write more custom bindings, you have solutions for the majority of common tasks. For example, in OCaml, you can find: otoml: A TOML parser Mint Tea: A TUI framework ocaml-opentelemetry: Instrumentation for OpenTelemetry awsm: OCaml AWS Client petrol: An OCaml SQL API made to go FAST And so on. Similar story for Haskell. I’d still say that the Haskell ecosystem has more packages and more ready-to-go solutions. It’s easy to show the difference in the following example. Number of Stripe API client libraries: Haskell: 13 OCaml: 1 (last change was 8 years ago, so it’s more like zero) You may find a solution in Haskell. But often you’ll discover too many solutions, you won’t know which one to choose. Choosing a library in Haskell becomes a separate skill you need to master. Haskellers even blog their recommendations on how to choose a library! And you’ll face this dilemma over and over again. Often, a new Haskell library is created not because it solves a different problem. But because the author wanted to write it differently (using different abstractions, playing with new features, etc. Who doesn’t want a new streaming library based on LinearTypes???). It’s not exciting to write a GitHub API client and parse tons of JSON. But it is exciting to design a logger with comonads. Tooling The Haskell tooling evokes the most controversial feelings. It’s like an emotional roller coaster: 🤩 Hoogle is the best! I can search through the entire ecosystem by using just a type signature!!! 😨 Wait, why build tooling error messages are so bad, what do you mean it couldn’t find a build plan for a working project??? 🤩 Global content-addressable storage for all dependencies is such an amazing idea!!! 😨 What do you mean I need to recompile my IDE because I changed my package??? 🤩 I can automatically test all the code snippets in my package docs!!! 😨 Wait, why the standard library doesn’t have docs at all for this version I use??? And so on. Using Haskell tooling is like always being in the quantum superposition of “How do you even use other PLs without such wholesome Haskell tools???” and “How Haskellers can live like that without these usability essentials???”. OCaml, on the other hand, hits differently. Because its ecosystem is smaller, you actually get surprised every time you find something working! For example, the VSCode plugin for OCaml based on Language Server Protocol (LSP) works out-of-the-box. I never had any issues with it. It just works ™ The ergonomics of starting with OCaml tooling might not be the best but they’re straightforward and robust. And they work most of the time. To get a full picture, refer to the following table for the full comparison of available tooling in both languages. Tooling comparison table Tool OCaml Haskell Compiler ocaml ghc REPL utop ghci Build tool dune cabal, stack Package manager opam cabal Package repository opam Hackage Toolchain installer - ghcup Linter zanuda hlint Formatter ocamlformat, topiary fourmolu, stylish-haskell, hindent, ormolu Type Search Sherlodoc Hoogle Code search Sherlocode Hackage Search Online playground TryOCaml Haskell Playground LSP ocaml-lsp HLS Compiler messages I want to highlight the compiler aspect of tooling separately since this is the tool you interact the most with. Especially, compiler suggestions. When using FP languages, the compiler is your best friend! You rely on it heavily to understand why your assumptions haven’t been codified precisely. Therefore, the compiler must present the information in the most accessible way. In my view, Haskell compiler messages tend to be verbose with lots of contextual, often redundant, and distracting information. OCaml compiler messages, on the other hand, are quite succinct. Sometimes too succinct. Consider the following example. Haskell: Compiler messages example Program with an error x = 1 + [3, 1, 2] Compiler output Haskell Compiler Error Message OCaml: Compiler messages example Program with an error let x = 1 + [3; 1; 2] Compiler output OCaml Compiler Error Message This is just one example (and most likely not the best one), but you can already see the differences in how information is presented and how types work in different languages. Standard library I believe the standard library deserves a separate mention too. It shapes your first program in a language and guides you through all future journeys. A great standard library is a cornerstone of your PL success. A poor standard library is a cornerstone of never-ending bikesheds about a better standard library (including an endless variety of alternative competing standard libraries). I’m a big proponent of the idea that a standard library should be batteries-included. Give me an Option-like type, a UTF-8 string, Map and HashMap, JSON and XML parsers, async primitives, and so on, so I can avoid learning your poor implementation of dependency tracking and build tooling. (Build Systems a la Carte is a thorough analysis of the space of dependency trackers and build tools.). Both Haskell and OCaml have kinda barebones standard libraries. They have minor differences (e.g. Haskell doesn’t include Map and HashMap; OCaml doesn’t have non-empty lists and Bitraversable). But overall they’re similar in the spirit. The Haskell standard library is called base and OCaml standard library is called.. well, it’s just “the standard library”. base: The Haskell Standard Library OCaml: The standard library However, one difference is striking. The quality of Haskell documentation sometimes can amaze even a seasoned developer. Haskell has a few more nice features, like the ability to jump to sources from docs but I’ve been told such features are being cooked for OCaml too 👀 Compare a few doc snippets for the List data type (one of the fundamental structures in FP): Haskell Haskell: Data.List.head Haskell head Haskell: !? Haskell index OCaml OCaml: List.hd OCaml hd OCaml: List.nth_opt OCaml nth_opt You may argue that the result of such functions is obvious, therefore there’s no need to write essays under each function. I’m a fan of example-driven documentation, and I love seeing usage examples in docs! This immediately gives me an idea of how I can leverage the API in the best way. Conclusion I want to end this blog post by saying: Both languages came a long way to support real industrial needs. They’re still small compared to mainstream languages. If you’re not critically dependent on the presence of some specific SDK, you can choose any and have lots of joy while coding your next app 🧡 However, I prefer OCaml nowadays because I feel that I can focus on actually building stuff with this language.

Disagree; if I did agree, then I would probably use something from the APL family or maybe Factor. reply johnnyjeans 10 minutes agoparentFor me, my problem with Haskell's syntax is less rooted in the fact that it's in the ML-family. It's more to do with just how horrific complex type aliases can end up being thanks to currying. Imagine we have type aliases that are built up out of function signatures, made up of more aliases of function signatures, and this is a tower of some 20 layers deep. If you're working with types at different levels of this tower of garbage at the same time, you very quickly end up in an associativity hell and the type signatures you have to work with are beyond unhelpful. Combination of both the flaws of currying as a concept, as well as the complexity of Haskell's type system. reply bbminner 12 hours agoparentprevI agree. I have limited experience with FPs, and I can get a hang of what is happening in OCaml examples relatively easily, but Haskell examples feel more like something akin to Forth - if I really needed, I could parse it with my brain, but cryptic one liners like that feel more like \"puzzles\" than an actual useful program. reply kqr 6 hours agorootparentI feel like there's nuance here that a lot of people don't mention. There are the actual puzzles that have been minified beyond recognition, and one has to work backwards to figure out what clearer code the author started from. I don't think anyone likes this code, but it gets written by people who are more used to writing code than reading it. There is also the incredibly clear, straight-forward code that could have come from any other language. If you manage a sane production Haskell codebase, you'll have a lot of this. In between those two, there is clear code but which you wouldn't find in any other language. This is code that uses well-known Haskell idioms that anyone who works with a lot of Haskell code will recognise, but which look like puzzles to someone who has not worked with a lot of Haskell. These are things like guard (age person >= 18) $> beer to return Just beer to someone of age, but Nothing to someone underage; Uuid.fromWordsgetRandomgetRandomgetRandomgetRandom to return a randomly generated UUID; maybe (compute_fresh seed) pure cached_value to use a cached value if it exists, computing it from scratch if it did not; or traverse_ $ \\elem -> do error \"stub\" to create a function that loops through a collection and executes a side effect for each element. These look like nonsense to people not familiar with the idioms, but they appear frequently enough that they are no longer puzzles. reply jes5199 13 hours agoparentprevI wrote Haskell for a couple years and I _never_ figured out the indentation rules.

Also, in most functional languages, a let-binding causes type generalisation, which is not the case for a lambda. reply chombier 11 hours agorootparentprevNot exactly the same: `x` is given a polymorphic type (in F) in Haskell (restricted to values in ML) whereas the unannotated let-over-lambda will give `x`a monomorphic type. reply solomonb 11 hours agorootparentprevYou can desugar let bindings that way but often times (as I believe is the case in GHC) you have a `Let` term in your AST. reply Tainnor 13 hours agorootparentprevI'll agree about the weird Haskell indentation rules. But do notation really is just syntactic sugar for a chain of >> and >>= applications (plus \"fail\" for invalid pattern matches). It's not usually pretty or understandable to write it that way, but it's a very simple translation. If the people you talked to couldn't explain it to you, I think they maybe didn't understand it well themselves. reply pyrale 10 hours agorootparentprevThe reason people can’t remember it on the spot is that it’s really not necessary to understand how do-notation desugars in order to use it. People usually check it once, see that it is correct and forget about it. reply tikhonj 11 hours agorootparentprevDo-notation is not all that different—if anything, it is simpler—than async/await syntax that's gotten popular in a bunch of mainstream languages. I don't know if that makes it easy or difficult in an absolute sense, but it isn't any worse than Python/JavaScript/etc. The indentation rules are definitely a mess though :/ reply yodsanklai 8 hours agorootparentprev> I _never_ figured out the indentation rules I'm glad I'm not the only one.

Maybe it helps https://elbear.com/a-user-guide-for-haskell-monads reply worksonmymach 11 hours agorootparentprevTo understand \"do\" you need to understand the underlying >>= and return operators for your monad.

I has three people tell me “it’s just a simple mechanical transformation from lambdas” oh yeah? how? they couldn’t explain that either Scala's for/yield (which is pretty similar) you can literally do an IDE action in IntelliJ to desugar it. I forget the precise Haskell syntax, but do {a >= $ \\a y >>= $ \\b z >>= $ \\c w . Hopefully the pattern is clear. Were there cases where you actually couldn't see how to desugar something, or are you just nitpicking about them calling it a mechanical transformation without being to explain the precise rules? reply mrkeen 11 hours agorootparentprev> I _never_ figured out the indentation rules Weird. Haskell's my preferred language and I thought there was only one indentation rule - if something's further to the right it's part of the same expression, and if something's down it's a new expression. f x y g z ...

I actually love Haskell syntax, it’s by far my favorite language to look at. reply gooosle 13 hours agorootparentPeople often say that before they realize how complex and messy real-world Haskell looks like. The indentation-based rules aren't even defined anywhere except via imperative code in the implementation. reply johnnyjeans 30 minutes agorootparentThat's because real-world Haskell tends to not be idiomatic, and it involves a lot of directly telling GHC what to do. Mathematicians don't have to (and rarely, if ever) make efficient code. GHC is a really advanced and impressive compiler, but that really doesn't amount to much. At some point the language just devolves into understanding what arcane compiler internals you need to invoke, and it's more like a bunch of C macros with a fancy runtime. reply _flux 11 hours agorootparentprevHmm, isn't this the definition? 10.3 of https://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/haskell2010/haskellch10... > The effect of layout is specified in this section by describing how to add braces and semicolons to a laid-out program. I wasn't going to actually read that in detail to see if it makes any sense, though, but it looks very detailed :). reply pyrale 10 hours agorootparentprevNothing forces it to be messy. A well-tended haskell codebase is great. On the oposite, I would say that a poor haskell codebase is painful, but far from being as painful as a poor java/js codebase. Anecdotally, in my years of haskell at separate places, I had to debug/repl maybe had to repl once or twice. I wish I could say that of mycurrent java gig. reply tome 6 hours agorootparentMy experience is similar, and in addition I would say that I have come across badly written, difficult to understand Haskell code, but it was always straightforward to refactor it into something clearly written. reply elbear 10 hours agorootparentprevI've written Haskell code in production and I still find the syntax the most eloquent. And you don't have to know the indentation rules, you just pick them up from usage. Just like you don't have to know the grammar rules. reply brabel 11 hours agorootparentprevIf that's true, that's such a disappointment. I always thought of Haskell as the pinnacle of mathematical discipline in programming (though too hard for me to wrap my head around!). reply johnnyjeans 36 minutes agorootparentHaskell is 30 years old at this point. It was pretty cutting edge in the 90s, but the pinnacle has climbed ever higher. reply mjan22640 10 hours agorootparentprevSuch a pinnacle would be Agda. Haskell has mathematical holes. reply worksonmymach 11 hours agorootparentprevOh sir we call that \"operational semantics\" reply mark_l_watson 5 hours agoparentprevCompiler version issues are a pain. For most programming languages I use, I like to constantly update toolchain and library versions. I fight that tendency with Haskell. “cabal freeze” can be your friend. I now find that using some combination of Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT makes using Haskell more pleasant for processing compiler error and warning messages, suggesting changes to my cabal or stack configuration files, etc. reply bmitc 14 hours agoparentprevThat's interesting you dislike ML syntaxes when they're generally thought to be the cleanest syntaxes. What syntax families do you generally like? Also, Haskell isn't really ML-syntax. I love MLs but find Haskell syntax pretty ugly. reply IshKebab 11 hours agorootparentI also dislike them. And I wouldn't disagree about them being \"the cleanest\", but cleanliness of syntax is only one concern. I also need to be able to mentally parse it, and on that from OCaml is very bad in my experience (haven't used Haskell much so I can't comment on that). I've said this before but if you remove all punctuation and capitalisation from English it will make it look \"cleaner\", but it will also make it awful to read. Look how \"clean\" text is if you get rid of all the spaces! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scriptio_continua#/media/File%... Clearly brilliant. reply bmitc 2 hours agorootparentThe argument you make about literature is one I have made before, but I don't think it applies here. To me, languages with clean syntax aren't just removing things arbitrarily. They remove things that aren't needed or they otherwise have large amounts of consistency. Let's look at three implementations of a doubling function in modern languages where at least two of them are considered \"clean\" syntaxes. F#: let double x = 2 * x Python: def double(x: int) -> int: return 2 * x Rust: fn double(x: i32) -> i32 { return 2 * x; } Tying back to my original point, are the brackets, annotations, semicolons, and return really needed? From my perspective, the answer is no. These are the simplest functions you can have as well. The differences get multiplied over a large codebase. Are people here really making the argument that F# and MLs don't have clean syntax? All three of these functions have the same IDE behavior in terms of types being showcased in the IDE and also in the type-checking processes, with F# and Rust's type-checking happening at the compiler level and Python's happening with MyPy. People might argue that I left off type annotations for F#, and that's true, but I did so because they aren't required for F# to compile and have the same IDE features like the other languages. Even if I did, it would look like: F# with type annotations: let double (x: int) : int = 2 * x which is still cleaner. reply steveklabnik 1 hour agorootparentIdiomatic Rust would look like this: fn double(x: i32) -> i32 { 2 * x } The reason Rust requires types here is because global inference is computationally expensive and causes spooky action at a distance. The only real difference between your F# and this is the braces, which I do personally think makes code easier to read. Of course there’s more overhead in smaller functions. I’d never write this code in Rust. I’d either inline it, or use a closure, which does allow for inference, and dropping the braces given that this is a one liner: |x| 2 * x Different needs for different things. reply itishappy 1 hour agorootparent# Rust let double = |x| 2 * x; double(3); // F# let double = (*) 2 double 3 -- Haskell let double = (*2) double 3 # Python double = lambda x: 2 * x double(3) reply bmitc 39 minutes agorootparentIf I am understanding that |x| 2 * x in Rust is an anonymous function, another F# equivalent is fun x -> 2 * x. reply neonsunset 22 minutes agorootparentThe Haskell and F# examples above use partial application. This also works: let zeroCount = numbers |> Seq.filter ((=) 0) |> Seq.length reply bmitc 41 minutes agorootparentprevI thought that the Rust playground was requiring me to use return, but I was mistaken. However, it actually lends to my original point though because I would wager that dropping the return was part of the influence of ML on the beginnings of Rust. reply aidenn0 13 hours agorootparentprevI love most entries in the Lisp family. I find Python to be quite readable as well. reply bmitc 13 hours agorootparentIf you like Python and Lisps, then I'm surprised you don't like F#. It is much more concise than Python, even for pure OOP programming. reply The_Colonel 14 hours agorootparentprev> when they're generally thought to be the cleanest syntaxes That might be true for academics. But most engineers don't consider ML syntax to be the cleanest, since most don't know any ML language. reply bmitc 14 hours agorootparentMLs aren't really academic languages aside from Standard ML. F# and OCaml are very pragmatic languages. The cleaner parts of Rust came from ML. What syntaxes do engineers find clean? I don't understand the distinction you're making. reply t-writescode 13 hours agorootparentI assume they mean: * Python, Ruby, C#, Java, Go-style languages? I imagine most developers operate in neither ML languages nor Lisp-style languages. The most advanced \"FP\" trick that I imagine most developers use is Fluent-style programming with a whole bunch of their language's equivalent of: variable .map do ... end .map do ... end .flatten Addendum: or maybe Linq in C# Addendum 2: And even the fluent-style trick in those languages tends to follow a similar pattern. Using Kotlin and Ruby as examples, since those are my (edit: main) languages, variable .map do |i| something_with(i) end .map { |i| something_else(i) } .flatten shows familiar tricks. The dot operator implies that the thing previous to it has an action being done; and curly braces or the \"do\" operation both imply a block of some sort, and so a quick glance is easy to follow. In Kotlin, this gets a little bit more confusing (yes, really) because it's common to see: variable .map { somethingWith(it) } .map { somethingElse(it) } .flatten() And now there's this magic \"it\" variable, but that's easy enough to guess from, especially with syntax highlighting. Anything more advanced than that and the cognitive load for these language starts to rise for people that aren't deep in them. When you're starting working with a new language, that does increase difficulty and may even be so much of a barrier that developers may not want to hop over. reply skydhash 3 hours agorootparentWhen you start working in a new language, the best thing to do is to get a book and familiarize yourself with any constructs or patterns you are not familiar with. Expecting things to be similar to what you’re used to (which lower the learning curve) is a fool’s errand. reply wyager 14 hours agorootparentprev> most engineers don't consider ML syntax to be the cleanest, since most don't know any ML language. This is like saying \"most uncontacted Amazonian tribes don't like Shakespeare, because they've never read it\". Sure, but why would we care about their opinion on this topic? reply unscaled 13 hours agorootparentThey might think Shakespeare's story are silly even if they did read it. In fact, there is at least one widely publicized instance where exactly the same thing happened with a culture that wasn't exposed to Shakespeare before: https://law.ubalt.edu/downloads/law_downloads/IRC_Shakespear... The same idea is probably true with programmers who have grown used to C-like syntax or even Python-like or Ruby-like syntax. Syntax is at least in great part a cultural thing and your \"cultural background\" can affect your judgement in many cases: 1. Are braces good? Some programmers find them noisy and distracting and prefer end keywords or significant whitespace, but other programmers like the regularity and simplicity of marking all code blocks with braces. 2. Should the syntax strive for terseness or verbosity? Or perhaps try to keep a middle ground? At one end of the spectrum, Java is extremely verbose, but a lot of Java engineers (who have generally been exposed to at least one less-verbose language) are perfectly OK with it. The trick is that the main way that code gets typed in Java used to be copy-paste or IDE code generation (and nowadays with LLMs typing verbose code is even easier) and reading and navigating the code is done with the help of an IDE, so a lot of the effects of having a verbose language are mitigated. Diffs are harder to review, but in the Enterprise app world, which is Java's bread and butter, code reviews are more of a rubber stamp (if they are done at all). 3. Lisp-like S-expression syntax is also highly controversial. Many people who are introduced with it hate it with passion, mostly because the most important syntax feature (the parentheses) is repeated so often that it can be hard to read, but advocates extol the amazing expressive power, where the same syntax can be use to express code and data and \"a DSL\" is basically just normal code. reply johnisgood 9 hours agorootparentI think Ada's verbosity is one of its strengths. Cannot say the same for Java, however. reply naasking 4 hours agorootparentThere's \"verbosity as descriptive clarity\", and there's verbosity as in \"I already said this, why do I have to repeat myself?\" Ada unfortunately still has some of the latter, otherwise I would agree. reply johnisgood 4 hours agorootparentI mean, it is supposed to be verbose for descriptive clarity. reply speed_spread 2 hours agorootparentprevJava is really not that verbose if steer out of the 25+ years old conventions that were defined to justify expensive proprietary tooling.

What drives me to it is its ability to express concepts (once you're used to it) parsimoniously - like the point-free style in the example. Monads, I can understand/manage. But by the time I hit Monad Transformers (and the n different packages available), the excitement turns into a headache. It's also a bummer that you need the containers package for basic DS. So, batteries not included, unlike Python. This also means that you need to use a package manager (stack or cabal) even for non-trivial programs, where a one-line ghci command line would have been more ergonomic. That said, learning Haskell has had a very positive effect on how I think about and structure the programs I write in other languages (\"functional core, imperative shell\"). I don't think I'll ever program in Haskell in any semi-serious capacity. But these days, I get my daily functional fix from using jq on the command line. reply MrMcCall 10 hours agoparentBack a decade+ ago when I was still using Microsoft in a corporate environment, I found F# and loved it because it changed how I thought about programming (in a very good way) with its being very concise, allowing me to naturally express algorithms, and giving the \"functional core, imperative shell\" functionality one can't get in the old-and-new-school VS.NET solution sets that comprise a tiered client-server WCF-based model (thanks in large part to the utterly brilliant Juval Lowy's IDesign approach). Unfortunately, F# was very much a second-class citizen in the VS.NET space, so it was only useful for banging out tight C# classes in F# first, then translating them over to C#. (My fundamental db access classes were developed in F# then translated to C#; the crux were a parallel pair of isomorphic classes that did design-time swappable DB2 and SqlServer access.) Beyond my refusal to use Microsoft for my OS anymore, it looks like F# has transitioned away from the original Don Syme authored minimal OCaml-based v2, into much more automagical v3+ stuff that I'm not interested in. They're a brilliant design team, but well beyond what I need or want for my needs. At the end of the day, it's hard to keep things simple, yet effective, when the tool designers we depend on are always one-upping themselves. Somehow, it seems like a natural divergence as design tooling expands to meet the our expanding needs as devs. What's good is that our perspective gets levelled-up, even if the tools either out-evolve our needs/desires or just plain fail to meet them. reply FrustratedMonky 5 hours agorootparentI love F#, but haven't used it in a few years. \"more automagical v3+ stuff\" What is going on with this?

Sadly they didn't really take off, they work but remain a niche feature. At least I'm not aware if any other feature fits this description closer. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/tutorials/ty... Or perhaps Computation Expressions? But those are an integral part of F# and one of the key reasons why it's so flexible and able to easily keep up in many areas with changes in C# - something that require bespoke compiler modification in C# is just another CE* in F# using its type system naturally. * with notable exception being \"resumable code\" which is the basis of task { } CE and similar: https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-design/blob/main/FSharp-6.0... If you want to get back to F#, it has gotten really easy to do it because .NET SDK is available in almost every distro repository (except Debian, sigh) - i.e. `brew install dotnet`/`sudo apt install dotnet9`.

Thanks for the links and help. That's really excellent. Still, I'm old enough to remember \"embrace and extend and extinguish\" so I keep Microsoft off my linux boxen.

For a quick script that I can write in 15 mins that uses an HTTP client, JSON and joins two APIs together, the standard library is OK. To be fair, it could be almost a bash script (using curl and jq or something like that), but I'm more comfortable with Python. So for one-off (or almost one-off) scripts, the standard library is worth avoiding dealing with dependencies. reply thierrydamiba 7 hours agorootparentAs the comment below alludes to, how many people are just going to import requests as r and then break something else instead of just hitting the client? reply elbear 10 hours agorootparentprevYeah. I feel nobody uses the standard library. Even for stuff like HTTP there is requests. reply crvdgc 10 hours agoprevI made a similar transition (1 year Haskell, 2 year OCaml) and this pretty matches up my experience. Some more points: 1. Compiler speed: a clear win for OCaml 2. OCaml 's module system is more explicit (always qualified Map.find). Haskell's type class system is more ergonomic (the instance is found through its type, so no explicit annotation needed, e.g. fmap fmap fmap, where the second must be the Reader's fmap). 3. > If I come to an existing OCaml project, the worst thing previous developers could do to it is have poor variable names, minimal documentation, and 200+ LOC functions. That’s fine, nothing extraordinary, I can handle that. Though it's not common, but functor-heavy codebase does give you a headache. On the other hand, unifying type class instances across packages is no fun either. 4. OCaml's mixture of side effects and pure code tends to encourage using that in libraries and codebase. So expect more speed and more crashes. reply xlii 12 hours agoprev(…on Stripe API…) OCaml: 1 (last change was 8 years ago, so it’s more like zero) I’ve been using OCaml for some time, primarily for my pet project, but also and some minor at-work utilities. One such thing was interacting with Datadog which, unsurprisingly, doesn’t provide OCaml SDK. In short: Experience was great. Not only implementing specs with provided specs while using OCaml tooling was fast but also when I got to the rate limiting, I’ve been able to refactor code in around 20 minutes and then it felt like magic transformation. My take away from that experience is that I wouldn’t use library availability as a hard argument. Every external library is liability and if language provides comfortable tooling and helpers then probably having own code on use-adequate level of abstraction (instead of high level kitchen sink) might preferred. For high number of external integration I would use something like Go instead, which has exactly that, but as an API implementer I’d prefer to use OCaml instead. reply cassepipe 6 hours agoparentIsn't what you are describing the curse of Lisps ?

The fact is most features are trivially implemented that you don’t need that much external libraries. Most are glue code anyway. And with lisp, as soon as you can translate the data structures, you can use the available functions in the standard packages. So you may want that github sdk, but in truth you’re only going to use 2 to 5 functions. Why not get an http package and add the few line of codes for these? reply kqr 3 hours agoprevThere's one nebulous property of Haskell that I've never found in other languages – not even F#, which is near OCaml in PL space: Haskell never gets in the way of what I want to express. In many languages I have an idea for what code I want to write, but then some quirk of the language forces me to express it differently lest it looks weird. Haskell never really feels clumsy that way. I know this is not objectively true because there are many cases in which Haskell also forces me to write things a different way than I would have intended (e.g. due to behaviour around resource allocations) but they don't hurt as bad, for some reason.

When I write production code, I aim to be as clear showing a good working design that's easy to understand (reading the issue/PR descriptions if necessary). The code style is chosen to maximize human comprehension. What I'm not doing is playing a game of one-upmanship with (virtual) others. The only parts I'm really interested in optimizing are the bits that matter: factoring, naming, datastructures, algorithms, queries (for database), and minimizing abstractions that don't pay their weight. I spent some time using F# out of curiosity of both it and OCaml and found that it was very easy to use with the exception of (mutable) arrays. reply frankie_t 6 hours agoprevI've used both of the languages previously for my own fun and private mini-projects. From a perspective of an clueless outsider, OCaml was so, so much better to start with than Haskell. I've always been fascinated with Haskell, but it took me around 5 years of attempts to finally get the tooling to work. Some parts always failed me, especially language server and vscode interaction (hardly something to put blame on haskell itself though). Finally I braced myself and with some hacks (like bash code in haskell comments in Setup.hs) made it all work. Still, to the day HLS would repeatedly hang or not start, and the only solution is to restart vscode. Of course, there could be a problem with my setup etc, maybe I configured it \"slightly incorrect\" way, I'm just rating my experience. OCaml was everything opposite. I made two Ocaml tours in recent years, and both times it literally just worked (tm). Granted, I've been using it less than haskell, but the experience of starting out is just heaven and earth. The only issue I have with ocaml tooling is that ideally I'd like to run the language server for real-time hints from the compiler, but also be able to invoke my program interactively. Unfortunately it seems you either have to run \"dune build watch\", or you can build and run, but not both as there is some locking happening. As far as the languages themselves go, I'd say haskell is more \"fun\", in a way that it has a lot of features, and it reads a lot nicer (unless it's point-free code). Monads are pretty fun, although when I finally got through Monad transformers I started feeling \"I wish we had no monads tbh\" Ocaml feels much more barebone, syntactically less appealing and somewhat clunky. On the other hand there is a kind of spartan appeal to it. Honestly, I like both of the languages a lot and wish for them to continue their development. I can certainly see myself using both in the future. reply debugnik 5 hours agoparent> Unfortunately it seems you either have to run \"dune build watch\", or you can build and run, but not both as there is some locking happening.

The transition from imperative paradigms to Haskell can be tough, but once you've overcome this barrier, the code reads effortlessly. In your example case: split the string into a list of words, that is tokenize based on spaces. Then map the read function onto this, which will parse each of the \"words\" in the list into some type. Annotations would likely be needed here. Then sum this list.

I think the problem is exactly in the \"get the hang of it\" part. For some languages, that's really difficult, while for others it's almost trivial. From my own experience, Haskell is very very difficult to \"get the hang of\" despite my multiple attempts, while something like Javascript is trivial for me (interestingly enough, except when it uses too much of the new FP patterns!) even when I do not program on it daily. reply kubb 11 hours agorootparentThis is like complaining that Spanish is so hard to learn while English is actually quite intuitive. Of course it’s easier to understand what you already know. reply brabel 8 hours agorootparentNot at all. I tried to make the point of distinction clear by saying I do not use JS, nor Haskell, daily, but JS is more readable, without a doubt, so it's more like saying something like \"english is more readable than french to a spanish speaker\" (the analogy makes much less sense, but trying to correct yours). I think that we can agree that everyone's a priori is what they know in the world, which is common language... and everyone is familiar with \"recipes\", or step-by-step instructions... which is the same as imperative code, not functional. Don't get me wrong, I like FP and have been trying to get into it for a long time. But currently I strongly believe FP as commonly done in Haskell is just too far from what we expect even before we start writing code. Combining functions and chaining Monads just seems to me to be extremely hard to do and understand, and I don't need to do any of that in \"lesser\" languages. However, I am finally \"getting it\" with newer languages like Flix and Unison - they let me just use `let` and stuff like that which makes the code trivial again, while being basically purely functional. reply iLemming 46 minutes agorootparent> JS is more readable, without a doubt In what sense? Haskell's: strSum = sum . map read . words in JS would be: const strSum = str => str.split(' ').map(Number).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0); for a person who's not already a JS programmer, the first one would be more readable (without a doubt), it literally reads like plain English: \"sum of mapped read of words\". Haskell's version is more \"mathematical\" and straightforward. Each function has one clear purpose. The composition operator clearly shows data transformation flow. No hidden behavior or type coercion surprises. Whereas JS version requires knowledge of: - How Number works as a function vs constructor - Implicit type coercion rules - Method chaining syntax - reduce()'s callback syntax and initial value - How split() handles edge cases So while the JS code might look familiar, it actually requires more background knowledge and consideration of implementation details to fully understand its behavior. Javascript is far more complex language than most programmers realize. btw, I myself don't write Haskell, but deal with Javascript almost daily and I just can't agree that JS is \"more readable\" than many other PLs.

Instead, it should be explained as this: \"strSum = sum . map read . words\" is \"a sum of all parsed values of the original input of space-separated words\".

On the other hand, longer names help on board new people. Theoretically, you could avoid this issue by transforming back and forth. Uiua e.g. lets you enter symbols by typing out their names.

The words function is simply: words :: String -> [String] So that words \"foo bar baz\" -- Produces: [\"foo\",\"bar\",\"baz\"] In my experience, both the blessing and the curse of Haskell's incredible succinct expressiveness is that, like other specialised languages - for example using latin for succinctly-expressed legal terms - you need a strong understanding of the language and its standard library - similar to the library of commonly used \"legal terms\" in law circles - to participate meaningfully. Haskell, and languages like Go (which anybody with a bit of programming experience can easily follow) have very different goals. Like many in this discussion, I too have developed a love/hate thing with Haskell. But boy, are the good parts good ... reply devjab 9 hours agorootparentI recently learned that things like Goroutines aren’t naturally written with buffers and channels. Granted anyone who reads the original documentation would likely do it correctly, but apparently that’s not how they are intuitively written. so while it may be easy to read it might be harder to write than I was assuming. So maybe there a difference where Haskell has an advantage? I mentioned it in my previous comment but I don’t know Haskell at all, but if this is “the way” to do splits by word then you’ll know both to read and write it. Which would be a strength on its own, since I imagine it would be kind of hard to do wrong since you’ll need that Haskell understanding in the first place. reply instig007 5 hours agorootparentIt all comes down to knowing the FP vocabulary. Most of FP languages share the names of the most widely used functions, and if you're well versed in Haskell you'll have 80/20 ratio of understanding them all, where the 20% part would be language-specific libraries that expand and build upon the 80% of the FP vocabulary. reply reidrac 10 hours agorootparentprevAs a Haskell noob, I had the same problem a few times.

Indeed, I have actually started viewing any language with long, detailed and subtle error messages as a red flag. These types of error messages indicate to me that the compiler is trying to do too much and the language would benefit from simplification, especially with respect to trying to infer the programmer's unstated intentions.

I wrote my thesis in OCaml and my recollection was that it had an amazing native code generating compiler that not infrequently output code that was almost as fast as C if you wrote it the right way. The story I heard about Haskell was far different at the time (admittedly decades ago). reply kreetx 12 hours agoparentAs with all garbage collected languages, optimizing comes down to removing allocations, in Haskell this means strictness and choice of data structures. You can make C-speed programs but you may need to work for it, and you'll also need to know the compiler/evaluation model you're working against. reply achou 11 hours agorootparentSure, I think what I noticed was that even idiomatic OCaml code was relatively fast, maybe 2-3x slower than C, but plenty fast enough. Whereas I was under the impression that idiomatic Haskell was far more likely to have unexpected and harder to fix performance issues (e.g. requiring more of an architectural rewrite) because of its lazy evaluation model. reply kccqzy 4 hours agorootparentThe problems brought about by the lazy evaluation (laziness when you don't want it) do not require architectural rewrites. It's mostly just profiling while setting a very low stack size limit, and then discovering which part of your code triggers a stack overflow. It can be solved by adding the right amount of seq (sequences evaluation), or ! (strict patterns). Maybe you'll also change a few incorrect uses of foldl into foldr. Even if you need to change from lazy Map to strict Map the change isn't disruptive; it's just changing some import and done; all the functions work.

You wouldn't want to write code like that except in scripts etc. because it would crash the program if you encounter bad input.

Which is going to be really frustrating once it fails. And if it doesn't fail the first version is fine. reply Tainnor 11 hours agorootparentSure, you can improve this by e.g. import Data.Either.Combinators -- from the either package strSum :: String -> Either String Int strSum = fmap sum . sequence . fmap tryReadInt . words where tryReadInt w = maybeToRight (\"not an integer \" ++ w) (readMaybe w) This keeps the bulk of the method the same.

Think this was a feature. F# has access to all of the existing libraries, plus those made for F#. reply antonyt 2 hours agorootparentIt's a feature but also sort of an anti-feature. To do anything productive you will need to reach for a lot of .NET libraries, and those will force you to write code differently than you would if you could live in blissful pure-F# land. This results in a mishmash of styles. Something as simple as calling a .NET function that doesn't have F# bindings forces a change (e.g. `someLibraryFunc(arg1, arg2)` instead of `f arg1 arg2`). This gets worse as libraries force you to instantiate objects just to call methods which could have been static, or use ref parameters, etc. I say this as somebody who loves F# - you do absolutely have to know .NET style (which really means C# style) in addition to F# style.

I doubt the public looking at FP languages would appreciate Go :) F# includes an optimizer that performs e.g. lambda inlining. Then, .NET compiles the assemblies themselves to a final application, be it native executable or otherwise, so I feel like relative compiler slowness is not a dealbreaker. It is also relatively quick at starting for executing F# script files with `dotnet fsi` (I'm happy that F# is included in standard .NET SDK, much different to e.g. Clojure or Scala), it's slower to start than Python or Elixir shell but I can live with that. This was also a good opportunity to write down a small workflow to use F# interactive to quickly build small native console applications thanks to FSharpPacker: https://gist.github.com/neon-sunset/028937d82f2adaa6c1b93899...

The first class module system is fairly nice, although it leads to an annoying problem where now you kind of have two \"levels\" to the language (module level and normal level). This is arguably analogous to Haskell having a \"term level language\" and a \"type level language\", where the type system is more prolog-y than the term language. Also, Haskell's type system is powerful enough to do most of the things you'd want the OCaml module system for, and more. I do occasionally miss the OCaml module system, but not most of the time. reply RandomThoughts3 12 hours agorootparentConversely, the Ocaml module system is powerful enough to do all the things you had want to do with Haskell except the Ocaml module system is nice to use. Anyway, the issue has nothing to do with relative powerfulness. The issue is that the Haskell community encourages practices which lead to unreadable code: lot of new operators, point-free, fancy abstraction. Meanwhile, the Ocaml community was always very different with a general dislike of overly fancy things when they were not unavoidable. reply kreetx 11 hours agorootparentIf by \"encourages\" you mean \"has features\", then yes. The typical haskell shop doesn't really encourage complex feature use, it's the people learning/online who don't actually need to work within their solutions, do. That's what seems to draw (some) people to haskell. reply shermantanktop 15 hours agorootparentprev [–] Learning a “pure” language is a lot like tripping on LSD. The people who do it can’t stop talking about how great it was, but also can’t really explain why it was so great, and when they try it just sounds ridiculous, maybe even to them. And then they finish by saying that you should drop acid too and then you’ll understand. reply mrkeen 10 hours agorootparent> also can’t really explain why it was so great I like it when assertTrue (f x) -- passes in test means that assertTrue (f x) -- passes in prod reply CyberDildonics 15 hours agorootparentprevThe reality is people want what you produce when you're sober, not having fantasy hallucinations. reply eru 15 hours agorootparentprevHaskell isn't all that pure. reply ChadNauseam 15 hours agorootparentwhat do you mean by that? all functions in haskell are pure unless you explicitly use unsafePreformIO or similar (which is rare to ever have to do) reply eru 12 hours agorootparentThey can still have side-effects like non-termination.

I meant that Haskell is plenty pragmatic in its design. reply instig007 48 minutes agorootparent> They can still have side-effects like non-termination. you can still have total functions that don't finish in humanly/business reasonable amount of time. reply tromp 10 hours agorootparentprevLambda calculus is as pure as can be, and also has terms that don't normalize. That is not considered a side effect. A better example of impurity in Haskell for pragmatic's sake is the trace function, that can be used to print debugging information from pure functions. reply eru 7 hours agorootparent> Lambda calculus is as pure as can be, and also has terms that don't normalize. That is not considered a side effect. Many typed lambda calculi do normalise. You can also have a look https://dhall-lang.org/ for some pragmatic that normalises. > A better example of impurity in Haskell for pragmatic's sake is the trace function, that can be used to print debugging information from pure functions. Well, but that's just unsafePerformIO (or unsafePerformIO-like) stuff under the hood; that was already mentioned. reply kreetx 11 hours agorootparentprevTo me, \"pure\" means referential transparency: same input, same output. So an `Int -> Int` function will return same result on same argument. So, similar to `Int -> IO Int`, the function (action) will return an Int after interacting with outside world, `IO` tracking the fact that this is the case. reply agnishom 13 hours agorootparentprevIt doesn't have great support for Dependent Types reply Tainnor 13 hours agorootparentwhat does that have to do with purity? reply agnishom 6 hours agorootparentNothing, but arguably a language with dependent types is more Haskell than Haskell reply yazzku 15 hours agorootparentprev [–] \"You mean you're going to make a copy of that every time?\" reply mrkeen 10 hours agorootparent [–] Haha, can't tell if you're joking or not.

The main method available for PrEP, in the United States, at least, is a daily pill. I think (I don't know) there is a monthly shot, too. Daily pills take a lot of time investment; monthly shots are better; but once every 6 months is awesome! Especially in circumstances where it might be difficult to guarantee a daily pill or even a monthly shot. reply bobthepanda 11 hours agoparentThere is a generic daily pill (Truvada), a more expensive one (Descovy) and an every two months shot (Apretude.) Apretude has lower efficacy than Descovy or Truvada, but once you factor in human error in taking a daily pill regimen, it is more even. Human error is a significant factor since the current treatment protocols say if you’re not sure whether or not to take it, it is safer to skip than to accidentally double the dose. reply cosmotic 1 hour agorootparentThe data I've seen shows apretude is more effective, not less reply m3kw9 4 hours agorootparentprevSeen these on commercial, I wish they stop with commercial for meds.

All in all, HIV just isn't a problem anymore. It's on the same sort of threat scale as any other STD.

Generics aren't possible in markets where the patent holder enforces their rights.

Maybe one of the most important stories for public health this decade? AIDS kills more people than malaria, and preventing malaria has long been viewed as one of the lowest hanging fruits in public health.

Such variance in humans. I find such things inordinately simple. I wake, stretch, urinate, go take my vitamins and drink two glasses of water. A third follows me to my current home office, where I process emails, alerts, whatever may be. I find the best time to triage overnight emails is when I'm not quite awake yet to realise I'm doing it. Less pain that way. The key is it being part of a routine, and the easiest is a part of the wake routine. At least for me. Which is why I find human variance interesting. Meanwhile scheduling something 6+ months out (a doctor's appointment, or maybe at a pharmacy) for a shot is quite difficult to keep on time. I have to schedule, I have to keep free, I have to keep it in my mental space (calendars on phones help, but still...). I literally don't know what part of the planet I will be on in a week.

Just as I take toothpaste, etc. If I am there long enough to need more vitamins, it is in the same category as needing more toothpaste, and you resupply as you would at home. No kids. I do have emergency paging and downed server / PROD to deal with 24/7, not the same as kids, but wake-disrupting all the same. There is rarely something urgent enough to prevent urinating in the morning, and being thirsty after waking up is typcially a no go either. If prod is down maybe I'll eval first, but humans need out and in of water. I'm not going to urinate on the floor, and I'm not going to sit dehydrated and parched mouth for long either. So wake, urinate, drink and vitamins are in that too. My vitamins are in the bathroom, and it takes less than 10 seconds to consume them. reply n4r9 6 hours agorootparent> I don't have much issue with buying vitamins, because I take them with me. Nevertheless you do have to remember to pack them, and you need to regularly replenish your stocks. I'm guessing that this replenishing happens at least as often as every 6 months, which is how often you need to arrange the injection in question. By the sounds of it you do a lot of travelling, so you may need to anticipate cases where you are away at the time you would normally replenish stocks. > you resupply as you would at home How does that happen? You notice how many pills are left in the bottle, and make a note to order more when it's getting low? Or immediately make an order there and then? I know I'm being really pedantic, but I'm trying to illustrate why many people would perceive daily pill-taking to be strictly more labour-intensive than a 6-monthly injection. reply thaumasiotes 8 hours agorootparentprev> Do you have kids, if so how do you deal with frequent disruptions to the morning routine? Do you not have days where you just need to get up and go e.g. to catch a flight, get to a meeting, take a kid to school, or because you stayed up late and got drunk, etc... and taking vitamins took a back seat? This is crazy. You deal with the morning routine by taking your pills when the alarm goes off, because there's nothing the kids can be doing that won't wait for that. Flying, driving, and driving are exactly the same. Take your pill when the alarm goes off. If you drank so much that it rendered you unconscious through the time you needed to take your pill, the solution is \"don't do that\". That's not exactly an unavoidable necessity of life. reply viraptor 7 hours agorootparent> because there's nothing the kids can be doing that won't wait for that. I feel you don't have young kids then. Jumping on you, bleeding, having a nightmare, making possibly-chocking-sounds, running away with your pills, vomiting on the floor, etc. will definitely take priority over whatever you thought you were going to do after waking up. And that doesn't even touch on people with executive functions issues. Or the 1-2yo period where the time you officially wake up may be often a very fuzzy concept.

Like a vomit, poo, or spillage situation needing immediate attention. Or throwing a tantrum if you try to bring them back upstairs where the pills are (thus waking everyone else up). Not to mention that it can be exhausting if they're not sleeping well - which can be half the time - and it's tough to remember every little thing when you're exhausted. > If you drank so much that it rendered you unconscious ... that's not exactly an unavoidable necessity of life You asked \"how much time does it take to swallow a pill\". The convenience of that depends on people's lifestyles. Lots of people will wake up at 7am in the week, go out and have a few drinks on Friday/Saturday, and wake up whenever/wherever they wake up the next day. That is not an extreme situation. It's a great freedom to dynamically adapt when you go to bed and when you wake up.

Of course it's easier to get a shot than to take individual pills, I think people would universally agree on that. Also with prep, since you have to continue dosing 2 days after last activity you get awkward situations where you left it at home or get distracted by life events.

If you have a limited budget, it's going to be hard to recruit, etc., you may well be better off powering your study for the group you think is going to be the most impactful, then going back. We saw this with the HPV vaccine - getting it going in the highest impact groups, and then going back later - Preventing HIV in women also prevents maternal to child transmission - \"Men with HIV\" are actually two different groups - men who have sex exclusively with women, and men who have sex with men. You then also need to power your study for both sub-groups. reply mike_hearn 7 hours agorootparentThat's inaccurate. The vast majority of all cases are in men. For instance in America only 22% of HIV+ people are women. Our World In Data has a map that shows this visually: https://ourworldindata.org/hiv-aids The only place this isn't true is sub-Saharan Africa. As there's no biological explanation for that discrepancy it's been hypothesized that it's because in Africa a lot of reported HIV cases are fraudulent, due to the large amount of AIDS/women specific foreign aid money and weak auditing standards. reply bobthepanda 1 hour agorootparentThere is a societal reason; condom use and polygamy. Condom use is less common and polygamy more amongst straight people in sub saharan Africa.

Even putting that aside, it's only the bizarre situation in Africa makes the statement technically true. If we interpret it in the way it was meant to be interpreted then the statement isn't really true because everywhere that has reliable data shows the opposite: men get it the most. reply foldr 4 hours agorootparentI don't think the 'especially' has that implication when you consider the context of the article that we're commenting on. It's true that women and girls make up the majority of people living with HIV worldwide, and this is especially true of the developing world. On the other hand, your statement that \"the vast majority of all cases are in men\" is simply false. Depending on the interpretation of 'vast', it's arguably not even true in much of the West. For example, in the UK, about a third of people living with HIV are women; in the US it's about a quarter. There's nothing 'bizarre' about the situation in Africa.

It prevents infected cells from producing viable virus particles. Because of this, it seems very likely that if any patient being treated with this drug ever discontinued it, they could develop HIV quickly from cells that were already infected in their body that had been suppressed from producing virus particles but were no longer suppressed. I was not able to find, in a little searching, any study at all on whether cells infected during treatment survive or are somehow cleared by the immune system or undergo apoptosis. Without this information it seems highly irresponsible to claim that this is a method of preventing HIV infection. reply JumpCrisscross 4 hours agoparent> This treatment does not in fact prevent HIV infection. It prevents infected cells from producing viable virus particles Lenacapavir interferes \"with multiple essential steps of the viral lifecycle, including capsid-mediated nuclear uptake of HIV-1 proviral DNA (by blocking nuclear import proteins binding to capsid), virus assembly and release (by interfering with Gag/Gag-Pol functioning, reducing production of capsid protein subunits), and capsid core formation (by disrupting the rate of capsid subunit association, leading to malformed capsids)\" [1]. For comparison, tenofovir diphosphate (from Descovy) \"inhibits the activity of HIV reverse transcriptase and causes DNA chain termination after getting incorporated into the viral DNA\" [2].

Cabotegravir is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor. This means it blocks the HIV's enzyme integrase, thereby preventing its genome from being integrated into the human cells' DNA. Emtricitabine is an analogue of cytidine. The drug works by inhibiting reverse transcriptase, the enzyme that copies HIV RNA into new viral DNA. Both of these drugs actually prevent infection. reply mike_hearn 7 hours agoparentprevThe problems are bigger than that. The trials don't attempt to show impact on AIDS itself. Biomarker studies like this have a long history of going wrong due to statistical or theory related problems. reply roywiggins 5 hours agorootparentHIV isn't a biomarker, it's the cause of AIDS.

Credit: GOG/Blizzard They might feel rough around the edges, but the original Warcraft titles can compel people like your author to dive in again, more than 20 years since their last campaign. Credit: GOG/Blizzard Text settings When an updated, remastered, or otherwise spiffed-up version of a game is released, nobody—not long-time fans, not archivists, not anybody, really—ever asks for the original version of that game to be taken down. Does this seem to stop game studios from committing this unforced public relations error? Absolutely not. Blizzard, a company that has recently released remastered versions of Warcraft and Warcraft II for $10 and $15, respectively (or in a bundle with III for $40) on its Battle.net storefront, has asked GOG to remove its non-remastered, DRM-free $15 bundle of those games from its store on December 13. GOG (aka Good Old Games), which recently included Warcraft I and II in its Preservation Program, with a \"Make Games Live Forever\" tagline, suddenly finds itself with a new policy to figure out. So GOG is putting the Warcraft I & II Bundle on sale (discount code \"MakeWarcraftLiveForever\" for $2 off) and is letting folks know that if they buy it before December 13, they will keep access to it after the delisting, complete with offline installers. That is also how it will work from now on, the team writes on its blog. ARS VIDEO \"Going forward, even if a game is no longer available for sale on GOG, as part of the GOG Preservation Program, it will continue to be maintained and updated by us, ensuring it remains compatible with modern and future systems,\" GOG's post states. GOG's version goes a bit beyond the classic versions that were on sale on Blizzard.net. Beyond the broad promise that \"this is the best version of this game you can buy on any PC platform,\" GOG has made specific tweaks to the networking code for Warcraft I and fixed up the DirectX wrapper for Warcraft II to improve its scaling on modern monitor resolutions. It's quite a novel commitment, keeping non-revenue-generating games playable for buyers, even after a publisher no longer makes them available for sale. The Warcraft titles certainly won't be the only games for which publisher enthusiasm lags behind GOG and its classic gamers. As noted at the Preservation Program's launch, for some titles, GOG does not have the rights to modify a game's build, and only its original developers can do so. So if GOG can't make it work in, say, DOSBox, extraordinary efforts may be required.

Blizzard's 2020 release of Warcraft III Reforged was widely panned as uneven, unfinished, and in some ways unfair, as it, too, removed the original Warcraft III from stores. Reforged was still in rough shape a year later, leading Ars' list of 2020's most disappointing games. A 2.0 update promised a total reboot, but fans remain torn on the new art styles and are somewhat wary. Then again, you can now select more units in the first two Warcraft games' remasters, and you get \"numerous visual updates for the UI.\" Kevin Purdy Senior Technology Reporter Kevin Purdy Senior Technology Reporter Kevin is a senior technology reporter at Ars Technica, covering open-source software, PC gaming, home automation, repairability, e-bikes, and tech history.

    "commentBody": "Blizzard's pulling of Warcraft I and II tests GOG's new Preservation Program (arstechnica.com)228 points by Tomte 13 hours agohidepastfavorite158 comments llmthrow102 12 hours agoThey've also now launched the Warcraft 3 \"remaster\" twice, and it's still in a worse state than it was 20 years ago. First they did less than half the job, cut budget, and launched missing major features from the original project, with only some terrible new models to show that look decent up close, but bad from the overhead RTS view. Then they did a relaunch where they did lazy AI upscaling of old models and icons that don't actually look any better, added some realtime shadows that don't fit with the style of the game, and called it a \"Warcraft 3 2.0\". Really terrible treatment of one of the best game series of all time, and being part of Microsoft hasn't helped. It would have been nice if Warcraft 3 got the same treatment as AoE2 or AoM. I buy all games on GoG when I can, especially classic games, but new ones as well. It's so nice to just have a collection of DRM-free installers, and be able to support a company that does right by the classic games. reply smolder 11 hours agoparentBlizzard started down the path to failure when they merged with Activision, though I'm not sure they would have lasted much longer outside of that. It's apparent to me the only way \"make quality stuff\" survives as a strategy long term is to stay private like Valve. Public ownership ruins companies. They grow into inefficient messes and lose any edge they had while alienating their customers in the interest of short term gain. Maybe companies should consider limiting their growth to stay nimble enough to provide value and stay viable. Maybe they do more good by being good at what they do than by chasing peak profit and diminishing their brands. Either way, Bobby Kotick was a bad CEO. reply raxxorraxor 5 hours agorootparentSame experience as an employee really. Want to work for a healthy company? Join a private one.

As soon as stock price is the primary target it ceases to be a good measure of the actual value of the company, management will try to game the stock price at the expense of the underlying value.

I find that the more you turn art into a massive assembly line the less passionate the product becomes. If the goal is quality art than massive growth is not the way. Unfortunately the expectation for modern games is this near infinite scope which requires several years to complete and way too much money. If your game is required to be this large then you either need a huge team or decades of time from a small time. So I believe that the larger the game the more likely it is going to be devoid of passion and artistic value. I'd prefer game studios to split up into many smaller studios and make more smaller games. reply 0dayz 10 hours agorootparentprevNope, it started waaay before that. * The sexual misconduct most likely happened way before it came out publicly as all the sleezebags stayed until it was public * real id debacle * Diablo 3 * shutting down blizzard north, despite working on d3 * spending 10 years on trying to make starcraft 2, when the rts genre was in a major slump * x years on the project titan, only to get cancelled * spent years trying to create a dedicated moba, and hots came out after the hype of the genre was gone * Cancelling semi-experimental games (the Warcraft Point'n Click Adventure game, the Starcraft: Ghost game, and many others[1]) I'm sure there are more issues/fuck ups blizzard did, the point though is that the company couldn't adapt to the new norms of the industry (some are excusable due to the fuck you money wow gives) and thus became the black sheep.

Certain games on that list tbf is way past 2008. reply Majromax 5 hours agorootparentI hate to just drop a book recommendation, but Jason Schreier's Play Nice covers the history of Blizzard in comprehensive detail. The overall situation was multifacted, but my takeaway is that Blizzard's recent failures come down to two main themes: * World of Warcraft's success gave the company unrealistic expectations of what a successful \"normal\" game looked like, and * \"When it's ready\" covers up the sins of a company that never quite figured out project management. My synthesis is that the combination meant that Blizzard projects needed to promise the moon to be greenlit, but then they immediately blew the initial time and money-budgets with the extensive scope. Activision's influence didn't help, and it imposed a tighter focus on prompt monetary return after Titan's cancellation. That clashed with the long development cycles of even the successful projects. reply cogman10 4 hours agorootparentSo interestingly you see this sort of thing play out in online media. - Youtuber X has a runaway successful video/s. - Seeing the cashflow from that video, they think \"Hey, I could probably duplicate this!\" - When that duplication fails, they decide \"You know what, maybe I just need to make a lot of videos\" - When that doesn't bring in the expected income and/or leads to burnout they think \"You know what, I think I need some outside help to make me see my blindspots\". And, of course, invariably when that outside help comes in, so does the slop. The outside help does not care about quality, they care about getting money in through the door. That often involves hack and slashing all efforts at quality, shilling out endlessly, and some real questionable decisions when it comes to employment. Now, of course, the creator is still responsible for what their company becomes. But, money is money and a creator/owner is just more likely to like easymode income (for themselves) vs duplicating the efforts of a prior period. reply montagg 4 hours agorootparentprevAs someone who’s seen the inside of a game company, this thesis reads true. Success really warps expectations, and warped expectations create perverse incentives that are different than make this particular game good. reply bloomingkales 3 hours agorootparentprevMy synthesis is that the combination meant that Blizzard projects needed to promise the moon to be greenlit, but then they immediately blew the initial time and money-budgets with the extensive scope. Going over budget and going over scope can only happen depending on who is measuring. I can spend 6 months developing a part of a game and not consider it a waste of time or out of scope. I’m of the mind that this was the natural state of Blizzard prior to Activision. I mean, they are fundamentally making things that roughly sound like this - we are all going to sit around on a server and pretend to have a giant adventure Ridiculous, the very concept is out of scope lol. You simply can’t have the wrong minded people involved in this process, certainly not the wrong project managers. You can’t even have the wrong parent company for a pursuit like this. reply Etherlord87 8 hours agorootparentprevStarcraft 2 murdered RTS genre, it was and is so good, that nothing comes close. I have no idea why you put it on the list. Activision Blizzard was 2008. Shutting Blizzard North was 2005. So indeed it seems it was rotting before official Vivaldi-Activision merger. I think, just like with Starcraft, you misread the situation with \"hype of the genre was gone\" about moba. I think Blizzard was very good at creating extremely polished products, but LoL already was polished and well established. Project Titan's assets were used in Overwatch, but yeah, spending so much time on a big project to abandon it really shows poor management skills and overall bad design of the project. reply 0dayz 7 hours agorootparentThe problem was the timing, Starcraft 2 mechanics wise is fine even if they made some really whimsical balance changes that plagued the esport scene until it was almost pulled off life support (similar to how Overwatch couldn't balance itself to the point where the developers gave up). If like HotS and Diablo 3 it came out much earlier it would've kept the RTS genre most likely alive (only revived interest in AoE 2 started to get the ball rolling for RTS again). Not only that but Blizzard had since WC3 tried to create their own MOBA and stalled time and time again, they announced Blizzard All-star while announcing SC2, only for HotS to be announce after Dota 2 had left beta & LoL was already moving away from static MOBA design to the more \"skill based\" design they currently got. Especially if the rumor that icefrog (last dev of Dota) approached Blizzard and Blizzard said no, it's the most obvious act of stupidity Blizzard did. By the time HotS was out it was dead in the water because it had no competing feature setting it apart from the competition: * if you wanted micromanaged static MOBA: Dota 2 * If you wanted a 3rd person shooter MOBA: Smite * If you wanted a \"skill based\" dynamic and more casual MOBA: LoL HotS tried to mimic LoL which meant an already watered down MOBA being further watered down. Hearthstone is a good example of how Blizzard's games could have looked have they timed their releases better and stopped with \"fold it 3000 times\", since you can only do this if the game's budget is a typical 90s game budget or you've got alternative income sources & isn't publicly owned i.e. Valve. reply properpopper 1 hour agorootparent> * if you wanted micromanaged static MOBA: Dota 2 Static?

I mean Supreme Commander has an active community despite coming out 3 years earlier, with less hype, and from a company that has long died. Starcraft 2 had a nice campaign, but it really felt like Starcraft 1.5. Never really elevated the genre. SupCom really did. reply concordDance 3 hours agorootparentprevSupcom, AoE2, Zero-K and BAR are all superior along different axes to SC2. RTS is a very wide category. reply BlueTemplar 5 hours agorootparentprevThat's bullshit, the greatest thing about SC2 was its marketing (including e-sports money). Ok, also the first campaign is great and the polish is, as always, top tier. But RTS was only in a slump in the sense that the apex of the popularity of that genre was around the turn of the millennium (which probably was unavoidable). And only a few years before SC2 released we've got the likes of Dawn of War 1 and Supreme Commander 1, and, last but not least : the amateur-made Spring(-Recoil) games, which put almost every other RTS game to shame, so advanced they were in comparison (and, sadly, still are, when you look at today's player's first impressions of BAR, despite it mostly only having improved in the graphics and performance department, as the 'R' suggests). Compared to Spring games, Starcraft 2 looked like a very solid and polished, but also very safe and almost obsolete game. reply bluescrn 8 hours agorootparentprev> Spending 10 years on trying to make starcraft 2, when the rts genre was in a major slump Was worth it though.

The company still generates a ton of money, continues to set records for day 1 sales of its games, and owns extremely valuable IP in the gaming industry, so you can't really say it hasn't adapted well to the current industry norms. At times, it practically sets them. It has certainly missed a lot of opportunities, such as turning BattleNet into a public digital storefront before Steam, or capitalizing on the MoBA genre that spawned from their own games before competitors did, but I doubt that they would have had as much success even if they did because their approach would have been different. Jason Schreier's recent book covers some of the game cancellations. The Warcraft adventure game was cancelled after they flew out one of the best designers in the genre for a week to try to make it work, and make it fun, and couldn't. It was a game that was outsourced to a different company, and they didn't feel like it was up to their quality standards to ship. Shutting down Blizzard North came about as a consequence of the distance between them and HQ, leading to a different studio culture that became difficult to manage, and the uncontested resignation of Blizzard North's executive team when they tried to make demands from Blizzard's owners, Vivendi. Polygon [1] covered the Starcraft: Ghost game. Long story short, it got canned because it was in development hell for too long. Originally under development by a studio in the Bay area, there apparently wasn't a dedicated Blizzard producer to the game for the longest time, and the idea of what it should be kept changing as new games came out and HQ wanted them to copy those ideas. At some point, Blizzard shifted development to a different studio just miles away from them because they wanted multiplayer, but the same issues persisted. And then they released WoW, which consumed all of their attention. With the release of the gen 7 consoles around the corner, requiring further investment, they made the sensible choice to shelve it so they could focus their time and money on their new cash-printing machine instead. Experimentation is important for finding the fun, and cancelling what isn't working is a required part of the process. And while, yes, there's a ton of games in the Blizzard graveyard, they're no exception. Valve has a list of cancelled games that's probably just as long. And they're all the better for it.

It was very fun very micro-transactions are optional and purely cosmetic game. I bought it day one. Then they saw the success of PUBG and Fortnite's season passes and decided \"we want some of that\" and launched Overwatch 2 going so far as locking entire characters behind micro-transactions. The day they launched Overwatch 2, they entirely shut down the Overwatch 1 servers. Something they had said earlier on that they were not going to do, before they later changed course. They took away the game I loved, the game I paid for, and replaced it with a junky free-to-play game dancing around in its skin like Edgar the Bug in Men in Black, all \"Look at me, I'm still Overwatch, pinky promise\", but anyone with a sense of taste can tell it really isn't. They ruined it. Literally all my friends played Overwatch. My wife was in an Overwatch League. I don't know a single person who stuck with Overwatch 2 for more than a couple weeks. My wife's entire league just shut down. I hear people play it but I sure don't know anyone. I would estimate mostly people who never played the original? Left such a sour taste in my mouth that I am hesitant to ever give Blizzard money again. reply wongarsu 8 hours agorootparentDon't forget they nearly killed Overwatch by barely supporting Overwatch 1 while they worked on Overwatch 2. But when they finally released Overwatch 2 there were barely any changes from Overwatch 1, except for the season pass system and a switch from 6v6 to 5v5. Apparently most of the development time was spent on single-player content that was first delayed and then cut entirely reply slfnflctd 7 hours agorootparentI was really looking forward to the single-player/PvE content. The gamers in my household are all fairly low skill (myself included), and one of our favorite original Overwatch events was Junkenstein's Revenge-- more of that kind of thing was huge on our anticipation list. When they not only killed the original Overwatch but also suddenly decided to abandon the PvE component, it was a double whammy which resulted in us instantly abandoning what had been a regular staple of our gaming time. We moved on to other things such as Deep Rock Galactic and haven't looked back. reply worthless-trash 6 hours agorootparentprevThis point really hits home. Blizzard basically ignored Overwatch 1 (except for lootboxes) for the last half of its life. Players would have paid for maps, paid for expansions, paid for spectating the overwatch league, paid for spectating their favorite yt personalities commentary, but nope, they promised some fever dream single player which went nowhere. reply aniviacat 8 hours agorootparentprevThe issues with Overwatch 2 were fixed. All heros are available for free; you can get the season passes for free (the free pass includes enough premium currency to buy the premium pass); you can get most skins for normal currency and you can get the mythic currency for the mythic skins by playing the battlepass. There are still a few skins you can't realistically unlock without paying; but that doesn't ruin a game.

It changed the ToS so Blizzard owns the IP rights to any third-party maps, effectively killing this community. Why? Because of Dota 2. There was a customm mode called Defense of the Ancients (\"Dota\") that somebody took and basically created the MOBA genre. Blizzard decided to sue and lost. They tried to create their own (ie Heroes of the Storm) but the space came to be dominated by League of Legends. Blizzard didn't want a repeat of that. Ridiculous; and 2. WC3 Reforged (\"Refunded\" as it was commonly called on release) also made the original game worse even if you didn't have Reforged. The game downloaded a bunch of assets you didn't use. It broke compatibility with some maps. I think there were a bunch of other problems too. More [1]. Some of these might've been fixed by later updates now.

That's the best part of GOG, you can just make your own backup. I think with hard copies going away, the ability to make backups of what you buy should be protected by law, at least for software that is no longer supported (of course one side effect is that all games become services, but there have been single player games recently that prove it's still a good business model). We have seen enough cases of how digital copies are ultimately a way for companies to \"erase history\", so to speak, and this is detrimental not just to consumers but the wider culture. Hard copies was a way to guard against this, but ultimately it is all software anyway, and digital copies should provide a way to truly own what you buy (if it's a one time buy product). reply lrem 9 hours agoparentFor a very long time “hard copies” were just a physical precache of the download.

But there are very powerful interests (including at the state level) that consider DRM worth having even to 'protect' something as trifling in comparison as commercial leisure products.

Now it's just scary and a bit depressing when they announce something. I was excited all the way up through Overwatch 1, then the WC3 remaster and Overwatch 2 were awful. If they only messed up new releases it wouldnt be so bad; it's the incessant fiddling and worsening of what was good. Even of games that weren't meant to be \"live service\" games.

A sad state from the \"Blizzard polish\" of yesteryear. reply burmanm 9 hours agorootparentWorld of Warcraft has never been without issues. When it launched it was full of bugs, servers kept crashing (but they did refund a lot of gametime back then) and so on. And every expansion was just a nightmare start, without being able to get to the new zone, servers again crashing. You just have golden memories of a state that never happened. Game wise, WoW has gone forward a lot since DF (the disaster of SL taught them something) and is actually in a lot better state than before. Sure, it has bugs, but it's also a massive game. And they do keep fixing a lot of bugs with quite good response time these days instead of what it used to be. reply 946789987649 6 hours agorootparentBugs and infrastructure are two different things. Yes when a game first launches it will potentially be quite buggy, but every expansion until recently has been impressively slick. reply EugeneOZ 9 hours agorootparentprevTry playing WoW with a new account. The initial mission has incredibly ugly graphics (much worse than the main game), a flat progress bar during loading (literally just a simple blue rectangle - no borders, gradients, or shadows, just something that a basic box(x, y, x1, y1) function would draw), and a yellow rectangle instead of a rope connecting your hero to a flying vehicle. It’s not a 3D bar, just a 2D yellow rectangle that looks like a censorship block on the screen, and you’re supposed to imagine it’s a rope hanging from a helicopter-like vehicle. I understand it’s an old game, but these parts seem like pure laziness. I’m sure this laziness costs them a lot of players who leave the initial mission in disgust and never get to see the beautiful parts of WoW. reply xandrius 8 hours agorootparentSame applies to many MMOs, even GW2 and FFXIV are terrible at the beginning, compared the current content. reply dxuh 10 hours agoparentprevYou mention a really interesting point.

It's incredible what GoG is trying to do, for a profit of course but all the same. The idea of not being able to purchase older titles in a legitimate way only encourages piracy, yet if it will squeeze an extra few pennies out for shareholders, it seems like the right move.

They've essentially in-housed the exact same product that they originally commissioned for GoG. It may or may not be a jerk move, business-wise (I have no idea what their original agreement with GoG was when they launched it there), but from a purely preservationist point of view, nothing has yet been lost as a result of this. (And while it's tempting to say that in the long run GoG would have been better stewards of the old builds than Blizzard, and that would certainly be true for 99% of publishers out there, keep in mind that Blizzard has successfully kept up servers and downloads for games going back to the mid-90s up to the present day. Blizzard takes preservation much more seriously than almost anyone else.) reply SmallDeadGuy 7 hours agorootparentprevThey've released a Warcraft Battle Chest which includes remasters of those games at three times the price (but also includes Warcraft 3), hoping to capture those old game sales into a more expensive offering.

GOG took part in bullying a developer for political reasons. We don't want to live in the world where you can't criticize China or you will be cancelled. Of course Microsoft is guilty of removing the Tiananmen Square massacre result from Bing on an anniversary of that event. Did they ever explain why that happened?

Unfortunately, very few (non-giant) developers still let you buy and download DRM-free games from their own websites, and so far, as far as I am aware of, GoG is still the least bad option for the others (there's also the likes of Matrix-Slitherine and itch.io, but they are much more niche). reply cocacola1 11 hours agoparentprev> But shortly after release, Chinese players found a poster hanging in the apartment that serves as the games’ setting that said “Xi Jinping Winnie-the-Pooh moron”. > Almost 10,000 negative reviews soon flooded the game’s review page.

If I had discovered something like this in a game, I'd probably uninstall, perhaps mention that in my review if I have other things to say and move on. Many people would obviously do differently. However, if someone discovered something like this in a game that I own and called everyone to add bad reviews and others have been at work bashing the product... I'd probably say \"meh\" and not do anything. I find a line between these and while it's clear for me, I cannot put into words exactly why. Am I counting on the actions of others? Not sure. Now we have an ecosystem of very political communities online that expand into social media, games, news and even travel, and they are getting bigger. Would harsh reactions make everything better or worse? I don't know the answer but I follow my gut feeling and just ignore them. reply TeMPOraL 6 hours agorootparentFWIW, the point I'm making isn't that this is reasonable behavior. Only that it's to be expected. Myself, if I saw a game insulting something or someone I'm emotionally attached to, I'd probably roll my eyes and continue or uninstall, depending on how my mood is ruined. I might think less of whoever put the insult there (or allowed it to stay), too. But many, many others would, unfortunately, voice their disdain more directly. I picked Trump as an example because, whatever you think about him, it should be easy for us in the West to imagine people going overboard in defending/dissing him too, because that has been, and is, repeatedly happening in plain sight for many years now.

Redesigns are subscription models that revive a working brand and keep players happy with a constant flood of new features. I understand Blizzard wants to decide what story to tell about its IP. On the other hand, many gaming veterans still want to feel and grasp the before of a remake rather than the after alone. GOG hit a sweet spot for me. It simply fulfills my early adulthood dream: \"One day, I will play all my good old games on CD again. See you fellas!\" GOG is Netflix for my earliest games. But this is not the reason, I buy games there. Why did I buy a W2 at GOG over a year ago? It was not nostalgia but a closed-game approach. All new \"cloud\" games are subscriptions in disguise. I liked the fact that game mechanics in W2 were mostly figured out, and you had to max out under fixed conditions: working on skills, not play-testing new civs. That's the main difference between tradition and pure entertainment. All major forms of sport have a fixed rule set, with some minor tweaking here and there to leverage these. I don't have the time nor will to grasp these changes. Age of Empires: Conquerors lost its appeal to me, because as a casual player, I cannot keep up with all the new addons. Years ago, when there were hardly any addons, I still benefited from my former RM 2000+ rating earned around 2000 at the MS ZONE and could play quite competitively online without any pro-gamer training all the time.

    "originLink": "https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/raspberry-pi-boosts-pi-5-performance-sdram-tuning",
    "originBody": "December 2, 2024 tl;dr Raspberry Pi engineers tweaked SDRAM timings and other memory settings on the Pi, resulting in a 10-20% speed boost at the default 2.4 GHz clock. I of course had to test overclocking, which got me a 32% speedup at 3.2 GHz! Changes may roll out in a firmware update for all Pi 5 and Pi 4 users soon. My quest for the world record Geekbench 6 score on a Pi 5 continues, as a couple months ago Martin Rowan used cooling and NUMA emulation tricks to beat my then-record score. But Raspberry Pi's engineers are tweaking memory timings even further. They've talked to Micron and implemented a number of small tweaks that—along with NUMA emulation—really add up to a performance improvement for multi-core workloads. And even a little improvement for single-core! The sdram refresh interval is currently using the default data sheet settings. You can actually monitor the temperature of the sdram and it reports if refresh at half or quarter the rate can be done. That allows the overhead due to refresh to be reduced by a half or a quarter which does improve benchmark results. We got in contact with Micron, and there is good news. They have said they actually test their 8GB sdram with the 4GB refresh rate timing (rather than the slower jedec timings), and so it was be safe to run the 8GB parts with 4GB timing. The tweaks can also give the Pi 4 a boost, but the Pi 5 improves more dramatically: Pi 5 also has faster sdram, better access to sdram (i.e. wider/faster internal buses), so generally the improvements with NUMA are greater. SDRAM Tweaks To get the latest RAM speedups for now (this may be default soon): Update the Pi's firmware to the latest version: sudo rpi-update (confirm with Y) Edit the bootloader config: sudo rpi-eeprom-config -e Add the configuration SDRAM_BANKLOW=1 (for Pi 5... for Pi 4, use 3) Reboot NUMA Emulation Since my first post on NUMA emulation on the Pi 5, the patches required have been added to Raspberry Pi's OS kernel. So to use NUMA, all you have to do is make sure you're on the latest Pi OS (e.g. sudo apt full-upgrade). To check if NUMA emulation is working, run dmesggrep NUMA and make sure it says something like mempolicy: NUMA default policy overridden to 'interleave:0-7'. You can tweak the settings if you want by adding numa=fake=[n] inside /boot/firmware/cmdline.txt, though the defaults should be appropriate for most use cases. Overclocking Following my own guide for overclocking the Pi 5, I set the following inside /boot/firmware/config.txt: over_voltage_delta=72000 arm_freq=3200 gpu_freq=1000 After rebooting, I set the fan to 100%, hacked the kernel with my pi-overvolt project to boost the core voltage, and set the scaling governor to performance: $ pinctrl FAN_PWM op dl $ cd pi-overvolt && sudo ./removelimit && vcgencmd cache_flush $ echo performancesudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor Geekbench World Record, Part 2 With just the default firmware changes, my Geekbench scores already increase quite a bit (+8% single, +18% multi). Adding a 3.2 GHz overclock on top (using my pi-overvolt hack to boost voltages), those increases go to +32% single, +31% multi, resulting in yet another world-record Geekbench 6 score! Geekbench Result Pi 5 - defaults SDRAM + NUMA 3.2 GHz OC Single 833 899 (+8%) 1153 (+32%) Multi 1805 2169 (+32%) 2468 (+31%) I also ran these tests with just an Argon THRML 30-AC Active Cooler. To try to keep temps under control, I boosted the fan speed to 100%: pinctrl FAN_PWM op dl. A word on overclocking: I've now overclocked around 20 Pi 5s, and found most to be capable of 2.6 or 2.8 GHz, and many (about half) to be capable of 3.0 GHz. But beyond that, very few can hit 3.1 GHz or beyond. More exotic overclocking (to 3.4 or 3.5 GHz) is much more difficult, and I've only had one Pi 5 that even boots reliably at those speeds, with more extensive cooling. RAM timings were already not happy at those speeds, and with the extra SDRAM tweaks, I imagine extreme overclocking will be even more unstable. Conclusion These optimizations could become default soon. I started looking into this after someone on Twitter mentioned seeing Pi 500 Geekbench results starting in September—all seemingly with these tweaks in place already! Memory speed has been a thorn in the Pi 5's side in comparison to many RK3588 boards. It's nice to see the SDRAM tweaks giving it a significant speed boost, over a year post-launch. And eagle-eyed readers may note I only overclocked to 3.2 GHz instead of 3.4 GHz this time. I'll leave the door open for someone else to combine all the above tricks to hit another new WR score ;) Further reading Hacking Pi firmware to get the fastest overclock New 2GB Pi 5 has 33% smaller die, 30% idle power savings Overclocking and *Underclocking* the Raspberry Pi 5 raspberry pi overclock hacks performance memory benchmarking pi 5 Add new comment Comments Steve – 20 hours ago How about a benchmark of updated rpi 4 and 5?

    "commentBody": "Raspberry Pi boosts Pi 5 performance with SDRAM tuning (jeffgeerling.com)219 points by nfriedly 14 hours agohidepastfavorite136 comments eamonnsullivan 5 hours agoSo, I saw this link and immediately thought, \"I bet the discussion will be about how we should use N100s, instead.\" I wasn't disappointed. Even on dedicated Pi forums, you see that happening. I guess I understand this point of view if you were trying to use Pis to experiment with Kubernetes or something. You'd have built your own (desktop) PC or a personal server rack for that kind of thing, years ago. But for the vast majority of typical uses (Home Assistant, VPNs, etc.) a Pi is going to be way more than you need. It will sit there and silently and reliably run, for years at a time, powered by a USB cable. I know mine have. Why would I consider replacing those with a bigger box, fan noise and a power brick? Maybe I'm missing something? reply placardloop 5 hours agoparentI think the reality is that a lot of people don’t use or care for the main Pi features like the GPIO pins or camera connectors, and aren’t using them in places where space or power is constrained. They’re purely looking for a cheap amount of compute. For those use cases, it makes sense that performance per dollar is the top metric that many people look for. Pi used to be king there too, but as Pi prices have gone up and the price of other cheap compute has come down, it’s harder to justify the Pi. The Pi is still a great board, but a Pi5 with case, power supply, SD card will run you $100+ (throw in an SSD and you’re at $200+ easy), meanwhile an N100 PC can be had for the same price. reply elcomet 5 hours agorootparentI'm wondering why there isn't a cheapest alternative to the pi without those features that most find useless. Or a more powerful for the same price reply Filligree 5 hours agorootparentThe N100 is the more-powerful-same-price option. reply zamadatix 3 hours agorootparentprevIt's kind of like a keyboard without LED lights for status, pop up tabs for the angle, and a recessed guide for the USB cable. Would it technically be cheaper without those things? Sure... but it also costs next to nothing to add them. Once a keyboard gets to $10 almost all of the cost is already put into \"being the best keyboard for $10\". There are certainly cheaper,But for the vast majority of typical uses (Home Assistant, VPNs, etc.) a Pi is going to be way more than you need. Ah, but if a Pi is more than you need, you wouldn't be reading an article about boosting performance with SDRAM tuning or indeed caring about the RPi 5 when the RPi 3 was more than good enough. reply RachelF 12 hours agoprevInteresting, but why bother. Pi's were great when they were cheap, but one can get a better performing Intel N100 box for a similar price and power consumption now. The only reason I can think of to use a Pi is GPIO. reply bayindirh 11 hours agoparentAs a person who uses both, I won't leave an N100 system where I can leave a RPi5. First, the overall footprint of an RPi5 is way smaller, plus RPi is easier to cool passively than an N100, also it allows RPi5 to be lower maintenance on the longer run. Most N100 are noisier, hotter and bigger than a Pi5 (I have a smaller N100, but it's still actively cooled). When paired with a decent A2 card (e.g.: Kingston Canvas Go), the SD-card related lag disappears. Add a good external SSD, you have tons of solid state storage. At that point you can just forget it. I like my N100, and companies like GMKTec routes 2 PCIe lanes to NVMe slots allowing ~1.5GB of throughput, but for most home use, that's overkill. I rather use Pi as a server and N100 as a desktop (which is exactly what I do). reply throwup238 10 hours agorootparent> When paired with a decent A2 card (e.g.: Kingston Canvas Go), the SD-card related lag disappears. Add a good external SSD, you have tons of solid state storage. At that point you can just forget it. At that point you can just underclock an N100 NUC for the same price and almost the same TDP (it's pretty much even with the SSD). Most vendors configure the CPU well into diminishing returns for marketing reasons and even a small undervolt can make them passive (the same is true of many laptops). I get the form factor issue but exposed RPis without the enclosure (more $$) are a burned out board waiting to happen. I use them in enclosed hardware that needs gpio like 3d printers but the N100 wins every other time. reply bayindirh 10 hours agorootparentYou can't rule out a fan sucking in dusty air from side or worse, bottom of the case. Most N100 systems have too much air circulation inside to forget them in the long term. Many N100 systems come with 5W TDP as default. However, this is more of an \"average\" TDP. It doesn't prevent the CPU to enable its turbo and exhaust its thermal budget. Forcing it to lower envelopes via cpufreqd would work, but you're limited by your fan again, which will make everything dusty, eventually. I have found a pretty cheap completely aluminum case [0] which sucks heat from every IC and bottom of the case via silicon thermal pads. It keeps the processor at 37 degrees, cools USB bridge and power controller too. With no moving part, case is almost airtight. So, it's sitting snug and cool in that case. You can't burn RPi in that configuration.

The RPi idled at around 50°C and throttled under load. The N100 keeps 56°C under light load (the heaviest things are rtl_433, grafana, nextcloud). To keep it from throttling in heavy load I zip tied a small Noctua NF-A4x20 to the side of the case over the passive heatsink and adjusted the fan curve to only run at above 60°C. This works super well, the N100 doesn't get hotter than about 62°C under full load and the fan spins slow enough that I can't hear it at all even if I put my ear directly next to it. reply heresie-dabord 7 hours agorootparent> To keep it from throttling in heavy load I zip tied a small Noctua NF-A4x20 to the side of the case over the passive heatsink and adjusted the fan curve to only run at above 60°C.

Boards tend to be undocumented, sparsely documented, or documented with errors. It makes for a frustrating experience when you run into problems, especially when those problems are with bog-standard Raspbian (or whatever). Raspberry Pi hardware has occasional quirks (eg, don’t try to hotplug USB on a Raspberry Pi Zero), but quirks are the norm for other SBCs (anything from Pine64 is an exercise in frustration). So the modest upcharge for a Raspberry Pi is usually worth it. reply magicalhippo 8 hours agorootparentprevThere are some, but a lot of them have very spotty Linux support. In most cases either you're stuck with some ancient kernel provided by the manufacturer, or you're relying on community support from Armbian at best. Take for example the OrangePi Zero 3[1], which you can get[2] from around $25. Armbian provides community support status[3], so you're relying on volunteer efforts to provide updates and support. Also drivers for peripheral devices might be missing[4]. There are others, like say the NanoPi Zero2[5][6] for around $20, but again, support might vary. The Zero2 is so new it's not listed on Armbian, and most of the other NanoPi's are under community support. That said, I've been running some NanoPi ZeroPi's (the Zero2's predecessor) for several years now, without any issues. Just using them for light loads, one is my PiHole for example, but yeah can work great as long as you do a bit of research in terms of what's supported and not.

You can run whatever daemons and still control a relay board. No microcontroller fills that niche. There still isn't really anything in that niche other than single-board computers (i.e. Raspberry Pi clones) - for example, NUCs don't have GPIOs on them.

Write generic code that runs on a generic linux kernel and you won't have to worry about if this is a N100, N200, AMD, or even something weird like a 30 year old RS6000. Well if you need GPIO you have to worry a little, but you are forced to spend an extra day to support a generic GPIO framework instead of directly writing to PI pins - that extra effort means you don't care. Even in embedded where you have contracts to ensure the same hardware will be available for a decade everyone has moved that way because eventually the hardware you rely on goes out of production and so you need to support new hardware. reply walrus01 11 hours agoparentprevAs a desktop, one can get a used x86-64 dell ultra small form factor quad core Intel core i5 something, 16GB RAM, something 128 to 256GB SSD on eBay for a hundred bucks...

We can split our sdram, into, say, 8 NUMA regions, and configure the kernel to interleave the allocations between the regions. In addition the sdram controller allows the address bits used for segmenting the banks to be reconfigured (which we've exposed through eeprom config SDRAM_BANKLOW). https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=378276 reply moffkalast 9 hours agorootparentIf it works on a Pi, wouldn't this make sense to also implement with DDR5?

I think he used a GMKTec G3, and the numbers were not bad, but active cooling adds a constant whine to background. Some companies' fans are more whiny than others, too. N100 is not a \"cool\" chip by any passive cooling standard, esp. under load. However, its standard (software limited) TDP is around 5W IIRC. You can increase that limit for more speed and added noise. reply Cumpiler69 10 hours agorootparentYou can still passively cool it if you want to. reply bayindirh 10 hours agorootparentWhich limits its performance severely. Even with active cooling it can reach 60 degrees C without much effort. On the other hand RPi5 idles around 37 and reaches 50 degrees C while passively cooled with a heat-sink case. reply Cumpiler69 9 hours agorootparent>Which limits its performance severely. Not if you put a large fin block on it. reply bayindirh 9 hours agorootparentIf I'm going to remove the case and do my own modding, then all best are off. I want something working well out of the box. I have enough computers to play, and not enough space to put Frankenstein systems securely around the house. reply Cumpiler69 8 hours agorootparentFair enough, but the RPI 5 also won't reach max performance out of the box until you add a third party cooling case on it, be it active or passive. N100 systems at least come with a case already on out of the box that let them reach max performance albeit with some noise. And we're talking about tinkerers after all, which is the target market for the RPI. Parents won't be buying RPis en-masse for their kids from Walmart to use as their main computer for school instead of Macs, iPads, Chromebooks or Windows laptops. Average Joes who aren't into tinkering, aren't daily driving a RPI as their main computer. It's a DIY toy/tool for those who want to tinker, learn and make stuff, so some added effort is implied anyway. reply bayindirh 7 hours agorootparentYes, that's sold as a DIY computer, so getting it a case is a must. OTOH, I'll be honest and say, both the official cooler and official case for RPi allows it to run at full-steam, almost all the time. I especially bought that passive case for my Pi, because it's destined to be a \"tuck away server\" from get go, and it's trucking along just fine. I'm adding services on top of it slowly, and it's not showing any signs of fatigue. A2 card and faster SD support really makes that one shine, without adding hats on top of hats. Again, OrgangePi 5B has better hardware, but way worse support. reply moffkalast 8 hours agorootparentprevYeah GMKTec is pretty bad when it comes to cooling solutions. Literally just had the K9 with the 125H delivered yesterday and while I was expecting the fan setup to be meh, it's honestly like a bad case of tinnitus. Constant eeeeeeee at the most annoying frequencies possible. They put a tiny 40mm fan on top which resonates with the plastic box and screeches like an absolute banshee all_the_time. That one is a must-remove since it also blocks installation of any heatsinks on the nvme/ram, and a mesh top results in roughly the same temps. But they gotta put their logo on top, priorities. The second problem is the main cpu cooling, which is actually a really well made bottom intake blower side exhaust setup... but it's set up to run at like half speed even when you're at 30 degrees and there's no bios fan curve control for it except for extreme temp steps. I'm currently pondering adding a pico or attiny that reads the board PWM and retransmitts it so it only runs the fan when it's set above usual. Or maybe just a full passive copper block replacement, but that would require a case redesign... Otherwise it's a really capable little machine if they put a little effort into making it shut the fuck up at idle. reply bayindirh 7 hours agorootparentG3's fan is mostly silent. You might hear a small clicking on lower RPMs, and mostly a whoosh on higher RPMS, OTOH, it' still moving air and sucking dust from the bottom. Looks like K9 needs to move more air since it's packaing an U5 in that small box, so cooling them silently is much harder. reply moffkalast 7 hours agorootparentIirc the N100 idles at 6W and boosts to 25W, whereas the 125H idles at 35W and boosts to over 100W, which the cooler has to be designed for of course. The Ryzen boxes have similar cooling problems from what I hear. But if you run the N100 flat out, which is likely to happen given that it's not the fastest thing, and disable turbo on this one (which I've done for now since my use case is a low power server) they are actually surprisingly close in heat output.

This makes the social media operator an intermediatary who decides who you can and cannot talk to and what you may or may not talk about.

They avoid having to produce solid products with good UX by restricting access to report problems, and they help the gatekeepers stay in charge by telling the C-suite that networking is an unfathomably hard problem you can only solve by hiring people with lots of Cisco certifications. As a simple example, the AnyConnect Mac client has a bug in the socket filter related to IP changes, which means that sometimes when the system wakes it’ll block connections for roughly 5 minutes until it times out and retries (or you kill the process). I would bet that this would be fixed in minutes if it affected Windows because most Cisco people use that and only begrudgingly support Mac or Linux desktops. reply Spooky23 4 hours agorootparentprevFew vendors attract the fervor that network dudes carry for Cisco. It’s a weird and unique phenomenon. reply UltraSane 2 hours agorootparentAs a CCNP I think I can offer some insight into this phenomenon. I feel that it arises due to a few reasons: 1) CLI familiarity. Networking Professionals invest thousands of hours in learning router, switch, and firewall CLIs and want a return on this investment and this can only happen if their employer uses the equipment they are familiar with. If someone only knows the Juniper CLI then they will most likely have equal fervor for Juniper hardware. Having to use a CLI you are not familiar with adds stress to an already very stressful job. 2) Operational streamlining. Generally if every device on a Network is Cisco they will work together more reliably than if not. This isn't as true as it used to be but is still true. If your company network is Cisco only then Cisco cannot blame other manufacturers for an issue. Personally I'm fine with having non-Cisco hardware. The Cisco Firewpower \"next gen\" firewalls are utter garbage compared to palo alto. My company has dozens of Cisco 2960 access switches and Cisco in their infinite wisdom has replaced this very cost effective product with the extremely NOT cost effective 9200 and 9300 series switches.

Not sure when that stopped. That is really what kept perl going between the years of 2010 and 2016 or so. The board was actually paying a couple of people to do maintenance on the core repository and code. I believe they still do that but obviously due to deficits that is going to get difficult. It's sad when so many companies are dependent upon perl, but donate nothing. A good case in point is AT&t in the 1980s was broken up into 20 plus different companies. They were then remerged back in the 1990s. But when they merged, they had 20 different computer systems and perl was actually used to glue all those systems together and handle data sanitation and ETL pipelines. Yet AT&t never donated anything to perl. reply jimmaswell 2 hours agoparentI miss Craigslist, seems like everyone moved over to Facebook Marketplace a few years ago. reply VTimofeenko 1 hour agorootparentAnecdata but as a buyer and seller I consistently have had a much better experience on CL.

You develop something for free, make it available to everyone for free, allow them to modify use and misuse as they wish. Every single step is your conscious decision. And then, you beg for donations, and complain that people are not donating? Doesn't make sense. If you don't want to work for free, just charge for it. reply rubyfan 2 hours agorootparentIf it was a business model then people would charge, but it’s not a business model it’s an ideal that leads to a common good. There are parallels to funding education and scholarship programs in public universities. Corporations often rely on human resources around office locations and they spend in order to ensure a steady flow of talent development. Funding open source is not that different of an issue. One challenge here is IT/Tech departments are often cost centers that are strictly budget controlled and it’s harder to make a case for non-essential costs like funding open source. reply rglullis 2 hours agorootparentprevFree software is more than just a business model. reply throitallaway 2 hours agorootparentprevYeah, I've never thought it compulsory to reimburse for any open source software. Some projects are \"lucky\" enough to have large corporate contributors/stewards, and others are projects of passion. Maintenance activities (bug reports, feature additions, participation in community discussions, etc.) should be considered a form of \"paying\" for OSS - you're giving back and improving the ecosystem. I've done plenty of that for various projects; it's something that I enjoy doing. reply rglullis 2 hours agorootparentIt is not \"compulsory\", but not doing it is extremely short-sighted, like the equivalent of failing the marshmallow test in a collective scale. reply Ologn 2 hours agorootparentprevCygnus, Red Hat, MySQL, JBoss etc. all had successful business models. Android, React and other projects come from companies with mixed business models, but they have had success as well - there are billions of active Android phones, and many web sites running React.

This new trend of maintaining or starting an open source project and then getting upset when people don't send you money is seriously weird. If you want compensation, start a company, otherwise consider anything you receive a gift. reply graemep 14 minutes agorootparentYou can also do things like dual licensing. GPL or Affero GPL plus proprietary license. Of course this puts off outside contributors so not if you want a \"bazaar\" development mode—but people complaining about this are usually not doing so. reply mardifoufs 1 hour agorootparentprevYeah, though I have sympathies for single devs or projects like perl that are obviously non profit. Like, I get the frustrations for actual volunteers and people who survive on building OSS at a small scale. What really annoys me is when someone decides to build a corporation around an open source project, and then you get the usual blog post around users not paying or OSS not being sustainable. Yes, using OSS as your marketing and adoption strategy is probably not very reliable and can cause users to use your OSS as if it was OSS, that is, without giving anything back. But usually those projects succeed because they are OSS, and would've had basically no users otherwise. Who would've used MongoDB, elastic search, or redis if they were proprietary and required a paid license from the get go? In a way, that's also true in this case (success came from being OSS) but again, I get why it seems unfair for some when it's a non profit not being able to sustain itself or get contributions for corporate users. reply anticorporate 1 hour agorootparentprevDo they owe anything today, in the sense of a legal obligation? No. But we've regulated the tragedy of the commons in all sorts of other instances. There's no reason, for example, that a small percentage of corporate income tax couldn't be allocated to a grant program for free and open source software projects. reply badsectoracula 1 hour agorootparentThat's a good thought in isolation. The problem however is how are you going to ensure the money collected for that purpose go to the projects that actually need it and there wont be any corruption involved? It isn't hard to notice, for example, that in EU where gamedev companies often receive grants for various nebulous reasons tend to be companies that do not need the money in the first place (and yes, of course there are devs who received money that needed them, somehow people have to excuse the existence things they benefit from). reply anticorporate 1 hour agorootparentI don't think you're going to solve corruption perfectly in any system, but isn't that a bit of a red herring? We manage to do this within other fields of endeavor, at least in the United States, by using an intermediary. Examples: National Science Foundation, Corporation for Public Broadcasting, National Endowment for the Arts. reply creato 9 minutes agorootparentprev> There's no reason There definitely is a reason, and it's the same reason this problem exists in the first place: it's hard to measure the value a library or tool generates, whether it's open source or not. How are you going to allocate this tax to projects at scale? Companies already can barely solve this problem internally, and often fail completely at it. Just imagine how many times you read a comment on HN lamenting the lack of investment in IT infrastructure. The idea that you'll solve it at society scale as a government, for things much more nebulous than even IT infrastructure, is laughable. reply carlosjobim 57 minutes agorootparentprevThat's honestly the sneakiest suggestion for implementation of communism I've heard so far in my life. Give away low quality software for free, then later demand that the government force people who want nothing to do with you or your code to pay you for your efforts. It's parasitic on several different levels. Then all FOSS hackers will be like Khrushchev, wondering why Western industry always outproduced his own, even though the Soviets \"where doing everything right\". reply coldbrewed 1 hour agorootparentprevOpen source is a gift within a gift economy. The software may be freely used but the labor needs to come from somewhere, and donations of either direct labor or compensation help ensure that the overall gift economy can continue to function. reply munificent 1 hour agorootparentprev> because people using your software doesn’t cost you anything.

Where do you draw the line between extending your project and providing free labor to a for-profit company? Fixing bugs is less controversial, while finding solutions to issues arising in bespoke production environments, with short deadlines, is grueling work for which companies are usually gladly purchasing support contract.

I work on my various projects to the extent that it is fun. If it stops being fun, I don't do it. Making something broadly useful is generally more fun than helping someone with a one-off thing, though that is not my decision criteria.

Obviously there will always be legacy code to maintain but these days I can't even remember the last time Perl was mentioned in casual conversation amongst my peers unless we're sharing war stories from the 90s. These days when we find ourselves needing to write a script our first go-to would be bash, and if we need more features or if it's going to be complex enough to have to worry about maintenance costs we'd probably reach for python. TIL that there is a non-profit foundation that focuses, in part, on supporting Perl. That surprises me to the same extent that I would be surprised to learn that there is a foundation aimed at supporting VB6 (though now watch someone is going to share that there is). reply lizknope 2 hours agorootparentMost of my coworkers above age 45 still use Perl. I am constantly parsing reports and then generating commands to run from that. I learned Perl in the 90's and it still works great for that. I have to code in Tcl for most of our EDA tools (chip design) but I still parse reports in Perl. The younger engineers use Python and I've learned enough but I really don't care. I'm not writing big systems or anything in Perl or Python. It's the Tcl code that has tens of thousands of lines because that is what the tools require. reply cafard 2 hours agorootparentI was about to say, Hey, I use Perl, but then I saw this posting with the over 45 qualification. Yep, that's me (way over). Honestly, I write about a script a quarter in Perl, but it definitely is handy now and then. reply gertlex 2 hours agorootparentCurious: do you also do script-writing in other languages? And just pull out perl for a subset of problems? Or are most things at the \"bigger than a script\" level for you? I'm not here to judge. I still prefer to write my python scripts like it's the 2.7 days... (more effort goes to python \"code\") reply cafard 24 minutes agorootparentGenerally, if the script is more than a one-off, I will write in Python, since all the young seem to know Python, and very few seem to know Perl. There are two recurring jobs that I have not rewritten from Perl, one because \"pack\" is so handy. The only other language I use much for scripting is Javascript, or rather Jscript, for our accounting department sometimes needs files munged for integration into Great Plains, and I can count on cscript being on the machine and running such scripts. reply leejo 1 hour agorootparentprev> I'm surprised to learn that Perl is still used. For this year's London Perl & Raku workshop I shortlisted 70 companies to look for sponsorship. That was with minimal research and effort. These ranged from long term (\"legacy\") users of Perl to startups. From small companies to very large and profitable fintechs. I cover this briefly in the talk I gave at the end of the workshop: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el7qHRpEDeE Yes, there is far less Perl than there was 20 years ago.

The incentives are just not working out, and it seems impossible to mobilize even a fraction of the sums for OSS-donations than what companies burn for much less critical aspects of their operation than OSS tools/libraries/components (or waste outright). Open source is largely a thing because lots of people voluntarily invest (valuable!) time on their own in my opinion (with corporate sponsorship being almost negligible by comparison). reply that_guy_iain 1 hour agorootparentMost big open-source projects are a thing because a companies invest in it. When we rely on people doing it in their free time what we see is unmaintained software. The entire idea that open source is volunteer work is largely a myth when it comes to popular open source. Even the ones where you think it's volunteer work they do so much during their working hours that either they're lying to their employer or it's sponsored by their employer. reply rglullis 2 hours agoparentprevIt is mind boggling how much funding there would be for the Gimp/Krita/Inkscape/Penpot developers if every designer gave them 5% of what they give to Adobe. reply miohtama 1 hour agorootparentThis is correct and sad. Open source would be much better with sustainable funding models. But hard to see how this could happen in SaaS dominated modern world. reply rglullis 17 minutes agorootparentWe \"just\" need to flip the narrative. Let's stop talking about \"services\" that people need to pay for and make FOSS something that people invest so they can (collectively) own later. People love to shit on crypto, but no other industry got so many small-scale, open source projects that got funded when people have high hopes of making bank from it. I wonder if we could get people to invest in open source projects that were tied to a short position on the proprietary counterpart. reply autarch 2 hours agoparentprevHere's some details about the foundation's financials - https://blogs.perl.org/users/makoto_nozaki/2024/10/understan... reply infecto 1 hour agorootparentI don't know the dynamics of this board but does anyone else find it strange that the secretary is digging through public documents to generate a post outlining finances? Is that not what the treasurer should be helping with? Then the treasurer makes a public comment to the post? Feels very strange to me. reply autarch 4 minutes agorootparentJust to clarify, Dan Wright is the former treasurer. He retired from the TPRF board back in 2020 (https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/board_update_tpf_treasu...). But to answer the bigger question, yes, I think this was a bit weird. I was also on the board for a while, and I think we did not do a good job of reporting on and monitoring financials. This was one of my frustrations with the organization, and part of the reason I stepped down from the board (though there were other, bigger, reasons not related to the board as well). In fact, I had made the same points as Makoto does in his blog post maybe 1-2 years earlier in a board meeting. We were running a constant deficit and we didn't seem to have a clear plan for what we would do if that continued. reply verelo 2 hours agorootparentprevSo yeah, they’re doing rough… Not sure what the path out here is?

I started playing with Ubuntu in 2006. Exploring the system, I'd come across system scripts in perl here and there, but Lennart Poettering has gradually displaced these with unit files that are much easier to read. These days I may invoke perl occasionally. A few years back I used checkconfig.pl to build a slimmed-down kernel config for an embedded board.

It is still an act of good. reply dale_glass 1 hour agoparentprevPerl used to, but I'd say not anymore at this point. Many of the big Perl names long moved on; CPAN is full of abandoned modules. And the world doesn't sit still. So as time goes by, there's more and more risk of you finding out that some Perl module you're using no longer works.

DuckDuckGo has improved substantially since the last time I used it (around 2012), and it's to a point where the results are comparable, and sometimes even better than Google, so changing was pretty seamless. Now the only Google-thing I need to remove from my life is YouTube. As a somewhat technical person, I was curious about one thing; I saw that the primary language for DuckDuckGo is Perl. Without making any judgement here, was there a particular reason for that choice? Also, are you planning to move to Perl 6? Anyway, I appreciate you reading my email.

Scharon Harding – Dec 2, 2024 6:58 PM83 Some customers are waving good-bye to Broadcom's VMware. Credit: Getty Some customers are waving good-bye to Broadcom's VMware. Credit: Getty Text settings Companies have been discussing migrating off of VMware since Broadcom’s takeover a year ago led to higher costs and other controversial changes. Now we have an inside look at one of the larger customers that recently made the move. According to a report from The Register today, Beeks Group, a cloud operator headquartered in the United Kingdom, has moved most of its 20,000-plus virtual machines (VMs) off VMware and to OpenNebula, an open source cloud and edge computing platform. Beeks Group sells virtual private servers and bare metal servers to financial service providers. It still has some VMware VMs, but “the majority” of its machines are currently on OpenNebula, The Register reported. Beeks’ head of production management, Matthew Cretney, said that one of the reasons for Beeks' migration was a VMware bill for “10 times the sum it previously paid for software licenses,” per The Register. According to Beeks, OpenNebula has enabled the company to dedicate more of its 3,000 bare metal server fleet to client loads instead of to VM management, as it had to with VMware. With OpenNebula purportedly requiring less management overhead, Beeks is reporting a 200 percent increase in VM efficiency since it now has more VMs on each server. Beeks also pointed to customers viewing VMware as non-essential and a decline in VMware support services and innovation as drivers for it migrating from VMware. Broadcom didn't respond to Ars Technica's request for comment. ARS VIDEO Broadcom loses VMware customers Broadcom will likely continue seeing some of VMware's older customers decrease or abandon reliance on VMware offerings. But Broadcom has emphasized the financial success it has seen (PDF) from its VMware acquisition, suggesting that it will continue with its strategy even at the risk of losing some business. Beeks is just one company that has moved away from Broadcom's VMware. But its story underscores the ongoing challenges Broadcom has in pacifying customers who have felt disrupted by the changes it has implemented. Ignacio Llorente, CEO at OpenNebula Systems, told Ars that \"several relevant organizations\" are moving from VMware to OpenNebula but that he couldn't disclose specifics. He added: In our experience, recent price increases have prompted these companies to explore alternative solutions. At its core, this is a matter of trust—many organizations feel they can no longer rely on VMware or other vendors that distribute proprietary components. Like Beeks, other VMware customers have claimed costs for working with VMware skyrocketed due to Broadcom ending perpetual license sales (a move Broadcom has claimed was planned before Broadcom bought VMware) and combining VMware's previously bountiful SKUs into a small number of bundles. Ars spoke to numerous customers who have said that their VMware costs increased 300 percent under Broadcom. Similarly to Beeks, AT&T previously claimed that Broadcom proposed new pricing that would have resulted in AT&T’s VMware costs increasing by 1,050 percent. AT&T sued Broadcom for not renewing perpetual license support, but the companies have since settled. Broadcom sought to appease small- and medium-sized businesses with a new, more SMB-friendly subscription tier announced last month. The move came amid concerns that Broadcom was primarily interested in enterprise-size customers for VMware and was overlooking the needs of smaller firms. But Broadcom’s changes have already pushed many customers to research alternatives to VMware, including rivals like OpenNebula. And with customers struggling to juggle new, higher costs associated with using and selling VMware, we can expect more companies to find ways to decrease dependence on VMware, just as Beeks has.

I did a 5 min lightning talk in summer about this: https://pretalx.com/devconf-cz-2024/talk/SN93LG/ reply prmoustache 6 hours agoparentIt is funny because my former company was trying to move out of vmware even before the broadcome aquisition and the local sales rep pretty much told us RHEV was a dead project but at the time openshift virt wasn't ready yet. In the end I left before broadcom bought vmware but the status at the time was \"let's wait a bit more\". reply rwmj 6 hours agorootparentI don't agree with the deprecation of RHV since it's very closely modelled on VMware vCenter in terms of the concepts and user interface. So it's ideal for ex-VMware admins. But here we are. Containers & Kubernetes are more buzzword-compliant than virtual machines. reply ghaff 5 hours agorootparentprevBasically, RHEV as a VMware takeout project never gained a lot of traction. With the general industry shift towards containers and Kubernetes plus the Broadcom acquisition, kubevirt in combination with a much more mature OpenShift is a lot more interesting. reply heraldgeezer 4 hours agorootparentSo working in the MSP space providing IT support to clients, our VMs are 90% mostly Windows Servers.

Thanks xoxo reply ghaff 3 hours agorootparentRed Hat (obviously) and Microsoft (increasingly) aren't all that focused on Windows as an operating system on the server. And the desktop, in general, is about the browser with some relatively niche exceptions.

The strategic jump is probably to Kubernetes/OpenShift/kubevirt but there are probably intermediate steps like Xen one could make instead off VMware. reply swarnie 3 hours agorootparentprevOdd way of phrasing your question but my general thought is yourThere never was a lot of interest in RHV as a like-to-like VMware alternative That is because it was before Broadcom lit VMware on fire. Nowadays everyone is looking for a like for like VMware alternative. > Kubernetes/cloud-native friendly VM alternative to VMware Cloud-native and VMs for the people used to the VMware world are antithetical.

Charging 10x the price to 10% of your customers isn't necessarily a bad strategy for a business. 6 months ago on HN: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40452260 > Steve McDowell, chief analyst at NAND research, told The Register that VMware by Broadcom is “laser focused on high-revenue, high-margin business” and has priced its wares “just below the pain threshold for customers they care about.” reply red_admiral 6 hours agoparentThere is a famous story about business in the UK when some sales manager at Coca Cola raised the price by a small amount for JD Wetherspoons, one of the largest chains of cheap pubs across the country. The manager must have felt very smug about the extra revenue they'd bring in, from a small change that the client could easily absorb and could hardly moan about. What else could they do, move to Pepsi? They did exactly that, and the sales manager was fired over losing one of the biggest clients and the loss of revenue that came with it. One needs to be very, very careful about both the pain threshold and the \"** you, I'm moving my business elsewhere\" threshold. reply ta1243 5 hours agorootparentSure, it's a gamble. But if Broadcom increases price 10-fold and loses half the customers by revenue over the next couple of years, that reflects in their bonus and they can then move on. The customers might have a plan to move off vmware by 2027, but continue to pay the money until then. Come the 2027 renewal the execs that made the massive bonuses for increasing revenue have left and then when the company says they aren't renewing it's the next generation dealing with the problems, and then they just reach for the three-envelopes. This really is on the companies that choose a single supplier. If you had two providers, then shifting doesn't take a 3 year program, it's just a policy change to prefer Provider B rather than Provider A. reply remus 5 hours agorootparentIt's worth bearing in mind that it's not just a financial gamble but a reputational one as well. Chances are most of that 90% of your customer base who were previously fairly happy are now very unhappy with a forced move to another platform, so in 10 years time when they're in some other business and making purchasing decisions, someone will mention VMWare and the only thing they'll remember is that shit show where they spent 6 months migrating off it because of some ridiculous pricing change. reply acdha 5 hours agorootparentThat’s the big problem I see for them: all of the VMware guys I know _hate_ this move and are talking about being betrayed. Even if they aren’t immediately migrating, I don’t think many people are going to be comfortable increasing their dependency on Broadcom, whereas before that was as close to a given as it gets in business. reply ta1243 4 hours agorootparentprevReputational loss won't be realised for a few years, the people making the decisions will have moved on by then. reply kevin_thibedeau 3 hours agorootparentprevThe problem is that their documentation is now a shit show. Their 10% whales are going to get fed up with that eventually. reply heelix 5 hours agorootparentprevWhen I worked as a SE, we'd often categorized sales reps as 'hunters' vs 'farmers' when it comes to managing the accounts. The hunters would hit their numbers, collect their bonus, move on, and leave the account in shambles for us to try and assist the new rep in recovering. This is the first time I've noticed that attitude in the company leadership. My heart goes out to our (now) Broadcom rep, as I can tell they are putting the squeeze to all contracts, to their mid-term detriment. reply jl6 5 hours agorootparentprevFor the vast majority of companies, supply chain diversification represents a cost with little immediate benefit. In the long term, it can be a rational hedge against hostile supplier lock-in, but the vast majority of companies aren’t good at making long-term bets. reply plagiarist 5 hours agorootparentprevThere really needs to be a different mode of compensation that forces the C-suite to prioritize long-term company success. reply smugma 5 hours agorootparentApple[1], for example, has performance based RSU’s for its executives. RSU’s vest over 3-4 years and the number granted is dependent on Apple’s performance relative to the S&P. Stock prices theoretically have future cash flows built in but markets are inefficient. In this case, if Broadcom starts losing customers in 2027 and revenue declines 5%, it would get hammered in the market at that point in time, punished much more than the 5% drop. [1] From Apple’s SEC filing: The value received by our named executive officers in 2022 from long-term equity incentives reflects exceptional stock price performance over the applicable vesting periods. As a result, for the applicable performance periods, performance-based RSUs vested at 200% of target for our named executive officers based on Apple’s TSR relative to other companies in the S&P 500 (“Relative TSR”), which was at: • the 96th percentile for performance-based RSUs held by Ms. Adams, Mr. Maestri, and Mr. Williams, and • the 99th percentile for performance-based RSUs held by Ms. O’Brien. Mr. Cook was granted an equity award with 75% performance-based vesting and 25% time-based vesting reply ghaff 5 hours agorootparentprevTheoretically, stock compensation should do that. In practice, many/most investors have a pretty short time horizon in mind as well. I'm not sure how you provide an incentive for long-term company success absent very deferred compensation which I imagine most people reading this wouldn't favor either if it applied to them. Bird in hand worth two in the bush and all that. reply EraYaN 3 hours agorootparentprevAnd most importantly some clients will not communicate that they are unhappy and just move on quietly. Especially for something like virtualization which is essentially a commodity. reply helsinkiandrew 5 hours agorootparentprevI would guess the plan for the larger companies is to sell a whole suite of products around the VMware: management, ops, auditing etc, plus take very good care of their niche requirements so moving becomes a much more expensive proposition reply tonyedgecombe 3 hours agorootparentprevWetherspoons might well be the sort of company Broadcom wouldn't want as a customer. reply guappa 5 hours agorootparentprevOh interesting. In sweden it's really hard to find a pub that has coca cola, they almost exclusively have pepsi. Also in the supermarket pepsi is cheaper. reply onei 6 hours agoparentprevBut does it not make you more vulnerable to competitors? Losing one of your few big customers will hurt regardless, but it likely hurts less if you have a pool of SMBs to act as a buffer. reply HPsquared 6 hours agorootparentIn the long term, sure. They might just be strip mining it. reply tvink 6 hours agorootparentprevIn terms of competition it's really the same. Whether you fight with a team of 1 for 5 businesses or a team of 10 for 1 business that is 50x bigger, on average as long as you have equal competition in each segment you walk away with the same. But you get very different customers, for better or worse. A segment of a customer base is hardly a buffer, if you underserve them they will leave, and you will have wasted effort making an inclusive sales and support process to them. reply acdha 4 hours agorootparentThat makes not losing those customers more critical: if you lose one of the 50 smaller businesses, your revenue is barely affected; if you lose that 50x whale, you’re out of a job especially given how hard it is to find another one of that size. This shows up especially in the context of hiring: for a generation, there have been a ton of people who learn VMware at businesses of all sizes and your large shop can reliably hire them. Shutting down smaller sales affects that directly and because the smaller places are going to do something else it means that the people who move up to a bigger place are going to have direct firsthand experience contradicting what the VMware sales people are saying about how risky it is not to use their software. reply gampleman 6 hours agoparentprevThis doesn't sound exactly like a small customer, with 20000 virtual servers on 3000 physical ones isn't exactly a tiny deployment. reply JOnAgain 6 hours agorootparentIt’s definitely going to be on the small side. reply mrweasel 6 hours agorootparentMy first reaction was that you're wrong, but you're probably correct in that large scale VMware installations are much larger than 3000 servers. The small side is going to be a large set of customers, probably the majority. There are tons of VMware installation that are 3 - 20 physical server, more so than 10.000 server installations. Right now Broadcom is telling those customers, and those with 500, or 1000 servers, that they can take their business elsewhere. Broadcom is much happier to milk the top 5% of customers, compared to servicing the \"bottom\" 95%. Broadcom seems to be cutting of to large a chunk of customers. They also are preventing new large customers from coming in. No one starts out with 10.000 physical servers and no one wants to switch a growing 5000 server datacenter from HyperV, KVM or Nutanix to VMware. reply jerf 4 hours agorootparentIn this case you're probably better off thinking of these things in roughly logarithmic terms rather than absolute. By the time you're up to 20,000 servers, you are going to have roughly the same issues to solve as a 10,000 server install and a 30,000 server install. In absolute terms there may be VMWare installations that seem much bigger, but in logarithmic terms there aren't that many more classes above them, and they get rarified quickly. The same ways that you're telling this customer to get stuffed are going to be affecting even the bigger guys in a way that you can't necessarily compare the experience of this customer to the \"10 VMs on one server\" customers. It's risky to do that. I'm not sure there's as much differentiation in the market to be exploited as Broadcom thinks. Even their larger customers are not just going to sit there and take it... they're just going to move more slowly. But at that scale, VM migrations have a very natural granularity to them; you move them one at a time. You don't need to drop VMWare next quarter; you can just begin your migration project and move away at a pace of your choosing. But then again, Broadcom may well be explicitly viewing this internally as \"we no longer have a competitive product, there is either no way to differentiate it again or we're not willing or able to invest in what it would take, and so the game is just to milk all the money we can out of this\", in which case this is pretty close to what I'd expect to see. Where I personally sit in their customer base now, VMs are a commodity and I've got no reason to pay for them anymore. That's been true for a while. I'm speaking here just as A Guy, not as an employee of anyone, but I would expect that this reality has been slowly but surely crawling up the market from where I sit at the bottom. (This is just discussion, not \"disagreement\".) reply kotaKat 6 hours agoparentprevHell, AT&T just settled with Broadcom. Five bucks says they stay right where they are. Hock Tan knows what he’s doing to force the big players to pay and extort them to the nines. https://www.ciodive.com/news/broadcom-att-vmware-settlement-... reply philjohn 6 hours agoparentprevA less charitable (but I'd argue, likely more correct on balance of probabilities) is they're aiming for the larger customers who are so entrenched in their use of the VMWare product stack that they can't feasibly migrate without taking a huge one-time hit to their balance sheets. reply jijji 6 hours agoparentprevi never understood, even 15 years ago, why people still use vmware when so many open source (i.e. virtualbox) systems existed at the time. The fact that Broadcom buys it out and then 10x the price on people is just even more reason to move to open source. As noted in the article, the open source solutions are 2x faster anyway, so they customers can realize a 2x increase in slices per server. reply dessimus 5 hours agorootparentThe ones staying with VMware, permanently or near term, are likely using products for which there are not good replacements. The open source alternatives can do what ESXi does sure, but its progressively more difficult to replicate VSAN (including stretched clusters) and NSX-T (with distributed firewalling) without bringing in multiple vendors that will all point at each other when there is a problem. reply bluGill 5 hours agorootparentprevVmware is better by our performance tests. Still is better but not 10x the price better. reply kube-system 4 hours agorootparentprevThere are some open source options that come close to what vmware's offerings could do, but virtualbox for sure ain't that. It has an extremely limited feature set compared to other offerings in this space. For example, it is mainly intended to manage VMs on a single host. Most organizations looking at commercial offerings have multiple hosts (or racks, or even datacenters) they want to manage. Apples are much more similar to oranges than vmware is to virtualbox. reply guappa 4 hours agorootparentprevvirtualbox is buggy and it's not open source. reply mdaniel 53 minutes agorootparentThe VirtualBox extension is not open source, but VirtualBox is GPLv3: https://www.virtualbox.org/svn/vbox/trunk/COPYING I can't speak to your buggy claim since I don't know which feature you are complaining about, and if it's part of the extensions then the \"many eyes, shallow bugs\" does not apply reply gosub100 5 hours agorootparentprevBecause they dumb it down, you pay more for VMware but then you can hire cheaper, less educated people to run it. reply heraldgeezer 3 hours agorootparentprevFor desktop virtualization, vmware workstation is the best.

What I picked up is that before the acquisition, price was mostly determined by CPUs on the hypervisor, now it's mostly by RAM. Which means we now have to optimize hypervisor hardware to a different licensing model. I don't think we've seen 10x price hikes, but it could possible if a provider has optimized hard for a metric that is now less relevant, and/or has difference licensing deals.

How on earth do people justify this? reply linsomniac 6 hours agoprevI know VMWare works great for a lot of people, but it was always just a thorn in my side. Almost a decade ago my small company moved from VMWare to ganeti, and we've been really happy with it. At the time we were running a SAN and the small VMWare Essentials license. But managing it with Windows was painful for me personally, and our HP SAN was kind of painful, every year like clockwork it would just stop processing until we had remote hands reboot it. And every year they'd tell us \"Try this firmware\" to shut us up for another year, until eventually the product reached EOL. We had been running ganeti in our dev/stg cluster for years at that point (and the python.org infrastructure was using it at that time as well), so I decided to transition us to local storage running VMWare and then to ganeti. Doing local RAID array monitoring on VMWare was quite painful at the time, maybe that's gotten better? I absolutely love that ganeti has such a good suite of command-line tools for operating. I have a small shell script that respins half our dev/stg infrastructure every other day. Our entire critical infrastructure is HA at the machine level, so we don't play around with anything like live VM moves, we just do offline moves. I used to do the drbd-based replication and live moves, but the doubling of disk writes and committed disc usage wasn't worth it for us. Proxmox is on my radar if we needed to move away from ganeti, but so far we are looking like we'll stick with ganeti. reply p_l 5 hours agoparentIs ganeti still alive? I remember it being a thing a decade+ ago, but haven't seen it mentioned much since. reply linsomniac 4 hours agorootparentThe latest release is almost 3 years ago, but the repo has commits a month ago. So I guess it depends on your definition of \"alive\". As \"stable\" software, I'm fine with it not having a ton of active development. It's been a real workhorse for me, I've got it running on 2 clusters of 6 physical machines each (1.4TB total RAM, 50TB disc, each). ~6 years ago I went to a local Dell dog and pony show where someone at the next table was poo-pooing on \"those greybeards that run Debian and ganeti\" instead of VMWare. But, this shit works... reply p_l 2 hours agorootparentGood to hear. VMware used to be honestly my preferred option because it handled certain hairy things well out of the box that many other solutions either ignore or require non trivial integration work (for example it's trivial to connect a VMware VM to piss-poor external network by simply attaching a VLAN - which matters when the network is a fieldbus in some OT deployment) Ganeti I remember as comparatively harder to deploy (nothing was harder than openstack though) reply maltris 7 hours agoprevHaving been in the field for some time and having some contacts, I must say: 100% of the companies where I get some insights are currently either already building alternatives or reviewing their options with a strong intention to leave VMware behind.

But they knew that for every customer like that, there would be 3 or more Fortune-500 type companies that don’t want to risk any disruption and have big IT budgets that they can divert into covering the increase if they have to.
