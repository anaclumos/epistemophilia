One thing I'm surprised they disclosed is on page 35 that Heather Brunner at WP Engine was interviewing for a job at Automattic. That's why we were spending so much time together 1:1 without her team there in the meetings I posted here: https://automattic.com/2024/10/01/wpe-terms/ They lied that it was to run WordPress.com, though, she wanted to be the Executive Director of WordPress.org for Automattic, a position that was held by Josepha. reply safety1st 15 hours agoparentHi Matt, great that you're participating here and I'm broadly supportive regarding your concerns with the trademark and WP Engine's conduct. However I do not understand why you chose to make 1.5 million enemies in the WordPress community in one weekend by shutting down their ability to update plugins with zero warning and consequently reducing the security of their websites. To be entirely blunt it's all damage control for us at this point when your name comes up, and it's because of that one singular mistake, if this was just WPE and Automattic duking it out in court no one would really care, but now the reliability of the WPOrg infrastructure is being questioned by a big chunk of the people who depend on WordPress and they will probably be inclined to walk away from your infrastructure and deeper into the arms of someone like WPEngine when they get the chance. If you care about the broad perception of your efforts and your business practices I think you need to address this. Again I see that there are plenty of reasons to take issue with WPE's conduct but this singular decision you made has people calling for you to step aside and let someone else run WordPress. It's not going to go away on its own. reply mike_d 12 hours agorootparent> make 1.5 million enemies in the WordPress community in one weekend by shutting down their ability to update plugins with zero warning AWS and Digital Ocean run local Ubuntu download servers and do not depend on Canonical to run their business. WPEngine is a hosted service and could make very simple changes to download updates from their own servers. reply JimDabell 12 hours agorootparent> WPEngine is a hosted service and could make very simple changes to download updates from their own servers. This all kicked off when he publicly accused WP Engine of “butchering” WordPress for disabling revisions: > What WP Engine gives you is not WordPress, it’s something that they’ve chopped up, hacked, butchered to look like WordPress, but actually they’re giving you a cheap knock-off and charging you more for it. — https://wordpress.org/news/2024/09/wp-engine/ Disabling revisions is a configuration change. This is the simplest possible change you could make, and it’s unacceptable in his eyes. Making WordPress contact something other than api.wordpress.org requires altering the codebase. Making this configurable is something he has explicitly rejected: > Why would I build that? The built-in source works great, for tens of millions of servers. — https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41676885 So according to Mullenweg: - If WP Engine alters WordPress, even just to alter its configuration, they are “butchering” it. - If WP Engine doesn’t alter WordPress and leaves it pointing at api.wordpress.org, they are unfairly using community resources. – Huge numbers of people using api.wordpress.org is actually “great” and scales to tens of millions of servers. As far as I can see, he doesn’t have a consistent position. He’s just grabbing hold of the nearest accusation that he thinks will harm WP Engine in the heat of the moment, regardless of what he has previously claimed or who else it hurts. reply safety1st 12 hours agorootparent> Disabling revisions is a configuration change. This is the simplest possible change you could make, and it’s unacceptable in his eyes. Actually this is wrong. Yes the constant WP_POST_REVISIONS exists. But WP Engine has disabled this constant. They do in fact \"butcher\" WordPress in the sense that they remove a feature, you can't turn it back on by yourself, and you need to talk to their support to get a limited version of it re-enabled by them. Add to that, revisions are a big deal for a certain type of customer. Say, an enterprise scale publisher for example who has built an extensive publishing workflow around WP. (Hacker News consistently underestimates how massive some WordPress installs are; the scale of the world's biggest publishers, many of whom rely on WordPress, blows your nice little startup out of the water.) So I am aware of a case or two where this actually became a negotiating point in an enterprise contract. The customer was entirely unaware that revisions were just a free thing built into WP, and it influenced the resulting contract and cost. Dirty dirty on WPE's side, really. BTW this is documented at https://wpengine.com/support/platform-settings/ and you can see on that page that they limit their environment in many other ways. In the abstract this may not be a huge problem, hosts have costs and security and various limitations to think about. In my personal experience there are limitations which are not listed on that page and those are more frustrating. reply hoofhearted 3 hours agorootparentAre you able to name of the publishers that you say run massive WP installs? I do know they exist of course, Sony being one. I’m coding up a little something that I feel is more modern and superior compared to WP, and I’d like to learn what their business requirements and use cases are that keep them on WP. Thanks in advance! reply dewey 1 hour agorootparentI don't want to discourage you...but there's so many WP alternatives out there that are supported by bigger companies, have a big ecosystem around them with agencies and developers for many years. Why would massive WP installs switch to \"a little something\"? reply dncornholio 11 hours agorootparentprevThe revision system is terrible though. Even we limit it for our clients. It doubles or triples the amount of queries your site and admin needs to run. Have some multi language plugin on top and your site will be eating memory and cpu. If WordPress would have made an actual usuable revision system, this wouldnt have been an issue at all reply safety1st 11 hours agorootparentI think this is where Matt's perspective actually makes sense: \"So, you guys built a $400M/yr business on our open source project, and when you had problems with the revision system, instead of contributing improvements, you just turned it off (and maybe converted it into an enterprise upsell some people are paying extra for!)?\" Intel, Google, even Microsoft etc. develop improvements to Linux knowing full well that their competitors will also get access to those improvements. For sure it's disappointing that WP Engine contributes almost no time to Core. reply remoroid 8 hours agorootparentWordPress is infamous for its terrible codebase. Everything is jammed into a single wp_posts table including revisions. The frontend code is just as bad. I'm sure they blame the need for backwards compatibility. The entire thing should be retired. reply delfinom 7 hours agorootparentThe entire thing makes money and serves the purposes of people using it even for free. It's a well-engineered product whether you want to accept it or not. Unlike more than half of the tech world that's unprofitable and is just a fart in the wind of tech memory. reply Communitivity 7 hours agorootparentNo, it's not well-engineered (speaking with over 25 years as a professional software engineer), at least the portions of the code I have looked at. Things I vaguely remember (it's been ten years since I looked at it) are lack of data normalization (and not in a performance optimizing way), template includes that depend directly on order of inclusion and variables in other templates, very little code isolation, and PHP. WP is a well-delivered product that works well for its user base in most situations. Plenty of code is well-marketed, profitable, and fulfills users' needs, but not well-engineered. By the way, I know the PHP gripe is contentious, but it's not the reason why I think WP is badly engineered, it's just the reason it was easier to engineer it badly. See https://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/ for more details on PHP. One excerpt from that page: There is a whole lot of action at a distance. Consider this code, taken from the PHP docs somewhere. @fopen('http://example.com/not-existing-file', 'r'); What will it do? If PHP was compiled with --disable-url-fopen-wrapper, it won’t work. (Docs don’t say what “won’t work” means; returns null, throws exception?) Note that this flag was removed in PHP 5.2.5. If allow_url_fopen is disabled in php.ini, this still won’t work. (How? No idea.) Because of the @, the warning about the non-existent file won’t be printed. But it will be printed if scream.enabled is set in php.ini. Or if scream.enabled is set manually with ini_set. But not if the right error_reporting level isn’t set. If it is printed, exactly where it goes depends on display_errors, again in php.ini. Or ini_set. I can’t tell how this innocuous function call will behave without consulting compile-time flags, server-wide configuration, and configuration done in my program. And this is all built in behavior. reply atonse 5 hours agorootparentI would argue that Wordpress is a great example of how something doesn't need to be \"well-engineered\" (when it comes to abstractions, maintainability, etc) to be widely useful for many. Although I think the exception there is security (and yes I know many will say clean and well engineered code is secure code). Security has to be solid or it will impact too many people negatively. reply gjsman-1000 1 hour agorootparentprevAh yes, the infamous 12-year-old fractal of bad design article which is almost entirely obsolete. reply northhanover 6 hours agorootparentprevCan you posted your most widely used project so we can see an example of good engineering? It would be interesting to contrast with WP. reply mgkimsal 5 hours agorootparentNo it wouldn't be 'interesting'. For years, wordpress stored user session data in 'wp_options'. Moderately trafficked sites needed to come up with regular purging hacks to 'clean' their wp_options table. Why? Session data is not an 'option', it's... session data. Make a database table called 'wp_sessions'. Transient 'cached' data also... in 'wp_options'. This was not an example of 'good engineering'. This is just one of many examples of suboptimal tech decisions. Some have been mitigated, updated or otherwise 'fixed' over the years, so they may not be relevant any longer. It's a very popular and widely used platform despite some poor development and engineering choices, and perhaps even in some cases because of these poor choices, but that doesn't make them good engineering. reply Hasu 5 hours agorootparentprevThe idea that no one is allowed to criticize anything unless they can and have done better is one of the most perniciously stupid ideas out there that just won't go away. If the parent poster is secretly Linus Torvalds, do you walk away in shame because he HAS done a project with better engineering? Or are the criticisms, perhaps, objectively valid or invalid, and worth engaging with regardless of the merits of the person making the criticisms? reply joshmanders 1 hour agorootparentWell when their whole argument boils down to \"php sucks\" and they back up their claims with a document that was invalid 12 years ago when it was written, they better have something to back up these criticism. reply chx 10 hours agorootparentprevTo recap, every post is stored in the wp_posts table and revisions have a post_type of 'revision' and a post_status 'inherit' (attachments also inherit). There's no gradual improvement you can do to this. More, their codex does not discourage accessing the database directly at all rather points out there's a class to make it easy https://codex.wordpress.org/Database_Description so moving revisions to a separate table will break every plugin which wants to access revisions and uses the wpdb class to do so which is just not acceptable: \"WordPress strives to never break backward compatibility. It’s one of our most important philosophies, and makes updates much easier on users and developers alike\". We can have debates about whether this philosophy is the right one or not but there's no point. It's what it is and it makes fixing things like this simply not possible. reply dncornholio 11 hours agorootparentprevWPEngine has tons of developers working on the WordPress ecosystem. This contribution argument doesn't work with me. They're contributing plenty of hours into WordPress plugins that their competition also can use. reply biccboii 7 hours agorootparentNo they don't. They contribute 40 hours a week. reply aimazon 6 hours agorootparentThat's the amount of hours they contribute to the \"Five for the Future\" program which specifically refers to work on a subset of the WordPress project managed by Automattic. For example, WPEngine own and develop Advanced Custom Fields, a plugin used by hundreds of thousands of WordPress websites. The work they do on that isn't covered in the 40 hours. Likewise, WPEngine run the DE{CODE} conference but that isn't included in the 40 hours either. reply johnchristopher 8 hours agorootparentprevIs there a list ? reply austhrow743 11 hours agorootparentprev\"A third party will complain\" is not a valid reason to provide poor service to your customers. reply JimDabell 9 hours agorootparentI’m not really focusing on WP Engine’s service here. I’m pointing out that the constraints Mullenweg has voiced appear to be self-contradictory and unsatisfiable by any WordPress host. reply jamespo 12 hours agorootparentprevI don't understand why wp engine don't just maintain a fork reply shabgzer 9 hours agorootparentHave a look at the WordPress core. ;-) Here's a nice example: https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/blob/92d9e70f849c337c... reply spyke112 7 hours agorootparentSo in your opinion what's wrong with that code? To me it seems to be nicely documented and everything. reply shabgzer 6 hours agorootparentThat it is - it better be. It's an example of the kind of backwards compatibility WordPress needs to deal with the myriad of crazy content generated by people (and plugins!) over the years. Often this gets very chatty and very inefficient. Besides backwards compatibility, this codebase grew like a jungle, with people just piling code on, not always with much forethought. Part of it's due to the limitations of PHP in the old days, and of course it's inherent with projects of this size, but there are varying degrees of messiness. WordPress is an example of a project that started out too messy and only became more messy over time. Just to pile on: the WPDB class is another example of continued messiness. The first thing I do whenever I write a plugin, is to add a little database wrapper that just uses PHP PDO instead. Anything better than to deal with the hopeless, inefficient, inflexible mess that is WPDB. (To whoever wrote it: sorry mate!) Edit: this guy said it better: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41729827 reply darkwater 4 hours agorootparentprevSo even better, WP engine could rewrite it from scratch in a better way. Maybe even use another language. Or maybe it is just fine for their use case and they are making already enough money with it... reply jantissler 5 hours agorootparentprevIt's not about what WP Engine could have done, but how Matt acted. If he wanted WPE to use their own Plugin repository, he could have told them so and given them a date. But cutting off access to updates without warning to all these sites is inexcusable. Matt chose the \"nuclear option\" without realizing that the fallout would also hit WordPress and himself. In addition to hundreds of thousands of websites that had nothing to do with his gripes. reply nchmy 4 hours agorootparentFrom the lawsuit: In a social media post on the platform X, he boasted that as a result of his actions, WPE is now a “distressed asset,” worth just a “fraction” of what it was before, because “[c]ustomers are leaving in droves” – calling into question whether Defendants’ motivations extend beyond mere interference and extortion, and are in fact a thinly disguised attempt to artificially drive down WPE’s valuation in hopes of acquiring it on the cheap Its not unlikely that the gameplan all along was slander and disrupt them so much that the company would become worthless, then acquire it. He was trying to blackmail/extort WPE's CEO into coming to work for him, after all! (text message screenshots are in the lawsuit too) reply safety1st 12 hours agorootparentprevSure, but to do that they'd need to know they are about to be cut off, something which they were given zero warning about. Had they known they 100% would have ensured that customers didn't lose service. Matt chose to surprise them. It's a very nuanced thing. The world could be very different today. There would have been very little pushback against Matt's crusade if he'd just thought about making sure service to users was uninterrupted. Instead he dragged 1.5 million sites into the middle of this in a way that made him look like the bad guy. I hope that WordPress will continue to be open and Matt will continue to lead it, but he just cost himself a lot mindshare. That's why I asked him to explain why he made the choice he did. Hopefully he has a PR person who is advising him on how to handle this situation. Were it me, I would say something like: \"My passion for keeping WordPress open source got the better of me and I made a hasty decision which caused problems for end users. I've learned from this and it's not a mistake I will ever repeat. Going forward if there are changes to how we administer WPorg's services we will discuss them with the community and announce them well in advance because we want them to be rock solid and reliable for all of the millions of websites which depend on them.\" This type of statement would go over well with a lot of people including the big enterprise customers who are depending on WP, who Matt really wants and who are constantly being courted by WP's competitors. In followup messaging you can reiterate all the strengths of open source e.g. how it reduces vendor lock-in. But what do I know, I've only sold a couple million dollars worth of WP contracts, meanwhile Matt is worth 400 of those big M's. :) reply chuckadams 3 hours agorootparentEven without dragging the wordpress.org infrastructure into the mess, MM's blackmail campaign wouldn't have played well with the community. But it would have blown over as just more #wpdrama, whereas this ... I think we're likely to see the WordPress trademark invalidated. Even if it isn't, this case winning means every last WP host can just line up and cite it, making the trademark as good as generic anyway. reply mike_d 11 hours agorootparentprev> Sure, but to do that they'd need to know they are about to be cut off, something which they were given zero warning about According to Automattic they had been in discussions for 20 months. Your anger should be with WPEngine for taking your money while knowing full well their service depended on servers ran by a company they were on (best case) shaky terms with. Up until about 8 months ago, Bluehost (another big paid hoster of WordPress sites) ran its own plugin mirror with no issues: https://github.com/bluehost/pluginmirror reply mort96 7 hours agorootparentDid Automattic tell WPEngine that they'd cut off plug-in updates 20 motnhs ago? Or is the 20 months thing just completely irrelevant to the point that Automattic should've given a heads up before cutting off plug-in updates reply nicce 11 hours agorootparentprev> According to Automattic they had been in discussions for 20 months. They could have give a warning 20 months ago that this may happen and then this would not be a thing. reply GlacierFox 10 hours agorootparentYea, WPE should have done that. reply jantissler 5 hours agorootparentMatt's behavior is inexcusable and shows that WordPress needs a complete restructuring without him. Too many sites rely on WordPress to endanger them because of one man's temper tantrum. I don't understand how you can defend this reckless behavior by him. Who cares what WPE could have should have done. He needs to step down immediately. reply mthoms 3 hours agorootparentprev\"WPEngine should have foreseen something that has never happened in the 20 years of the software's history\". I mean yeah, companies should have contingency plans for things that are extraordinarily rare but let's be reasonable about it. No one, including you, saw this coming. I challenge you to find a single blog post, tweet or HN/Reddit comment that suggests Matt could one day shut off wp.org access to a single company running 1.5 million sites without any notice to that company, or the community members who will be affected. It's unconscionable. Or at least it was. Be reasonable. reply ThinkBeat 4 hours agorootparentprev> AWS and Digital Ocean run local Ubuntu download servers I would think that is a cost-saving measure as well. A hell of a lot of that data would be downloaded by users every day. Being able to pull it locally saves all that. Also, it is faster and does provide some security. > They do not depend on Canonical to run their business. That depends on how you look at it. If for some odd reason Canonical vanished tomorrow, that would be a big problem for both DO and AWS. They do rely on Canonical developing, fixing upgrading the distros. But then Amazon does have their own in-house Linux distro, which is/used to be somewhat associated with RedHat/ Centos https://github.com/amazonlinux/amazon-linux-2023 I would expect AWs,Google etc have specific internal only distros that make up the foundation of their cloud business but that is just a guess. reply arielcostas 7 hours agorootparentprevBecause Canonical makes it easy to clone their entire repositories and host your own mirrors. You can change your ubuntu mirrors changing the configuration files themselves (or via graphical programs on desktop systems), unlike in WordPress where you'd need to \"butcher it\" (Matt's words, regarding disabling revisions by WPE) modifying the source code to point to another server. reply jdub 8 hours agorootparentprevBut from the very beginning, Canonical/Ubuntu chose to make mirroring the repo easy, and encouraged the usual network of public mirrors to participate, much as Debian and other distros had done for years. (It wouldn't be unfair to say that Canonical/Ubuntu had to meet the expectation those distributions had set.) That is something the WordPress community (albeit centralised in the WordPress.org decision makers) could have been doing for decades. reply lsaferite 6 hours agorootparent> WordPress.org decision makers That would be Matt as the sole owner of wordpress.org, not a plural 'decision makers' reply Spastche 1 hour agorootparentprev>However I do not understand why you chose to make 1.5 million enemies in the WordPress community in one weekend by shutting down their ability to update plugins with zero warning and consequently reducing the security of their websites. yup.

Casting WPEngine as some sort of saint is highly inaccurate. reply moneylotion 12 hours agorootparentprevA million people trusted WPE’s resources. WPE, in turn, relied on someone else’s. The real issue here is that WPE completely overlooked the fact that they haven’t done the work to maintain the availability of their apps.

The actual non-profit [1] had expenses of $41k in 2022, which wouldn't come anywhere near paying for wordpress.org infrastructure and personnel. I guess Wordpress is going the RHEL route.

The WordPress Foundation owns the right to use the WordPress marks for non-commercial purposes. It can also sublicense out this right for particular events (e.g., WordCamps) and to people supporting the WordPress project and community.

To be very specific about at least one of the issues: * The URLs pointing to the WP plugin directory on wordpress.org are hardcoded into WordPress * If WPE forks WordPress to fix that, and continues to say they host WordPress, IANAL but they probably have a trademark violation problem on their hands. There are certainly workarounds which exist, but it's hard for us to conclude casually on Hacker News whether they can be deployed at WP Engine scale and in compliance with whatever agreements WP Engine is bound to. So yeah you're right about what the right thing to do is. But frequently reality is not that simple. They needed time and maybe even assistance from wporg (in helping them to be free of wporg. errrr) reply luckylion 11 hours agorootparent> * The URLs pointing to the WP plugin directory on wordpress.org are hardcoded into WordPress But they can be changed via filters. I do that all the time to manage when certain request are being made (and making sure it's in a cron job and not a user-request). WP Engine does run their own plugin in the instances they host, though I assume it's not obligatory. Still, every site I ever had to look at that was on WPE had it installed and enabled. WP does come with its own CA certs, but that file could be appended (or replaced, again via filter) as well. Since they're comfortable changing things like the revision settings, I doubt this would be something they wouldn't do. I'm not saying Matt is reasonable, but \"it's not an easy thing to do\" isn't true. reply chuckadams 3 hours agorootparentIt's academic now, the mirroring has been a done deal since Oct 1.

I have seen that more than once in anti competition lawsuits and Heather has as well reply ThinkBeat 4 hours agorootparentprevI have not heard of anyone being turned off from using WordPress from this. That does not mean it does/has not happened, I am sure some folks got mad. It is a stupid hissyfit and some bad judgments. People make mistakes. There are far better purely technical / code issues to turn people away from WordPress, but WordPress is spectacularly popular. reply marpstar 2 hours agorootparentUhh. I am. I've launched probably 30 websites using WP over the last 10 years, a couple for household name brands. WordPress stopped being \"cool\" awhile ago (because \"PHP sucks\" and the like), I've defended my usage of it in plenty of past comments, despite it being long past \"cool\". The way MM talks about enforcing the trademark, the licensing distinction (i.e. the commercial use of \"WordPress\" to Automattic only) -- am I allowed to call myself a \"WordPress\" developer and charge people money for it anymore? Or do I have to worry about a trademark troll? I'll admit that I'd already been looking for a modern alternative. I'm a web developer, I almost exclusively write in TypeScript, something running on Node just makes more sense for me. I recently built a project on PayloadCMS and NextJS -- Payload has since integrated directly into Next's server and has a really nice \"website\" template to get started.

In fact, I met you at a WordCamp here in NZ 15 or 16 years ago. Anyway, this whole episode has been the final nail in the coffin for me, and I no longer want to have anything to do with WordPress. I've long thought that the relationship between Automattic/WordPress.com and WordPress.org was not good for the community, and your behaviour here has put that beyond doubt. I honestly don't know what's going through your head, but you need to try to wind back the clock a couple of weeks and put things right. You continue to lie and manipulate words (even in this thread!) to make it sound like you are in the right, but it's not working. You need to stop. reply bwb 6 hours agorootparentI left WordPress ~8 years ago for a similar reason. I watched Matt destroy friends' WordPress businesses by saying they violated the WP ethos while he and Automattic did the same thing in their businesses. I've seen them break legal agreements with theme creators and refuse to pay them despite contracts. They also use legal threats against small creators to force them to accept an agreement that pays far less. I would never do business with Matt or Automattic. They have behaved unethically in my experience. Matt has too much power and uses it to do whatever he wants. He should never have been allowed to be involved in WordPress.org once he was working at Automattic. reply Brian_K_White 4 hours agoparentprevIt's obvious what you intend to accomplish, but here is what you've actually accomplished: Before this week I knew what wordpress was (of course), did not know either names WP Engine nor Matt Mullenweg, and had never happened to build a site with wordpress. Now I know your name and will never build a site with wordpress. You can choose to make that about me instead of recognizing any responsibility for that outcome, but it's never the less a fact. Do with this simple data what you will, but data it is. Another comment by someone else in one of the severel conversations on this went something like: \"I don't know either of these companies and so far WP Engine hasn't said anything yet. So far I have only heard Wordpress's side of the story, and that has made me assume that Wordpress are the side in the wrong.\" That is some galaxy brain stuff right there. reply Kye 16 hours agoparentprevDon't lawyers usually advise their clients to stop talking about it when they're sued?

Its embarrassing, even if I enjoy reading the content. Of course its possible that these posts are happening through consultation with a lawyer/PR or something but often it feels like someone using their “inside” voice in the outside, and reads like unforced errors. reply DannyBee 16 hours agorootparentprevLawyer here - we do. For very good reason. A. Legally, it cannot possibly help you (whatever happened, happened). However, it can hurt you (inconsistent statements, etc). This is particularly true in colloquial environments like HN. B. While it may be useful reputation/press wise, because anything you do wil be evidence, you should be having someone else do that. C. If you are part of a publicly traded company, you can run into SEC violations quickly from what you say, how you say it, and where you say it. Even moreso if you are CEO/an officer/etc I could go on forever here - for example, you can also run yourself into trouble quickly if the people you are talking to are people you know may be witnesses in the case, etc. There is a near infinite number of reasons lawyers tell people to STFU when you get sued. Of course, if your company/you as CEO get sued, it can obviously be incredibly frustrating and difficult to sit there and watch a one-sided story take hold - not the least of reasons because people often take complaints as evidence rather than assertions, and the response rarely gets as much press, etc. I think the closest lots of HNers come is when they love their company and see a legal complaint pop up on HN that they felt is just insane but can't say anything about it. It's like that, but like 100x worse :P. But saying nothing is the most useful thing you can do - get away from it. Take a walk, meditate, whatever. Get the people who are experts in handling it involved (lawyers, comms folks, whatever), and let them do their job.

Not a lawyer but have been at some major companies when legal stuff goes down. Most have told us: \"hey, there's a thing going on. Do not talk about it, don't reference it, don't 'correct' people. If anyone asks you for comment, send them to us\" I've been deposed and it sucks. It's exceptionally stressful, even if you're not the target in the situation. reply DannyBee 15 hours agorootparentRight. The best case scenario here is that Rachel (or one of her associates more likely) takes every single sentence Matt has written here, or anywhere else, tonight, and cross-checks it against every other sentence or fact he's claimed before. Or that his company has claimed. or the foundation has claimed. or .... Then at the deposition, they will then ask a lot of hard, uncomfortable questions about every single inconsistency, no matter how little. Because that is what they spend many hours preparing to do. That's the best case. reply caseysoftware 14 hours agorootparentDoes similar apply to some of the Automattic employees who have been talking everywhere? Is there a point where it could switch from \"a bunch of people running their mouths\" to \"a coordinated harassment campaign against WP Engine and its customers\"? reply DannyBee 3 hours agorootparentYes. Most lawyers in cases like this are not assholes (surprisingly), so they generally won't spend time/energy deposing people who can't produce useful evidence, even if they could. As a result, you would generally stick to people who have relevant evidence, are capable of legally binding the company (often director or above) or speaking for it (various others), etc. But - if you need to prove a coordinated campaign, and can't get evidence of it otherwise (emails, chats, etc), sometimes you just got to depose a lot of people. Usually the path of least resistance is taken, however, and electronic evidence is often sufficient enough these days to not end up having to depose lots of employees. Judges (magistrate and otherwise) also are pretty careful in ensuring you aren't being malicious (IE just trying to harass employees) reply saagarjha 15 hours agorootparentprevHmm, you didn't say the magic words so I am going to treat your words as if you were representing me. Thanks for your service reply DannyBee 15 hours agorootparentSee now i would go copy paste one of those 73 page email signature disclaimers but it would push everything off the page. reply kragen 4 hours agorootparentprevdo you think there are cases where the public perception of the conflict is more important than the outcome of the lawsuit? reply DannyBee 4 hours agorootparentSure. Lawyering is a means to an end, not an end unto itself. Lots of companies fall into the trap of letting lawyers make business decisions instead of being advisors of legal risk/etc to the business. Done properly, they are advisors 99% of the time. Which means, to answer your question, there are plentyof situations where the outcome of the lawsuit is not as valuable to the business as the narrative/etc. For example, there are people/companies whose brand is their most valuable asset. \"family friendly\" celebrities are a common example, i think. For them, the narrative and control of it may be way more important than winning or losing. Now, i would still say - even in that case, the person going off and talking in public without someone helping them know what to say (not necessarily a lawyer) is still often a really bad idea. They are often too close to it, etc, to really be objective about what will make the most sense, even if the goal is \"control the narrative\" rather than 'win the lawsuit\" or whatever. But in those cases, working with a crisis manager or whatever, if the most important thing is the perception, have at it. At the same time, people involved tend to be in a bit of a bubble. It often feels more critical, urgent, and well known than it really often is. So for example, here, i'm sure to lots of employees/Matt it feels like a thing everyone is talking about. But in reality, uh, its not. It isn't carried by any major news site, and even among the general open source or developer community, i would bet 99% of people have no idea about any of this. Even within their customer base i would imagine it still isn't widespread knowledge (though it likely will be over say the next week). So in a case like this, you have time to catch your breath, engage your best people, and think about your response. Which you should take. That isn't always the case mind you (it's like any incident response). But i think it's the case here. reply kragen 2 hours agorootparentthank you for your thoughtful and humble response. i'll have to think about it reply dangafee 16 hours agorootparentprevnext [2 more] [flagged] saagarjha 15 hours agorootparentI would much rather dang moderated this site reply elicksaur 16 hours agorootparentprevDefinitely true and all of his communication - this thread, he’s given some interviews, etc. is very odd for a legal strategy. reply flutas 16 hours agorootparentRight, this all feels like (and I'm not trying to be rude with this, I'm speaking from experience) a mental break.

It’s not all of them, by any means, but it’s definitely one sort. In ordinary circumstances it manifests as a preference for maintaining control over making moves that might, by some measures, be better (improving business success, or limiting liability, say) and a string of quiet and maybe fishy-seeming but not exactly red-flag dust-ups; when a big enough obstacle (especially to that whole “control” thing) shows up and throwing their weight around can’t make it go away, though, things can get real dicey. reply spondylosaurus 13 hours agorootparentprevI don't even know if it's a vendetta about WP specifically or just the result of his general disposition.

He, or his opposite party, could literally be lying about everything they're saying here and there's no way for us to know or evaluate it.

Yeah sure. People on the internet can lie. It is not like we believe everything which comes out of the mouth of any party ever. That is not a reason for me wishing them to shut up. It would be in their best interest to stop talking. But it is not our job as third parties to enforce that or even encourage it. We are not his legal representation, nor we are his fairy godmother. > He, or his opposite party, could literally be lying about everything they're saying… Yes. > … and there's no way for us to know or evaluate it. That is not true. We can hear them out and then apply our logic, look at the things presented and can absolutely evaluate them. We don’t have as strong tools as people in a court case do. For example we can’t subpoena them, nor can we demand discovery. But that is how 99.9% of our interactions are. It is not like we only have to engage our critical faculties when it is about a court case. They have to be always engaged. And it is important to remember that the likely outcome of any such evaluation is that “there is not enough info for me to know for certain”. That is not some weird edge case of critical thinking, but the default state of things. reply edanm 5 hours agorootparent> That is not true.

I was getting at this distinction - in a court case, there are real tools, both legal and investigative, that let you determine truth to a much higher degree than in random internet (or real life) conversations. What I highly dislike is that the person who is acting responsibly legally, and who is probably acting more responsibly by trusting the court system to determine what should happen, is always the party that doesn't engage in this kind of talk.

Reading documents like this for the first time pointing out where things don't make sense to me.] > 89. Defendants’ extortion campaign included levying personal attacks against the CEO of WPE for not capitulating to his demands. For instance, on September 26, 2024, Mullenweg gave an interview on the X platform during which he gave the CEO’s personal cell phone number to the interviewer and encouraged him to contact her. She was in fact contacted by the interviewer. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUJgahHjAKU [Edit: Ignore this paragraph, see JimDabell and lolinder comments below] I watched the whole interview they linked to and don't recall that happening, ChatGPT also doesn't seem to think so based on its transcript. During the interview Matt did ask at one point if Theo would talk to Lee and Heather on stream, it was about giving everyone a fair chance to tell the story and I doubt that anyone can characterise it as extortional in nature. Even it was Matt who gave the number away during stream (if it was cut out of the YouTube version) or off stream, it's a huge stretch to claim that as \"personal attacks\" as part of an \"extortion campaign\"... > 90. Defendants’ attacks against WPE’s CEO have also continued in private. First, on September 28, 2024, Mullenweg attempted to poach her to come and work for Automattic, and falsely suggested that WPE’s investor was making her do something she did not want to do. They screen capped just Matt's message without any context about what was said prior to that message? By September 28, 2024 they have already met many times in-person, too. I think it's just insane for Matt to send a text like but that just seems very out of context in isolation. If absolutely nothing compelled Matt to send that message then I guess it's possible that he's either extremely naive or he is a psychopath. > 91. After WPE’s CEO did not immediately respond, Mullenweg threatened her the following day. Specifically, on September 29, 2024 Mullenweg gave her until midnight that day to “accept” his job “offer” with Automattic. If she did not accede to his demand, Mullenweg threatened to tell the press, and WPE’s investor, that she had interviewed with Automattic: > 93. WPE’s CEO did not respond to Mullenweg’s September 29 threat 91 has very interesting wording: \"After WPE's CEO did not *immediately* respond\". In contrast to 93, they also don't claim that Heather didn't respond to the messages on September 28. The screenshot of Matt's message on September 29 begins with this: > Heather, after our extensive discussions about you joining Automattic, the offer you negotiated with me is still on the table. So... there was definitely a conversation between the screenshots on September 28 and September 29 that lead Matt to think that they presumably didn't include? > 92. Mullenweg’s premise was false, as WPE’s CEO had never interviewed with or negotiated a job offer with Automattic. To the contrary, back in 2022 Automattic had asked if she would be interested in running wordpress.com, but she politely declined. 92 feels like an assertion that's deliberately placed between 90, 91 and 93 to potentially make their claim seem more valid? I suppose \"had never interviewed\" depends what kind of evidence Matt can produce at this point if he's not lying; if it's all in-person and there are no records at all, which he pointed out in the interview with Theo, then it's unfortunate. The \"[had never] negotiated\" part doesn't make sense at all if something was indeed discussed between September 28 and September 29. > If you decline, on Monday morning, I tell Greg Mondres: > - Lee's refusal to negotiate terms to resolve our conflict > - your interviewing with Automattic over the past year > - I will possibly tell the press all of the above I feel like the minority on HN that wants to give Matt the benefit of the doubt. Even so, that's a sure-fire way to get someone who may have been listening to you to turn on you. If you're not going to call your lawyers, at least call Theo since he offered. reply JimDabell 14 hours agorootparent> > during which he gave the CEO’s personal cell phone number to the interviewer and encouraged him to contact her.

Among other statements, Mullenweg acknowledged his retaliatory and vindictive intentions, saying: “They could make this all go away by doing a license.

Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\" WordPress is itself a fork, with no copyright assignments, so Matt has no ability to change the license. Given this, is it legal for WordPress.com to continue using and distributing the WordPress software as we speak? reply photomatt 17 hours agoparentThis was a separate agreement from their GPL license, which of course allows them to fork.

The agreement does not limit it to non-GPL code in any way, so i'm really not sure where you are getting that from. The plain terms cover all of automattic (et al) software, which includes the stuff that has GPL code in it. The normal way such an agreement would be written to cover only non-GPL pieces would be to say it does not attempt to modify or change rights you get elsewhere, blah blah blah. It includes no such clause. If you've got meaningful parol evidence that it was meant to cover only non-GPL code, great, let's see it.

You'd have to file a claim for breach of contract or infringement (or both). This matters because if, for example, your main incompatibility is around the patent pieces (that's one of them), and there are no patents anywhere involved, you may have a hard time convincing a judge that there is really a breach of contract. reply throwlicense 1 hour agorootparentI do not believe it is legally \"GPL v2 or later\" at all. The original b2 license was GPL v2. There was no or later version option in the original b2 license. Given that WordPress is a derivative work, it has to keep the same or compatible license. Which \"GPL v2 or later\" is not. Note how the original license is GPL v2 at [0], then the \"or later\" header is added much later at [1] seemingly out of nowhere.

So if they wanted to be able to market themselves as offering WooCommerce(TM), they had to agree to the license, in which they'd have to promise not to use the aforementioned GPL rights. I am nowhere near knowing enough about trademark law to say whether this is anything even approaching a reasonable use of trademarks. reply mort96 7 hours agorootparentBut that's not what the legal document says? \"Cease and desist from using the trademark\" is a different sentence from \"cease and decist from forking and modifying code\" reply kemayo 3 hours agorootparentI'm not defending his position, or talking about whatever's in the legal documents, I'm just trying to explain the distinction Matt seems to be drawing between the trademark license (and attached terms) and the software license in this thread. (Personally, I think it's a fairly bullshit distinction that's completely against the spirit of the GPL. It's probably legally allowed, though.) reply mort96 3 hours agorootparentI don't understand how that's supposed to work. You can't use a trademark to prevent anyone from forking a piece of software whose license allows forking. You can say that other people can't use your trademark in forks, but that doesn't seem to be what's going on here? \"Cease and decist from forking or modifying the software\" is, again, a different sentence from \"cease and decist from using our trademark in your modified versions of the software\" reply kemayo 2 hours agorootparentMy understanding of Matt's position, and what that term sheet he posted is talking about, is that he feels that WP Engine needs a trademark license to cover what it's currently doing. He feels that their usage of the marks exceeds what's generally allowed under the \"everyone can use it this way\" terms that WordPress.org offers. His position isn't just that they can't use the trademark to apply to their forked version, it's that they can't use it as they currently are even if it wasn't forked. So Matt's now offering these terms: a license to use the trademarks as they currently are, in exchange for concessions. The concessions include that they'd agree to not use their GPL-granted right to fork the code. This sounds like an agreement that would hold up, assuming he's right about the trademark policy. Again, I have no idea about the actual legalities of trademark usage. It's entirely possible that Matt is wrong about them not being allowed to do what they're currently doing with the trademarks, but it sounds like lawyers will be arguing about that. reply Terretta 16 hours agorootparentprev> fork or modify software He mentioned \"trademarks\". This phrase is messy: \"forking WooCommerce\". There's a likely fracture between the two words. One might have a right to fork source, while one might not have a right to mark and trade what was changed under the same trademark. Similarly, a source license might require prominently disclosing changes made to source, such as redirecting an affiliate support stream from a trademark owner's account to one's own account, while it might be trademarks that decide whether one can still call this permissibly edited thing the same name or let users think it's the same thing. To be clear, I have no idea what rights or agreements are at play in this particular situation, just noting these are not the same rights. reply duskwuff 16 hours agorootparentprevLet's be clear about who did what here. WP Engine didn't agree to anything. You demanded that they not do these things. reply DannyBee 16 hours agoparentprevA few things: First, something general - one thing to keep in mind is that open source folks think of these things as license violations/etc, but that's not actually a thing, legally. Breach of contract and copyright infringement are. That is how a claim would be analyzed. Not as a \"GPL violation\". Why is this relevant? Well, you really have to think of this stuff as contracts to use a given copy of software, and not as some abstract thing licensed or not. This is fairly relevant because: 1. The general view on GPLv2 is that you gain a shiny new license every time you receive a new copy from someone else. In other words, you have signed a new contract. So while your rights may have been terminated the existing contracted copy (and you would be liable for distributing or ... that one), if you just get a new copy from someone else, congrats, new contract. This is supported by the license: \"6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.\" Let's assume this was not true 2. Wordpress is actually GPLv2 or later. GPLv3 has a notice and cure period. Under GPLv3, they would still be within the cure per",

    "originBody": "Patent troll Sable pays up, dedicates all its patents to the public! 2024-10-02 Emily Terrell Patrick Nemeroff 9 min read Back in February, we celebrated our victory at trial in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas against patent trolls Sable IP and Sable Networks. This was the culmination of nearly three years of litigation against Sable, but it wasn’t the end of the story. Today we’re pleased to announce that the litigation against Sable has finally concluded on terms that we believe send a strong message to patent trolls everywhere — if you bring meritless patent claims against Cloudflare, we will fight back and we will win. We’re also pleased to announce additional prizes in Project Jengo, and to make a final call for submissions before we determine the winners of the Final Awards. As a reminder, Project Jengo is Cloudflare’s effort to fight back against patent trolls by flipping the incentive structure that has encouraged the growth of patent trolls who extract settlements out of companies using frivolous lawsuits. We do this by asking the public to help identify prior art that can invalidate any of the patents that a troll holds, not just the ones that are asserted against Cloudflare. We’ve already given out over $125,000 to individuals since the launch of Project Jengo in 2017, and we’re looking forward to celebrating the successful end of the Sable iteration of Project Jengo with our Final Awards! To learn more about how things concluded with Sable and next steps in Project Jengo, read on. Background For anyone just joining us on this odyssey, here is a little background on how we got here: Sable sued Cloudflare back in March 2021. Sable is a patent troll. It doesn’t make, develop, innovate, or sell anything. Sable IP is merely a shell entity formed to monetize (make money from) an ancient patent portfolio acquired by Sable Networks from Caspian Networks in 2006. Caspian Networks was a router company that went out of business nearly 20 years ago. Using Caspian’s old patents, Sable sued Cloudflare and many other companies, including Cisco, Fortinet, Check Point, SonicWall, and Juniper Networks, alleging patent infringement. While these other companies resolved their disputes with Sable out of court, Cloudflare fought back. Sable initially asserted around 100 claims from four different patents against Cloudflare, accusing multiple Cloudflare products and features of infringement. Sable’s patents — the old Caspian Networks patents — related to hardware-based router technologies common over 20 years ago. Sable’s infringement arguments stretched these patent claims to their limits (and beyond) as Sable tried to apply Caspian’s hardware-based technologies to Cloudflare’s modern software-defined services delivered on the cloud. Cloudflare fought back against Sable by launching a new round of Project Jengo, Cloudflare’s prior art contest, seeking prior art to invalidate all of Sable’s patents. After years of Cloudflare aggressively litigating against Sable’s patents before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the district court, Sable was left with only one claim from one patent to assert against Cloudflare at trial. If you’d like to know more, we described those battles, in which Cloudflare successfully eliminated around 99% of Sable’s claims, in more detail in a prior blog post. Sable and Cloudflare came together in a five-day jury trial in Waco, Texas in February 2024. At trial, Sable did its best to try to map its decades-old router technology onto Cloudflare’s modern software-based architecture. But Sable’s case was riddled with technical issues and its efforts backed only by the desire for a payout. The jury agrees: Cloudflare does not infringe To defeat Sable’s claim of infringement we needed to explain to the jury — in clear and understandable terms — why what Cloudflare does is different from what was covered by claim 25 of Sable’s remaining patent, U.S. Patent No. 7,012,919 (the ’919 patent). To do this, we enlisted the help of one of our talented Cloudflare engineers, Eric Reeves, as well as Dr. Paul Min, Senior Professor of Electrical & Systems Engineering at Washington University, an expert in the field of computer networking. Eric and Dr. Min helped us explain to the jury the multiple reasons we didn’t infringe. From slide deck presented by Cloudflare to the jury during the trial First, we explained that the accused Cloudflare products (Magic Transit and Argo for Packets) do not route “flows” or “micro-flows” as required by claim 25. Instead, they handle packets individually, on a packet-by-packet basis. Indeed, processing each packet individually is important to the functioning of these products and Cloudflare’s DDoS and security services as a whole. Eric also helped to tell our invention story to the jury. He explained how the Cloudflare team saw problems that needed to be solved, and built unique and innovative new products to solve them. He described the work that went into developing Magic Transit and Argo for Packets, and how these products are part of Cloudflare’s modern software-based approach, which is fundamentally different from the hardware-based technology of the ’919 patent. Together, Eric and Dr. Min explained how the benefits of Magic Transit and Argo for Packets enjoyed by Cloudflare’s customers are not attributable to any technology claimed by the ’919 patent. From slide deck presented by Cloudflare to the jury during the trial Second, we explained that Cloudflare doesn’t infringe because claim 25 of the ’919 patent requires certain processes to occur “at” ingress and egress line cards, and Cloudflare’s accused servers do not include line cards. From slide deck presented by Cloudflare to the jury during the trial As Dr. Min explained, “line cards” are a specific type of hardware — a physical hardware “card” — that are commonly used in routers. Sable’s witnesses could not deny that the technology of the ’919 patent was tied to old router technology. After all, Caspian Networks Inc. (where the ’919 patent inventors worked) was a router company. Caspian’s core products were routers, and we showed the jury documents describing Caspian’s routers, which used “flow-based” technology on physical hardware line cards. Trial exhibit, image of sample line card While Sable’s technical expert tried his hardest to convince the jury that various software and hardware components of Cloudflare’s servers constitute “line cards,” his explanations defied credibility. The simple fact is that Cloudflare’s servers do not have line cards. Ultimately, the jury understood, returning a verdict that Cloudflare does not infringe claim 25 of the ‘919 patent. Excerpt from Verdict Form completed by the jury The jury agrees: Sable’s patent claim is invalid In addition to proving that we do not infringe, we also took on the challenge of proving to the jury that claim 25 of the ’919 patent is invalid and never should have been issued. Proving invalidity to a jury is hard. The burden on the defendant is high: Cloudflare needed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that claim 25 is invalid. And, proving it by describing how the claim is obvious in light of the prior art is complicated. To do this, we again relied on our technical expert, Dr. Min, to explain how two prior art references, U.S. Patent No. 6,584,071 (Kodialam) and U.S. Patent No. 6,680,933 (Cheeseman) together render claim 25 of the ’919 patent obvious. Kodialam and Cheeseman are patents from Nortel Networks and Lucent relating to router technology developed in the late 1990s. Both are prior art to the ’919 patent (i.e., they pre-date the priority date of the ’919 patent), and when considered together by a person skilled in the area of computer engineering and computer networking technology, they rendered obvious the so-called invention of claim 25. Excerpt from Verdict Form completed by the jury Sable does not get its payday … Sable’s real motivation for suing Cloudflare — its desire for a payout — was made clear by Sable’s trial witnesses, who were unified only by their desire to present a wildly inflated view of the alleged “value” of the Sable patent and the damages allegedly owed by Cloudflare. Sable’s attorneys tried their best to present their clients as reasonable businessmen, just trying to get what they’re owed for Cloudflare’s purported use of Sable’s patent. But Sable couldn’t hide its true colors from the jury. When Sable presented testimony from Brooks Borchers, the founder of Sable IP, Mr. Borchers was forced to admit that Sable IP is in the “business” of filing lawsuits. Excerpt from Borchers trial testimony In fact, Mr. Borchers was forced to admit that Sable’s approach is to sue first and ask questions later. Even among patent trolls, this is hardly a noble business practice. Excerpts from Borchers trial testimony What's more, Mr. Borchers and his lawyers have teamed up on cases like this before, following the same sue-first-and-ask-questions-later playbook in hopes of a payout. Sable’s true motivations for suing Cloudflare were on full display after this testimony, making Sable’s damages demand all the more galling. Sable’s damages expert, Stephen Dell, told the jury that Sable was owed somewhere between $25 million and $94.2 million in damages. But, Mr. Dell was forced to admit to multiple flaws in his damages calculation, and Cloudflare’s damages expert Chris Bakewell explained to the jury how bad inputs and faulty assumptions led Mr. Dell to a wildly inflated damages figure. Indeed, after hearing Sable’s expert’s testimony, Judge Albright said he was “very skeptical” of Mr. Dell’s opinions, explaining that he was “very concerned that there’s not support for his methodology.” In the end, Mr. Dell’s outsized damages demand didn’t matter because the jury found that Cloudflare did not infringe and that the asserted patent claim is invalid. But, it was revealing of Sable’s motivation (greed) and the lengths that it would go to try to get a payout. When all was said and done, after all the testimony and argument, we were thrilled when the jury returned its verdict — after less than two hours of deliberations — finding across the board for Cloudflare. The jury’s verdict is truly a validation of our strong belief in the importance of standing up to patent trolls like Sable, and we are grateful for the jury’s time, attention and consideration! Sable admits defeat, and agrees to pay Cloudflare! A jury verdict is not the end of the road in a patent case ... there are post-trial motions, appeals, and other procedural hurdles to jump through before a case is truly over. Tired from the fight, and smarting from its loss, Sable decided it wanted to throw in the towel and end the fight once and for all. In the end, Sable agreed to pay Cloudflare $225,000, grant Cloudflare a royalty-free license to its entire patent portfolio, and to dedicate its patents to the public, ensuring that Sable can never again assert them against another company. Let’s repeat that first part, just to make sure everyone understands: Sable, the patent troll that sued Cloudflare back in March 2021 asserting around 100 claims across four patents, in the end wound up paying Cloudflare. While this $225,000 can’t fully compensate us for the time, energy and frustration of having to deal with this litigation for nearly three years, it does help to even the score a bit. And we hope that it sends an important message to patent trolls everywhere to beware before taking on Cloudflare. Excerpt from the Dedication to the Public and Royalty Free License Agreement between Sable and Cloudflare And, let’s talk a bit more about that final part: Sable has agreed to dedicate its entire patent portfolio to the public. This means that Sable will tell the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office that it gives up all of its legal rights to its patent portfolio. Sable can never again use these patents to sue for infringement; they can never again use these patents to try to make a quick buck. Excerpt from the Dedication to the Public and Royalty Free License Agreement between Sable and Cloudflare To sum it up … Cloudflare fought back against the patent troll and we won. We not only defeated Sable's claims in court, we forced Sable to pay Cloudflare for the trouble, and we got Sable's patents dedicated to the public, ensuring that it can never assert these patents against any other company ever again. It was admittedly a lot of work for Cloudflare, but totally worth it. Project Jengo for Sable: Conclusion of the Case A crucial part of our efforts to secure this across-the-board win are our Project Jengo participants. Since the launch of the Project Jengo for the Sable case, we’ve received hundreds of prior art references from dedicated Project Jengo participants. So far we have awarded $70,000 in prizes to the winners of Chapters 1 through 8. And we still have $30,000 in prizes to award in the Final Awards. This blog post marks the official “Conclusion of the Case” under the Project Jengo Sable Rules. We will continue to accept submissions during the 30-day Grace Period, which lasts until November 2, 2024, and then will move on to selecting winners of the Final Awards. We are thrilled to announce the winners of Chapters 7 and 8 We publicly celebrated the Chapter 1, Chapter 2, Chapter 3 and Chapters 4-6 winners in previous blog posts. However, as the trial approached in the Sable case, we chose not to make public announcements for the Chapter 7 and 8 winners out of respect for the judicial process. Now that the case is over, we are delighted to give a big public shout out to the winners of Project Jengo Chapters 7 and 8! We selected four total winners in Chapters 7 and 8, each receiving prizes of $5,000, for a grand total of $20,000. Our Chapter 7 winners, George W. and Madhu, each provided helpful and detailed charts containing element-by-element comparisons of the prior art to the relevant Sable patents. George W. is an electrical engineer and lawyer, who is active in the intellectual property community. He learned about Project Jengo in an article posted online, and thought it was a clever idea. The Chapter 8 winners, Jatin and Ketan, also provided thoughtful and detailed submissions. Jatin submitted two pieces of prior art that were particularly good references for Sable’s U.S. Patent No. 7,012,919, which contains the one claim that remained asserted against Cloudflare at trial. We also want to again thank our prior chapter winners and everyone who participated in Project Jengo! We look forward to selecting the Final Awards winners — it will be fun to take a walk down memory lane re-reviewing the fantastic prior art submitted by our prior winners, and we can’t wait to check out the new submissions, too! Please use the “Submit Prior Art” link on this page for your final entries. Once we’ve announced our Final Awards, we will also update the Sable patents prior art listing on our website, to share all the prior art submitted by our Project Jengo participants.

    "commentBody": "Patent troll Sable pays up, dedicates all its patents to the public (cloudflare.com)506 points by jgrahamc 5 hours agohidepastfavorite159 comments btrettel 4 hours agoAs a former patent examiner, I was struck by how low the payout for Project Jengo was. $125,000 for all people submitting prior art? (There were hundreds of submissions, so it's split among many people.) I would like to help out with such things and I think I have the experience to do it well, but even being a GS-7 patent examiner making $75,000 per year is a better deal! That's especially true given that Cloudflare's not only expecting people to find prior art, but to also write the legal arguments about why it reads on Sable's claims. If they're serious about their prior art bounty program, they're going to need to increase the bounties. Actual patent search firms charge a lot more money, and even lowly paid bureaucrats make a lot more. reply eastdakota 1 hour agoparentHaving talked with several of them, most of the people who submit the prior art as part of Project Jengo would do so even if there were no payout. Several winners have actually asked that the payout be donated back to other organizations fighting patent trolls. This isn't intended to be anyone's full time job. It is intended to reward technical people with industry knowledge who may be able to help surface prior art and are as sick of patent trolls as we are. reply btrettel 1 hour agorootparentThanks for your comment. Personally, I value my own time well above my job's hourly rate, so I would expect to be paid more, not less, in the situation you describe. I suspect the same is true for many others as well. > most of the people who submit the prior art as part of Project Jengo would do so even if there were no payout I'd say this is due to selection bias. People who wanted a bigger payout didn't participate. You all's program is basically over now, but I think anyone considering a prior art bounty program in the future should check best practices for bug bounty programs. The two seem similar to me. Paying more will get more and better submissions, and it doesn't seem to be particularly expensive to me. reply lazyasciiart 0 minutes agorootparentI always thought of it as a way to get input from people who can see the patent application and say “hey that’s just the same as X” off the top of their head. mlyle 1 hour agorootparentprevIt was obviously sufficient ;) Paying more doesn't always motivate people more or get more (quality) people to do a thing. Compensation and associated psychology is complicated, because people are complicated. e.g. I am willingly working very hard at a job where I could make 10x or perhaps even 100x elsewhere with equal or less effort. And I often spend my time on things that are completely irrational by your types of economic measures or even \"pay to work.\" reply bsimpson 57 minutes agorootparentI'm remembering the time I spent $40,000 worth of time saving maybe a couple grand on bike parts.

I'll still pick up litter when I'm walking through a rich neighborhood, even though those people have groundskeepers to take care of it for them. No one is doing this with the goal of a profit. reply btrettel 1 hour agorootparentWhy should I do a \"public service\" for a company with a market cap measured in the tens of billions of dollars? They can pay for it. And this is a much bigger ask than picking up litter. reply jstanley 41 minutes agorootparentNobody's trying to tell you that you have to do this. They're trying to help you understand why other people want to do it. Is there a name for the fallacy \"I don't see why people do X\", \"they do it because Y\", \"but I don't care about Y!\" ? reply btrettel 24 minutes agorootparentFair enough. Replace \"I\" with \"someone\" in my previous comment. I can see why people would do these patent searches, but I still think it's a bad idea for those folks do these patent searches for so little. reply ordu 7 minutes agorootparentIt is the same with programmers who writes open source programs just for fun of it. And I remember in 2000x there were people who thought that it is a bad idea. There were even lawsuits filled by programmers who couldn't sell their programs because they were left without customers due to open source solutions. barkingcat 12 minutes agorootparentprevisn't this exactly the point? from the viewpoint you've presented it's a bad idea to volunteer for basically anything. even something like enlisting in a nation's armed forces is a bad idea since the risk is so high vs the monetary reward, and the only way people would become soldiers is to join mercenary armies where there is a price exacted that matches the performance. for many people, they value the intangible more than the money. btilly 3 minutes agorootparentprevWhy should a company that is doing a public service for the rest of us, at their own expense, pay more than it needs to to do that service? If Cloudflare was to behave rationally, it would simply pay the troll to go away. Trolls are very good at making that the logical choice, which is why virtually everyone else just pays up. Cloudflare fights because the act of taking a stand fits with their values. You're clearly not civic minded enough to appreciate why Cloudflare does what it does. And so you don't understand why other people, who share Cloudflare's values, would be motivated to help them accomplish their good deeds. nfriedly 22 minutes agorootparentprev> Why should I do a \"public service\" for a company with a market cap measured in the tens of billions of dollars? They can pay for it. It's right there in the name: public service. Yeah, it benefits cloudflare, but it also benefits nearly everyone else. Some people just want to improve the world, even if they're not fairly compensated for it. Some people see living in a world with one less patent troll as compensation enough. reply btrettel 19 minutes agorootparentThe alternative is that Cloudflare pays a patent search firm to get the same result, albeit at a higher cost to Cloudflare. That would benefit everyone else too as the prior art would be on legal record. Why can't Cloudflare do a \"public service\" by paying a patent search firm like most other companies would? reply stavros 12 minutes agorootparentprevAs someone who didn't participate (because I didn't have any prior art), I'd donate a few hours of my time (a few thousand dollars' value) to fight patent trolls. reply mdhb 1 hour agorootparentprevThat’s cool and all but don’t lowball people. This was the first thing Cloudflare has done in years that I didn’t associate with something shitty until I saw this. Just for once do the right thing rather than what you think you can get away with because overall this is a genuinely something to be celebrated. reply tomhallett 3 hours agoparentprevWhile I don’t disagree with any of your points, it seems like they are using a “platform/UGC/crowd” model to change the economics of the business model. In the same way that TV networks find/vet/pay for the supply of shows and take on the risk per-show, YouTube (at its core) doesn’t do any of that and all of the content creators do those things with the hope it will take off and a share of the ad revenue, while YouTube’s risks are related to the opex cost of the incoming supply/demand. Instead of cloudflare paying per examiner, they give a non-guaranteed slice to a bigger group of people. reply btrettel 3 hours agorootparentGene Quinn (in 2015) estimated that patent search with the attorney's opinion on patentability for software costs around $2500 to $3000 [1]. Obviously the cost is going to be higher now. Compare that alone against the $1000 (\"at least\") per winner that Cloudflare's offering. But Cloudflare isn't asking for an opinion on a particular invention. A patent searcher could come back and say there is no prior art that reads on the invention in that case and still be paid. Instead, Cloudflare's asking for invalidating prior art, which I think sets the bar even higher and should increase the payout to account for the fact that much of the time there won't be invalidating prior art and thus won't be a payout. If the platform is not taking on as much risk, the payouts should be higher. [1] https://ipwatchdog.com/2015/04/04/the-cost-of-obtaining-a-pa... reply oefrha 2 hours agorootparentI doubt the program’s aimed at patent lawyers. They’re probably casting a wide net hoping to reach people who happen to be close to invalidating prior art to begin with, skipping the search. Or maybe people who’s sued by the same patent troll, in which case the program serves to pool findings. If I can write up something I already know in less than an hour and possibly win $1k, why not. reply AlbertCory 10 minutes agorootparentprevAt Google we did a comparison of many, many \"patent search\" firms: giving them all the same task. Unfortunately I couldn't tell you the results even if I remembered them (which I don't). Most were garbage but a couple were spot-on. It's more than $3,000; I can tell you that. Secondly, it's detective work; you might get the answer right away, and you might spend days searching fruitlessly. Making a claim chart is what take the time: you have to hit every single element. reply jimmydddd 3 hours agorootparentprevBut is there any potential disproportionate upside for any of the group of people who are searching? The sued company avoids paying $100 million in damages, and my upside as a searcher is $1000? Correct? Like, I don't have a potential super high upside like a YouTube content creator. reply charlieyu1 32 minutes agorootparentFOSS has almost unlimited upside and is based on contributors who are barely paid anything. reply toomuchtodo 3 hours agorootparentprevStrangely, this sounds like a great use case for LLMs? To just grind through entire datasets attempting to surface prior art. Edit: Found this with a search, so it can be done: https://xlscout.ai/novelty-checker-llm/ (also, thanks Cloudflare! Keep on grinding patent trolls!) reply btrettel 3 hours agorootparentAfter I quit the USPTO, I tried using ChatGPT 3.5 for some basic patent examining activity out of curiosity, and I can say that it did an absolutely horrendous job. This wasn't prior art search, just analyzing the text to do a rejection based on the text alone (35 USC 112). And the AI search technologies I used tended to not be particularly good. They typically find \"background\" documents that are related but can't be used in a rejection. I don't anticipate LLMs being able to examine patents in general well. Many times a detailed understanding of things not in the text is necessary to examine. For the technologies I examined, often search was basically flipping through drawings. I'd love to see an AI search technology focus specifically on patent drawings. This can be quite difficult. Often I'd have to understand the topology of a circuit (electrical or flow) and find a specific combination of elements. Of course, each drawing could be laid out differently but be topologically equivalent... this surely can be handled with computers in some way, but it's going to require a big effort right now. reply lostdog 1 hour agorootparentThe patent office is also horrendous at evaluating novelty, so I suppose ChatGPT has already reached human level performance on this task! reply jeremyjh 1 hour agorootparentSimilar to the way in which software developers are terrible at delivering quality software on-time and on-budget, so I suppose ChatGPT has already reached human level performance on this task! reply B1FF_PSUVM 48 minutes agorootparentChatGPT is a mirror where we don't look too good ... reply jeremyjh 36 minutes agorootparentMy point was more that just because humans are terrible at something doesn't mean ChatGPT can't be much worse. reply dsr_ 3 hours agorootparentprevThen you need to go over each item with just as much care as you would any probably-irrelevant item pulled from a keyword search, because the LLM is incapable of evaluating it in any way other than correlation. Also, you don't necessarily have a real dataset to begin with: prior art doesn't need to be patented, it just needs to be published/public/invented sufficiently before the patent. Searching the existing patent database is insufficient. reply toomuchtodo 1 hour agorootparent> Also, you don't necessarily have a real dataset to begin with: prior art doesn't need to be patented, it just needs to be published/public/invented sufficiently before the patent.

Patent trolls impose costs on everyone, not just Cloudflare. Making life difficult, expensive and unprofitable for patent trolls benefits everyone, not just Cloudflare. I expect that many of these people didn't see themselves as helping Cloudflare, but the community of everyone who might be targeted by patent trolls. reply pg_bot 1 hour agoparentprevIt seems like it worked out quite well for Cloudflare. You typically only increase bounties if you aren't seeing the results you want. reply javajosh 3 hours agoparentprevCloudflare is shrewdly calculating that there is a lot of latent, unexpressed hate toward patent trolls but that most people don't want to make a career out of it, but might very well make a little hobby out of it, and so they get to take advantage of people who are motivated by something other than money. More deeply, the very idea of a \"patent examiner\" has never made sense to me. It requires being expert in all things, which is impossible. It makes more sense to take someone who is an expert in a field, and put a \"patent examiner\" hat on them for a little while. Ideally the patent system is not so complex that it itself requires as much or more study to be expert in than the actual subjects of the patents -- this would be a very bad sign. reply saratogacx 3 hours agorootparentPatent Examiners do specialize in their fields. It isn't something that is just a common pool subject to any patent that comes into the pipe. From the USPTO[1] What kind of degree do I need to apply, and which vacancy do I need to apply to? The minimum degree required to be a utility patent examiner is a bachelor’s degree. There are dozens of STEM-related bachelor’s degree types that qualify, even if they are not the exact discipline listed in the title of the job vacancy. For example, professionals with bachelor’s degrees ranging from engineering, mathematics, astronomy, space science, geophysics, oceanography, or hydrology could all apply to the \"Patent Examiner (Physics)\" vacancy when it is open.

If your issued patents are found invalid, your bond (which would be in the millions) is raided to pay back damages. reply btrettel 3 hours agorootparentprev> Cloudflare is shrewdly calculating that there is a lot of latent, unexpressed hate toward patent trolls but that most people don't want to make a career out of it, but might very well make a little hobby out of it, and so they get to take advantage of people who are motivated by something other than money. I don't think this is a good strategy. These folks tend to have a poor understanding of patent law in my experience, and you need to understand the basics to do this right. (You fortunately don't need to know too much law to handle 90% of cases.) And these folks probably aren't very effective at patent searching even if they understand the legal parts. I think most people overestimate their own search abilities. I certainly did. Examining patents didn't level me up as much as humble me in that regard. > More deeply, the very idea of a \"patent examiner\" has never made sense to me. It require being expert in all things, which is impossible. [...] As saratogacx pointed out, at the USPTO, the vast majority of examiners have a specific technology they are assigned to. While the matching of examiners to their \"art unit\" is often pretty bad (I could go on a rant...), the situation is not as bad as you described. There are some generalist examiners, but as I understand it, they are in (basically) QA roles and don't need to know the technologies as much. Unfortunately, USPTO upper management seems to want to make examiners into generalists, which I doubt will work out as they want. I agree that periodic rotations of industry folks into patent examiner positions is a great idea. It would help the patent system and give the industry folks some appreciation for what examiners do. If you're worried about lack of expertise, you should be more worried about the courts.

That's basically the situation the USPTO is in. Examiners are on a quota system and they don't get enough time to do a good quality job. With that being said, the majority of the time, the examiner made the right decision. You should check whether a patent was actually granted, for instance. Often when people are complaining about a dumb patent they're actually complaining about a dumb patent application that the USPTO rightly rejected. You should be complaining about the people writing such applications, not the USPTO. Further, the USPTO is funded purely by fees, not taxes. Applicants want patents. That creates a perverse incentive to reduce patent quality to make it easier to get patents.

While there are minor technical differences in exactly how rANS has been encoded/decoded before, and how Microsoft does it, the fact that Microsoft was granted this means they now have a weapon with which they can cause fear, uncertainty and doubt around ANS, much to the chagrin of the ANS's actual inventor, Jarek Duda, who wanted it to be public domain and implementable by anyone. I'm not an expert but Duda and fellow compression experts looked at the claims themselves: https://encode.su/threads/2648-Published-rANS-patent-by-Stor... It seems to me like Microsoft got a patent on \"doing ANS a little bit different\" - they didn't have to, they could just do it the normal way, but this little bit of difference lets them secure a patent, and now they can pursue anyone who implements ANS to intimidate them with \"how sure are you don't do ANS like we do? Let's get our multi-billion legal team, and your legal team, and find out. You have a legal team, don't you?\" In particular, this patent already had a final rejection in 2020. But Microsoft then took advantage of the \"After Final Consideration Pilot\" program, which sounds more like the USPTO trying to drum up trade, to get it re-re-re-examined. lostdog 1 hour agorootparentprevThe parent clearly said that approved parents were bullshit, and I agree. I have several patents, and have seen how nonsense the process is. When lawyers obfuscate the text enough to confuse the patent examiner, the patent gets approved. I can't tell if an individual patent examiner is competent or knowledgeable, but patent decisions have nothing to do with factuality or novelty. I do remember your comments from past threads too. It really interesting to hear the perspective from the patent office's side, but the idea that the patent office had some secret and specialized method of evaluating novelty is ridiculous. Any expert can read a sample of granted patents and tell you that. I'd estimate maybe 5% of patents in my field have any novelty, and that's being generous. I'm sure this has more to do with incentives and the overall system, and that individual patent examiners would prefer to do a good job.

No, I don't. You've seen a small selection of what the USPTO outputs. Only the bad cases appear in the news.

I think the quality of examination and search is excellent given how little time examiners have. But mistakes still happen too frequently, and the mistakes can be highly costly. Better to stop problems upstream in my opinion by giving examiners more time. Patent quality is related but different. I agree that patent quality is awful, but there's only so much an examiner can do to influence that. Attorneys have basically gamed the system to write vague legalese that's patentable but basically useless. And to paraphase a supervisor I knew at the USPTO, \"Just because it's stupid doesn't mean that it's not patentable\". I can't reject them if it meets the legal standards but is stupid.

The issue is widespread bad behavior from patent trolls, given that the cost of mass filing patent infringement claims that barely apply is so much lower than the expected settlement, and the cost of a successful defense is likely higher than the request settlement. The incentive is to get a portfolio of overly broad patents and then shake down almost entirely unrelated companies. reply petesergeant 2 hours agorootparentFor sure, the whole thing sucks reply cptskippy 2 hours agorootparentprev> That patent was an asset. That line of thinking is the problem. A patent is intended as a protection to spur development, not an asset to be traded. The spirit of a patent is to protect a novel solution while a company develops and monetizes their innovation. It keeps bigger fish with deeper pockets from quickly copying your invention and monetizing it before you. What's happened however is that Large companies with deep pockets are filing patents for anything and everything they can. These patents generally come from their R&D efforts but are not necessarily linked to any product specifically. They're also usually unenforceable junk that wouldn't hold up in court. The value of these junk patents isn't in the viability to be developed into a product, rather their value is that it will take time and money to invalidate them in court. When these companies are hit with a lawsuit for violating someone else's patent, their defense is to counter sue with as many junk patents as possible. The purpose of the counter suit is to make a settlement preferable to the protracted legal fight necessary to invalidate all of the junk patents. It's the path of least expense. You could argue this allows large companies to steal innovations from smaller players by forcing cross licensing agreements. Often these patent portfolios are transferred to companies with no interest in developing products or protecting their business. These companies sole purpose are to weaponize the patents, they're Patent Trolls. Using the same strategy as companies with defensive patent portfolios, Patent Trolls seek to extract settlements (extort money) from companies by suing them with all the junk patents they can. The patent trolls are immune to counter suit because they produce nothing. Thus companies must either invalidate each junk patent or settle. Often settling is the path of least expense. reply hadlock 40 minutes agorootparentprev>Are these patent trolls doing anything that normal companies with patents that try to monetize them don't do? The important distinction here, in my opinion, is that investors bought a dead company along with it's IP for the explicit purpose of suing companies as that was their profit motive. Had there been an existing company that was actively building/selling routers, then yes they would have been using the patents as intended - to protect their business. In this case the company who owns the patents, was using them in a weaponized fashion. reply hansvm 3 hours agorootparentprevThe two normal arguments are: 1. Patent trolls don't actually produce anything. They just extract rent from other companies. 2. The patents they choose tend to be extremely bad -- overly broad, should never have been granted, had prior art, the tech never existed, .... They use the fact that they're able to sue cheaply to bully people into settling on bogus claims. Point (1) doesn't seem bad to me. It's kind of like how truck driving is separate from truck insurance. Having specialists capable of monetizing patents allows, in theory, inventors to invent and immediately sell for estimated lifetime patent value, minus a discount associated with the troll's costs and desired profits. Without trolls, in theory, you'd have fewer inventors because they'd also need to be/hire experts in marketing, litigation, .... Point (2) is the one that bothers me the most, and my impression is that it's a very common problem. Oh, and to your question, most companies use patents for mutually assured destruction and as a form of signalling that important people should want to work there, not to directly monetize. Monetizing patents is less common. reply cloverich 1 hour agorootparentThe argument against your argument in (1) is that if the incentive is to patent and sell to someone who will not market the patented invention either, it still isn't promoting the development of the product. It is actually _hindering_ the development of the product, because now whoever does develop the product has to pay an additional tax. Its literally antithetical to the concept of patents (I am _assuming_ they exist to spur R&D development primarily). Another argument against your argument in (1), is to allow the scenario to exist only where the purchaser of the patent can prove they are marketing and selling it. That is still not ideal imho, but at least it eliminates outright patent trolls. HN is I think particularly sensitive because it has a lot of programmers and product development folks, who know that a good idea or even plan on its own isn't very valuable. I'd guess most of us have more good ideas floating around than we'll ever have the time or money to develop on our own.

Substitute \"FDA market authorization after successful clinical trials\" with \"that infamous East Texas court district and picking the right targets\" (picking a too big target might backfire, picking a too small doesn't really worth the costs, etc.) Of course the questions are: does this really help inventors? do inventors need help? is it good for society that inventors get help? is the cost of helping inventors this way not unreasonable to the economy? and even if the cost is \"low\", how fucking fair is it that a lot of businesses are using a given invention but only a lucky few get dragged to court? can we do better? what kind of people patent trolls are? what do they do with the money? reply returningfory2 2 hours agorootparentYeah, I think pharma is the really tricky case.

If it were, there may be some unforseen consequences. For example, during the late 1800s, a number of companies bandied together to pool their patents together for a commercially viable sewing machine. No single company had been able to develop and file patents that resulted in a working sewing machine. As such, they pooled the patents and negotiated a portion of royalties for everyone who contributed. That would probably have been set up as its own legal entity. With a requirement to be an operating company, such a legal vehicle would not have worked. You could argue that such an entity is considered “productive”, but then you would have to define what that means and write it into the law. Any lawsuit involving patents would require demonstrating that. Another example is trademarks. In order to have a registered trademark, you must show that it is in active use, and it is distinct. That means that in order to keep a registered trademark, you must sue anyone who is infringing upon it. There is an indie author who came up on a litrpg genre concept combining it with a post-apocalypse setting. His book exploded upon the niche, progressive fantasy scene. People loved the idea and other authors wrote books for it. The original author tried to brand it and protect it with a registered trademark. Because the term had rapidly genericized, that author started sending cease & desist letters to other authors, because he was required to in order to keep the registered trademark. I don’t know if he knew he had do that when he registered it, but doing so drained the goodwill he had in the community. Progressive fantasy is a small indie community, and the authors who can, gather at Dragoncon to talk, exchange ideas. This is similar to sending cease and desist to your neighbors. You will quickly find yourself locked out of the community. I am thinking of the inventor of the bear suit. Making something to protect yourself from a grizzly bear seems like it has low value for society. It is also this off the wall perspective that allowed him to invent a gel that can absorb heat (probably a non-Newtonian fluid). If we’re trying to protect the livelihood of an indie inventor like that, would a requirement to demonstrate productivity help the Bear Suit inventor? Or would it have a chilling effect? reply teucris 3 hours agoparentprevIt’s an unfortunate byproduct of allowing patents to be bought and sold. Let’s say you had a patent: you worked hard on your invention and you deserve to reap the financial benefits of it. But you do not have the legal resources to protect your right as the inventor. It feels fair and reasonable to me that you can sell your patent to a third party to license and protect as they see fit, so you can reap some financial reward. Now, how do you make sure that these companies buying patents don’t become trolls? I don’t think it’s fair to require them to use the patent, because that limits who the inventor can sell to.

There could possibly be a few unpublished patent applications from before 1995 that are still in the examination process; but case law from 2005 [1][2] makes it difficult to enforce patents if there has been 'unreasonable and unjustified' delay in the claims, and I'd suspect it would be hard to justify a delay of 30 years.

And maybe they shouldn't be assignable to corporate entities, only to people. Multiple people at once if they all contributed to the invention. reply jessriedel 1 hour agorootparentThis would massively disenfranchise small inventors, and force all inventive work into large companies. There is no reason that the person who does the inventing should also be the person developing and selling a product. It is weird and unfortunate that the longstanding deficiencies with patent law (chiefly: issuing patents for things that are too obvious or numerous) are being blamed on transferability of property rights. It’s the same broken intuition as over regulating housing construction and then blaming high housing costs on ownership by Chinese nationals. reply _nalply 2 hours agoparentprevIn a perfect world this is arbitrage. Arbitrage helps making markets more efficient. However we don't live in a perfect world. Judgment is too expensive and risky.

I would be highly interested to see the breakdown of what it cost in manhours, fees, prizes to Project Jengo, etc. versus the payout from Sable to fight this particular case for Cloudflare, and whether they even came close to breaking even just on this case alone.

Also makes me wonder if this is in the playbook the next time a patent troll comes sniffing around. Somewhat related: In MA, to fight NIMBY-ism, we passed a law that people suing new housing developments can be forced to put up a deposit, without requiring proof that the case has merit. I wonder if a similar law could help with patent trolls: IE, making it easier that the plantiff put up a deposit when suing for violating their patent. reply AlbertCory 4 hours agoprevCloudflare's redeemed themselves, bigtime. A lot of patent trolls have no assets, and don't own anything except the patents they're currently milking. Then they go out of business, and there's nothing to sue.

Not much different from Cloudfare paying salaries to the inventors to become the patent holders and then enforcing it against third-parties.

If companies like Cloudfare did want all tech patents to be gone, they would be gone and no patent troll would be able to do anything about.

Seems like you'd be able to back up this claim since it's a core component of your argument. Also, your reasoning seems to leave out a world of possibilities for why someone would hold a patent - its worth looking up the thinking around defensive patent portfolios. These exist for a few reasons.... patents might be strategically filed to: * have prior art on the record to keep a market open... e.g. preventing a competitor from monopolizing a space. * have patents available for counter-suit against competitors suing over patent violation of some bit of tech that uses both. * impress investors * provide recognition to employees. At least in the US patents are filed by individuals, and the rights of the patent are then assigned to the company. Granted patents usually come with bonuses, as well as a nice resume padding that helps the engineers involved get higher salaries in the future. reply sophacles 1 hour agoparentprev> Doesn't clouldfare have patents of their own? Looks like it. Not all patents are the same - sometimes a patent is erroneously granted for something that is not a novel invention. The judge and jury ruled that the patents involved in this case were in that category... and therefore invalid patents. There is no hypocrisy in holding patents (presumably ones you believe are valid) while pointing out that some other patents are invalid. I don't understand how this could equate to hypocrisy in any scenario short of the patent holder declaring all patents except theirs must be invalid on the principle that all patents are bad. > Don't they enforce them? Feel free to prove me wrong, but I've never seen anything about Cloudflare going after people for patent violations. I believe they subscribe to the modern tech patent strategy of having a big patent portfolio that only really gets used as part of a counter-suit if someone sues them for patent infringement. Additionally, I presume Cloudflare's patents are related to the tech they develop and sell, which is categorically and qualitatively different than a law firm that does literally nothing of value buying up old patents and suing everyone who has ever used a word that also is present in the patent. Given that the usage, purpose, and means of obtaining a patent are different between cloudflare and the troll - I don't understand how a hypocrisy claim can be leveled here... it defies all reason and logic to do so. reply dangoodmanUT 2 hours agoprevpatent trolls have a special place in hell, next to the boiler room reply dpratt 4 hours agoprevWell, it's nice to know that Sable's entire portfolio is going into the public domain, it's a shame that the likely 50-100 other shell companies owned by this troll still have an arsenal of useless, but incredibly complicated, patents to use to extort money.

The problem is that unless the USPTO can find the requisite publications to prove the \"obvious\" part above from the statute, that then knocking down the resulting issued patent in a court case can be a very expensive effort. > On the other, you can patent \"Page down button on the keyboard moves the screen down one full page (A4) instead of one screen size\" Applicant's get patents because the USPTO can't find the publications necessary to prove they do not deserve to get the patent (there's also lack of time problems that I'm ignoring at the moment). For your premise, often the reason why \"Page Down moves by 'printed page'\" might get patented is the lack of any findable publication of anything stating such. The USPTO examiner's don't have the ability to just say \"but this is the way it works....\", they have to find some publication, somewhere, that said \"this is the way it works...\".

To the incumbent, the settlement is a fee paid for moat-as-a-service provided by the troll. reply singlow 1 hour agorootparentprevI couldn't tell from the article but it seems the $225k was a settlement, and the release of all patents was additionally part of the settlement - I doubt the court could have awarded that directly.

    "title": "Terminal colours are tricky",
    "originLink": "https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/10/01/terminal-colours/",
    "originBody": "Terminal colours are tricky Yesterday I was thinking about how long it took me to get a colorscheme in my terminal that I was mostly happy with (SO MANY YEARS), and it made me wonder what about terminal colours made it so hard. So I asked people on Mastodon what problems they’ve run into with colours in the terminal, and I got a ton of interesting responses! Let’s talk about some of the problems and a few possible ways to fix them. problem 1: blue on black One of the top complaints was “blue on black is hard to read”. Here’s an example of that: if I open Terminal.app, set the background to black, and run ls, the directories are displayed in a blue that isn’t that easy to read: To understand why we’re seeing this blue, let’s talk about ANSI colours! the 16 ANSI colours Your terminal has 16 numbered colours – black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white, and “bright” version of each of those. Programs can use them by printing out an “ANSI escape code” – for example if you want to see each of the 16 colours in your terminal, you can run this Python program: def color(num, text): return f\"\\033[38;5;{num}m{text}\\033[0m\" for i in range(16): print(color(i, f\"number {i:02}\")) what are the ANSI colours? This made me wonder – if blue is colour number 5, who decides what hex color that should correspond to? The answer seems to be “there’s no standard, terminal emulators just choose colours and it’s not very consistent”. Here’s a screenshot of a table from Wikipedia, where you can see that there’s a lot of variation: problem 1.5: bright yellow on white Bright yellow on white is even worse than blue on black, here’s what I get in a terminal with the default settings: That’s almost impossible to read (and some other colours like light green cause similar issues), so let’s talk about solutions! two ways to reconfigure your colours If you’re annoyed by these colour contrast issues (or maybe you just think the default ANSI colours are ugly), you might think – well, I’ll just choose a different “blue” and pick something I like better! There are two ways you can do this: Way 1: Configure your terminal emulator: I think most modern terminal emulators have a way to reconfigure the colours, and some of them even come with some preinstalled themes that you might like better than the defaults. Way 2: Run a shell script: There are ANSI escape codes that you can print out to tell your terminal emulator to reconfigure its colours. Here’s a shell script that does that, from the base16-shell project. You can see that it has a few different conventions for changing the colours – I guess different terminal emulators have different escape codes for changing their colour palette, and so the script is trying to pick the right style of escape code based on the TERM environment variable. what are the pros and cons of the 2 ways of configuring your colours? I prefer to use the “shell script” method, because: if I switch terminal emulators for some reason, I don’t need to a different configuration system, my colours still Just Work I use base16-shell with base16-vim to make my vim colours match my terminal colours, which is convenient The main advantage I can think of for configuring colours in your terminal emulator is that, if you use a popular terminal emulator, there are probably a lot of nice terminal themes out there that you can choose from. I think there are some more advantages I’m not thinking of though. This is what my shell has looked like for probably the last 5 years (using the solarized light base16 theme), and I’m pretty happy with it. Here’s htop: Okay, so let’s say you’ve found a terminal colorscheme that you like. What else can go wrong? problem 2: programs using 256 colours Here’s what some output of fd, a find alternative, looks like in my colorscheme: The contrast is pretty bad here, and I definitely don’t have that lime green in my normal colorscheme. What’s going on? We can see what color codes fd is using using the unbuffer program to capture its output including the color codes: $ unbuffer fd . > out $ vim out \u001b[38;5;48mbad-again.sh\u001b[0m \u001b[38;5;48mbad.sh\u001b[0m \u001b[38;5;48mbetter.sh\u001b[0m out \u001b[38;5;48 means “set the foreground color to color 48”. Terminals don’t only have 16 colours – many terminals these days actually have 3 ways of specifying colours: the 16 ANSI colours we already talked about an extended set of 256 colours a further extended set of 24-bit hex colours, like #ffea03 So fd is using one of the colours from the extended 256-color set. bat (a cat alternative) does something similar – here’s what it looks like by default in my terminal. This looks fine though and it really seems like it’s trying to work well with a variety of terminal themes. some newer tools seem to have theme support I think it’s interesting that some of these newer terminal tools (fd, cat, delta, and probably more) have support for arbitrary custom themes. I guess the downside of this approach is that the default theme might clash with your terminal’s background, but the upside is that it gives you a lot more control over theming the tool’s output than just choosing 16 ANSI colours. I don’t really use bat, but if I did I’d probably use bat --theme ansi to just use the ANSI colours that I have set in my normal terminal colorscheme. problem 3: the grays in Solarized A bunch of people on Mastodon mentioned a specific issue with grays in the Solarized theme: when I list a directory, the base16 Solarized Light theme looks like this: but iTerm’s default Solarized Light theme looks like this: This is because in the iTerm theme (which is the original Solarized design), colors 9-14 (the “bright blue”, “bright red”, etc) are mapped to a series of grays, and when I run ls, it’s trying to use those “bright” colours to color my directories and executables. My best guess for why the original Solarized theme is designed this way is to make the grays available to the vim Solarized colorscheme. I’m pretty sure I prefer the modified base16 version I use where the “bright” colours are actually colours instead of all being shades of gray though. (I didn’t actually realize the version I was using wasn’t the “original” Solarized theme until I wrote this post) In any case I really love Solarized and I’m very happy it exists so that I can use a modified version of it. problem 4: a vim theme that doesn’t match the terminal background If I my vim theme has a different background colour than my terminal theme, I get this ugly border, like this: This one is a pretty minor issue though and I think making your terminal background match your vim background is pretty straightforward. problem 5: programs setting a background color A few people mentioned problems with terminal applications setting an unwanted background colour, so let’s look at an example of that. Here ngrok has set the background to color #16 (“black”), but the base16-shell script I use sets color 16 to be bright orange, so I get this, which is pretty bad: I think the intention is for ngrok to look something like this: I think base16-shell sets color #16 to orange (instead of black) so that it can provide extra colours for use by base16-vim. This feels reasonable to me – I use base16-vim in the terminal, so I guess I’m using that feature and it’s probably more important to me than ngrok (which I rarely use) behaving a bit weirdly. This particular issue is a maybe obscure clash between ngrok and my colorschem, but I think this kind of clash is pretty common when a program sets an ANSI background color that the user has remapped for some reason. a nice solution to contrast issues: “minimum contrast” A bunch of terminals (iTerm2, tabby, kitty’s text_fg_override_threshold, and folks tell me also Ghostty and Windows Terminal) have a “minimum contrast” feature that will automatically adjust colours to make sure they have enough contrast. Here’s an example from iTerm. This ngrok accident from before has pretty bad contrast, I find it pretty difficult to read: With “minimum contrast” set to 40 in iTerm, it looks like this instead: I didn’t have minimum contrast turned on before but I just turned it on today because it makes such a big difference when something goes wrong with colours in the terminal. problem 6: TERM being set to the wrong thing A few people mentioned that they’ll SSH into a system that doesn’t support the TERM environment variable that they have set locally, and then the colours won’t work. I think the way TERM works is that systems have a terminfo database, so if the value of the TERM environment variable isn’t in the system’s terminfo database, then it won’t know how to output colours for that terminal. I don’t know too much about terminfo, but someone linked me to this terminfo rant that talks about a few other issues with terminfo. I don’t have a system on hand to reproduce this one so I can’t say for sure how to fix it, but this stackoverflow question suggests running something like TERM=xterm ssh instead of ssh. problem 7: picking “good” colours is hard A couple of problems people mentioned with designing / finding terminal colorschemes: some folks are colorblind and have trouble finding an appropriate colorscheme accidentally making the background color too close to the cursor or selection color, so they’re hard to find generally finding colours that work with every program is a struggle (for example you can see me having a problem with this with ngrok above!) problem 8: making nethack/mc look right Another problem people mentioned is using a program like nethack or midnight commander which you might expect to have a specific colourscheme based on the default ANSI terminal colours. For example, midnight commander has a really specific classic look: But in my Solarized theme, midnight commander looks like this: The Solarized version feels like it could be disorienting if you’re very used to the “classic” look. One solution Simon Tatham mentioned to this is using some palette customization ANSI codes (like the ones base16 uses that I talked about earlier) to change the color palette right before starting the program, for example remapping yellow to a brighter yellow before starting Nethack so that the yellow characters look better. problem 9: commands disabling colours when writing to a pipe If I run fdless, I see something like this, with the colours disabled. In general I find this useful – if I pipe a command to grep, I don’t want it to print out all those color escape codes, I just want the plain text. But what if you want to see the colours? To see the colours, you can run unbuffer fdless -r! I just learned about unbuffer recently and I think it’s really cool, unbuffer opens a tty for the command to write to so that it thinks it’s writing to a TTY. It also fixes issues with programs buffering their output when writing to a pipe, which is why it’s called unbuffer. Here’s what the output of unbuffer fdless -r looks like for me: problem 10: unwanted colour in ls and other commands Some people mentioned that they don’t want ls to use colour at all, perhaps because ls uses blue, it’s hard to read on black, and maybe they don’t feel like customizing their terminal’s colourscheme to make the blue more readable or just don’t find the use of colour helpful. Some possible solutions to this one: you can run ls --color=never, which is probably easiest you can also set LS_COLORS to customize the colours used by ls. I think some other programs other than ls support the LS_COLORS environment variable too. also some programs support setting NO_COLOR=true (there’s a list here) Here’s an example of running LS_COLORS=\"fi=0:di=0:ln=0:pi=0:so=0:bd=0:cd=0:or=0:ex=0\" ls: problem 11: the colours in vim I used to have a lot of problems with configuring my colours in vim – I’d set up my terminal colours in a way that I thought was okay, and then I’d start vim and it would just be a disaster. I think what was going on here is that today, there are two ways to set up a vim colorscheme in the terminal: using your ANSI terminal colours – you tell vim which ANSI colour number to use for the background, for functions, etc. using 24-bit hex colours – instead of ANSI terminal colours, the vim colorscheme can use hex codes like #faea99 directly 20 years ago when I started using vim, terminals with 24-bit hex color support were a lot less common (or maybe they didn’t exist at all), and vim certainly didn’t have support for using 24-bit colour in the terminal. From some quick searching through git, it looks like vim added support for 24-bit colour in 2016 – just 8 years ago! So to get colours to work properly in vim before 2016, you needed to synchronize your terminal colorscheme and your vim colorscheme. Here’s what that looked like, the colorscheme needed to map the vim color classes like cterm05 to ANSI colour numbers. But in 2024, the story is really different! Vim (and Neovim, which I use now) support 24-bit colours, and as of Neovim 0.10 (released in May 2024), the termguicolors setting (which tells Vim to use 24-bit hex colours for colorschemes) is turned on by default in any terminal with 24-bit color support. So this “you need to synchronize your terminal colorscheme and your vim colorscheme” problem is not an issue anymore for me in 2024, since I don’t plan to use terminals without 24-bit color support in the future. The biggest consequence for me of this whole thing is that I don’t need base16 to set colors 16-21 to weird stuff anymore to integrate with vim – I can just use a terminal theme and a vim theme, and as long as the two themes use similar colours (so it’s not jarring for me to switch between them) there’s no problem. I think I can just remove those parts from my base16 shell script and totally avoid the problem with ngrok and the weird orange background I talked about above. some more problems I left out I think there are a lot of issues around the intersection of multiple programs, like using some combination tmux/ssh/vim that I couldn’t figure out how to reproduce well enough to talk about them. Also I’m sure I missed a lot of other things too. base16 has really worked for me I’ve personally had a lot of success with using base16-shell with base16-vim – I just need to add a couple of lines to my fish config to set it up (+ a few .vimrc lines) and then I can move on and accept any remaining problems that that doesn’t solve. I don’t think base16 is for everyone though, some limitations I’m aware of with base16 that might make it not work for you: it comes with a limited set of builtin themes and you might not like any of them the Solarized base16 theme (and maybe all of the themes?) sets the “bright” ANSI colours to be exactly the same as the normal colours, which might cause a problem if you’re relying on the “bright” colours to be different from the regular ones it sets colours 16-21 in order to give the vim colorschemes from base16-vim access to more colours, which might not be relevant if you always use a terminal with 24-bit color support, and can cause problems like the ngrok issue above also the way it sets colours 16-21 could be a problem in terminals that don’t have 256-color support, like the linux framebuffer terminal Apparently there’s a community fork of base16 called tinted-theming, which I haven’t looked into much yet. some other colorscheme tools Just one so far but I’ll link more if people tell me about them: rootloops.sh for generating colorschemes (and “let’s create a terminal color scheme”) Some popular colorschemes (according to people I asked on Mastodon): catpuccin, Monokai, Gruvbox, Dracula, Modus (a high contrast theme), Tokyo Night, Nord, Rosé Pine okay, that was a lot We talked about a lot in this post and while I think learning about all these details is kind of fun if I’m in the mood to do a deep dive, I find it SO FRUSTRATING to deal with it when I just want my colours to work! Being surprised by unreadable text and having to find a workaround is just not my idea of a good day. Personally I’m a zero-configuration kind of person and it’s not that appealing to me to have to put together a lot of custom configuration just to make my colours in the terminal look acceptable. I’d much rather just have some reasonable defaults that I don’t have to change. minimum contrast seems like an amazing feature My one big takeaway from writing this was to turn on “minimum contrast” in my terminal, I think it’s going to fix most of the occasional accidental unreadable text issues I run into and I’m pretty excited about it.

    "commentBody": "Terminal colours are tricky (jvns.ca)277 points by chmaynard 12 hours agohidepastfavorite115 comments ykonstant 10 hours agoI came across all of these issues and many more trying to make a good light color scheme for my systems. Two interesting findings I did not see discussed: 1. It makes sense in retrospect, but I was very surprised at how much more subtle light themes are compared to dark when viewed on different screens; of course their hardware and software configs lead to variations on the color output, but light dominant changes are perceived so much more drastically than dark ones. This is a serious issue if you will be porting your theme to computers with a variety of screens and configurations. 2. Occasionally, you need to drop to a linux or bsd console with very limited support for fonts and fancy colors. Then your `fd` and `exa/lsd/whatever` may be unusable and annoying, especially if you have mapped the latter to `ls`. I managed, after a long struggle, to get a working fbterm in my system to get decent terminal features without X, but fbterm has its own issues. You need to account for this use-case, especially when configuring vim colorschemes: make sure that you have a fallback theme for a feature-poor console or you have really practiced typing vim commands blind :D Edit: here is a screenshot of my stylized fbterm screen, obviously not for serious work, but meant to demonstrate what you can do without X: https://i.imgur.com/RbDRgtD.png reply sricciardi 8 hours agoparent> I was very surprised at how much more subtle light themes are compared to dark when viewed on different screens. This does not surprise me. I do analog black and white printing (from film) and it's a well known thing that our eye is much better at detecting subtle tonal changes in light areas of a print than darker ones. For this reason, a lot of the time in tweaking the right exposure and contrast for a print is spent to make those hightlights look \"just right\". I don't print digitally, but I am sure the same principles will apply there too. reply klodolph 4 hours agorootparentThis is why, as policy, I don’t judge negatives any more. I always print contact sheets and make my initial judgments there. reply HPsquared 9 hours agoparentprevI had a recent experience trying to show a large number of data series by different colours on a plot in Excel. I found the best option for easily distinguishing a large number of colours was the monochromatic spectral \"rainbow\" colours on a black background (there's also a setting to make the data points have a bit of \"bloom\" aura in the same colour so they look like dots of light). It makes sense from a colour saturation perspective (i.e. signal to noise ratio across the spectrum) that a black background is better. You can pretty much have 10 different colours EDIT: Another benefit is it conveys \"sequence/order/distance\" information: yellow is between red and green; orange is between red and yellow, etc. It's easy to subdivide and interpret how \"close together\" two colours are. reply phkahler 3 hours agorootparentThat sounds reasonable. But sometimes I have a bunch of signals with some of them being pairs, so having a dark and light version of the same color helps to see them together. Does this work with adjacent rainbow colors as well? reply HPsquared 3 hours agorootparentYou can use the same hue with different luminance. reply jve 8 hours agoparentprevAll those nice fonts and pleasant color theme... ruined by a background that makes some characters hard to read :) reply ykonstant 4 hours agorootparentOh, you mean the picture I linked?

The ANSI blue on black for directories in eza is a bit... meh, but it's perfectly readable and the same is true for the default colour scheme for ls on MacOS terminal reply hnlmorg 10 hours agoprevI actually don't think it's that hard: Step 1: Most terminal emulators ship with a garbage default colour scheme. So change that. Personally I'm a fan of Solarized (specifically dark, but I like their light theme too). However even if you don't like Solarized, there are plenty of other themes that are readable with any colour against the default backgrounds. Step 2: Avoid any CLI tool that uses escape sequences for 8bit or 24bit colours by default. This might be an unpopular opinion, but I actually consider that as user hostile. Reason being: I've already chosen a the best terminal colour scheme for my readability requirements (remember, this will differ for different people). Having a developer override that because they fancy themselves as a pseudo-designer is not helpful. By all means, they can have an option to enable themes in their tool if they wish, but that should be opt-in, not the default. As someone who spends most of their life in the terminal, following those two rules is enough to provide a consistent and easy terminal reading environment with almost-zero configuration overhead. I think the real problem is that we indulge developers using 8bit and 24bit colour escape codes. reply bhaak 9 hours agoparent> By all means, they can have an option to enable themes in their tool if they wish, but that should be opt-in, not the default. This touches on the problem of good defaults. If the user has to configure it then the user must know that it is configurable and then do it. This is a serious hurdle and only a tiny fraction of users will do it. Over the years I've come to the conclusion that you must throw your new features into the face and shove good defaults down the throats of users, otherwise these feature are hardly used. 8bit and 24bit colors are already opt-in and you can configure it. Your TERM and COLORTERM environmental variables determine if a (well behaved) terminal program will use those colors. reply hnlmorg 8 hours agorootparent> Over the years I've come to the conclusion that you must throw your new features into the face and shove good defaults down the throats of users, otherwise these feature are hardly used. Agreed to an extent. I wouldn't call ignoring the systems colour preferences as \"good defaults\". But I do agree with your more general point. > 8bit and 24bit colors are already opt-in and you can configure it. Your TERM and COLORTERM environmental variables determine if a (well behaved) terminal program will use those colors. Unfortunately it's not that simple. Both the \"256color\" suffix to $TERM and $COLORTERM env vars report terminal compatibility -- not user preference. Neither are standards either. It's a push to even call them a de facto standard because they're often not used by either terminal emulators nor application developer alike. There is another env var that does report user preferences: $COLORFGBG, but that receives even less support than the former two vars. There's also $NO_COLOR (or is $NOCOLOR?), which seems to be honored a little better. However the problem with this is it turns colour off completely. ie you cannot specify \"use 4bit but not 8bit nor 24bit colour\". Like all things terminal detection wise, it's all a big fat steaming mess of inconsistencies. Which is why I think the best default is 3/4bit or no colour at all if $NO_COLOR / not a TTY. And have all the cool 24bit themes as an optional extra. reply NoGravitas 5 hours agorootparentIt's also the case that a lot of modern CLI tools will absolutely ignore your termcap and your $TERM env var and barf out whatever extension to ANSI is used by the currently most popular terminal emulators. Unless it's a TUI app that I'm going to spend a lot of time in (e.g., Emacs), I do not want it theming itself. I want it to look at my termcap to see if it has ANSI color support, and if it does, then emit ANSI color codes. I use base16-shell to set my terminal colors and I want CLI and TUI apps to respect them. reply phkahler 3 hours agoparentprev>> Step 2: >> Avoid any CLI tool that uses escape sequences for 8bit or 24bit colours by default. I was going to point out that the author never takes a step back and asks \"What would be the best way to handle this?\" The problem there is we have to define what \"best\" is. IMHO that involves a number of principles. My preferences are: 1) Any user customization should be in one place. 2) The impact on programs should be minimal (in LoC for example). Both of those suggest the solution belongs in the terminal. IMHO it starts with terminal programs having sane default colors. What that means is fuzzy, but so is this whole discussion. IMHO colors should follow the \"standard\" so that blue is still recognizably blue. But consideration should be given to the common forms of color blindness - for example I have a hard time reading pure red on black (adding a bit of anything helps this, don't just use ff0000). Once terminals get fixed to have sane defaults, CLI programs should use those 16 standard colors. Any attempt to use 24bit here is either saying \"I give up on getting those terminal folks to offer sanity\" or it's saying something like \"I know best\", but either way users end up with N programs they have to configure. Lets not define themes in cli apps OK? Remember, this is my answer to \"what would be the best way to handle this?\" I have similar thoughts when it comes to web sites and fonts. Present content in HTML so users can configure how they want to see it. Similar for page formatting - it's not a magazine layout, let it flow. Also stuff in desktop software. IMHO Wayland compositors should remember window placement. It was stupid for every X program to store and restore its window position. Wayland says knowing about the environment is a security issue (and I agree) but then it becomes the DEs job to handle this memory. It also unburdens ALL the apps from having code for this. There are other areas where that question comes up \"Where in the software stack should this thing be handled?\" Whatever your opinion, I believe you should start by answering the questions around that word \"should\". What are the goals in selecting where a thing gets handled? My answers always lean toward simplicity and maintainability. What other principles might I adopt to answer these questions? reply kevin_thibedeau 3 hours agorootparent> What would be the best way to handle this? A styling service from systemd. reply arp242 9 hours agoparentprev> themes that are readable with any colour against the default backgrounds. Yes, but then there are applications that set both the text and background colour. For example pamix sets the background to black, or tmux's statusline, or ngrok. And you end up in a rabbit hole trying to deal with that. reply prmoustache 7 hours agorootparentI don't know what pamix is but my rule of thumb is to use only apps that supports themes that are common in most terminals, text/code editor like solarized, gruvbox... reply weinzierl 9 hours agoparentprevAvoid any CLI tool that uses escape sequences for 8bit or 24bit colours by default. How difficult is this in practice? (Julia's article mentions this idea too without going deeper into the struggles) A related topic is: Do terminal color schemes only concern themselves with the 16 base colors or do they also meddle with the RGB and greyscale parts. I mean you could also adapt the 8bit and 16bit colors to your readability requirements. reply hnlmorg 7 hours agorootparentThere is no 16bit. You cannot alter the 24bit (at least not on your average terminal emulator). Same is true for 8bit. Most terminal emulators tend not to support altering those colours either. In practice, the only application I use that I've had to configure the colours for was tmux. But I tend to forget about tmux because its one of those applications that needs a lot of a configuration from the outset anyway (in my opinion at least). There might be other \"must have\" tools that set the background colours too. I've either not needed them personally, or have completely forgotten about them reply fwip 3 hours agoparentprevSolarized Dark, specifically, is not well-suited for terminal use, because the author has assigned \"bright black\" to nearly the same color as the background. Many applications expect that 'bright black' text will be visible against the background. See here for many examples: https://github.com/altercation/solarized/issues/220 Nearly all other colorschemes represent 'bright black' as a gray color, which is readable against the black background. reply sim7c00 9 hours agoparentprevStep2: do agree with the fact someone making a CLI tool should respect user preferences. it's also much easier just not to use the sequences in the tool so I don't get why people would do that in the first place :S. Step 1: I think here maybe the default setting should be solarized-dark/light on terminals. It's honestly a good and sane default. It's purpose built to be less hostile on the eyes in my opinion, which should likely be what's aimed for in a default setting... the themes and colors are there for people who like to stare at their terminal all day (if you only use it once or twice then you don't care about what color it has) so it should be eye-friendly defaults. if people want to muck about changing it to their own custom theme they won't be bothered about defaults anyway since they will immediately customize it. I personally hate the fact I even need to swap a theme, or download and reformat some Xresources file tediously (while looking at godawful colors in the process!). I just want my eyes not to burn.. don't care what colors yield that result. reply tmtvl 7 hours agorootparentI would disagree that solarized is a good default, the colour it uses for blue (which is used by `ls' to show directories) is so low contrast it wears my eyes out. reply kibwen 4 hours agorootparentSeconded. By all means, people should use what they personally like, but solarized is really not designed to be a terminal mapping. Half the brights get mapped to totally different hues and the other half get mapped to indistinguishable shades of gray. Yes, the standard terminal color values are hideous, but we can do better than solarized. reply hnlmorg 2 hours agorootparentWhat would you recommend? Same questions to others who've posted qualms with Solarized. I tend not to spend much time configuring things these days so have always landed on Solarized out of laziness. reply kibwen 38 minutes agorootparentTo reiterate, I'm not here to say anyone is wrong for using solarized, only that as a terminal default it would eliminate the ability of terminal applications to assume that bright green, bright blue, bright cyan, and bright yellow are anything other than shades of gray. If that's fine for your use case, then no harm. And plenty of people tweak solarized to make these colors usable and distinguishable, but of course this obviates the whole light mode/dark mode party trick that is solarized's raison d'etre. There are lots of websites out there where people have shared their terminal color schemes, I would recommend seeking one out and looking for a screenshot of one that catches your eye. reply hnlmorg 1 minute agorootparentDon’t worry, I wasn’t taking your comment as personal critique. :) And to be fair to Solarized, it was really novel when it came out. But we’ve had years to improve upon it since. So I’m genuinely interested to hear some recommendations. Ideally themes that are “standardised” (for lack of a better phrase) so that I’m likely to find a VSCode theme as well as iTerm2 etc. I know I could just look online myself but customisation can quickly end up becoming an “addiction” (again, for want a better phrase) where you spend more time “configuring” than “doing”. A procrastination trap I’ve fallen into many times before. So the appeal of Solarized is that it stops me from spending too much time playing. And the appeal of having someone else tell me to use something else is that I also don’t fall into that proverbial rabbit hole. ziml77 3 hours agorootparentprevFor some reason that blue is a problem in a lot of color schemes. It's a good test for me though. If I can't read the output of ls, I dump the color scheme. reply layer8 4 hours agorootparentprevSolarized it too low-contrast for my eyes.

For some of those programs, the colors are configurable, but it seemed too much of a hassle to configure every single program. So now I'm just using a dark terminal background, but with a hand-picked ANSI theme where all the colors have a sufficient contrast ratio for me and also get a pass on APCA / WCAG 3 contrast checkers. I'm happy with it. :) reply kps 5 hours agoparentFor some of us with higher-order visual aberrations, dark mode is a non-starter. (The converse holds for some people with cataracts.) The OSC 11 control sequence lets a program determine the background color, but few bother. Usually, someone just thinks yellow warning messages look cool, and that's the end of it. That also leads to problem 12: Certain popular terminals that default to setting TERM=xterm256-color while not being xterm-compatible.

You can get the right color codes from something like Pablo or Moebius. It's a bit of a pain, and I'm honestly surprised more terminals/editors don't have a \"DOS ANSI\" theme option that matches those color codes.

If you’re a TUI (as in, full-screen terminal app), you should probably not (a) set background colours, or (b) use more than the 16 colours range¹, unless the user configures it so. —⁂— ¹ And you can’t even wisely use most of the 16 colour range—the intense colours might be higher or lower contrast, so they’re not useful how people want to use them, and black and white could both be either the higher contrast or literally invisible, when used against the default background; and blue, yellow, bright yellow, bright cyan are each very difficult to see on some common themes, those that’s becoming less common. reply powersnail 2 hours agorootparentSadly, the state of CLI and TUI tools is that background colors _will_ be encountered soon or later, if you use a wide range of software.

But buggy terminals are very common. Sometimes it's due to COLORFGBG not being set. Sometimes it's due to failing to implement the legacy \"bold = intense\" hack (from the 8-color days), which very many programs rely on. Sometimes it's due to the colorscheme having all colors be too bright. It's abominable how far some of those colorschemes are from the VGA standard. (Sometimes it's a gamma-ish problem.

    "originBody": "What Excessive Screen Time Does to the Adult Brain May 30, 2024/in Cognitive Enhancement, Mental Health /by Maya Shetty By Mary Grace Descourouez, MS, NBC-HWC Binge-watching television, watching YouTube videos for hours, or scrolling on your phone every morning may seem harmless, but research shows that too much screen time may be detrimental to your health. We know children’s brains are affected by spending too much time glued to their cell phones, however research shows that adult brains are also negatively impacted by excessive screen time, defined as more than two hours a day outside of work hours. Too much screen time can impact our health in a myriad of ways, from eye strain and neck pain to social isolation and mental health, and in some cases, it may cause harm to our brains. “The negative effects of screen time are insidious because you can’t see what’s happening in your brain as you’re staring at the screen,” says Maris Loeffler, MA, Family and Marriage Therapist, member of the Stanford Lifestyle Medicine Cognitive Enhancement pillar. “If you scrolled on your phone in bed for an hour just one morning, the negative impacts would be minimal. But if it becomes a habit, day after day, month after month, this behavior can take a toll.” Since the eyes are directly connected to the brain, Loeffler encourages us to think about our eye health to ensure overall brain health. Rather than looking at our phones upon waking, Loeffler recommends starting each morning looking at the horizon or an object outside and far away. To prevent eye strain throughout the workday, The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends the 20-20-20 rule for adults who work on a computer. This rule suggests that individuals look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds every 20 minutes of the day. What is Happening in the Brain During Screen Time? This study found that increased use of screens among adults may harm learning, memory, and mental health, as well as the potential to increase the risk of early neurodegeneration. The study shows that in adults aged 18 – 25, excessive screen time causes thinning of the cerebral cortex, the brain’s outermost layer responsible for processing memory and cognitive functions, such as decision-making and problem-solving. Another study found that adults who watched television for five hours or more per day had an increased risk of developing brain-related disease like dementia, stroke, or Parkinson’s. This study found that excessive screen time can hinder sleep, especially when looking at screens late at night. Light from the screen can delay melatonin release from the brain’s pineal gland, impacting the body’s natural circadian rhythm and causing difficulty sleeping. Additional studies found that adults who engage in excessive screen time or have a diagnosed smartphone addiction had lower gray matter volume. Gray matter is brain tissue essential for daily human functioning and is responsible for everything from movement to memory to emotions. Gray matter volume naturally decreases as we age, so along with reducing screen time, engaging in activities that maintain our gray matter volume and promote brain health, such as exercise and movement, restorative sleep, social engagement, and stress management, is crucial. “Passive screen time is like eating sugar but for your brain. It ‘tastes’ good, and you want it now, but you’re not actually feeding yourself. You’re not giving your brain any nutrition,” says Loeffler. “Instead, replace screen time with an intentional healthy habit that feeds your brain in a healthy way. Lifestyle medicine activities, like exercise, good sleep, social connection, and stress management, function like ‘nutrition’ for your brain and mental health.” Specifically, Loeffler cautions us not to pick up the phone after the alarm goes off in the morning. She explains that looking at our email or social media on our phones while still in bed jolts the nervous system and can trigger the fight-or-flight response since we aren’t fully awake yet. Also, if we look at our phones first thing every morning, we create a pattern and can set the flight-or-flight response as our default mode of operation. So, not only does this behavior set an anxiety-filled tone for the day, but we are also training our brains to be more hypervigilant in general. “One of the biggest issues with picking up the phone right away in the morning is that when you have an object close to your face, it’s registered as a threat,” says Loeffler. “You wouldn’t want to wake up and look a bear in the face every morning. On a physiological level, it’s the same thing.” Practice of the Month: No Screen Time for the First Hour of the Day Stanford Lifestyle Medicine experts recommend no screen time for the first hour of the day to support cognitive enhancement. Instead, we suggest engaging in a lifestyle medicine activity upon waking to promote whole-body health: Exercise Call a friend or family member Prepare a healthy breakfast Meditate and count your blessings Listen to music Create a gratitude list Read a book Spend time outside and get morning light “How do you want your day’s energy and mood to start?” says Loeffler. “Intentionally implementing a morning routine that reflects lifestyle medicine choices instead of screen time sets a positive tone for the day and supports brain health and cognitive enhancement.” Tags: brain health, mental health, screen time Share this entry Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Linkedin Share by Mail https://longevity.stanford.edu/lifestyle/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2024/05/Social-Med-POM.png 315 851 Maya Shetty https://longevity.stanford.edu/lifestyle/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2023/03/Untitled-500-×-250-px-400-×-200-px-400-×-100-px-300-×-100-px.png Maya Shetty2024-05-30 22:37:382024-06-05 00:44:23What Excessive Screen Time Does to the Adult Brain",

Social media, doom scrolling, candy crush, etc. are all high-dopamine activities. After you engage in these activates for a while, then stop, you're left at a relative dopamine deficiency, which your brain abhors. It attempts to rectify the deficiency by encouraging you to engage in high-dopamine activities, which you experience as being 'distracted' from the relatively low-dopamine-rewarded work you're trying to focus on. If you avoid engaging in high-dopamine activities in the morning, your brain WILL be more amenable to focus on low-dopamine-rewarded work.

Primary search terms focused on “smartphone,” “mental health,” “substance use,” “neurodevelopment,” and “neurodegeneration”; secondary search terms focused on “social media,” “anxiety,” “cannabis,” and “dementia”. They basically went fishing for studies that focus on the negative impacts, came back with enough content and packaged it as a meta-study.

OK so let's call it 'interactive screen time'. No, reading ebook doesn't count, as long as you don't keep switching to something else frequently. It will mess up your eyes worse than physical book, but that's about it. I can see the proper cancer that screens cause to small children development. Heck, some parents are proud how 'digital' their kids are, like scrolling through social media videos is some hard earned skill only few posses. What I see is failed parenting, and I call it like that. Then you look at the mood swings of those kids, how they behave socially, what they eat etc. and its often a sad story. Then you look at parents glued to phones themselves, often overweight, living unhappy unfulfilled lives, and it starts making sense (broad generalization here of course, but I see it very often among peers & a bit younger). Kids ain't adults for sure but screen time, if not done for actual work or learning, eats time we could be actually doing something with our life. Relaxing, sporting, socializing, learning new skills, making ourselves properly happy. That ain't happening in front of screen, any screen. The energy recharge and 'soul' regeneration that me and everybody else I know experience in nature and wilderness can't be achieved in any other way. Screen time also sets unrealistic expectations on how 'baseline' of normal daily life should be with its always-stimulated-neocortex as such, no wonder kids have attention issues with 'boring' stuff that regular life simply is. I may be a luddite re this despite being software dev, but in this case happy to be one since I've figured my path to happy fulfilled life, and it sure as hell doesn't need more screen time, nor any made up justifications for some form of addiction to such. reply portaouflop 9 hours agorootparentA bit tangential but how does a digital book mess up your eyes? Or a physical one. I don’t think reading has any effect on your eyesight. People are quick nowadays (or always have been) to bring out the good old „todays kids are rotten to the core“ trope - just because it’s now you who is old and doesn’t get how the world moved on, doesn’t mean it’s any different to the centuries of complaining about the youth before us.

That said, I have a Philips wake-up light that has a very pleasant yellow and dimmable light. I wonder what its frequency is though, some cheaper leds don't blink fast enough and especially when I'm tired it's noticeable. I just checked it with the slow-mo camera of my phone, my overhead lamps have a visible flickering, but the wake-up light has an interesting shuttering / interlacing effect, when I up the brightness (which increases brightness and shifts the light more to white) it seems to alternate between a white and orange light source. Might be multiple bulbs interlacing. Anyway, LED backlight shouldn't be a problem if it's not white light. Best to have some additional light in the room though, to reduce contrast / eye strain between the screen and the background. reply hug 10 hours agorootparentprevFrom anecdotal experience, it makes essentially no difference.

When we onboard users we ask them to select a number of \"scroll replacements\" — these are simple things you can substitute for scrolling, like going outside or reading. The app will block you from scrolling and direct you towards a chosen replacement. One I make the split second decision to pick up the book it's easy to stay there. That single moment of decision can make a big impact. (I'm the founder of an app called Roots) reply Roark66 8 hours agoprevYou can't make conclusions based on that... At best these studies are a start to show where proper studies should be conducted. You may as well measure an impact of looking at printed paper. What about the impact of the actual activity you're having? It is completely different to mindlessly watch TV, or a YouTube stream vs playing games (online or offline). Then within games there are more and less intellectual or dexterity based ones and so on. There is social interaction or just exploring the game world. And so on. reply imaginationra 8 hours agoprevAdult here that NEVER used any kind of mobile phone/tablet- never even had a flip/dumb phone. I do programming amongst other creative computer based things- the thing I've noticed between me and the normal phone/tablet human- is the ability to focus. I can focus for hours, weeks, months, years on tasks etc. Everyone around me feels like focus wimps- they focus for 15 minutes or an hour and are proud of themselves and want some kind of pat on the back. They even use apps on the devices to \"help them focus\" its hilarious. I don't use any medications at all or nootropics/drugs for focus either btw. These devices destroyed peoples ability to focus amongst a myriad of other things. The solution to me seems very simple. Stop using them BUT thats like telling a heroin addict to just put down the needle. They can't do it- and neither can you (shrugs) Also using phones has always seemed nerdy/dorky- no matter who the person is- when I see someone using a mobile phone they seem like a dweeb- like whatever aura they had fades away and they just become cringey. It doesn't matter if their screen is cracked or what case they have- there is no way to be cool while using a mobile phone- just a sea of dorks with broken brains begging for more. reply ph1sch3r 7 hours agoparentWhen engaged in a difficult task - perhaps when working at the limit of one's working memory or understanding, I often get a jolt of frustration and want to 'switch tabs' (figuratively or literally). It's becoming more apparent to me that important traits are: 1) raising the threshold of discomfort that makes one want to task switch 2) the ability to avoid task switching immediately once the task becomes uncomfortable or difficult (or at least avoid task switching in a mindless way) I find that impactful work often takes sustained periods of focus with some level of discomfort. (For example, watch chess grandmasters at work. Their behaviors of often are a mixture of grimaces, frowns and exasperated sighs.) Having said that, I find taking a walk is often fruitful, and has a different valence/intentionality to a mindless task switch. reply Roark66 8 hours agoparentprevAdult here that has always had a device with a screen since they first became available. From a black and white Palm which required learning a special cursive script to write quicker, through iPhones of the 3G era to latest Samsungs today. I spend many hours \"with screens\" every day in addition to a programming job. Before portable devices I always had a computer from age 10 when I got my first 8 bit computer. I was glued to screens ever since. I never had problems with focusing on tasks. In fact when I have a particularly interesting thing I'm doing, unless I actively remind myself to have breaks I'll forget to eat and drink for many hours. So there's my anecdote :-) reply wezdog1 7 hours agoparentprev>Also using phones has always seemed nerdy/dorky- Nothing nerdy about sitting behind a terminal emulator... reply makeitdouble 6 hours agoparentprev> I can focus for hours, weeks, months, years on tasks etc. What do you mean by focusing on tasks for years ? For instance does a parent get to say they focused on raising their kid for 10+ years ? Or can a accountant say they focused on keeping books straight for decades ? Aside from that I feel what's lost in this argument is whether a specific task merited focus in the first place. Let's say someone is watching a movie but decides after 10 min to look at TikTok instead, to then go cook some popcorn and ends up doing the laundry. Should we blame them for doing chores instead of staying focused on the meh movie in the first place ?

Many people in similar climates to you use sun lamps during winter, for example. reply mrweasel 7 hours agorootparentIt's not wrong, but I still think it's stupid, because of how it's normally stated. I've never heard it presented as \"if your location allows it\" or \"We understand that that isn't an option for large parts of the world so here an alternative\". People have been living in this part of the world for thousands of years, without sun lamps, it might be good if you can get it, but sun light first thing in the morning certainly isn't a requirement. It might be good thing to do, but as general advise, it's has a pretty obviously flaw. That is NEVER address by the type of people who brings us this advise and to me that hurt credibility. \"Get sun light into your eyes first thing in the morning\", perfect, I'll just sleep until 10. reply OJFord 8 hours agoparentprevMaybe it's consistent with hyperfocus on doing things 'naturally' though? Before timekeeping we would've just risen & started work with the sun, gone to bed when it was dark and we tired. I'm not actually advocating that (I kind of like it but it's also a bit incompatible with interacting with a society not living such a way, to varying degrees depending on your job, family, etc.) I just wonder if that would be the author's response - well what are you doing up over an hour before sunrise. reply Ekaros 8 hours agoprevI'm more thinking that it is not the medium(as in screens).

Looking at the sky - okay. But looking at the horizon? That's a bit unrealistic. I'd argue that you could also have a plant.

I like using Claude, and I'm also a big supporter of Anthropic - not just because it's an underdog, but due to its responsible and ethical corporate governance model[1], which stands in stark contrast to OpenAI. It's worrying to see ChatGPT close one of the gaps between it and Claude. [1] https://www.anthropic.com/news/the-long-term-benefit-trust reply iwishiknewlisp 3 minutes agoparentI got weirded out about ChatGPT when I dug deeper into the founder and discovered claims of sexual assault from his sister. I am not being facetious either when I say that something about the expressions and behavior of Sam Altman gives me the creeps even before I was aware of the allegations against him. Obviously, the split into a for-profit company and resignations from the alignment team are more factual based concerns, but the way Sam Altman carries himself gives me all sort of subconscious tells of something sinister. Maybe its a point anti-thetical to reason, but my view is that after hundred of thousands of years of human evolution, a gut feeling has some truth even if I can't understand the mechanism behind it. reply kingkongjaffa 8 minutes agoparentprev> clearly this is meant to match one of the killer features of Claude. where does Claude have a canvas like interface?

The idea of a canvas made me really enjoy using Claude as I felt it to be the (so far) most \"appropriate interface\" to AI Chatbots as you are often doing two unique things in an AI chat: - holding in your mind a \"thing\" (i.e. some code) - talking about a \"thing\" (i.e. walking through the code) The same applies to non-code tasks as well. The ability to segregate the actual \"meat\" from the discussion is an excellent interface improvement for chatbots. reply mmaunder 1 hour agoparentHave you used it? reply cj 1 hour agoprevThis is cool, but I wish it were integrated into tools already used for coding and writing rather than having it be a separate app. This also demonstrates the type of things Google could do with Gemini integrated into Google Docs if they step up their game a bit. Honestly I’m scratching my head on OpenAI’s desire to double down on building out their consumer B2C use cases rather than truly focussing on being the infrastructure/API provider for other services to plug into. If I had to make a prediction, I think OpenAI will end up being either an infrastructure provider OR a SaaS, but not both, in the long-term (5-10 yrs from now). reply jcfrei 1 hour agoparentWhen they are focusing on just being an API provider then they will be in a market with (long term) razor thin margins and high competition - most likely unable to build a deep moat. But if you can shape customers habits to always input \"chatgpt.com\" into the browser whenever they want to use AI then that's a very powerful moat. Those customers will also most likely be on a subscription basis, meaning much more flexibility in pricing and more rent for openAI (people using it less then what OpenAI calculates for subscription costs). reply adventured 33 minutes agorootparentThe difference between Google had it just tried to be an enterprise search API, versus owning the consumer destination for search input/results. reply al_borland 20 minutes agoparentprevI wouldn't be surprised to see Apple add something like this to Pages and some of their other apps. Their approach to AI, from what we've seen so far, has been about integrating it into existing apps and experiences, rather than making a separate AI app. I have to imagine this is the way forward, and these stand alone apps are basically tech demos for what is possible, rather than end-state for how it should be consumed by the masses. I agree with you on where OpenAI will/should sit in 5-10 years. However, I don't think them building the occasional tool like this is unwarranted, as it helps them show the direction companies could/should head with integration into other tools. Before Microsoft made hardware full time, they would occasionally produce something (or partner with brands) to show a new feature Windows supports as a way to tell the OEMs out there, \"this is what we want you to do and the direction we'd like the PC to head.\" The UMPC[0] was one attempt at this which didn't take off. Intel also did something like this with the NUC[1]. I view what OpenAI is doing as a similar concept, but applied to software.

I feel like Google's products have become such a labyrinth of features, settings, integrations, separate (but not really) products, that navigating them requires an expert. Sadly, I don't see a way back - each new additional feature or product is just bolted on top and adds more complexity. Given the corporate structure of Google, there's zero chance of an org-wide restructuring of the labyrinth. reply herval 11 minutes agorootparentprevgoogle's approach to shipping products is puzzling. It's like they don't care if anyone uses them at all reply serjester 52 minutes agoparentprev75% of OpenAI's revenue is coming from their consumer business - the better question is the long term viability of their public API. But if they believe they're going to reach AGI, it makes no sense to pigeonhole themselves to the interface of ChatGPT. Seems like a pretty sensible decision to maintain both. reply wenc 1 hour agoparentprev> This also demonstrates the type of things Google could do with Gemini integrated into Google Docs if they step up their game a bit.

My guess is they know they don't have a long term edge in models alone, so they are going to rely on expanding ChatGPT for better margins and to keep getting training data from users. They obviously want to control the platform, not integrate with other platforms reply herval 23 minutes agoparentprevLLM as a service is much easier to replicate than physical data centers and there's a much lower potential user base than consumers, so I'd imagine they're swimming upstream into B2C land in order to justify the valuation reply isignal 31 minutes agoparentprevConsumer side can allow you to run ads and get Google like revenue in the future. reply riffraff 25 minutes agoparentprevgoogle has gemini integrated in Google Colab (jupyter notebooks) and while it doesn't work 100% well, it's a pretty great idea. reply leetharris 1 hour agoparentprev> Honestly I’m scratching my head on OpenAI’s desire to double down on building out their consumer B2C use cases rather than truly focussing on being the infrastructure/API provider for other services to plug into I think it's because LLMs (and to some extent other modalities) tend to be \"winner takes all.\" OpenAI doesn't have a long term moat, their data and architecture is not wildly better than xAI, Google, MS, Meta, etc. If they don't secure their position as #1 Chatbot I think they will eventually become #2, then #3, etc. reply aflukasz 8 minutes agorootparent> If they don't secure their position as #1 Chatbot I think they will eventually become #2, then #3, etc. But can they do it at all?

Instead we are getting garbage UX/Backends that are trying to fully replace devs. Give me a break. reply dumbfounder 15 minutes agorootparentGarbage in, garbage out. It is not going to imagine your perfect scenario and then create it for you. I take anyone saying it is garbage with a grain of salt because it is incredibly useful for me. And others think so too, so how can your bad experience negate that. It can't. If you can craft the right prompts it can make you much more efficient. Anyone saying it is going to replace whole people en masse is just part of the hype machine. But if all it does is make every human on earth 1% more efficient then that is an obscene amount of value it is creating. reply RigelKentaurus 51 minutes agoparentprevThe text i supposed to be banal, so that ChatGPT can make it better.

I'm not very skilled at creating good \"test\" scenarios for this, but I found this to be fun/interesting: https://i.imgur.com/TMhNEcf.png I had it write some Python code to output a random poem. I then had it write some code to find/replace a word in the poem (sky -> goodbye). I then manually edited each of the input poems to include the word \"sky\". I then told it to execute the python code (which causes it to run \"Analyzing...\") and to show the output on the screen.

Why not work on truly revolutionary ways to visualize the make this singularity so radically new things? Embody it. Maps its infinite coherence. Give it control in limited zones. Truly find its new opportunities. reply aboringusername 55 minutes agoprevExcuse my possible ignorance but I had a question: Does ChatGPT have 'up to date knowledge' in terms of latest versions of software? When I have used it I asked it to help me with VueJS but whilst it knew about version 3 (which is substantially different to V2) it didn't know the very latest version. Isn't this going to be problematic if it's trying to help code but has outdated information? Won't this result in more code being written/tied to older languages/framework versions? In my experience, because GPT outputs code tied to particular versions of software, I use those as it's far quicker to copy/paste/edit than reading the latest docs, where GPT is absolutely useless as it simply doesn't know about the latest code and isn't able to produce working snippets. So the real deal would be if GPT knows about the latest software instantly the moment it's published (ingesting docs data, any stackoverflow Q/A's etc).

However, there are alternate definitions (reasonable in their own way) in which it is clear these AI tools fall short.

Apparently he just dumped money into the bank accounts of the various overseas territories he was selling the domain names for and they were OK with it? He's since sold it on and now a hedge fund owns it. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.io Officially, the British Indian Ocean Territories will cease to exist, therefore so would the ISO 2-letter country code. However, ccTLDs have outlasted countries before, notably \".su\" for the no longer existing USSR. I suspect that IANA would prioritise not breaking millions of domain names over trying to police ccTLDs. Google's view on the matter is that .io is already effectively a gTLD rather than a ccTLD, like with .nu, .to, .tv, as most of the registrants run websites with a global audience or at least an audience other than the island nations whose ccTLDs they are. reply lolinder 6 hours agoparentAs far as I can find .su is the exception in surviving, not the rule, and who operated the ccTLD is irrelevant to the question of whether ICANN decides to allow it to live on. It does seem likely that ICANN won't kill off all existing registrations, but this is supposition, not an answer. If we look only at what they've done historically to ccTLDs the most likely outcome is that new registrations become locked and ICANN attempts to phase the .io TLD out. They may break that trend now given how much they've already polluted the TLD space, but they may not, and I think your comment is a bit too optimistic. People with .io domains should absolutely be paying close attention here. Edit: gnfargbl found the actual written policy [0].

You buy the coffee, and the people who have the rightful claim to the land don't receive any of the profits.

All of this handwringing is a disingenuous excuse to vilify Britain and the West in general from the very same people who sympathize and make excuses for the Vietnamese communists even to this day. Edit: If we were holding a consistent standard here, we would have to say that the Vietnamese government should withdraw from illegally occupied South Vietnam and return it to the people who were violently displaced in 1975. Nobody advocates for this. Vietnam has somewhat liberalized into the kind of country that doesn’t do this sort of thing anymore and the refugees of 1975 and their descendants have built new lives in the countries they ended up in, including the United States.

    "title": "Image Editing with Gaussian Splatting",
    "originLink": "https://www.unite.ai/image-editing-with-gaussian-splatting/",
    "originBody": "Artificial Intelligence Image Editing with Gaussian Splatting Published 7 hours ago on October 3, 2024 By Martin Anderson A new collaboration between researchers in Poland and the UK proposes the prospect of using Gaussian Splatting to edit images, by temporarily interpreting a selected part of the image into 3D space, allowing the user to modify and manipulate the 3D representation of the image, and then applying the transformation. To change the orientation of the cat's head, the relevant section is moved into 3D space via Gaussian Splatting, and then manipulated by the user. The modification is then applied. The process is analogous to various modal techniques in Adobe software, that lock off the interface until a current complex process is completed. Source: https://github.com/waczjoan/MiraGe/ Since the Gaussian Splat element is temporarily represented by a mesh of triangles, and momentarily enters a ‘CGI state', a physics engine integrated into the process can interpret natural movement, either to change the static state of an object, or to produce an animation. A physics engine incorporated into the new MiraGe system can perform natural interpretations of physical movement, either for animations or static alterations to an image. There is no generative AI involved in the process, meaning that no Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are involved, unlike Adobe's Firefly system, which is trained on Adobe Stock (formerly Fotolia). The system – called MiraGe – interprets selections into 3D space and infers geometry by creating a mirror image of the selection, and approximating 3D coordinates that can be embodied in a Splat, which then interprets the image into a mesh. Video Player 00:00 00:00 00:00 Use Up/Down Arrow keys to increase or decrease volume. Click to play. Further examples of elements that have been either altered manually by a user of the MiraGe system, or subject to physics-based deformation. The authors compared the MiraGe system to former approaches, and found that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in the target task. Users of the zBrush modeling system will be familiar with this process, since zBrush allows the user to essentially ‘flatten' a 3D model and add 2D detail, while preserving the underlying mesh, and interpreting the new detail into it – a ‘freeze' that is the opposite of the MiraGe method, which operates more like Firefly or other Photoshop-style modal manipulations, such as warping or crude 3D interpretations. Parametrized Gaussian Splats allow MiraGe to create high-quality reconstructions of selected areas of a 2D image, and apply soft-body physics to the temporarily-3D selection. The paper states: ‘[We] introduce a model that encodes 2D images by simulating human interpretation. Specifically, our model perceives a 2D image as a human would view a photograph or a sheet of paper, treating it as a flat object within a 3D space. ‘This approach allows for intuitive and flexible image editing, capturing the nuances of human perception while enabling complex transformations.' The new paper is titled MiraGe: Editable 2D Images using Gaussian Splatting, and comes from four authors across Jagiellonian University at Kraków, and the University of Cambridge. The full code for the system has been released at GitHub. Let's take a look at how the researchers tackled the challenge. Method The MiraGe approach utilizes Gaussian Mesh Splatting (GaMeS) parametrization, a technique developed by a group that includes two of the authors of the new paper. GaMeS allows Gaussian Splats to be interpreted as traditional CGI meshes, and to become subject to the standard range of warping and modification techniques that the CGI community has developed over the last several decades. MiraGe interprets ‘flat' Gaussians, in a 2D space, and uses GaMeS to ‘pull' content into GSplat-enabled 3D space, temporarily. Each flat Gaussian is represented as three points in a cloud of triangles, called ‘triangle soup', opening up the inferred image to manipulation. Source: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01521 We can see in the lower-left corner of the image above that MiraGe creates a ‘mirror' image of the section of an image to be interpreted. The authors state: ‘[We] employ a novel approach utilizing two opposing cameras positioned along the Y axis, symmetrically aligned around the origin and directed towards one another. The first camera is tasked with reconstructing the original image, while the second models the mirror reflection. ‘The photograph is thus conceptualized as a translucent tracing paper sheet, embedded within the 3D spatial context. The reflection can be effectively represented by horizontally flipping the [image]. This mirror-camera setup enhances the fidelity of the generated reflections, providing a robust solution for accurately capturing visual elements.' The paper notes that once this extraction has been achieved, perspective adjustments that would typically be challenging become accessible via direct editing in 3D. In the example below, we see a selection of an image of a woman that encompasses only her arm. In this instance, the user has tilted the hand downward in a plausible manner, which would be a challenging task by just pushing pixels around. An example of the MiraGe editing technique. Attempting this using the Firefly generative tools in Photoshop would usually mean that the hand becomes replaced by a synthesized, diffusion-imagined hand, breaking the authenticity of the edit. Even the more capable systems, such as the ControlNet ancillary system for Stable Diffusion and other Latent Diffusion Models, such as Flux, struggle to achieve this kind of edit in an image-to-image pipeline. This particular pursuit has been dominated by methods using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs), such as SIREN and WIRE. The difference between an implicit and explicit representation method is that the coordinates of the model are not directly addressable in INRs, which use a continuous function. By contrast, Gaussian Splatting offers explicit and addressable X/Y/Z Cartesian coordinates, even though it uses Gaussian ellipses rather than voxels or other methods of depicting content in a 3D space. The idea of using GSplat in a 2D space has been most prominently presented, the authors note, in the 2024 Chinese academic collaboration GaussianImage, which offered a 2D version of Gaussian Splatting, enabling inference frame rates of 1000fps. However, this model has no implementation related to image editing. After GaMeS parametrization extracts the selected area into a Gaussian/mesh representation, the image is reconstructed using the Material Points Method (MPM) technique first outlined in a 2018 CSAIL paper. In MiraGe, during the process of alteration, the Gaussian Splat exists as a guiding proxy for an equivalent mesh version, much as 3DMM CGI models are frequently used as orchestration methods for implicit neural rendering techniques such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). In the process, two-dimensional objects are modeled in 3D space, and the parts of the image that are not being influenced are not visible to the end user, so that the contextual effect of the manipulations are not apparent until the process is concluded. MiraGe can be integrated into the popular open source 3D program Blender, which is now frequently used in AI-inclusive workflows, primarily for image-to-image purposes. A workflow for MiraGe in Blender, involving the movement of the arm of a figure depicted in a 2D image. The authors offer two versions of a deformation approach based on Gaussian Splatting – Amorphous and Graphite. The Amorphous approach directly utilizes the GaMeS method, and allows the extracted 2D selection to move freely in 3D space, whereas the Graphite approach constrains the Gaussians to 2D space during initialization and training. The researchers found that though the Amorphous approach might handle complex shapes better than Graphite, ‘tears' or rift artefacts were more evident, where the edge of the deformation aligns with the unaffected portion of the image*. Therefore, they developed the aforementioned ‘mirror image' system: ‘[We] employ a novel approach utilizing two opposing cameras positioned along the Y axis, symmetrically aligned around the origin and directed towards one another. ‘The first camera is tasked with reconstructing the original image, while the second models the mirror reflection. The photograph is thus conceptualized as a translucent tracing paper sheet, embedded within the 3D spatial context. The reflection can be effectively represented by horizontally flipping the [image]. ‘This mirror-camera setup enhances the fidelity of the generated reflections, providing a robust solution for accurately capturing visual elements.' The paper notes that MiraGe can use external physics engines such as those available in Blender, or in Taichi_Elements. Data and Tests For image quality assessments in tests carried out for MiraGe, the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and MS-SIM metrics were used. Datasets used were the Kodak Lossless True Color Image Suite, and the DIV2K validation set. The resolutions of these datasets suited a comparison with the closest prior work, Gaussian Image. The other rival frameworks trialed were SIREN, WIRE, NVIDIA's Instant Neural Graphics Primitives (I-NGP), and NeuRBF. The experiments took place on a NVIDIA GEFORCE RTX 4070 laptop and on a NVIDIA RTX 2080. MiraGe offers state-of-the-art results against the chosen prior frameworks, according to the results featured in the new paper. Of these results, the authors state: ‘We see that our proposition outperforms the previous solutions on both datasets. The quality measured by both metrics shows significant improvement compared to all the previous approaches.' Conclusion MiraGe's adaptation of 2D Gaussian Splatting is clearly a nascent and tentative foray into what may prove to be a very interesting alternative to the vagaries and whims of using diffusion models to effect modifications to an image (i.e., via Firefly and other API-based diffusion methods, and via open source architectures such as Stable Diffusion and Flux). Though there are many diffusion models that can effect minor changes in images, LDMs are limited by their semantic and often ‘over-imaginative' approach to a text-based user request for a modification. Therefore the ability to temporarily pull part of an image into 3D space, manipulate it and replace it back into the image, while using only the source image as a reference, seems a task that Gaussian Splatting may be well suited for in the future. * There is some confusion in the paper, in that it cites ‘Amorphous-Mirage' as the most effective and capable method, in spite of its tendency to produce unwanted Gaussians (artifacts), while arguing that ‘Graphite-Mirage' is more flexible. It appears that Amorphous-Mirage obtains the best detail, and Graphite-Mirage the best flexibility. Since both methods are presented in the paper, with their diverse strengths and weaknesses, the authors' preference, if any, does not appear to be clear at this time.

Based on the description of how they generate the splats, I think you’d auto select the item out of the background, do this with it, then paste it back. The splatting process uses a pretty interesting idea, which is to imagine two cameras, one the current “view” of the image, the other one 180 degrees opposite looking back, but at a “flat” mirror image of the front. This is going to constrain the splats away from having weird rando shapes. You will emphatically not get the ability to rotate something a long a vertical axis here, (e.g. “let me just see a little more of that statue’s other side”). You will instead get a nice method to deform / rearrange. reply aDyslecticCrow 4 hours agoparentprevIt probably isn't.

In this case, you probably work with a transparent map anyway. reply doctorpangloss 2 hours agorootparentWhy do gaussian splats benefit you for mesh transform applications? Name one, and think deeply about what is going on. The applications are generally non-physical transformations, so having a physical representation is worse, not better; and then, the weaknesses are almost always interacting with foreground versus background separation. Another POV is, well generative AI solves the issue I am describing, which should question why these guys are so emphatic about their thing not interacting with the generative AI thing.

It's just good-ass tooling for making cool-ass art. Hell yes! Finally, there is some useful AI tooling that empowers artistic creativity rather than drains it. Pardon the French; I just think this is too awesome for normal words. reply jsheard 4 hours agoparentYep, there's a similar refrain amongst 3D artists who are begging for AI tools which can effectively speed up the tedious parts of their current process like retopo and UV unwrapping, but all AI researchers keep giving them are tools which take a text prompt or image and try to automate their entire process from start to finish, with very little control and invariably low quality results. reply treyd 1 hour agorootparentBecause the investors funding development of those AI tools don't want to try to empower artists and give them more freedom, they want to try to replace them. reply ChadNauseam 1 hour agorootparentThe investors want to make money, and if they make a tool that is usable by more people than just experienced 3D artists who are tired of retopologizing their models, that both empowers many more people and potentially makes them more money. Aside from that, it's impossible to tools replace artists. Did cameras replace painting? I'm sure they reduced the demand for paintings, but if you want to create art and paint is your chosen medium it has never been easier. If you want to create art and 3D models are your chosen medium, the existence of AI tools for 3D model generation from a prompt doesn't stop you. However, if you want to create a game and you need a 3D model of a rock or something, you're not trying to make \"art\" with that rock, you're trying to make a game and a 3D model is just something you need to do that. reply aDyslecticCrow 4 hours agorootparentprevThere have been some really nice AI tools to generate bump and diffusion maps from photos. So you could photograph a wall and get a detailed meshing texture with good light scatter and depth. That's the kind of awesome tech that got me into AI in the first place. But then prompt generators took over everything. reply jsheard 4 hours agorootparentDenoising is another good practical application of AI in 3D, you can save a lot of time without giving up any control by rendering an almost noise-free image and then letting a neural network clean it up.

The problem is, these are not billion dollar ideas. You're not gonna raise a lot of money at crazy valuations by proposing to build a tool for relighting scenes or removing unwanted to objects from a photo. Especially since there is a good chance that Google, Apple, or Adobe are going to just borrow your idea if it pans out. On the other hand, you can raise a lot of money if you promise to render an entire industry or an entire class of human labor obsolete. The end result is that far fewer people are working on ML-based dust or noise removal than on tools that are generating made-up images or videos from scratch. reply CaptainFever 3 hours agoparentprevI share your excitement for this tool that assists artists. However, I don't share the same disdain for prompt generators. I find it enlightening to view it in the context of coding. GitHub Copilot assists programmers, while ChatGPT replaces the entire process. There are pros and cons though: GitHub Copilot is hard to use for non-programmers, but can be used to assist in the creation of complex programs. ChatGPT is easy to use for non-programmers, but is usually restricted to making simple scripts. However, this doesn't mean that ChatGPT is useless for professional programmers either, if you just need to make something simple. I think a similar dynamic happens in art. Both types of tools are awesome, they're just for different demographics and have different limitations. For example, using the coding analogy: MidJourney is like ChatGPT. Easy to use, but hard to control. Good for random people. InvokeAI, Generative Fill and this new tool is like Copilot. Hard to use for non-artists, but easier to control and customise. Good for artists. However, I do find it frustrating how most of the funding in AI art tools goes towards the easy-to-use side, instead of the easy-to-control side (this doesn't seem to be shared by coding, where Copilot is more well-developed than ChatGPT coding). More funding and development to the easy-to-control type would be very welcome indeed! (Note, ControlNet is probably a good example as easy-to-control. There's a very high skill ceiling in using Stable Diffusion right now.) reply TheRealPomax 2 hours agoparentprevExcept this is explicitly not AI, nor is it even tangentially related to AI.

Current generative models devalue artists' work without giving much, if anything, in return to help them make better work themselves. They're also trained on artists' work without compensation and abuse copyright laws that are too outdated for the technology. Learning to draw or paint these days and expecting to get paid for it is getting harder, as there will always be the counter, \"but I can just generate it with AI at a 10th the speed\".

Their examples does however only look a bit like distorted pixel data. The hands of the children seem to warp with the cloth, something they could have easily prevented. The cloth also looks very static despite it being animated, mainly because the shading of it never changes. If they had more information about the scene from multiple cameras (or perhaps inferred from the color data), the Gaussian splat would be more accurate and could even incorporate the altered angle/surface-normal after modification to cleverly simulate the changed specular highlights as it animates. reply anamexis 6 hours agoparentprevThe type of 3D model, Gaussian splatting, is also pretty neat and has been getting a lot of attention lately.

A sleep-deprived artist somewhere (not me): No, thank you, I need to get this for an ad tomorrow morning. reply aDyslecticCrow 5 hours agoparentprevThe kind of edits and animations this can do are currently not possible with 3D modelling and animation, with or without this tech. This kind of warping of 2D images is currently used extensively, but a lot more manually (See Live2d, the Photoshop mesh transform tool, or Adobe Illustrator). So, this does not replace 3D modelling; it replaces some 2D editing techniques where 3D modelling isn't even on the table as an applicable tool. This kind of 2d image warping is useful in advertisements, game art, photo touchups, concept art, photo bashing and digital illustration. reply atrus 5 hours agoparentprevWhat's the line there though?

Everyone does and always has had the right to express themselves visually with the best tools available. But why shouldn’t it require difficult to use tools or cost a lot? That depends entirely on what ideas you’re trying to express and what tools exist, does it not? Blockbuster movies will never get significantly cheaper, no matter what tools we invent. They will spend as much or more money on using the new tools to make more grandiose movies that individual people have no hope of doing themselves. There’s already a hundred year history of this happening, despite the tools having always been accessible to everyone. I think this Gaussian splatting tool is great, and I’m in favor of forward progress in imaging tools, and I work in this field. But where is the line between having accessible tools, and putting time and effort into your craft to make something that’s high quality, or telling a story with images that are personal and new?

I, for one, would like to tell an epic sci-fi adventure story without needing Disney's budget. I've spent tens of thousands of dollars on indie film production and it's incredibly expensive and time consuming.

(Read: waiting on post has been a serious hang-up for me in the past and caused me to miss several festival deadlines.) > There’s already a hundred year history of this happening, despite the tools having always been accessible to everyone. No, the reason this happens is because large budget films are predictably bankable and wind up eating up all of the screen distribution real estate. There's a reason you don't want to launch your movie opposite The Avengers or another tent pole feature. The most ROI comes from breakout low budget successes, but those are harder to gamble on. > I work in this field Same. > But where is the line between having accessible tools, and putting time and effort into your craft to make something that’s high quality, or telling a story with images that are personal and new? Why not let the users and the artists show us what they'll make rather than predicting they can't do a good job? I know dozens of artists, myself included, using these tools incredibly effectively. > being able to express your ideas effortlessly This is probably the source of our disagreement. An effortless tool doesn't mean works of art don't take effort. > stealing the means to do that from artists who had to put it effort to produce the content that trained the AI This argument will be moot soon.

You wouldn't ask illustrators to ditch their tablets force them to mix their own cerulean unless that's what they wanted to do. The tools that are coming are going to be fantastic and they're going to enable artists to do wild new things. That isn't subtractive, it's additive. There's more space to explore. New tools don't even prevent folks from making music and media the old fashioned way: there are still people shooting on film to this day. And there's a vibrant community that embraces anachronistic tools to make new art.

DAWs don't revert your changes back to means, but genAI always do, being a statistical model. The roughly other half is that the output is inexplicably bad, not always noticeable to everyone but often obvious to artists and connoisseurs, so connoisseurs can't promote themselves into artists by use of AI. The almost violent anti-AI sentiment seen among art cohort is sometimes hard to understand to subgroups of tech literates without enough training epochs in human generative image data(especially the kind prevalent on the Internet), and I would understand that without grasp of rather subjective quality issues it could indeed look like an artificially incited luddite conspiracy. Once someone makes an AI that would be additive and outputs entertainment worthy, then the \"luddites\" will change, they must. Until then, it's just a technically remarkable white noise generator. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originBody": "◂ Back to latest posts ▾ Previous: Around The World, Part 19: Constructing languages Why my apps will soon be gone from the Google Play Store Fri, 6 Sep 2024 by Thomas ten Cate · Comments Business, Bigcanvas, Patchy, Twistago, Rocket Mail The first real money I ever made from game development was on Android. It was in 2013, when Android was still the underdog compared to the iPhone, and was being touted as a great platform for developers. I’d taken two weeks to build Patchy, a retro arcade game revamped for touch controls, and published it on the Google Play Store without any hassle. Since then, I’ve also published Twistago, Rocket Mail, Bigcanvas, Radio Nul and Papageno. With each next app, the bar for publishing kept getting higher. At some point, Google started publishing developers’ full company address on the store alongside the app. That’s fine for a professional company, but quite problematic for a solo indie developer who works from home, especially if the app or the developer is even remotely controversial. I worked around it at the time by just putting the name of the town instead of the full address, which is only right morally, but not legally. The technical requirements also kept going up. To publish an update to an app, it has to target the latest API version, which goes up once or twice a year. Each API update comes with a slew of deprecations, and breaking changes to the already inscrutable build system. And even if you don’t want to update the app, Google will eventually start hiding apps from users if the app doesn’t target some minimum API version. This means you can’t just publish an app and leave it at that; it’s several days of work per app per year to keep up with the latest rug-pulls from Google. Again this is no problem for a company for whom the app is their core business, but bad news for indie and hobbyist developers who just want to make something cool, put it out there, and move on to the next project. And then, there’s the latest increase in publishing requirements, the straw that broke the camel’s back, which made me decide to abandon the Google Play Store altogether. The new rules The original announcement just mentioned that organizations will need to provide a D-U-N-S number. It was possible to choose your own deadline, so I set it as far in the future as I could. Now that deadline, 5 November, is getting close, and I can start the verification process. The email, however, makes it clear that they want much more than a D-U-N-S number: What you need to provide to verify a D-U-N-S number for your organization If you don’t have a D-U-N-S number, request one at no cost from Dun & Bradstreet now. This process can take up to 30 days, so we recommend requesting a D-U-N-S number immediately. Learn more about requesting a D-U-N-S number a phone number and email address for Google Play users to contact you a phone number and email address for Google to contact you an official document to verify your identity an official document to verify your organization There is only one of these items that I don’t have a problem with. The D-U-N-S number is only needed if your Play Store publisher account is for an organization, not an individual. But I’m registered as a sole proprietor, so the rule applies to me. You can look up your company’s D-U-N-S number, but the form doesn’t (currently?) allow selecting any country except the US. Dun & Bradstreet’s partner in the Netherlands, Altares, does allow me to look up my own company, but charges 15 € for the privilege of seeing my own data, including my own D-U-N-S number, which they’ve apparently already assigned when I registered with the Chamber of Commerce. If I didn’t already have one, I don’t see a way on their website to request one either, even though the FAQ mentions that you can (for a fee, of course). While that may be just some paperwork and a small expense, the next requirement is more insidious: “a phone number and email address for Google Play users to contact you”. I’m fine showing an email address, but I absolutely do not want my phone number to be available to anyone on the internet. (Even for phone calls. But remember that a phone number is used for much more than phone calls these days.) And that’s just me, a privileged hetero white cis dude who is unlikely to be the target of harassment or doxxing. The requirement “a phone number and email address for Google to contact you” is the only one that sounds benign to me, although I have yet to see Google trying to contact small-fry developers like me by phone, instead of just reaching for the algorithmic ban hammer if I cross any line. An “official document to verify your identity” would presumably be a scan or photo of my passport. Now, I have reasonable confidence in the security of Google’s systems, but this is something very sensitive and can easily be abused if it fell into the wrong hands. And why is it necessary? I’ve done business with many other companies, where a lot more money was changing hands than I’m getting from my Play Store apps, but they never asked for my passport. Why does Google? Those other companies also never asked for “an official document to verify your organization”. Presumably this is a document I can request from the Chamber of Commerce to the tune of another 9 €, but again I’ve never had another company ask for this when doing business with them. In conclusion I sort of understand why Google is doing all this. It’s partly legal requirements (especially EU), partly an attempt to reduce spam and malicious stuff. Some of it might even be in the best interest of the end user. Larger companies have the resources to deal with all this, and for personal accounts the rules are much more lenient. Sadly, there has been little consideration for sole proprietorships like mine, which fall somewhere in between: bound by the same rules as big companies, but without the means to play by them. And this is why I’m just going to let my Play Store developer account expire. Starting on 5 November, you won’t be able to install any of my apps anymore. Most of them were not actively maintained anymore, but they still worked, because the Android operating system itself is actually pretty good at backwards compatibility. Even though there was little remaining interest in my older apps, it makes me sad that people won’t be able to use them anymore. The one I’m most sad about, though, is Papageno, an unfinished side project about bird sounds that I haven’t worked on for three years, but keeps popping into my mind as something I’d really like to finish some day. Maybe it could be in the form of a web app. We’ll see. ◂ Back to latest posts ▾ Previous: Around The World, Part 19: Constructing languages",

Many features cannot be preserved. They could preserve some features, but doing so would result in some weird 50% support for old APIs, which wouldn't be great either.

Yes. When any API is used for the first time, pop up a toast saying \"this legacy app is trying to use File Access permissions. [Allow access to whole device] / [ Restrict to apps own files ]\". If the user hits 'allow', grant the legacy API. If the user hits 'restrict', give a fake filesystem. The dialogue box should be provided by the OS, and if the threading model doesn't allow pausing the app to wait for user interaction, simply kill the app to ask the question, and restart it with the permission. reply parl_match 10 hours agorootparentExcept that legacy app owners regularly get offered money by bad actors, to purchase the apps and take over. Which means that anyone who \"Allow access to whole device\" suddenly gets a malicious update that cryptolocks them or steals their files. Real scenario, real problem, semi-common attack vector. Enough that it's a serious problem for Google. reply alexey-salmin 10 hours agorootparentYou don't have to give access to whole device.

If the new API can give a sensible way to restrict file access without too many prompts, then the old-over-new API layer can do exactly the same. reply growse 7 hours agorootparentHow can the new API know this? You've got an old app that uses an API that assumes full access to the device. A new API that restricts that access _cannot_ just guess what the app actually needs / uses - the only sane thing to do is to ask the user what the app actually needs. The problem there is that the user is not incentivised to precisely curate the permissions boundary of the app, they're incentivised to _make the damn popup go away_. This stuff is highly non-trivial. reply alexey-salmin 7 hours agorootparent> You've got an old app that uses an API that assumes full access to the device. A new API that restricts that access _cannot_ just guess what the app actually needs / uses - the only sane thing to do is to ask the user what the app actually needs. No. It knows which actual paths the app tries to access. They can be grouped into exactly the same permission bundles (access to camera images, access to downloads etc) which are used for newer apps. Then presented to the user for approval, like they are with newer apps. The only difference is, you may not get all permission popups at once -- but that's already the case with many newer apps. They only ask for permissions to e.g use camera when you actually need it. And I like it so much better than the old approach when the apps would refuse to run without camera even though I don't need this particular feature. > The problem there is that the user is not incentivised to precisely curate the permissions boundary of the app, they're incentivised to _make the damn popup go away_. Right, and exactly the same problem applies to new apps natively built against the new API. The app can request unreasonably wide permissions and the user will make the damn popup go away. It's not relevant to the problem of maintenance of old apps. reply out_of_protocol 3 hours agorootparentprevExcept tou can't upload new app version targeting old API version reply exe34 8 hours agorootparentprevupdates have to use the new api. boom. reply dietr1ch 10 hours agorootparentprevBut will implementing this secure you a promo?

From the app's perspective, nothing has changed. It gets a handle to a directory and can list files in it. Whether that directory contains 1 or 10000 items makes no difference. Just to be clear: I don't disagree with you. I think it's completely normal to have APIs be deprecated, and this means eventually your app will break and be removed from the store. I just don't think this specific example was entirely justified. reply ristos 11 hours agorootparentDeprecating an API doesn't mean you have to break work already done.

I suppose that does include code that could be described as emulators for every single version of Windows, but it's less work because Microsoft, for their many other faults, preserves backwards compatibility so old APIs tend to just keep working. reply ristos 11 hours agorootparentprevWould you need every single version of Android? or just a much thinner compatibility layer for deprecated APIs?

Connected it to my iphone and that was it. My relative had an android though. No playstore option. Downloaded the apk from their site, launched it. Access to your location? Photos? File system? Wifi networks? Etc? ETC? E.T.C.? The thing is, it asks it every time you tap “connect” or “on” despite everything being disabled in settings. And of course it doesn’t work without permissions (bluetooth was on). Idk which are critical because none of them are acceptable. That’s basically my average experience with apks.

However, i still prefer that over the closed garden. reply wruza 10 hours agorootparentthey didn't try to invade your privacy in iphone land at all (since an app review might scrutinize it). Exactly. I prefer my lights to not know my location and photos, and to not even ask for it. With the fall of apple scrutiny, almost everything will work as described above. Cause it demonstrably does when allowed. The problem isn't android itself Android could (1) disallow repeating permissions popups, (2) feed empty or arbitrary data to apks because of the nature of their “habitat”. F-droid and other non-standard firmware is incompatible with banks, other apps and hardware, so this is out of question. an open system is more vulnerable to being abused. However, i still prefer that over the closed garden. I respect your preference. In my case I should explain the situation to my relative and suggest to choose between the two approaches. But I don’t see mutual respect when reading happy celebrations about destroying the protective garden. Not a thing in our conversation, but I hear it often and dread the results, where there will be nothing to choose from. reply noirscape 10 hours agorootparentF-Droid isn't \"non-standard firmware\", it's just an app store like the Play Store is and can in fact exist alongside the Play Store just fine. You don't need to do any fancy trickery to get it working (download APK from their site, install and that's it) and rather notably, due to (good!) changes by Google to comply with EU law, is basically an indistinguishable installation experience from the Play Store when it comes to updates. As for faking empty/arbitrary data: this is a thing in Android, and has been a thing for several versions now. The unfortunate problem is that for reasons that I'm sure aren't tied to the big G's economic interests, the UI around \"granted but not really\" is complete dogwater (it's basically only functional for the gallery permission these days). You can use something like appops[0] to forcibly override these permissions options, but it really should be made more user friendly. I think the main problem with the closed garden is that it expects Apple to be a fair and unbiased steward of their ecosystem, when it's been proven over and over again that they absolutely aren't. They allowed the app store to be flooded with ad-riddled junk, allow for paid search results that make it harder for people to install government apps[1], press smaller app devs into adding more payment schemes and even on the most basic level demand a continuous resource drain with their licensing schemes that ensures that \"just make a good app and sell it once\" is eventually an unsustainable business model. And that's just the stuff that ends up hurting the customer; the dev experience from what I've been told is even more miserable. This isn't to defend Android as being superior (the Play Store also has many of these issues), but at least with Android I can substitute the Play Store for F-Droid when it comes to non-government and non-banking apps. F-Droid at least ensures that I don't wake up one morning to realize that I have to plan a full week of support for relatives because an app decided to start milking it's userbase for money and ruin the experience; when Simple Mobile Tools went to shit, I was able to just spread that stuff out over a couple weeks at my own pace since F-Droid never shipped that version. (And it helped the fork get off the ground too.) [0]: https://appops.rikka.app [1]: Probably one of the most frequent requests I got when I did tech stuff for the elderly was just \"help me set up the government app to see [some service they were using]\"; invariably the App Store would push some healthcare insurance nonsense or other vaguely related thing as the first result, which confused the hell out of them. It's unacceptable and I don't get where the \"my low-tech relatives like it\" idea comes from. reply wruza 6 hours agorootparentOh, I confused f-droid with some firmware I’ve read about then. Yes, I understand development issues for apple, but at the same time the end result is my lamp - works on iphone - sort of does work on android iff I accept the unacceptable This is probably not a very “tech” case, but in my view it is pretty consumer-average, and it’s not the first app which does that (I had an android for a while).

For example, I live in Portugal. Setting up a one-person company (Unipessoal LDA) is fairly cheap and easy here, but you're still required to have a certified accountant with certified accounting software.

My software is essentially a digital asset manager, though with a bit of extra functionality and project management built-in. I don't see how a web app could efficiently index millions of files on the local file system. However, based on all the horror stories I've heard, I'm seriously thinking about re-considering my approach and settling for a different, simpler web-only product.

For a small business it's probably fine but for a solo dev it's really shit.

From experience, in the UK there are companies were you can outsource (at little cost) most of your admin stuff, and/or you can also mark them as the 'HQ' of your company, using their address instead of yours. I will go ahead and assume that everywhere in the civilized world similar companies exist. Also \"is only right morally, but not legally\" is very BS. These are the rules, take them or leave them. You can escalate, but not break them, otherwise if YOU pick which rules YOU want to break, then I will pick the rules that I want to break, and then it goes only downhill.

    "originBody": "Martin Broen Freelance writer The underwater caves of the Yucatán Peninsula are a window to the distant past. Through two million years and over multiple glaciation cycles, these caves have been transformed. When the sea level was high, the caves flooded, and their reach expanded. During the ice ages, the caves dried out as the sea level dropped, and the seeping water from the surface decorated the caverns with deposits such as stalagmites and stalactites, collectively known as speleothems. Then, with the next cycle came higher sea levels again, flooding the caves and preserving in time the speleothems and everything else with them. I have been diving the unique submerged landscapes of Mexican cenotes, or sinkholes, for almost ten years, exploring their dark, flooded tunnels and capturing their secrets. The last time the shallow caves on the Yucatán Peninsula flooded was around 8,000 years ago, which means that every diver in these caves travels back in time to a prehistoric age. The paleontological and archaeological remains preserved within them would disintegrate at the surface, which makes these caves a perfect time capsule. How Mexico’s cenotes came to be The lagoon-like entrance of an unnamed cenote stretches out near the Caribbean Sea. Martin Broen This underworld is formed by a massive underground aquifer in the northern Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico. It is accessible by cenotes that connect the surface of the Earth to the longest underground river systems in the world. Here, water doesn’t accumulate on the surface as rivers, but instead gets absorbed through the porous limestone to flow within underground tunnels. Much as our blood vessels send life-sustaining fluid throughout our bodies, these tunnels convey the precious water that sustains all life in this region. It is no wonder that cenotes were considered sacred by the Maya. The Maya established their civilization on the Yucatán Peninsula about 4,000 years ago. In order to thrive, they needed to settle close to a freshwater source. All of their largest settlements on the northern part of the peninsula—including the famed Chichén Itzá—were built beside cenotes. During the region’s dry season, cenotes were the only source of water; therefore, the sinkholes were not only a fundamental part of Maya life but also a place for worship and rituals related to rain, life, death and rebirth. Looking up from the depths of the Blue Abyss highlights this in-cave sinkhole's distinctive shape and azure tones. Martin Broen Each Maya d’zonot (the Maya word from which the word cenote comes from) was an entrance to the mystical underworld called Xibalba, where various deities and supernatural beings resided. It is a mysterious and powerful realm associated with death, a portal to a domain where ritualistic offerings honored both the gods and the deceased and sought protection and guidance for the living. Living within, and the protector of this underworld, was Chaac, the god of rain, fertility and agriculture. He was an important deity in Maya mythology, as rain was vital for the success of crops and the well-being of the community. Beneath the cenotes, deeper in their caves, artifacts and human remains from the Maya civilization have lain undisturbed for centuries and can be seen by explorers. But these are not the only indicators of human presence. While the Maya settled the region only a few thousand years ago, evidence found in the cenotes points to human settlements in the area dating back more than 13,000 years. These finds challenge the accepted notion of when our ancestors first crossed into America via the Bering Land Bridge between Siberia and Alaska during the last ice age. Light in the Underworld: Diving the Mexican Cenotes An immersive journey into a natural wonder—the underwater caves and cenotes of Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula, a destination very few divers have ever reached. Buy These ancient hunter-gatherers also depended on the cenotes as a water source, and probably for shelter as well. Back then, the cenotes were much drier, with the water level some 300 feet below current-day levels. The ancient inhabitants had to venture deep into the caves to access the water, crossing paths with huge prehistoric animals from the late Pleistocene—now long extinct—that also sought fresh water. Finding Maya artifacts and human remains A skull of a high-ranking Maya features an intentionally deformed forehead bone and front teeth carved to hold decorations. Martin Broen It’s challenging to put into words the raw and profound sensation that accompanies encountering a human skull in the darkness of the flooded caves. Long before I recognize a skull as mere remains, I can feel its gaze upon me from the shadows, a haunting presence that defies description. Particularly in the area of the Ring of Cenotes, many sacrificial cenotes hold skulls of the higher-ranking Maya families. Along with modified front teeth to host ornaments, these skulls were artificially deformed to create a physical distinction. The higher-ranking Maya used different techniques to shape their children’s skulls, creating an oblique deformation, which made their heads look longer than the average Maya’s. Said to resemble a jaguar’s head, this shape was a symbol of power. Also rare sightings for cave explorers are sophisticated Maya paintings on cave walls close to the entrances of cenotes. Depicting wars, animals, gods and stories, these treasures can be forever lost once submerged, washed away over time. Long before the Maya settled in the area, the first Homo sapiens crossed into America over the Bering Land Bridge at least 25,000 years ago. They made their way down to South America and arrived on the Yucatán Peninsula at the end of the last ice age around 13,000 years ago. There they used the caves to extract water and minerals, to find shelter, and to bury their dead. While it is typically hard to find remains of these hunter-gatherers on the surface of the Earth, evidence of early human presence was preserved in these caves from before the last time the caves flooded. That evidence gives us clues to understanding early humans’ biology and even their social interactions. Within the flooded caves it is common to see purposely broken formations that create passages through the tunnels, and even cairns—made of piles of rocks or broken speleothems—placed at the junctions of tunnels to navigate the intricate cave labyrinths. Early humans also excavated rocks and mined red ocher using only Stone Age tools and their mastery of fire. They used the ocher to decorate objects for personal ornamentation and burials. They also decorated the caves with multiple art forms, from paintings on the walls to sculptures. A well-known example is the figure of a woman at the entrance of Cenote Dos Ojos; while it was not sculpted as such, it is a carefully selected speleothem that resembles the silhouette of a woman and was intentionally exhibited on a pedestal to decorate the cave entrance, evidence of paleoart from more than 8,000 years ago that anyone can visit. Maya remains preserved within flooded caves are a haunting reminder of this ancient civilization. Martin Broen Diving for fossil evidence of extinct megafauna As if they were corridors of a museum, the submerged passageways of these time capsules also offer divers the opportunity to uncover exquisitely preserved fossils of diverse creatures—most of which are now extinct—that once inhabited the Yucatán during the late Pleistocene. Following the cataclysmic impact of the Chicxulub asteroid 66 million years ago, which marked the end of the dinosaur age, mammals began to dominate the lands once ruled by dinosaurs. Over time, North and South America underwent distinct evolutionary trajectories. However, around 2.7 million years ago, the formation of the Panamanian land bridge facilitated a pivotal event: the Great American Biotic Interchange. During this exchange, North American fauna migrated southward, including large mammals called megafauna, like saber-toothed cats, lions, gomphotheres (related to modern elephants), horses and camels. Meanwhile, South American megafauna moved northward, including giant ground sloths and glyptodonts (enormous armadillos). This monumental event significantly influenced and sculpted the ecosystems and biodiversity of both continents, affecting the composition of species and ecosystems we see today. A fossilized shell of a loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) may mark where it perished in the cave 200,000 years ago. Martin Broen The thrill of exploring the underwater caves of the Yucatán is heightened upon uncovering the fossilized remains of these long-extinct megafauna. Visualizing these colossal creatures coming to life right where you are diving, in what was once a prehistoric cave that had been frozen in time by these waters, is like being teleported back to their era, immersed in a thrilling journey through time. How their fossils came to be submerged underwater can be easily imagined. With the water level during the last ice age up to 300 feet lower than it is today, these animals had to venture down dark, dry cave passages to reach drinking water, sometimes surprisingly far away from an entrance. Trapped in sinkholes or lost within labyrinthine passages, these animals died, and their remains became fossilized and preserved by rising water levels. Among the many extinct species that lived in this region are members of the family Megalonychidae (including the genus Megalonyx, Greek for “large claw”). Fossils of these giant ground sloths are commonly found in the caves, as they probably took refuge within them, such as members of the genus Xibalbaonyx (“great claw of Xibalba”), a polar bear-sized ground sloth with big claws that measured up to 12 feet in height and weighed nearly a ton. They are joined by members of related families, including the genus Nothrotheriops, a grizzly bear-sized mammal that reached five feet tall and weighed 1,000 pounds. Representing archaeological and paleontological marvels, the fossils concealed within the caves constitute genuine treasures, allowing for teams of specialized scientists to explore these wonders, aiming to unravel scientific enigmas, construct hypotheses and shed light on the mysteries that shroud our planet’s history. Green from concentrated tannic acid in the water gives an otherworldly hue to tunnels close to Cenote Hatzutz Aktun. Martin Broen Many more mysteries to be solved There’s a symbiotic relationship between the passionate and technical cave explorers who investigate every hole in a cave in their free time (and just for fun) and those in the scientific community who want to study these prehistoric materials but cannot reach where they’re hidden in the underwater darkness. This relationship of discovery and research has already provided evidence of many newly discovered extinct species, as well as ancient humans who had vanished for millennia, a relationship that could be fostered even more by leveraging the world-class level of the dive explorers in the area. After all, the majority of these secrets remain yet to be discovered! The caves also hold evidence that could solve a prehistoric murder mystery. After the Great American Biotic Interchange, these megafauna species coexisted in this region for hundreds of thousands of years and through multiple ice age cycles, until their abrupt extinction more than 10,000 years ago when a new species arrived on the Yucatán Peninsula: Homo sapiens. After humans arrived in the region, many genera of large mammals became extinct. There are different ways to explain this mass extinction event. One leading hypothesis states that the already reduced populations of those animals, stressed due to the changing climate after the latest ice age, were hunted to extinction by the humans. These big mammals, which needed a long time to become sexually mature and had slow reproduction rates (up to 22 months), were particularly vulnerable to this new threat. The narrow entrance of Cenote Corral focuses the pulsing light beams. Martin Broen Among the fossils preserved within the flooded caves, I have witnessed many examples indicating that these extinct species had been hunted and eaten by our predecessors, such as preserved megafauna bones exhibiting cut marks from human-made stone tools, the repetitive marks showing the methodical action taken to remove flesh from the bone. Also noted are perforations on fossilized bones inflicted by projectiles, extinct animal remains beside cooking pits with bones in them, organized piles of bones, and burn marks on animal fossils inside the cave. Indications such as these have been found at cave depths that correspond to the time horizon when humans and the now-extinct animals coexisted and within areas that also exhibit indications of the kind of sophisticated social organization required for early humans to hunt these big creatures, like the mining of red ocher. The hypothesis of the Paleo-Americans overhunting these species to extinction still needs to be validated, but it is undeniable that these caves protect invaluable material for scientists to study, information that will help us understand our past—and hopefully inform our future.

The lack of cavers in general is becoming a bigger and bigger problem in archaeology and paleoanthropology. Since a lot of archaic human species were quite a bit smaller, they managed to make very elaborate caves their home that are hard for the average adult to navigate. Underwater archaeology is still in its infancy so the training isn't explicitly part of anyone's education. Last year there was a story [1] on the front page about research into Homo naledi in the Rising Star Cave [2] that was only made possible because they were able to find six petite paleoanthropologists cavers who were able to fit through a \"vertically oriented 'chimney' or 'chute' measuring 12 m (39 ft) long with an average width of 20 cm (7.9 in)\" to the Dinaledi room in the back of the cave. They found 1,500 human bones there and still have a lot left to excavate.

Cave diving requires extensive training and is very dangerous. In cavern diving you stay within the naturally illuminated part of the cave and, while there might be something overhead of you at periods, you're not functionally farther from a safe exit than you would be at 130ft depth with no overhead. Of course any overhead obstruction is an added risk but that situation happens in regular recreational diving too. It wouldn't surprise me to hear that some tour operators bend the guidelines but the diving I did there felt appropriately careful. reply technothrasher 18 hours agorootparentprevA friend of mine made a bunch of films about his cenote diving.

Approximately every other paleoanthropologist is extremely skeptical of this and also constantly mad him for other things like putting preprints on bioRxiv, having too many TV shows, going to space with fossils, etc. On the other hand, every paleoanthropologist except him seems to run on a system where they never reveal any discoveries or share their work with anyone and take 30 years to write up what they have found in case someone steals their dig sites.

Being able to integrate both fullcalendar and a wysiwyg editor easily is definitely a headstart and something that is a point of friction with most of these component libraries! I can't use it yet, since the docs are still missing the part about using this with svelte, but good to know you are working on that. reply devsoul 11 hours agoparentThank you for the feedback! I'm glad to hear that you found the inclusion of third-party plugins helpful. We understand that seamless integration is often a point of friction, so we've made it a priority to simplify that process. That's the reason we have said \"Easiest Tailwind CSS Components Library\" reply gammacine 10 hours agorootparentDoes this work with tailwind visual editors like this https://windframe.dev ? reply agos 4 hours agoprevI went to see the Select component which is something that I always do to see how component libraries tackle complexity, and was surprised (and a bit horrified) to see that components are configured by writing html inside json inside data attributes. This is going to be a pain to use: strings have to be escaped, no assistance from the editor whatsoever, all crammed inside an attribute... reply olivermuty 1 hour agoparentI see none of this in any of the Select examples. Mind sharing what you mean? reply noahjk 53 minutes agorootparentTake a look at Advanced Select. I think that’s the one he was referring to. reply fmnxl 11 hours agoprevIsn't this just a thin wrapper of Preline? Why use this instead of Preline? reply ajaypatel9016 8 hours agoparentHello fmnxl, Those are nice questions and we asked the same ourselves twice before we started working on this http://flyonui.com/. Preline is a great library with its beauty. It uses Tailwind CSS utility clasess may lead to cluttered HTML with numerous utility classes, which can be a nightmare to maintain. Where DaisyUI is the most popular component library for Tailwind CSS, offering a wide range of components with semantic class names. However many projects require interactive features that need JavaScript. This is where FlyonUI shines. FlyonUI builds on top of DaisyUI by integrating Preline’s JS plugins, offering headless, fully unstyled components that are accessible and responsive. reply fermigier 9 hours agoprevI'm worried about the license. Flyon contains code from Preline which is \"dual licensed\" under the MIT license and a proprietary \"fair\" license. > Preline UI is free for both personal and commercial projects, released under dual license terms \"MIT\" and \"Preline UI Fair Use License\". See: https://preline.co/docs/license.html They don't explain if \"dual license\" means \"and\" or \"or\". I suspect \"and\", because otherwise, it wouldn't make sense since MIT is one of the less restrictive open source licenses. If it's the case, neither Flyon nor Preline are open source. reply ajaypatel9016 9 hours agoparentHello Fermigier, Thank you for sharing your input. You’re correct that Preline has a dual license (MIT) allowing usage for both personal and commercial projects. We've confirmed with Preline and they have implemented this license just to restrict those who utilize their code without proper attribution. FlyonUI utilizes the Preline JS plugins to enhance the functionality of its semantic components. As a result, it also adheres to the same licenses. For more details, please visit: https://flyonui.com/docs/getting-started/license/ reply gr4vityWall 3 hours agoprevThe components seem to work well and look good, but regarding its use of colors, it seems to have the same issues as DaisyUI. Lots of components have very low contrast between the inner text and the background color. Even in the front page, we can see a button with black test on top of dark grey background. Unfortunately, that's a blocker if you're building simple B2B admin panels and don't want to spend too much time tweaking your theme to make it accessible. reply atilimcetin 12 hours agoprevLooks great! Can you also consider supporting svelte[1] (and sveltekit[2]) officialy? [1] https://svelte.dev [2] https://kit.svelte.dev reply devsoul 11 hours agoparentYes, if Daisy UI provides support to Svelte, we will surely go for it. reply rizzaxc 10 hours agorootparentI'm tempted to try this in my SvelteKit app. What do I lose compared to a React user? reply husarcik 9 hours agorootparentBigger ecosystem for react.

Which indeed needs to be correct. reply icar 3 hours agoprevI was hoping to find a contender for DaisyUI, but some of these components require JS. I wish there were more Tailwind component libraries that required 0 JS. reply TheSecondMouse 7 hours agoprevI have a Daisy UI project (Sveltekit), that also integrates svelte-shadcn, as Flyon Ui uses Daisy Ui, would I no longer need to add Daisy as an import? Do I have full access to the Daisy Ui toolset? Can they be run side by side?

But many projects require interactive features that need JavaScript. FlyonUI builds on top of DaisyUI by integrating Preline’s JS plugins, offering headless, fully unstyled components that are accessible and responsive. Headless Architecture: FlyonUI’s headless architecture allows developers to focus on functionality, providing greater flexibility when integrating components into any UI framework or design system. Broader Component Set: FlyonUI extends the component offering, with both UI elements and functional components that handle interactive behaviors like accordion, overlay, dropdowns, and carousels, etc. Third-Party Component Support: FlyonUI provides built-in support for popular third-party libraries like ApexCharts, FullCalendar, Flatpickr, and Toast, etc. This allows developers to extend their UIs with advanced features. For more details refer: https://flyonui.com/docs/getting-started/introduction/ reply welder 11 hours agoparentprevI really dislike daisy's default colors and changing them is a PITA reply wg0 10 hours agorootparentMaybe it's just me but these \"modern\" UI kits such as Daisy and Skeleton have horrible UI color schemes, themse and aesthetics. reply hombre_fatal 12 hours agoprevThe two interactive clusters of component examples on the homepage are really amazing and well thought out. How'd you come up with the idea of having them cascade down from the right side of the webpage above the fold? Never seen that before. The docs have some serious attention to detail. reply devsoul 11 hours agoparentA huge thanks to our talented design team for their exceptional work and dedication! Their creativity and attention to detail have truly elevated the project reply kewp 10 hours agoprevTried to put it into my svelte project. Build failed. Went onto github to report it. A reproduction url is required ... so not submitting a bug ... and looking for something else to use ... reply ajaypatel9016 8 hours agoparentHello kewp, We appreciate your feedback. Honestly, we've just shipped our first release and we will be creating guides for the framework integration soon. https://flyonui.com/docs/getting-started/framework-guides/ However, you can mention localhost in the URL if you're trying on the local machine or you can share stackblitz URL with setup which you have tried. reply seanwilson 12 hours agoprevLooks great, but for dark/Gourmet, the purple primary color and others like accent and success are too dark and don't contrast well for me. The purple fails WCAG contrast checks from a quick look. reply devsoul 11 hours agoparentThanks for the appreciation & suggestion. We will look into it. reply sgt 11 hours agoprevLooks great. I've just been using TailwindUI (commercial) and creating components as I see fit. I base it off the HTML templates only. reply devsoul 11 hours agoparentThanks for the appreciation. reply faloppad 12 hours agoprevLooks great and quite complete reply devsoul 11 hours agoparentThanks for the appreciation. reply ShanAIDev 8 hours agoprevbeautiful work, This looks like an interesting project that aims to combine the power of utility classes with semantic components. I'm curious if FlyonUI is currently limited to Next.js, or if it can be used with other frontend frameworks like Nuxt.js as well? reply icemelt8 12 hours agoprevbeautiful work, can't imagine the hours that went into it reply devsoul 11 hours agoparent8 months actually...!! But worth it. The appreciation and love it is getting already, the efforts are paid off. Thanks a lot for your appreciation. reply 1-2-3-5-8 12 hours agoprevExcellent effort and thanks in advance for publishing this. reply devsoul 11 hours agoparentYou are welcome. Thanks for the appreciation. reply welder 11 hours agoprevThe landscape is very crowded. For example, I've tried all of these: - https://ui.shadcn.com/ * - https://daisyui.com/ - https://www.ripple-ui.com/ - https://flowbite.com/ - https://tailblocks.cc/ - https://headlessui.com/ * Finally settled on this one because I can edit the components easily if needed. It's basically a code generator not a component library. I'm already set on shadcn, but still have to ask what this one does better/different? reply phforms 10 hours agoparentI love the approach of shadcn and the fact that they use Radix primitives, which have a focus on accessibility. But I wish they would have a pure CSS option without tailwind style classes. It took me some time to translate the classes shadcn uses from tailwind to CSS (which sometimes require more research) and the variables for colors, sizes, etc. into the CSS-to-js system I use (which is stitches - yes, its deprecated, but still the best one I know). Tailwind is nice for prototyping and simple projects, but often I find that it obscures things too much and when I need more control over the CSS it is too abstract and awkward to use. reply worble 9 hours agorootparent>Tailwind is nice for prototyping and simple projects That's interesting because I find it quite the opposite, if all I'm doing is a quick prototype then the last thing I want to do is spend hours creating a ton of components with tailwind! I've often gotten extremely frustrated that it completely nukes basic browser styles when all I'm trying to see what it'd look like if I had some text, a form and maybe a picture on the page. reply sireat 6 hours agoparentprevExcellent list but some apples and some oranges up there. Shadcn looks quite nice, but I wish they mentioned that it is React only (as far as I can tell). Some of the above support Vue and React. Some of the above actually seem to be actual CSS libraries on top of Tailwind without any dependencies on Javascript frameworks which personally seems more sane. For past few years I've been teaching introductory Web Dev course at a university and students do pretty well with HTML,CSS and vanilla Javascript. They pick up on plain CSS libraries easily. They understand the need for Javascript frameworks. However, when it comes to insanity that is complexity of Javascript based build systems, it is beyond my abilities to transfer that knowledge. It becomes just a magical bundle of commands lost in the sea of abstraction. reply Terretta 3 hours agorootparent> Shadcn looks quite nice, but I wish they mentioned that it is React only (as far as I can tell). https://www.shadcn-svelte.com https://www.shadcn-vue.com https://github.com/birobirobiro/awesome-shadcn-ui reply ajaypatel9016 8 hours agoparentprevHello welder, Thanks for sharing your thoughts. Obviously, shadcn is the best library. FlyonUI is designed to combine the best of both worlds: the aesthetic appeal of semantic classes and the powerful functionality of JS plugins. Why should I use FlyonUI? Using Tailwind CSS alone may lead to cluttered HTML with numerous utility classes, which can be a nightmare to maintain. Apart from that Tailwind CSS or DaisyUI doesn’t provide any interactive headless JavaScript components like accordion, overlay, dropdowns, etc… This is where FlyonUI shines. FlyonUI brings together the beauty of semantic classes and the interactive headless JavaScript plugins, offering you a powerful toolkit to build stunning, interactive user interfaces with ease. reply makingstuffs 10 hours agoparentprevIt was ShadCN which convinced me that there is a lot of utility in Tailwind TBH. Absolutely love the whole 'just copy the component to my repo' concept. Plate JS follows the same and uses the same components but is a WYSIWYG editor: https://platejs.org/ reply whazor 11 hours agoparentprevIt would be nice if shadcn became the standard and you could copy components from any tailwind component library. Technically, this would mean that all these component libraries allow you to copy-paste their components, and additionally there would be a 'standard' in theme token naming. reply wg0 10 hours agorootparentIt could also be nice if it were pure HTML instead of React. reply crucialfelix 10 hours agorootparentMany of the components in shadcn are implemented with radix components which have the js functionality. I too have been wanting html versions of some simple non functional ones for use in Django. Daisy UI is great because it just makes custom classes using tailwind @apply so you can use them in react or server side html. reply whazor 9 hours agorootparentprevThese components are interactive, but you can copy them to HTML by inspecting them via your browser. reply spiderfarmer 11 hours agoparentprevFor the AlpineJS / Livewire fans: - https://wireui.dev - https://fluxui.dev - https://www.penguinui.com reply Saanvi001 9 hours agoparentprevIn Shadcn you will have to style the components manually while Flyon UI provides styled-components. You will get Semantic classes as well. reply theyknowitsxmas 7 hours agoparentprevToday I learned about shadcn, thanks. reply littlestymaar 11 hours agoprevI don't understand the fascination for tools like Tailwind (or bootstrap before that). Sure when your doing very basic things it sounds cool to be able to use just a simple class to get a cool style, but then when used in hanger you end up with a list of class like this `fixed flex items-center w-full max-w-xs p-4 space-x-4 text-gray-500 bg-white divide-x rtl:divide-x-reverse divide-gray-200 rounded-lg shadow top-5 right-5 dark:text-gray-400 dark:divide-gray-700 dark:bg-gray-800\"` [1] and then I really don't understand what you've gained compared to using CSS directly… [1]: this class is taken from a flowbite component I've worked with no latter than yesterday. https://flowbite.com/docs/components/toast/#simple-toast reply mjAxi0m 9 hours agoparentI really agree on that one. Being able to define SOME (and I insist on that point) style directly in HTML is super convenient and can be a huge time saver day by day. But I think Tailwind went too far by trying to entirely replace CSS with countless classes and shortcuts. Just imagine the learning curve and the time spent by devs trying to find the right syntax for a specific transition or such... I like the approach of tools like Perseid (https://perseid.dev/docs/ui/styling/classes), focusing only on layout design and providing a small set of built-in CSS classes (alignments, positions, margins, dimensions, …) for that purpose. All the rest (colors, shadows, fonts, animations and such) lying in good old CSS declarations. reply input_sh 10 hours agoparentprevThis is like a backend developer asking someone using a spreadsheet why don't they just build their own database. Or a sysadmin telling you why don't you just run your own Kubernetes cluster. Unless there's like a 10 person team working on the same thing, you gotta take shortcuts somewhere. Not here to argue that learning CSS properly isn't better, but I legit have no interest in doing so. I can copy-paste that code and be sure it'll look exactly the same on my website. I can't do the same with CSS. reply wildrhythms 8 hours agorootparentTo be clear, you have to 'learn CSS properly' to make sense of Tailwind. I don't see how someone can not know CSS, but know Tailwind. Tailwind is just atomic classes for the underlying CSS styles. reply gr4vityWall 3 hours agorootparent> I don't see how someone can not know CSS, but know Tailwind. I've met a fair amount of devs (specially younger,classes.filter(Boolean).join(\" \"); Using the tw function, your example classes would look something like this: class={tw( \"fixed top-5 right-5 w-full max-w-xs p-4\", \"flex items-center space-x-4 divide-x divide-gray-200 rtl:divide-x-reverse dark:divide-gray-700\", \"rounded-lg shadow\", \"bg-white text-gray-500 dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-gray-400\" )} I like splitting the classes into logical groups. In this case, I’m grouping by: 1) base positioning, 2) flex behavior, 3) effects, and 4) colors. Finally, the filter in the tw function allows for easy conditional classes: class={tw(kind === \"something\" && \"m-4 p-4\")} I also use Biome, which has a work-in-progress but already quite good class sorter for Tailwind [1]. This keeps the code tidy by applying a logical sort order to each string passed into the tw function. -- 1: https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/1362 reply ajaypatel9016 8 hours agoparentprevHello littlestymaar, Thanks for sharing your thoughts. To deal with the huge number of class lists like this `fixed flex items-center w-full max-w-xs p-4 space-x-4 text-gray-500 bg-white divide-x rtl:divide-x-reverse divide-gray-200 rounded-lg shadow top-5 right-5 dark:text-gray-400 dark:divide-gray-700 dark:bg-gray-800\"` [1] We've created Flyon UI, to combine the best of both worlds: the aesthetic appeal of semantic classes and the powerful functionality of JS plugins. With FlyonUI you can achieve this with semantic classes like: btn btn-primary for more details: https://flyonui.com/docs/third-party-plugins/notyf/ reply littlestymaar 5 hours agorootparent> With FlyonUI you can achieve this with semantic classes like: > btn btn-primary That's obviously the better way, but then it's not Tailwind anymore. You're just using class and CSS directly. reply fmnxl 9 hours agoparentprevIt's more ergonomic than using stylesheets. - No external stylesheets. No need to think about optimising the serving of CSS assets (e.g. with CDN) - Co-locality: work on styling right where the element is, you don't have to figure out which stylesheet affects a particular element. - No naming headache, as there's no need to give class names to elements in order to style a particular (or set of) elements These days HTML is served compressed, with gzip/brotli, so long class attributes won't bloat the resulting file size by much. Stylesheets still has its place of course. reply jonwinstanley 10 hours agoparentprevA lot of people find tailwind easier to use because it cuts out the steps in CSS where you have to come up with all those names for elements/containers/wrappers etc and define the styles for them all. The big long lines of classes are often only written once anyway as web development usually makes use of components or partials for repeated elements. Obviously others can continue to use CSS if they prefer to do it that way. reply joseferben 9 hours agoparentprevyou've gained: - fine-grained design tokens (p-63 doesn't exist) - freedom from having to name things prematurely - not having to jump back and forth between index.html and styles.css reply littlestymaar 5 hours agorootparent> freedom from having to name things prematurely > not having to jump back and forth between index.html and styles.css Nobody prevents you to have your style directly in the HTML files (or in the JSX components, AKA CSS-in-js).

I might never be able to convince the person I am discussing with, but I might convince the audience. reply TZubiri 11 hours agoparentInteresting. In that case offering a submissive message may mollify the interlocutor in exchange for a response, but at the cost of signalling to other readers that their position is sensible. My grandma used to say that arguing something is the greatest concession. Consider A: -Earth is flat - it is not, earth is round - ya it is, john doe proved it - ok sorry for not understanding could you please explain what john doe said? Or B: - earth is flat - yo momma's butt is flat Yes B, loses the battle for the one mind, but when you consider the readers, you are simply avoiding platforming an idiot and playing a dumb strawman to boot. I guess it all comes down to whether you view the internet as the greek agora or the roman circus. All of this rational debate and usage of latin phrases for fallacies brings back memories of teenage years of online debating. I get that it's election time at the homeland and some people are campaigning, but you get more votes making a strawman of your opponent and making a thread viral than going one by one changing minds. Who here thinks twitter is a platform for rational discourse? Ha! reply niemandhier 8 hours agorootparentI see your point, on the other hand I see that people have been ridiculing and insulting alt-right content a for years and that method did not work. In the contrary, deplattforming, doxxing and all the things people came up with are now an integral part of the rights toolkit. Point is: when I talk to people on the street I get the impression Thant what most of them desire is just boring politics by upstanding people. Maybe it’s time to change the way we discuss. reply randomdata 3 hours agorootparent> Maybe it’s time to change the way we discuss. My takeaway from your comment is not so much that we need to change the way we discuss, but that we more regularly need to remind ourselves that computers and people are not the same thing. As you suggest, when people have discussions it usually goes well, with all parties more or less wanting \"boring\" discussion that goes somewhere meaningful. It is when people have discussions with computers but confuse them as being people when it all goes off the rails. reply TZubiri 34 minutes agorootparentare you a computer? reply randomdata 22 minutes agorootparentWhat do your eyes indicate? Do I look more like a person or more like a computer? reply m-i-l 8 hours agorootparentprev> Who here thinks twitter is a platform for rational discourse? That's the elephant in the room here. The site formerly known as Twitter is optimised to maximise engagement, and conflict typically generates much more engagement than co-operation. It'd be like trying to have a friendly discussion to work out your differences with your opponent in a boxing ring, surrounded by large crowd who have been whipped up by the venue into baying for a fight. I sometimes wonder if it is even possible to build a sustainable internet platform which somehow rewards cordial good faith discourse and penalises the mean and intolerant (and by sustainable I mean immune to the tendency for these platforms to eventually pivot to maximising profits above all else). reply cryptopian 5 hours agorootparentI've noticed that certain Twitter behaviours are popping up on Bluesky. It's being fought against by the early adopters, but fundamentally, the mechanics of a platform are going to massively influence how arguments happen. It still allows replies and quote-reposts to divorce a comment from its context. It's still global and public by default so users are always in performance mode. What it doesn't have yet, that Twitter does, is sorting of comments by engagement. That always had the effect of presenting responses to an argument with the most inflammatory takes first. reply karmonhardan 5 hours agorootparentprevReddit where upvotes are weighted by your similarity or difference to the target uploader or commenter. People who have different sentiments, identities, writing styles, etc. will boost your post faster than people who are similar. Downvotes count for less, in the same vein. Discourse approaches a mean of respectability and sentiment. A few years down the road, sell analysis of users' corpus as de facto background checks. Or Something something LinkedIn. I suppose both approaches have their own problems. reply tempodox 5 hours agorootparentprevI feel reminded of Mark Twain: “Never argue with an idiot.

When considered in its entirety? No. Not at all. Within the curated segment of Twitter I have established? Yes! It is probably the most rational place on the internet that I know of. Those within that curated circle seem to genuinely want to share information in a productive manner without the silly vitriol. That's the beauty of \"the algorithm\", I suppose. You can tune it to leave the garbage out. reply diggan 5 hours agoparentprev> I might never be able to convince the person I am discussing with, but I might convince the audience. Reading the comments around this blogpost here on in other places, I feel like I'm almost alone in not trying to convince anyone when I argue with strangers online (most of the times), neither the other person I'm discussing with, or others who might be reading. I mostly reply because there are unanswered questions that if answered, might teach me something new. Most of the times I'm just seeking understanding from both sides, not convincing the other. Do most people argue on the internet with strangers in order to convince others of something? If so, how does your success rate look like? I probably feel like aiming for that would be futile at best. reply specialist 3 hours agorootparentThere are many forms (styles) of discourse, no? Rhetoric, dialectic, sophistry, trolling, slap fights, agitprop.

Correia’s Law: \"Internet arguing is a spectator sport. You argue to convince the undecided and give ammo to those on your side. Do not expect to change your opponent’s mind as you cannot sway the willfully ignorant. Internet arguing is only worth it when there is an audience. The contestants do not get a vote, the audience decides who wins.\" reply s1artibartfast 1 hour agorootparenthowever, there are a lot of degenerate behaviors that stem from arguing for an audience opposed to the opponent. I dont think it is possible to have a debate in good faith without putting the opponent first. reply antisthenes 1 hour agorootparentprevIt's easy to see that in this case, if your audience is also willfully ignorant, you will end up in a downward spiral where you just try to destroy your opponent's credibility and reputation in a shouting match, regardless of what the factual reality is. You may have convinced the audience, but you ended up with a solution that doesn't work and is divorced from the real world.

This also applies to any _public_ offline argument, doesn't it? reply left-struck 12 hours agoprevSo much negativity in the comments. I think this concept of how to have a conversation on the internet, and how to understand someone’s point, and how to maybe even convince someone successfully is extremely important. Much more important than what ever is in vogue right now as the hot topic politically issues of today. I have a minor gripe though, there’s a contradiction in the writing. “ There’s a misconception that good faith discussion only happens in close-knit…” And then just a few paragraphs later “If you’re not willing to do this, then you’re not arguing in good faith in my book.“ but this is generally the default behaviour of people on the internet and the article is trying to convince you, and teach you how not to be like that. So I think indeed, good faith arguments pretty much don’t happen on the internet with rare exceptions. It’s not a misconception unless the misconception is taken as good faith arguments literally never happen except in close knit communities, but who believes that? reply 0xEF 9 hours agoparentBack in my Reddit days, I learned it was also hard to have an honest discussion because people are suspicious of your motives. I would comment something like \"I'd like to understand more about why you think X,\" and ask for clarification. These were met either with radio silence or very caged answers that just reiterated their point instead of explaining it further. IRL, people tend to become extremely guarded when someone questions their statements or beliefs (guilty, myself) because they automatically assume the person asking is trying to change their mind as opposed to make an effort to understand them. In the end, I think everyone just wants to feel heard. It's difficult to remember that sometimes online, easy to forget there is a person behind the keyboard who came to think differently because of their experiences and exposures. reply Izkata 4 hours agorootparent> because they automatically assume the person asking is trying to change their mind as opposed to make an effort to understand them. That's a pretty negative view of something I think is much simpler: Most people, on most topics, remember the conclusions (opinions) formed when learning about the topic, but either don't remember how they got there or only vaguely remember the details. reply jrochkind1 4 hours agoparentprevI think the author meant (but is I agree not saying it clearly in those quotes) that while good-faith arguments are rare, there's a misconception they can only happen in close-knit communities, but in fact if one party, you the reader, engages using the methods I discuss here, you can create many good-faith arguments on the general internet, not just in close-knit communities. reply DoctorOetker 8 hours agoparentprevGood faith discussions are happening all the time on the internet, in machine readable proofs for formal verifiers. reply raincole 12 hours agoprevThe first example is basically saying you have to insult yourself first to prevent the other side from insulting you further.

I bet even if KJ had responded with the author's way, axial would have still blocked them after several exchanges. Not true! I'm trying to collect \"success stories\" here because I've done this dozens of times, even with the most troll-like internet strangers. It's very consistent. Nobody believes that it generalizes. What I'm working on now is writing down these techniques so that people can empirically try it for themselves. I want people to challenge this, prove me wrong. Because the techniques get more robust with every challenge. https://github.com/DefenderOfBasic/in-good-faith-handbook/is... reply Teever 32 minutes agorootparentHave you thought about training a language model with these kinds of examples and then use a bot farm to win arguments? reply amadeuspagel 11 hours agoparentprevI see the first example as self-deprecating humor. reply TZubiri 11 hours agorootparentIt felt a bit two faced, like making fun of OP for being pretentious, but playing the fool so they won't notice reply DrammBA 4 hours agoparentprevI feel the same way, replying \"I'm too dumb!\" to being essentially asked \"Are you dumb?\" is not even having a discussion anymore The second example is just a guy moving the goalpost, he went from \"Where's the money?\" to \"Ok, that's where the money is, but are they using it?\", and then gets mad when someone answered with sources. But according to the author KJ completely misunderstood the goalposts. reply langsoul-com 8 hours agoprevThe question is whether it's worth the time. If you know someone face to face and plan to interact with them in the future. Then you must be able to continue conversing with them. So the time investment to have a decent conversation is necessary. Is online the same? It's possible to talk to someone new every time. Will this long process happen for each person? There's a reason why first impressions matter. Yes, someone who left a bad first impression could be a diamond in the rough. Except, why not just chat with the other diamonds instead? reply bubblyworld 7 hours agoparentI agree that it's important to filter your conversations on the internet (for that exact reason - it might be a waste of time for no gain), but I think this blog post is more about how to approach it once you've already decided to engage. Arguing in bad faith is a great way to guarantee you're going to waste your time and emotional energy, at least if you're genuinely interested in the topic. reply ericyd 6 hours agoprevI think the key point in this post is actually right at the end where the author states that their goal is always to understand the other person.

Your users don't have to pay if they want to have different profiles on different servers. Your users can use any interface they want to access the service... So you are right in a sense that discord replace IRC as a means of communication for the majority, but in term of freedom it is a regression.

If I repeated the exercise, there would be a third in line. Bad arguments take 1 unit of effort to generate and 1000 to refute. If you don't have a strategy for handling that asymmetry, you're toast, and the strategies for handling it do not involve kid gloves. Gish gallopers are gonna Gish gallop, and no amount of good faith is going to stop them if they don't want to stop.

As I've gotten older, I've come to realise that there are people (including offline, including close friends and/or family) with whom discussions simply turn into arguments ... and there's no logic that will prevail. Increasingly I set boundaries, both for myself, and with those others. I've also realised that some things don't need to be arguments. I'll state my terms, request, proposal, plans, whatever (and even that only if necessary or plausibly considerate), and if there's some antagonistic response ... I ignore it. If the person actively thwarts my doing something (often to help them, and why people get so combative about assistance I can't even begin to understand...), I'll simply lay down tools. \"You don't want me to do X ...\" or \"You're going to make it more unpleasant / inconvenient for me to do X ... then you can do it yourself.\" It's much easier to do this if you can walk (or otherwise) get away. A space you can control (walls, locking doors, or exit from location) helps tremendously. Some of this transfers to online discussion. Mostly I communicate to share my own knowledge/experience, or to try to understand others. Rarely to convince. Occasionally to refute or show the inherent paradox or inconsistency of a statement, though that's usually aimed at other readers.

It is INCREDIBLY frustrating and difficult to talk about this unless you are in some specific circles. The best analogy currently I have is between Individual recycling vs company scale environmental harm. Denialist arguments, misinformation campaigns - these are not conversations. These are campaigns. Someone wants to enact political change, influence the Overton window and drive votes or citizen behavior. It’s absurd - and any intervention to stop this, will be branded as censorship. Then the usual solutions get pulled out; fact-checking, more free speech. All of which buys more space for the malignant campaigns. Currently, misinformation research is specifically being targeted, which has incredible parallels to environmental research in the 80s/90s. You had cranks brought onto Fox and treated as experts. This created bills to thwart pro environment efforts. When scientists went onto Fox to debate, they were fed to the lions for spectacle. The facts of online ecosystems end up being loaded - misinfo campaigns focus mostly on right and conservative groups. This leads to emotional responses and dismissals from people who aren’t steeped in this nonsense. You get arguments of both sides, or solutions that assume equal levels of harm and exposure.

Those who have settled on some kind of final truth stop talking about it. Topics become boring once you are sure there is nothing left to be convinced of.

But rarely is a topic so simple that \"X is Y\"; \"no X is Z\" provides enough information to move someone forward towards establishing a final truth. Even if \"X is Z\" is a true statement, it almost always lacks necessary context to fully satisfy what the other is in need of. It is hard for us to understand where the other person is coming from. Furthermore, if you do end up truly convincing someone of something, the topic then becomes boring and they'll just stop engaging, so how do you even know whether the argument was 'productive' or if the other just ran out of free time?

Trying to boil this down to the quality of the faith is also a rather immature response. To frame things this way isn't to accept that there are different viewpoints other than your own, it's just to assert a claim that your viewpoints are correct, and that while other view points might exist, they are wrong. Your assessment of what is a good faith or what is a bad faith argument likely has little to do with the quality of the arguments involved, and instead will somehow miraculously align with your own world view at a rather implausible rate. If you want to argue with people in public, the only thing you should really be concerned about is stating your best case.

Such issues include fossil-fueled global warming, the efficacy of the latest patented FDA-approved pharmaceutical product, the role of virological gain-of-function research in the origins of the Covid pandemic, the necessity of government funding budgets for various purposes from public health to the provision of weapons to European and Middle Eastern conflicts, desirability of regulation of financial institutions (Glass-Steagall etc.), and possibly most relevant to HN, the wisdom of running Linux vs. Windows vs. Apple operating systems to meet your personal, business, and other computing needs.

The problem on social media I think is twofold: first, you often don't know where on that continuum things are because you might not know enough about who you are interacting with or why, and second, when you do know who you're interacting with, the public nature of the discussion incentivizes performative aims with regard to other possible readers, rather than working through some argument with you and the other person in particular. Any argument has some aim I think, and it's often implicit. It may be to achieve some aim that depends on the other person, or it may be to repair a relationship, or it might be to inflict some outcome in an organizational setting, it may be to work out something in your head, or it may be to convince bystanders of a position. Sometimes you end up with bots, sometimes you end up with PR people, sometimes you end up with highly politically motivated people, sometimes you end up with people who are trying to sell their own book or paper or whatever. You just don't know and even though I do think a lot of people — maybe most — are acting in very good faith, some of them are not, and it varies in degree. I also think social media systems are fundamentally broken at the moment, and ideally we should be moving to highly decentralized and/or federated platforms. That's a slightly different issue probably but maybe not — I think the subtle aims of platforms tend to trickle down into this too, and nudge different types of behaviors.

The system was effective enough to make it virtually impossible to know whether some random town in iirc Ohio got nuked, creating a q-anon cult around that. Then once the bots were released en mass by whoever wants to use them, the internet became indecipherable. Regarding this topic of people believing wrong and harmful things on the internet and spreading it around (mixed in with the 999 bots is 1 person's great aunt exposing her brain to unfiltered bot noise), I wonder, would the better solution be like the one from the novel, to completely annihilate the trustworthiness of the unfiltered internet, or, perhaps there's some other solution that counters the Oil and Gas bots, perhaps even following a strategy like in the OP article, politely Dale Carnegieing every single point with boundless energy, enthusiasm, politeness, and good faith?

The same is true for another theory like the continental drift. Dissent is not only allowed, but one of the main drivers of scientific advance. A lot of times we find some solidifying evidence a posteriori (e.g. when common fossils were found in Africa and South America after hypothesizing they were once together) for a dissenting hipothesis. reply nickpsecurity 5 hours agorootparentThat’s a good point. Evolution had an uphill battle early on before many scientists accepted it. Dissent does help in many areas. It’s allowed within evolution, but not against it. No dissent is allowed contradicting the entire theory. We have to teach it like it’s an observed fact, anyone disagreeing is mocked, and it’s blended into tons of topics with no evidence it happened. People just start saying something is an evolutionary X or Y happened over millions of years with no proof of this. That a theory with many articles of faith becomes the lens through which observed facts are reshaped is more like philosophy or religion. That it can’t be contradicted and its proponents rooted out all alternatives. This shows it’s built on group or political power, not the scientific method. reply crdrost 14 hours agorootparentprevI'm somewhat confused; I thought there were many self-professed Christians who also believed in evolution.

I see what you are saying about needing to take something as axiomatic, I just don't understand why you think the evolutionists have so many axioms and your axioms are altogether fewer?

But there's no reason that God couldn't have used natural processes like evolution to enact his vision for the world, so to me there's no conflict at all with my faith. reply nickpsecurity 4 hours agorootparentprevThere are. They usually aren’t committed to following the text when it conflicts with their current culture, though. Some are with an interpretation that’s different from the older ones. Likely an error given God promised to help us interpret His Word with the gift of teaching. So, why wouldn’t we believe it Biblically? First, God describes creation like He did it personally in Genesis. He describes everything up to the Fall of humanity in Gen. 1-3. It’s here because I’ll reference it a few times: https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%201-3&v... First, in Gen. 1:11-13, God creates the plants on Earth before creating the stars and moon. They aren’t getting energy from the Sun in photosynthesis. That contradicts the scientific model of how life formed. Second, God doesn’t create us from the animals. He describes it like He made us from scratch. Were the most important thing to Him, made in His image. He describes it elsewhere like a Potter shaping a piece of clay into what He imagines. He does it for each of us through natural processes He directs but originally sculpted the entire person. Third, He says it was six days with resting on the seventh day. The way the word is used in Hebrew is how they usually do a 24-hour day. In the New Testament, writers aided by the Holy Spirit reference it like it was a 24-day day. Fourth, there is no death on Earth at this point. God made us to love Him, love each other, and enjoy this world. He blessed them with life. Humanity’s betrayal of God, where every human ever born chooses to commit evil acts, results in God punishing us with the curses in Genesis 3 (and 4). Death itself, with a lifespan of 120 years, is a curse He introduces into a deathless world. He’ll later counter death by giving us life by faith in Jesus Christ our God. This contradicts evolution where death creates people from other animals. If anything, evolution glorifies death because evolutionists believe it’s one of the main drivers of biological progress. Fifth, God’s Word indicates there’s different “kinds,” or categories, of creatures that He may have fixed. It’s a bit higher than a species in current taxonomy. While creatures adapt, we’ve actually not seen these categories of animals change into other animals despite billions of animals in captivity. God’s Word is holding up while evolution is refuted by billions of data points. Sixth, we see what we’d call an explosion of life where fully-formed creatures show up with no parents. Later, there’s a global Flood, which built up over time, which would cause other catastrophes if driven by or paired with geological events. That would cause mass extinctions while dropping fossils in layers on the Earth. Evolution instead predicted continuous streams of small adaptations from the tiniest animals to the most complex. We saw virtually no transitional fossils despite evolution requiring piles of them everywhere for the multitude of observed species. Supporting God’s Word, we do see life disappearing in mass extinctions, life appearing out of nowhere in mass (eg Cambrian explosion), evidence of catastrophes, and rapid shifts in geography of some areas. Lastly, God’s Word describes our creation as a story of how He made us for Himself, we all chose evil, rejected Him, and He pursued us to redeem us. That He loved us so much He gave His Son, Jesus Christ, for us who died and rose again to set free all who repent and believe in Him. This helps us empirically. Human creators rapidly design their artificial universes or movie sets using their own technology to get to the point of the story they’re trying to tell. They don’t evolve them over billions of years within the laws and timeline of their creation. God rapidly creating His movie set in six days, but then letting it play out within its own laws, is exactly how most human creations operate. Empirically, God’s Word shows a Creator that uses principles like all observed creators with good, logical reason for a quick creation, too. So, there’s some ways God’s Word contradicts macro-evolution as origin of life. It doesn’t contradict diversification within categories. We’ve observed that. God’s Word also tells us to protect all individual lives, loving each as ourselves. Each individual’s life has purpose. Godless, amoral evolution encourages things like eugenics or genocide to “improve” our species or accomplish the selfish goals of those in power. Nothing really matters either. So, evolution combined with other beliefs contradict both the truths in and righteous goals of God’s Word. reply ZeroGravitas 9 hours agoprevI think the people propogating the talking points that these people are mindlessly spouting are doing a much better job in achieving their goals. The guy who says climate change is a Chinese Hoax is 50/50 for President as a result. So the answer seems to be a decades long campaign of misinformation to achieve power to get money to fund another decade of misinformation.

However, I disagree with some of the core tenets involved. > There’s a misconception that good faith discussion only happens in close-knit communities like LessWrong or HackerNews. In my experience, discussions about more controversial topics here are exactly as disgusting as they are on any other forum. Which makes sense, because technologically, this place is exactly like any other forum. > The reality I’m looking at here is that ~everyone on the internet is rational AND is arguing in good faith. (...) \"people suck/are bad/evil/stupid\" (...) is a very difficult way to live life, it’s also just flat out false. The approach I'm going to use for debuking this is going to be semantics-play and claiming that your examples are cherry-picked. I'll paraphrase 2 X (formerly Twitter) conversations for this that I just hit recently. I'm paraphrasing because I lost the links. You'll unfortunately just have to take my word for this. Conversation #1: OP: You should drink alcohol! When are you going to drink alcohol if not now? 18-29 are your prime drinking years, your body is made to process alcohol at this age. You should never abstinate. You should take at least 12 shots every week.\" Apart from being blatantly terrible health advice, this is also logically unsound. The OP very clearly cannot prove or demonstrate that the body is made to process alcohol in this age range. What he could prove/demonstrate is that in this age range, the body handles it best, which is a very different thing. Commenter 1: I disagree, it's really bad for your body, blah blah blah. OP: You're a loser, and look at me I'm more fit than you (posts unsavory picture of commenter 1, and a \"good\" one of themselves). Commenter 1: posts picture of themselves being visibly more fit than OP. OP:Commenter 2: yeah but you're a loser If this article's author's takeaway from this is that Commenter 1 didn't try to argue in a good manner, that is profoundly depressing. Very clearly OP and Commenter 2 had zero intention in making a good faith argument, or recognizing themselves in the wrong. They were deliberately acting like \"cool\" assholes. Conversation #2: OP: post about Apple and privacy Commenter 1: whenever I talk aboutI get recommended them in ads immediately after. How can Apple have top notch privacy if this happens? Commenter 2: argues that Commenter 1 searched for saidand just doesn't realize, therefore he's dumb, therefore Apple good Once again, there was no attempt at a good faith conversation. Possibly from either of them. Join in, and you'll have to fend off two immature idiots instead of one. What I'm trying to get at here is that regardless of whether these people are actual assholes or are just acting like one, it doesn't really matter. I'll go on these platforms and be hit with their misery regardless. Them being actually goody two shoes is unimportant, if all I can ever interact with is their asshole selves. Either the platform (X, formerly Twitter) gets this kind of behavior out of people, or being on the internet in general does. Regardless, these people are not worth anyone's time. Despite this, I will say that I do highly agree that this view is on its own extremely miserable as well. I've been having an extreme difficulty connecting with people due to the many years of insufferable conversations like this, and have abandoned most platforms by this point also. Inviting me to put in even more effort isn't super tantalizing either. I really don't think this is just a \"language\" thing people can or should just figure out. It's a bit like thinking that you can do hard drugs if you just control yourself - ignoring of course that controlling yourself is the very thing the more serious substances gradually disintegrate. Is it true that you can be super into, idk, heroin, if you just pay attention? Sure I guess. Is it what's overwhelmingly likely to happen? No. And it has very little to do with you the \"person\" inside. It's biochemistry. reply houseplant 9 hours agoprev [–] what I've noticed is that many arguments have little to do with you, the \"opponent\", or the topic argued about or even which of you is right. it's more about the arguer re-enforcing their beliefs of being correct, and therefore morally righteous and powerful, to themselves. If you can argue your point successfully or at least cause your opponent to secede or give up and ragequit or block you, you won, because it isn't about correctness but power to remove or eliminate their influence from the argument, and if taken to the farthest conclusion, society at large. you begin noticing that all these conversations are about power over the opponent and if they could humiliate them enough- either with numbers by ratioing them with chatgpt bot replies or reddit downvotes or whatever- they will be silenced and you can pretend it was your power that did it. It reminds me of catcalling on the street. The guy catcalling a girl knows very well they won't turn her on, she isn't going to be receptive, she isn't going to fuck him. She might just shoot him an angry look. But it doesn't matter because that wasn't the goal, the goal was to get a temporary sexual power trip- you just made that girl think about you against her will!! you were powerful enough to occupy her mind for that moment. You win! you also see it in the sort of cultish thinking of all kinds of ideological things like wild flat earthers or MRAs or pickup artists or pizzagaters or whatever stupid shit. It's never about the thing they say they're all about, they don't really care about the earth being flat, or men's rights, or manipulating girls, or child abuse- they care about feeling like heroes to themselves and their peers- culturally righteous and powerful. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

Becker journeyed with a legal bailiff to check that the owl prize was still buried at the location revealed in the solution. He reported that when he dug at the spot he found the owl missing and instead found a rusty iron bird. He replaced this rusty bird with a new bronze owl so that the treasure hunt could continue https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Trail_of_the_Golden_O... Sounds like somebody actually had already solved it? reply aredox 1 hour agoparentNo, what is means is that at the location, the stand-in for the golden owl was rusted. The creator of treasure hunt didn't bury the actual golden owl, to keep the artwork clean and to force the finder to reveal that he/she has indeed solved the puzzle, and not just stumbled upon it. reply _notreallyme_ 4 hours agoparentprevThe english version is weird. It was planned from the beggining that they would bury a bronze owl. The bronze owl was to be exchanged with the precious metal one. In the french news, they specifically mentioned that the bronze one was found. If you think about it, it makes more sense. The co-founder was given the rights to the original treasure hunt because he is the owner of the valuable owl. He is the one who financed the whole thing. reply supergarfield 3 hours agorootparentThe French Wikipedia page doesn't talk about it, but the quoted text from the English Wikipedia page involving an iron bird (and not a bronze owl) is accurate.

What it says it that the statue should have been in bronze, but is instead in \"ferrous metal\" and must have been replaced around september 2005. Anyway, the idea was that the golden one was not buried, only a \"pass-out\" one. reply card_zero 1 hour agoparentprevThat is confusingly low on details. I added \"speculated to be a replacement left by Hauser\" (the creator), as the source says. reply SeaGully 2 hours agoprevReminds me a bit of Alkemstone. I went snooping about old games magazines from the early 80s and there was an advert for the prize for that game (it really is just a maze with a series of clues). The ultimate solution was to be a location of the Alkemstone (presumably a fake gem) which one would exchange for the prize. I think the guy who created it died long ago and the legal office which was meant to verify the prize is also maybe defunct (?). I'm also skeptical the \"stone\" would be wherever it was meant to be at this point anyways (similar to a number of the boxes from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_(treasure_hunt) are theorized to be now inaccessible or destroyed). Anyways, people are still trying to solve it. Last I heard someone claimed that they and their friends had paired all the clues in some way and were close to solving it, but they were very cagey about it.

Masquerade by Kit Williams [1] was a phenomena in 1979 - a book of weird illustrations that somehow contained a puzzle as to where a golden hare was buried. Even a fifteen year-old living in Kansas at the time was drawn to it, got caught up in it. The golden hare was found after a few years — the whole story of the hare and its finding are well documented in the book by Bamber Gascoigne, Quest for the Golden Hare [2]. The account is a fun read: why Kit decided on buried treasure, how he went about creating the artwork/puzzle, the adventure of burying the rabbit.... But far and away the most fascinating bit describes the various treasure-hunters that then came after the hare. The party that solved the puzzle did not find the hare.

Michel Becker only helped illustrate the book that is the support for the hunt and has taken over it when he passed. As far as I know this was quite controversial because he had not knowledge about the riddles or how to solve them, and was only able to take over because there was a notarized enveloped left behind by the original creator which explained everything. reply RandomThoughts3 5 hours agoparentCould you explain more because the author passed away and left the solutions to the riddles in a notarised envelope to a close collaborator who worked on another part of the book so the hunt could live on - the solution is finally found by an unrelated party a whole decade later - doesn’t seem notably controversial to me? reply Naklin 5 hours agorootparentSee https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Trail_of_the_Golden_Owl... There are more details on the french wikipedia article but basically Michel Becker did everything he could to make money out of the success of the treasure hunt, doing things that were either unethical or deemed contrary to the true creator's original intent.

This category is based on a new informal definition that was agreed with no democratic scrutiny. While claiming to target those who may engage in political violence, there is potential for far broader application. Support our work: become a Friend of Statewatch from as little as £1/€1 per month. Image: Andrew, CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 Increasing efforts against “radicalisation” The EU and its forerunners have targeted radicalism and “radicalisation” for decades. This agenda gained a firmer hold in 2011, when the European Commission established the Radicalisation Awareness Network. In June this year, the Commission launched a new €60 million (pdf) “Knowledge Hub” to further expand the agenda. The hub aims “to collaborate in a new way at the EU level to address the challenges posed by radicalisation.” Around the same time, the Belgian Council presidency circulated a document (pdf) which “sums up the Presidency focus areas and initiatives for the past six months in the domain of counter-terrorism (CT)”. It says: “Member States should continue their efforts to recognise and handle, at an early stage, public security threats stemming from individuals considered by national law enforcement authorities to constitute a violent extremist/terrorist threat.” This would rely on information on these individuals being entered into EU databases, such as the Schengen Information System or Europol’s files. The document says information should be entered “where possible and in line with national and EU legislation.” Informal definition of “potential terrorist” These plans build upon a recent “shared understanding” of who EU authorities consider a \"potential terrorist or violent extremist threat,” a concept encapsulated in the document by the German term Gefährder. The German authorities introduced the phrase and the topic of “potential terrorists” into EU institutions. The Council’s internal security committee (COSI) approved this “shared understanding” in May this year (pdf). By framing it as a “shared understanding”, COSI avoided legal reforms. This would have required lengthy negotiations, as well as an opportunity for democratic scrutiny. The document that sets out the definition (pdf) notes: “The criteria are strictly non-binding and do not affect the existing mechanisms and procedures already established at European and national level. Their goal is to promote entering such individuals into the European databases and information systems by the Member States subject to the legal requirements governing these systems.” (emphasis in original) As previously reported by Statewatch, the criteria consist of three points. A “minimum materiality threshold”. This requires “objective and verifiable… information suggesting that a criminal offence, or future criminal offence, has a certain degree of seriousness.” A “basic indicative criterion”. This requires “objective, verifiable information” leading to a belief that the individual in question “will in the future commit, facilitate, support or engage in terrorist or violent extremist offences.” A series of “indicative auxiliary criteria”. This could be involvement in terrorist offences, sharing terrorist content online, or being the subject of an EU entry ban. This Council initiative comes at the same time as the EU’s rollout of new information systems and an updated Europol mandate. These developments will massively expand the EU’s collection of information on “risky” individuals. Through this “shared understanding”, the Council of the EU has created space for a new, informal practice. It will likely permit the collection and sharing of data on far more people than those involved in terrorism and violence. The effects on asylum-seekers and refugees The Belgian Presidency document outlines categories of people who this new practice may cover. These include asylum seekers and refugees, as well as climate and environmental activists. The document notes the “limited” number of asylum seekers and refugees involved in terrorism and violence, but the new initiative adds to others that frame them as suspects. As Statewatch reported in March, this includes an expanded intelligence-sharing plan introduced by the Belgian Presidency. This seeks to “strengthen cooperation and exchange of information between immigration and asylum authorities and between CT [counter-terrorism] authorities,” likely to be policing and intelligence agencies. They justify this as a response to “terrorist attacks in Europe” that have “triggered a debate on how to better prevent future attacks.” The effects on climate and environmental activists The EU’s interest in “radicalisation” also targets climate and environmental activists. The recent Belgian Presidency document states: “Climate activism is on the rise, together with an increased willingness to use violence, marking a shift from environmental activism to environmental extremism” (emphasis in original). To back this up, the document refers to a report by the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator, which purportedly examined “the role climate change and environmental concerns play in the ideologies and narratives of violent extremists and terrorists in the EU.” Yet, the report itself said it was largely speculative: “The potential for terrorism and violent extremism linked to the environment and climate change is at this moment limited but might become more significant in the coming years.” The Belgian Presidency document included a similar note on the “limited” number of asylum seekers and refugees involved in terrorism and violence. Yet, both groups remain targets of the EU’s agenda against “radicalisation”. The UN Special Rapporteur on Environmental Defenders under the Aarhus Convention has issued a warning that: “…the conflation of peaceful climate activism with radicalisation and terrorism may increase polarisation by wrongly labelling activists as radicals and trivialising terrorism.” Harsh sentences are being handed down to peaceful climate protesters by both EU member states and the UK. The latter remains closely tied to the EU’s policing structures through its cooperation with Europol. For example, at the end of August, Climate Rights International reported: “…a German court sentenced 65-year-old Winfried Lorenz to 22 months in prison without parole, for his involvement in a climate protest that blocked a road. It is believed to be the longest sentence ever imposed in Berlin against a climate activist.” Documentation Counterterrorism: Current challenges and Presidency initiatives and activities in the area (Council doc. 10406/24, LIMITE, 3 June 2024, pdf) A shared understanding of when a person should be regarded as a potential terrorist or violent extremist threat (“Gefährder”) (Council doc. 9988/24, LIMITE, 22 May 2024, pdf) Outcome of proceedings, Standing Committee on Operational Cooperation on Internal Security (COSI) (Council doc. 10752/24, 27 June 2024, pdf) Our work is only possible with your support.

Plans to exchange information about “future” criminals EU member states have finalised a set of “non-binding” criteria for assessing when someone may be labelled a potential terrorist or violent extremism threat. The intention is to feed European databases such as the Schengen Information System (SIS) and the Europol Information System (EIS), as well as Europol analysis projects such as “Hydra” and “Traveller”, according to a note circulated by the Belgian Council Presidency last month. Terrorism Civil liberties Policing Surveillance EU Germany 28 March 2024 EU: Intelligence-sharing plan extended from asylum-seekers to \"any foreigner involved in a migratory procedure\" In 2022, EU member states began discussing ways to increase the amount of information sent to intelligence agencies on \"the timing and state of progress of applications for international protection lodged by individuals posing a terrorist threat\". Now the intention is to cover not just asylum-seekers, but \"any foreigner involved in a migratory procedure.\" According to the Belgian Presidency, \"security concerns go beyond the mere scope of applicants for international protection, as they also cover other people who apply for the legal right to stay in Europe.\" Asylum Immigration Security and intelligence agencies EU 28 February 2024 Environmental activism under the EU counter-terror microscope Next week, EU and member state officials will discuss “the role of climate change and environmental concerns in violent extremist and terrorist radicalisation.” A discussion paper for the meeting, obtained by Statewatch, considers the threat posed by “violent left-wing and anarchist extremism” – a heading under which a number of prominent environmental protest groups are mentioned. The inclusion of peaceful but disruptive groups in the paper may legitimate further police surveillance and infiltration, legal harassment and government crackdowns – a problem identified as “a major threat to human rights and democracy” by a UN Special Rapporteur.

This would send a message with some plausible deniability. reply rbanffy 6 hours agoprevHow is the notion of conspiracy to commit a crime framed in the US legal system (including entrapment) and what would be the provisions against overreach in those cases? I remember not so long ago a couple people were arrested for conspiring to kidnap a governor in the US. They never actually committed the crime though. reply throwaway48476 6 hours agoparentThe law only matters insofar as you have enough money to drag it through court long enough to get a ruling. The government has unlimited money to spend in prosecution and will freeze yours to hobble your defense. reply rbanffy 6 hours agorootparentThen, I'd say, the US has far more pressing problems than this EU policy. reply throwaway48476 5 hours agorootparentThe EU is a canary in the mine and a case study in the slide towards authoritarianism that the US is not uniquely safe from. reply rbanffy 5 hours agorootparentI'd argue you have already crossed into that space a long time ago. Just observe the numerous transgressions by various police enforcement agencies. When you hire officers with tattooed swastikas, authoritarianism is kind of what you get. I grew up in a society where I was completely unaware of it, just because I was a white, middle-class, very caucasian, cishet male. I never feared a police stop. I have never feared the police would storm a party, show, or rave I was in and kill a dozen people. I moved to Ireland and was rapidly integrated into their society. I never faced any form of discrimination. A lot of Brazilians there and here are not so lucky. My Indian colleagues tell horror stories of their encounters with less enlightened members of my adopted country's population. You wouldn't want t be one of them. reply throwaway48476 5 hours agorootparentI don't understand your point, if there is one. reply rbanffy 4 hours agorootparentThe point is the US is already quite authoritarian, with sweeping surveillance laws (enacted as a reaction to 911), illegal renditions and extrajudicial executions (outside the US), where discretionary power allows police abuse against minorities that is far more frequent than it is in the EU, but, since the people affected are the most disenfranchised minorities, there is little incentive to keep it under control. The US has far more pressing issues than the EU. reply leereeves 5 hours agorootparentprev> I have never feared the police would storm a party, show, or rave I was in and kill a dozen people. What are you referring to here? reply rbanffy 4 hours agorootparentA couple incidents in Brazil where the police stormed a party to arrest some individuals and ended up killing a couple dozen unarmed people (in addition to the people they were supposed to arrest). reply leereeves 4 hours agorootparentWas that related to the US or EU? reply rbanffy 1 hour agorootparentDo black Americans fear their police forces? reply jonathanstrange 7 hours agoprevThat's pretty crazy, it looks a lot like in Minority Report. Notice the reference to a \"future criminal offence\" and the phrase \"leading to the belief\" in the criteria: A “minimum materiality threshold”. This requires “objective and verifiable… information suggesting that a criminal offence, or future criminal offence, has a certain degree of seriousness.” A “basic indicative criterion”. This requires “objective, verifiable information” leading to a belief that the individual in question “will in the future commit, facilitate, support or engage in terrorist or violent extremist offences.” A series of “indicative auxiliary criteria”. This could be involvement in terrorist offences, sharing terrorist content online, or being the subject of an EU entry ban. reply jand 7 hours agoparent\"support or engage in terrorist or violent extremist offences\" What constitutes \"support\"?

What I see is... it is in big part our fault but in another part people from outside... trying to get their nose, which, I would say, at the end, that it is enabled by corruption, which... is also our fault anyways. reply throwaway48476 6 hours agorootparentCorruption is cultural. There's a correlation between petty corruption and political corruption. reply hulitu 6 hours agorootparent> Corruption is cultural. Are there cultures without corruption ? (no i'm not asking about headhunters in Papua New Guinea) reply throwaway48476 6 hours agorootparentThe definition of corruption is also cultural. From an individual perspective there are places with relatively more or less corruption. reply germandiago 4 hours agorootparentThere are actually multiple ways to be corrupt. Some of the most well behaved and civilized cultures in the world, again in my opinion and only my opinion, had a double standard when they went out of their domains. I am guessing that is alao human nature, though, but I find that somewhat corrupted behavior. It is fair to say that before mindsets were also different and should be adapted to the times before giving an extensive opinion on this. But human and double standards, no matter the place or culture in the world, is quite common. I think things have improved in that sense but we are still very far from perfection, which does not exist anyway. Also, and from my experience, you see more real humans in the face of scarcity. It is like the instincts pop up more quickly when there is less abundance in the environment. It is not a matter of materialistic things available only though, but it is something that it affects definitely human behavior. Put in other words and in harsh vocabulary: just because someone looks good, it does not mean they are. Sometimes, conveesely, a desperate person could do things we would label as bad and probably the only thing that happened is that we saw those two people in very different contexts... It is a complicated topic, but from Eruope to Asia (where I lived over a decade) and since the country where I have been most of the time is somewhat poorer (also cultirally different) you can see very different behaviors for similar situations or things that are very bad in Europe are somewhat ok here. The topic of lying is one of those. For people here, it is not really important to stick to their word that much (except for family-related stuff). It is ok also to use lies as a tool to give excuses. I do not mean noone does that. Everyone has done some of that. What I mean is that for them there is no bad in doing it in that way, for me it would be a bad-looking thing I'd rather avoid most of the time. This happens with so many things... reply lo_zamoyski 6 hours agorootparentprevIt makes sense to pay attention to what is being pathologized by the EU establishment, because that can make you a target. However, interestingly, if you look at US Department of State travel advisories, note those for the UK, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, and Sweden and compare those with Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary, for example. One element is that the very policies that the EU is pursuing contribute to the anxieties motivating such fears of terrorism. reply Rinzler89 6 hours agorootparentOf course countries in Eastern Europe like Poland can be safer. Who knew that being selective with who you let in and unwelcoming to people who enter your country illegally instead of giving them generous welfare can make it safer? That's like being surprised that standing in the rain makes you wet. Unfortunately promoting strictly enforcing immigration laws and borders makes you a right wing supremacist in the other progressive EU counties so they need to make themselves unsafe in order to virtue signal to the world how welcoming and tolerant they are. reply germandiago 1 hour agorootparent> Unfortunately promoting strictly enforcing immigration laws and borders makes you a right wing supremacist in the other progressive EU counties In the media only. I do not know people who really think that if you ask, no matter left or right. Right wing people because they always thought in these terms somewhat (but not as much as you might think for a country like Spain). Left wing because they are starting to see this is already a matter of security, no matter their core ideas, they live in the real world, like everyone else. In Spain for example immigration became already the first and most worrying topic according to the INE (National Institute of Statistics, biggest surveys in country). We have waves of like up to 5,000 in canary islands some weeks, like almost 300 per day in average. They also use the NGOs and take them illegally even according to our laws to Madrid in flights that are not tracked. All this has been researched and is known already nowadays. That is why people get this worried. There are other problems related, but they ask citizens to follow laws and they workaround them however and whenever they deem appropriate. That is quite infuriating, more even so than the problem itself when you know security is related to this phenomena when it is too massive, and there is hard data that backs it up... That is the reason why in many countries right wing parties (not the \"soft right wing\", which are kind of social democrats) are getting traction: security. In fact, my personal opinion is what they call far right is (almost all the time except very very few exceptions) more or less normal right wing and what they call \"right wing\", are just social-democratic parties. But who am I to say... the media will jump to my throat, right? Anyway, many of us never cared or do not care anymore, because this has become already a matter of security. reply zxcb1 6 hours agoparentprevThe Nord Stream incident is attributed to Ukrainian ultranationalists by the WSJ (https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/nord-stream-pipeline-explos...)

There is a big difference between that and having evidence someone intends to commit a crime in the future. Of course it is possible to abuse such things, which is why its important to have reasonable definitions for these things. reply gillesjacobs 6 hours agorootparent1. Three years ago, you liked some tweets of someone who you didn't know was a political seperatist. Now, his group had been classified a terror organisation. 2.

No, one legitimate concern is over the amount of information gathering and sharing that's needed to establish sufficient “objective, verifiable information” and how that competes with other goods. reply wickedsight 7 hours agorootparentprev> “objective, verifiable information” leading to a belief Is very different from 'a belief'.

What a belief is based on means squat, it is how that belief came to be that is important. reply zo1 6 hours agorootparentprevHave you not seen how they're already starting to redefine various very benign but anti-government groups as \"terrorists\"? Next thing you know, just being a part of that group becomes 'objective, verifiable information\" that makes them \"believe\" that you \"may commit\" some crime? And pretty much anything, with a semblance of plausibility or causal inference can be used as \"objective, verifiable information\". They just need to define that property as a) verifiable, b)objective and c) somehow implies some bad other property or future event. There's a reason that programming is hard, and even harder when you have to use normal non-programming-language constructs. reply komali2 6 hours agorootparentprevAnti war activists have been called \"terrorist supporters\" since at least 2001.

I think people give too much credit to governments. \"Of course they'll only use for-sure for-sure objectively terrorist intent verifiable information.\" No, historically what they'll do is throw you on the list because you followed a hot commie girl to a meetup in college, or attended a protest, or hell bought a watch terrorists happen to use to set timers in bombs. reply boffinAudio 6 hours agorootparentprevNo it isn't. This \"objective, verifiable information\" is an open door to using misinformation to frame innocent people of crimes they have not committed. reply wickedsight 6 hours agorootparentThis type of information is already being used to prevent crimes. People get arrested for planning robberies or murders all the time. Those investigations start based on beliefs that are based on 'objective, verifiable information'. After that intent has to be proven in court with evidence that has been found during an investigation. In many cases it also leads to a case being dismissed because no evidence is found. I'm honestly pretty surprised that people think this is a new concept. reply jonathanstrange 6 hours agorootparentThere is no mention of probable cause and oversight by a judge.

Don't know if this is the truth, but since this has also happened in my country in the past, I wouldn't be surprised that it is.

I hate that police have been caught doing this crap before because now at every single protest, if there's any stupid violence like a random innocent businesses having their windows smashed, the knee jerk reaction is \"It was Agent provocateurs!\". There's kids out there who live in some magical fairytale land where every protestor is always 100% innocent and isn't open to even discussing what's happening in reality because in their mind, all the bad stuff that happens is under cover bad actors. It's like the let's version of how January 6th was \"antifa\". reply Rinzler89 6 hours agorootparentUnfortunately when crowds go berserk and riots happen, it's very difficult to get solid proof on who exactly started it and identify that person since the tend to cover their faces. And even if by a miracle you do manage to get the face of that person and submit it to law enforcement, if they happened to be part of one of the intelligence agencies like it was in my country, the government would turn a blind eye and pretend they cant identify that person in order to protect them. Throwing LEOs under the bus, even if they're guilty of something, is not something most government leaders are rushing to do since they need LEOs on their side in order to enforce the laws and maintain their positions in society, and it's not a good idea to piss off those in charge of the guns and surveillance capabilities and turn them against you. reply johndunne 7 hours agorootparentprevI think this is a common problem in the UK during peaceful protests. I've witnessed masked young men clearly getting messages on their phones to go somewhere. They'll suddenly hustle off together. I figure they're there just to cause trouble. If the EU is serious about democracy then they ought to make it clear that this kind of thing goes on during peaceful protests instead of justifying dubious legislative changes in the name of 'protecting people'. reply adrian_b 6 hours agorootparentThis is a common tactic used by the police or secret services in all countries, not only in the UK. Wherever there are truly peaceful protests against governments there is a very high probability that governmental agents infiltrated among the protestants will attempt to cause violent incidents in order to provide justification for the police to attack the participants with excessive force. reply yunohn 7 hours agorootparentprevYes, sadly this is a common tactic by the incumbent corruption (politicians, corporations, otherwise) to make the protestors seem dangerous.

Nearly every protest I've been to has been peaceful. Sometimes the cops try to instigate violence by kettling or shoving people around really aggressively, but well trained protest leaders have people prepped for this and push hardline pacifism - well all know what happens when the cops \"get the green light.\" Typically when shit kicks off, it's an agent provocateur. Not always, but typically: https://abcnews.go.com/US/man-helped-ignite-george-floyd-rio...

The most concerning thing about this proposed legislation is the fact that it can be used to further skirt accountability, by labeling protesters under the broad terms the bill covers. reply smashah 6 hours agorootparentBack in the day, in a more localized times (i.e your life was somewhat controlled by those within your vicinity), if our \"leaders\" were tratiours, we would get the torches and pitchforks and march to their homes as the citizen's form of keeping leaders accountable. Post-enlightenment, we put down the torches and pitchforks, we outsourced the accountability function to the media/press. Shame and transparency were the new \"torch and pitchforks\". As soon as the likes of Rupert Murdoch/Roger Ailes etc. got involved in media, the press no longer wields the people's power, which was delegated to them, for the people. Instead the press selectively uses that power for ulterior aims - whether that's the Oil & Gas industry, the war machine, or for foreign interests. After Clinton, and in order to push the illegal Iraq war, politicians (no longer called \"leaders\") had to shed all their shame so that they would be immune to any press that came out about their illegal acts for the war machine. Wikileaks happened. Only the messenger was pursued. Shame doesn't work anymore. The press use the power we gave them against us. Therefore no wonder protests don't work. They don't get covered and politicians are rewarded for shamelessly ignoring the people's interests. The system is broken. I don't blame climate protesters escalating.

How does this square with the rise of insurgents like donald trump? He was basically snubbed by the GOP political establishment in 2016, but now the republican party is now enthralled to him. There was even a period where he tried to fight fox news and urged his supporters to watch OAN instead.

Just as the press usurped our power to block us out of it. Trump usurped the media's power (through his own showmanship) to block them out of it (this was the only reason CNN libs were mad really). At the end of the day Trump did the bidding of the common backgrounds interests so he was allowed to play the part: - Sold $100s of billions of weapons to dictators (MIC) - His anti-china policy was solely to stop their EVs from taking over the gas car market in the US (Oil & Gas) - Escalated tensions in the middle east to keep netanyahu in power through the Abraham Weapons Deal and moving the US embassy illegally to Jerusalem (Foreign Interests) The politicians, the media, they fall over, and fight amongst, each other to be top slave to these same various lobbies. The public are only there insofar to keep the facade in-tact, every 4 years people stand in line to larp as casting directors in the great pantomime. Most western states do not live in free, representative democracies - all the ones with significant sway have been totally usurped (in other countries we'd call it coups). And unfortunately, the tech industry is now going in that direction (with YC now accepting MIC projects, lazy zero-alpha investors and VCs are crawling to the DoD infinite-money-glitch teat).

Or that signing the Iran deal actually means Russia benefits somehow (dunno, maybe so their client state/ally isn't sanctioned anymore?) and trump is in the pockets of Russian oligarchs. Point is, no matter what policies get enacted, there's going to be someone benefiting, which means you can accuse the people in charge for doing \"the bidding of the common backgrounds interests\". Even something that should be an unalloyed good (eg. FTC outlawing noncompetes) can be cynically written off as \"that's just them throwing us a bone to keep us placated\". To put another way, what would convince you that your theory is false? A full socialist revolution? reply smashah 3 hours agorootparentI'm not so arrogant as to claim the world as it is as \"my theory\". If you choose to gormlessly debate reality that's up to you. If you choose to see some things and not others, well that's your theory of living you can debate with yourself also. If you were to ask me what I want. I want consistency and honesty. If politicians want to do the bidding of lobbies then don't waste our time with the quadrennial dog and pony show. If the press/media refuses to keep the powerful to account then just give us our torches and pitchforks back. If the justice system can be abused by people with power and money to squash the little guy then just rename it to something else. If international law only applies to what the status quo considers subhumans then just get rid of the ICC/ICJ and the entire concept of International Law. If profit motive is more important than the continuation of life on earth then just say so and stop paying useless consultants millions of dollars while the world burns and allow people who care about the climate to escalate as they see fit. If corporations are allowed to massacre people with their negligence and the \"justice system\" does nothing to hold them to account then just allow the people to do the same to negligent corporations. This whole setup of one side can always do the bad thing yet the other side always needs to politely go through \"the right channels\" to get an ounce of recourse is tiring. It's either \"law & order\" or the \"law of the jungle\" for all of us or none of us. reply FollowingTheDao 7 hours agorootparentprevGhandi set the standard for effective peaceful protests.

The funny part is that most groups would want to tell you that their particular set of ideas are worth dying for. As is often the case, it seems to be only the rank and file and the young is doing the dying part though. With that out of the way, maybe ideals is too charged of a word. Maybe the right word here is: priorities. reply dotnet00 6 hours agorootparentprevInvoking Gandhi's satyagrahas should always come with all the caveats that made the movement successful. It wasn't merely the act of peaceful protest that won India's independence, but the fact that it happened in the backdrop of WW2. Britain had to be much more careful to not risk escalating things into a full-blown revolt. Then, at the end of the war, they needed to focus their resources towards rebuilding. reply FollowingTheDao 6 hours agorootparentAgree, but he started his work in South Africa with great success.

I just wanted to emphasize that part of the reason satyagraha remained mainly peaceful was that even the people being protested against couldn't risk it turning violent. > But I will also argue, imagine if he did nothing? I think that India would still have gotten independence a few years later, since either way, I don't think post-WW2 Britain had the capacity to hold on to India. However, I do believe that Gandhi's efforts ended up playing a significant role in creating a more unified national identity and helped to foster values that have allowed India to be a mostly stable democracy, in stark contrast to many of its neighbors. So, if he had done nothing, I figure that India might've fragmented into smaller countries with too much conflict to amount to much on the global stage. reply highcountess 7 hours agorootparentprevPretty sure Jesus set that standard many centuries before Gandhi.

Someone smarter than me wrote: > Anarchists dedicated to nonviolent direct action are not opposed to all forms of property damage. It can be an effective strategy if the decision to do it involves all participants, the target chosen is one that will guarantee no one who is not part of the action could be injured, and the method used does not frighten the public. > A simple example is the Food Not Bombs actions taken the night of August 19th... we spray-painted the outline of \"dead” bodies on the ground, stenciled mushroom clouds with the word “Today?” and wheat-pasted \"War is Murder for Profit\" posters along the route that the weapons buyers and sellers would take from their hotel to the conference hall. taking credit for hundreds of dollars in graffiti damage to Boston University's property.

It’s violence displaced onto the inanimate as a threat to the animate. > Quietly eradicating experimental GMO crops or pulling up mining claim stakes is generally like the firefighter. Breaking windows during a big demonstration is more like the husband. I saw the windows of a Starbucks and a Niketown broken in downtown Seattle after nonviolent direct action had shut the central city and the World Trade Organization ministerial down. I saw scared-looking workers and knew that the CEOs and shareholders were not going to face that turbulence and they sure were not going to be the ones to clean it up.

People move the goal posts further and further away in order to justify their actions and to claim that their are not violent because violence is always something else, which is exactly what the second person you quote does, and can be safely ignored because it is obviously dishonest mental gymnastic. In any case, the (Cambridge English) dictionary's definition of \"violence\" remains \"actions that are intended or likely to hurt people or cause damage\" (you'll note that what firefighters might do is not intended to cause damage while vandalism obviously is), and the law indeed makes this a criminal offence for a reason. I'm half expecting someone to seriously claim at some point that an instant death is not violence because there is no suffering... reply wildrhythms 7 hours agorootparentprevWhat's the point of this comment? Some violence is justified. Violence against the Nazis was justified. The destruction of the Berlin Wall was justified. Jesus overturned the tables of the money exchangers, violently I suppose, and that was justified. The focus on the broad term 'violence' without any additional analysis is completely useless. And it's interesting to me that when 'violence' is used on this specific topic, it seems to only be used to label the reaction of the protesters and not the underlying issue they're protesting about, which itself is also a form of violence. reply A4ET8a8uTh0 6 hours agorootparentThe point of the comment is that there is no such thing as 'good violence' just as there is no such thing as 'hate speech'.

What the comment does in its original form is draw attention to the nonsensical cowardice of refusing to take a stand on any issue. \"There's no such thing as good violence\" has you condemning slave revolutions for example. \"There's no such thing as hate speech\" refuses to acknowledge the forces and choices that led to historical atrocities and abdicates power to notice and prevent them.

Anyone looking at the rise of AfD should also look at the example of Denmark, which some years earlier had also seen a strong rise of radical alt-right parties, but once the centrists switched their stance against immigration, at the next elections the radicals went back down to their rightful 1% or so of votes. That is also an example which shows that indeed it is possible to compete with hate-based politics with actual actionable and long-term viable policies. Indeed, SPD should instead examine why they themselves are losing votes and consider it their duty to provide some alternative for German voters so that a person can vote against immigration without getting the full neo-nazi package in addition to that. reply rbanffy 5 hours agorootparent> deliberately ignoring some major factor which a lot of the voters care about. Is it that so, or is it that hate-based shallow arguments appeal to a particular audience more than \"more reasonable\" policies or discourse? > once the centrists switched their stance against immigration Then the far-right would have won and turned the political mainstream into xenophobes. Not a great outcome for the society as a whole. Would arguments centered on supporting immigrants (and refugees fleeing humanitarian crisis) and integrating them into their host society have the same appeal for people who have been fed a diet of fear and hatred?

I disagree with your \"totalitarian measure\" comment, it is the AfD who are not compatible with the German constitution and the majority of Germany's society who prefer a fair democracy should not bulge the shouting of demands by populists, Reichsbürger, Querdenker. The connections to the AfD do exist, AfD politician Malsack-Winkemann (then already not a member of the Bundestag anymore, a security issue in my eyes) toured through the Reichstag with people from the Reichtsbürger group around Heinrich XIII.

A famous example many here will likely still be able to associate with is “The Patriot act”, which should have really been called “The Hunt Patriots act”; in reality a kind of mop-up operation after the USA has already long ago been functionally and psychologically conquered without the people even realizing it, kind of like how people can one day find themselves wondering how they slid into a very abusive relationship little by little without realizing it or being able to take action to prevent it. The only difference being that many, definitely not most people haven’t even started asking themselves whether they are in an abusive relationship, let alone how they got there.

There's a very weak link back to the electorate, but it's homeopathic democracy. reply buildfocus 5 hours agorootparentAgain, this is not different to local democratic processes. Voters typically cannot directly stop somebody being named leader of their party or given a specific role within government for multiple terms. If you dislike them, you pressure your elected representative to change that. Almost all representative democracy is accountability through a representative, not directly through control of government internals & positions. reply timrichard 4 hours agorootparentAgain, my point was that even though we only have one direct representative, the governing party as a whole will be punished in the next election if they become deeply unpopular. If your rulemakers are immune to voter displeasure, it isn't a healthy democracy. You said \"if you dislike them, you pressure your elected representative to change that\". If as an EU citizen you are angry with the performance and direction of Ursula and the Commission, there isn't a damn thing you can do about it. reply medstrom 7 hours agorootparentprevIs this different from your own government? reply ThalesX 5 hours agorootparentYes, in that we find out what we voted for after the vote instead of before. reply generic92034 7 hours agorootparentprevSo we are in complete agreement. reply diggan 6 hours agorootparentprevThis is generally called \"representative democracy\" and is mostly what people talk about when they talk about \"democracy\" in public conversations.

But representative democracy still is democracy. reply fdfgyu 2 hours agorootparentThis is not representative democracy. This is, at best, buffered representative democracy. Arcane electoral rules make for weak representatives who gather power by making back room deals. The real (but not constitutional) power lies in the commission that is appointed, not elected, and has been vacuuming power to itself in increasing amounts. reply gillesjacobs 6 hours agorootparentprev> But calling the EU not being democratic is going too far Unelected commissioners draft laws, while elected MEPs rubber-stamp with barely any changes. The Council's backroom deals make smoke-filled rooms look transparent. Try explaining the Ordinary Legislative Procedure to the average voter - you can't. And let's not forget the ritual of ignoring referendums that don't align with the \"ever closer union\" mantra. When lobbyists have more sway than citizens, you've got a problem. The EU is a masterclass in obfuscating accountability behind layers of bureaucracy. It's democracy laundering, plain and simple. reply generic92034 6 hours agorootparentThe commissioners are not elected directly by the populace, just like ministers in any government I know of are not directly elected by the populace (and other powerful officials, too). The level of indirection is greater in a confederation of countries compared to a single country. The MEP usually do not \"rubber-stamp with barely any changes\". There often is considerable change applied to the original proposals, by the MEP negotiating. What really is missing is the right to propose laws for the EP. But for that you would need to agree about a way tighter EU integration of the member countries, which currently seems highly unlikely in the given political climate. Again, it is way easier organizing a democratic system in a single nation state than in a confederation of sovereign countries with sometimes very different national systems and views. And I am not saying that to brush over the democratic deficit of the current EU implementation, but just to acknowledge the level of difficulty. reply fdfgyu 2 hours agorootparentIn a parliamentary democracy every minister has been elected to his seat in Parliament. Voters can literally fire the PM while giving the ruling party a majority. Take Canada. The PM - Papineau The defence minister - Scarborough South West Finance Minister - University - Rosedale Even the Speaker, who stands for the Majesty, is a member of the House - Hull Aylmer. While Cabinet members are, typically, given safe seats to run, cabinet members can and do lose their seat effectively ending their ministry. In a strong presidential system, like the US, the \"ministers\" (i.e.secretaries) are not in fact elected. But, not only are they approved by Congress, but they serve on behalf and on the whim of the President who is elected. The fount of executive authority is solely in the hands of the President, who merely delegates his authority (who have no power of their own) to the cabinet members and (except for the VP) can fire them at any time. The President holds all the executive power and the voters pick him. The EU commissioners are not elected and the Commission president is not elected reply rbanffy 4 hours agorootparentprev> way tighter EU integration of the member countries, which currently seems highly unlikely in the given political climate. A real shame, if you ask me. The EU is the crowning achievement of human politics, and a step for a single government representing every human being democratically, with equal rights across national borders. Just to think the member countries never managed more than a couple decades without engaging in wars between them is a statement of the value of this organisation. Imperfect as it is, it has prevented countless avoidable deaths and brought unprecedented peace to its members. reply gillesjacobs 6 hours agorootparentprevYou hit upon the \"locality principle of representative democracy\": the more non-local elected representatives are in their excertion of power, the less oversight by the electorate. EU Law is seperated from the electorate by multiple layers: electorate > national parties > national parliament > national government > Council of the EU > European Parliament > European Commission > EU law Each layer dilutes democratic input and accountability. By the time you reach EU law, the average voter's influence is homeopathic at best. Localists would argue since a federation is highly non-local it shouldn't even be attempted because it leads inherently to non-representative centralisation of power. This multi-layered separation explains why EU citizens feel disconnected from Brussels decision-making. It's a game of democratic telephone where the message gets garbled with each step and the centralist power machine inserts its own interests. reply generic92034 5 hours agorootparent> This multi-layered separation explains why EU citizens feel disconnected from Brussels decision-making.

I agree with the first sentence, but I do not think that this cannot be improved upon. For example, more direct news reporting from EU level events/decisions could help. If only good journalism was not such a rare occurrence these days. Regarding the \"centralist power machine\" - that is no different anywhere, no matter the processes.

The reason this line is bad is because it's wrong and misused from multiple directions due to overloading/being vague with \"consequences\". Freedom of speech is freedom from VIOLENT, or directly violent adjacent [0], consequences, public or private. But SOCIAL consequences aren't infringement on free speech rights, they are exercising free speech rights. The exact same freedom of speech and association that gives you the right to say something offensive also gives everyone else the right to say offensive things back and/or never have anything to do with you again. Free speech culture and principles typically encourage attempting to maintain a more open and curious mind then you are required to, and to use your rights with appropriate measure and discretion. And of course social/economic consequences go round and round, too harsh a reaction may result in others treating the one who is judged to have been too harsh with consequences in turn, and on and on. That's the vibrant market of ideas. But it's false if someone brings this line up to support or excuse violent speech suppression, and it's also false if someone brings this up sarcastically and tries to equate bans from private soap boxes, people refusing to offer support, people offering criticism, etc with use of violence. If you get banned from some web forum, which is said web forum's freedom of speech, and then whine about your free speech rights, and someone says \"that doesn't give you freedom from consequences\" you should recognize they're completely correct as far as social consequences go, and would be completely wrong if they said you should get fined or imprisoned or beat up or the like. I consider myself a \"free speech absolutist\", but that's within a wholistic understanding of the whole system of free speech applying to everyone with infinite regression. The phase has gotten a bad name from hypocrites who call themselves that while then complaining loudly about others exercising their free speech (which of course is itself free speech). ---- 0: For example if government imposes a fine someone might say that's not violence, but the reason it's a \"fine\" not a \"suggestion\" is that it's backed by the government's general monopoly on violence. What makes a law a law is what happens if you don't go along with it. It can be nested many levels deep, and involve discretion and resource limits, but ultimately it always ends up with violence. reply llm_trw 6 hours agorootparenthttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60383385 I've worked with people who are outraged over what is happening with Hezbollah protestors that were 100% behind the above.

    "originBody": "Computer Science > Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing arXiv:2410.00531 (cs) [Submitted on 1 Oct 2024] Title:TPI-LLM: Serving 70B-scale LLMs Efficiently on Low-resource Edge Devices Authors:Zonghang Li, Wenjiao Feng, Mohsen Guizani, Hongfang Yu View PDF HTML (experimental) Abstract:Large model inference is shifting from cloud to edge due to concerns about the privacy of user interaction data. However, edge devices often struggle with limited computing power, memory, and bandwidth, requiring collaboration across multiple devices to run and speed up LLM inference. Pipeline parallelism, the mainstream solution, is inefficient for single-user scenarios, while tensor parallelism struggles with frequent communications. In this paper, we argue that tensor parallelism can be more effective than pipeline on low-resource devices, and present a compute- and memory-efficient tensor parallel inference system, named TPI-LLM, to serve 70B-scale models. TPI-LLM keeps sensitive raw data local in the users' devices and introduces a sliding window memory scheduler to dynamically manage layer weights during inference, with disk I/O latency overlapped with the computation and communication. This allows larger models to run smoothly on memory-limited devices. We analyze the communication bottleneck and find that link latency, not bandwidth, emerges as the main issue, so a star-based allreduce algorithm is implemented. Through extensive experiments on both emulated and real testbeds, TPI-LLM demonstrated over 80% less time-to-first-token and token latency compared to Accelerate, and over 90% compared to Transformers and Galaxy, while cutting the peak memory footprint of Llama 2-70B by 90%, requiring only 3.1 GB of memory for 70B-scale models.

Well, it does manage memory with some clever scheduling. The core of this idea is that you can schedule out inference on edge nodes in a memory and bandwidth optimized way that's a bit different than just splitting layers. They propose that right now computation and latency dominate the costs for multi-node inference, and pick a network topology (star) that is savvy to that. That said, it's 26-29 seconds per token for llama2-70b with their 8 edge devices, each using 4 gigs of RAM. That's amazing that they can run it at all, but this isn't going to be viable at the edge with current hardware. I think the paper makes the case that you could probably recruit say your 30 graphics workstations to do much faster inference without just nailing your LAN bandwidth, though. Upshot - interesting paper -- smart ideas, large frontier models still need very exotic hardware and bandwidth interconnects - this may point a way forward to lowering the bandwidth interconnects part of the story. reply tgtweak 2 hours agoparentI think the main advantage here is you COULD run it, even it it takes a while. That is a step up from current model limitations which require ram or vram to hold the model. I think this lays some groundwork for running a 400B model on a 3090/4090 or even smaller GPU. If you can get a huge model like that running on a single gpu even if the mean time per token is in the seconds, that's acceptable for many use cases. If this same technique can be used to extend context windows in addition to token autocomplete, that would be great in it's own regard. Hopefully work like this continues as throwing a ton of vram at a model should be regarded as a performance optimization not necessarily a requirement. reply michaelt 1 hour agorootparentIt's already technically possible to run huge models locally when you don't have the RAM/VRAM needed - llama.cpp can 'mmap' the model from disk. Of course an nvidia 4090 has a memory bandwidth of a 1000 GB per second; a CPU like the i7-13700K has a memory bandwidth of 90 GB per second; and a high-end NVMe SSD might only have read bandwidth of 10 GB per second. So in approximate terms, an LLM and quantisation level that can produce 10 tokens per second on a 4090 will produce 1 token per second from RAM and a token every 10 seconds from SSD. reply ignoramous 1 hour agorootparentprev> That is a step up from current model limitations which require ram or vram to hold the model. Current? Apple recently published a neat paper on how they optimise for both inference (cpu/gpu) and memory use: Our method involves constructing an inference cost model that takes into account the characteristics of flash memory, guiding us to optimize in two critical areas: reducing the volume of data transferred from flash and reading data in larger, more contiguous chunks. Within this hardware-informed framework, we introduce two principal techniques. First, “windowing” strategically reduces data transfer by reusing previously activated neurons, and second, “row-column bundling”, tailored to the sequential data access strengths of flash memory, increases the size of data chunks read from flash memory. These methods collectively enable running models up to twice the size of the available DRAM, with up to 4x and 20x increase in inference speed compared to naive loading approaches in CPU and GPU, respectively. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38704982 reply diggan 41 minutes agorootparentprev> I think the main advantage here is you COULD run it, even it it takes a while. I mean, you COULD run it before as well, even if you don't have enough RAM or VRAM, by using something like `zram`. It'd probably be even slower (and border-line usable, depending on the use case), but it's not impossible to get things to run. reply k1musab1 1 hour agoparentprevDo you think this could allow distributed inference only, or opens the door for distributed training of the model?

Most of the rewards will be reaped by consumers rather than providers. We're also in an age where the current levels of RAM in consumer devices were almost entirely optimized for prior to the existence of LLMs. I find it highly likely vendors will optimize for higher RAM capacity over other priorities in future hardware. How long until a 256GB RAM laptop (shared with GPU) is reasonably cheap/available? I give it a few years at most. It's possible that models grow orders of magnitude larger, but I find it more likely that the size of models will grow along the curve of cost of training decreasing/hardware cost improvements. There will be a sweet spot where it's economical to train larger models, and private companies won't push much beyond that. reply lxgr 1 hour agoparentEnterprises use LLMs too, and quite often there wouldn't be any client you could reasonably run the model on. (You wouldn't want to e.g. have an LLM summarize and categorize a user request on their device, since that would require you shipping your model and/or internal knowledge base to the client). reply adam_arthur 1 hour agorootparentYes, but if you can run a sufficient LLM on a $2,000 laptop, then the cost to serve it from the cloud will be similarly cheap. (e.g. reserve an appropriately sized EC2 instance for pennies on the dollar) It's a highly competitive market. Consumers aren't going to pay 100k/year to run a model on something that can run on a 2k consumer grade device. 128GB of gpu accessible/fast RAM can be had for $5000 on a macbook pro today. What will it be 3-4 years from now on linux/windows machines? And we still haven't seen any SoC providers try to optimize for RAM capacity over compute yet. reply lxgr 1 hour agorootparentOh yes, I could definitely see the privacy-preserving consumer use case creating sufficient demand for efficiency that also bleeds over into the enterprise market. That's what's happened with power efficiency and ARM CPUs, after all! reply adunsulag 9 minutes agorootparentThis is where I want highly sensitive healthcare consumers of LLMs to be at.

If so, would it be reasonable to have a second tiny model that specifically tries to predict activation and preemptively swap those into memory? reply miki123211 2 hours agorootparentThis isn't how neural networks work. For vanilla models, you always use all the weights. That isn't true for mixture-of-experts, though, and in that setting, your approach has merit. reply tcdent 3 hours agorootparentprevDepends on the architecture, but generally you just move through the layers linearly. Simple iteration. The number of layers, and the amount of time spent in each of them, makes me think any benefit from pre-loading the layer ahead is negligible. You really need the entire model on device to consider it performant. reply zackangelo 3 hours agoparentprevI've only read the abstract but they don't mention quantizing the weights or otherwise trying to shrink the model in any way. They're claiming to be able to efficiently run larger models without loading the entire thing into GPU memory. If they're using the same weights, the same architecture and just using tensor parallel operations to perform the forward pass that would imply no loss in quality. I'm sure there are trade-offs but they're not clear by just looking at the abstract. reply tgtweak 2 hours agorootparentI read it like this too - no drop in weights or model quality just optimizing the lower boundaries of performance when you are splitting from vram to ram to disk (or network). reply freehorse 3 hours agoparentprevFrom what I get skimming through the article the main cost is speed of token generation (token latency). You can always run a large model by reading directly from the disk and not care much about ram; but it is very slow. They try to improve that aspect doing some optimisations, but it is still definitely slower than using ram or vram. reply refulgentis 3 hours agorootparentTable 3 directly refutes this* and claims 0 tradeoffs.** Below that, they indicate that a key part of the implementation is loading weights from disk before they're needed using a separate thread.*** * maybe I'm missing something though, someone please triple check :) ** ttft (time to first token) and s/token (seconds per token) are both lower than any alternative in all cases. *** \"daemon thread asynchronously preloads the weights\" reply sgc 2 hours agorootparentI want to add that their chart shows s/token per device (edit: as per the heading on table 1 - it could also be confusing grammar), so it sounds like you are getting 4x the listed s/t on their 4 laptop cluster . Their laptops are not even hardwired - they are connecting over wifi. This comes at a very interesting time for me. I have an ancient dual xeon workstation with 64gb memory that I was researching how to convert to run an llm. I can just run that with 4 instances on the same machine and see how it goes, without purchasing a better GPU, to start. It sounds like this will allow you to run very large models with minimal quants, on craigslist quality devices. If it does what they say it does (and it seems to do), it will be an absolute game changer for most users. reply not_a_dane 3 hours agoparentprevNothing is free in this world. reply Zetaphor 2 hours agoprevIs this different from (or related to) the work being done by the exo project? https://github.com/exo-explore/exo reply tgtweak 2 hours agoparentExo is for partitioning over network across devices (implementing some bandwidth-reducing partitions) but still requires a minimum ram/vram requirement to load a model. This could, in theory, be combined to allow larger models to run on exo clusters with less gpu/ram than is required by the underlying model (at the cost of some performance no doubt, but still). reply alexandercheema 1 hour agorootparentexo maintainer here. tgtweak is correct. This looks like potentially some promising research that I'm looking into reproducing now. We want to lower the barrier to running large models as much as possible so if this works, it would be a potential addition to the exo offering. reply tgtweak 2 hours agoprevIs there a cuda implementation of this... asking for a friend reply dvh 3 hours agoprev [–] So when will I be able to \"sudo apt-get install llm\" ? reply o11c 2 hours agoparentRealistically, you probably want to wait until Vulkan support trickles out.

Instead of writing \"40 millions dollars\", they often omit the number, like \"millions of dollars\". This means they only use three values: millions, billions, and thousands.

If you print \"40 millions\", and it turns out to be 39, you've lied, which is considered far more bad than being vague. reply beAbU 8 hours agorootparentIn a local publication I follow they always round up or down to make the article easier to read. Sometimes they'll prefix the number with an \"about\" or \"roughly\" or \"nearly\" or whatever. The actual number (if it's available as a fact) will be printed in the article somewhere, but headings, pull quotes and other call-outs will have some rounded number.

For example, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(voltage) says that high voltage substations are in 100 kV range and 25.5MV is \"The largest man-made DC voltage – produced in a Van de Graaff generator at Oak Ridge National Laboratory\" and gives me much better color than a \"comparison\" with 100 million batteries.

A \"stack of AA batteries\" as described would be a measure of electrical potential (i.e. voltage), not electric field strength (Volts / unit-length in the applicable dimension(s)). It's been known for quite some time that high density static electric field \"break-downs\" generate electromagnetic radiation all throughout the spectrum--look at any wide-band antenna's reception next to any spark-gap generator. It doesn't take much--even the piezoelectric igniter on a grill wand will do it. One can also generate X-rays by rapidly unrolling Scotch tape. It the same phenomena on a _much_ smaller scale.
