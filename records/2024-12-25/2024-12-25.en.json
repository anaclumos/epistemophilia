Share them here :) - Josh :) jedberg 14 hours agoI'm Jewish, so all my Christmas's growing up were kinda the same. Sleep in, have brunch, wander over to my neighbor's house around noon to see what kind of loot they got and help them play with their new toys. Sometimes we'd go out for Chinese food and a movie. But my favorite was Christmas 1999. My girlfriend was out of town with her family and there was no reason to go home to mine, so I was alone (my roommates were with their families too). I decided to go to the movies in Emeryville. I was going to see Galaxy Quest, Bicentennial Man, and Man on the Moon. The timing lined up perfectly to see all three. About 50 other people were there to do the same thing. When it was time to go in for the first movie, a staff member came out and told us that it would start about 30 minutes late. This would of course cause us to miss all the other movies. About 30 people stepped forward at the same time and asked to speak to the manager. :). We explained to him that it would throw our whole schedule off. Since it was Christmas, he was kind enough to adjust the schedule so that we could all see all three movies. That was a great day. reply Sam6late 8 hours agoparentI'm Muslim, so all my Christmas's school and college days were kinda the same, 1980s. I would have a real small tree xmass decorated at home and no one would blink about it, then wander over to my christian friends' neighborhood around noon to see what kind of cherry and wine they were serving. This is that neighborhood now https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=1031546789002116&set=pcb... reply abustamam 5 hours agorootparentI'm Muslim too and I always find it interesting to see how various non-Christian theists observe Christmas. Obviously we don't \"celebrate\" but I personally don't see anything wrong with partaking in the secular parts of Christmas (and let's be real, in the west, it's pretty much all secular). My parents felt otherwise when I was growing up, so my siblings and I weren't allowed to do anything Christmas related, but now my wife and I would do seasonal things like watch a live performance of Nutcracker or Pentatonix or TSO. And can't forget about watching the holiday classic movies like Elf and Die Hard! reply almokhtar 4 hours agorootparentnext [4 more] [flagged] footy 4 hours agorootparentThis is a weird and kind of rude thing to say to someone. reply bloomingeek 4 hours agorootparentIndeed, the site rules infer not to be too argumentative.

Also tried 1973 — same (The Day of the Jackal, Soylent Green, Westworld, The Wicker Man, Papillon, American Graffiti, The Sting, Serpico, Mean Streets, High Plains Drifter, Don't Look Now, Badlands, The Long Goodbye, Jesus Christ Superstar, The Three Musketeers, Fantastic Planet, etc.).

Turning lazy writing from a vice into a virtue. Many shows now feel like they’re actively and intentionally wasting my time, ironically curing me of my desire to watch TV/Movies freeing up time for better uses. The other lazy writing is the lack of conflict resolution enabling a continuous source of needless conflict, making an entire show out of a situation that could have easily been resolved if there had been a single ‘adult’ in the room. This has the added problem of normalizing the extreme confrontational or evasive communication styles as opposed to productive engagements. I guess this is what happens when TV raises a generation and then that generation goes on to make their own TV show, each cycle worse than the previous. As bad as ‘engagement’/‘rage bait’ YouTubers are now I shudder to imagine what the next generation would bring. reply lazystar 11 hours agorootparentprevhuh, american beauty was 99. i always remember the \"plastic bag caught in the wind\" scene - when i was in middle school, years before i saw the movie, i was sitting on the sidelines during football practice and saw a plastic bag caught in the wind. it was hypnotizing, enrapturing - i dont know how long i watched, but that floating bag caught against the side of the school building was one of the most beautiful things ive ever seen. reply vladgur 12 hours agorootparentprevOf course it was peak - the Matrix came out reply mckirk 5 hours agorootparentFun fact: 1999 was also 'peak public phone booths'.

Could have been made yesterday. reply AznHisoka 4 hours agoparentprevOK, i am ignorant, but why do most Jewish people eat Chinese food on Christmas? Is there something I am missing? reply tasty_freeze 4 hours agorootparentChinese restaurants are often owned by first or second generation Chinese immigrants who (1) aren't Christian and (2) haven't been in the US long enough to adopt local customs. Since restaurants often are marginally profitable, they tend to stay open on Christmas because there is profit to be made, especially since most of the competition is closed that day. If you are Jewish, Christmas obviously isn't nearly as important to your (often nominally) Christian neighbors and there isn't much to do on Christmas day. If you decide you don't want to cook, Chinese restaurants are way over-represented in the choice of open restaurants. Once you do that for a couple years it becomes its own tradition. I grew up in a Catholic household but my family, after years of making Turkey and spending hours cooking, for the past few years has switched to Chinese food on Christmas. I don't miss the turkey and gravy. reply throwup238 1 hour agorootparentChinese restaurants will also often have whole roast duck which is an easy way to get the dinner centerpiece if you’re cooking the rest. My family doesn’t eat out but we always get a whole duck on Christmas and Thanksgiving (it’s a 20 year old tradition at this point). reply nozzlegear 3 hours agorootparentprevMy Christmas Eve tradition with my wife for the last 14 years has been to eat as much Chinese food as we possibly can at our favorite Chinese place. Then we drive around town looking at Christmas lights while listening to classic Christmas music. Neither of us are religious, but we were both raised Christian. I came into this thread thinking that I don't really have any great Christmas memories. My family was poor growing up, my parents shouldn't have been together for as long as they tried to make it work, and my father had a lot of issues with drugs and alcohol. But now that I think about it, these Christmas Eve memories with my wife are my favorite. reply woodruffw 3 hours agorootparentprevOthers have mentioned that it's because Chinese places are open, but another reason is that Chinese food is (or was) not obviously treif, meaning that there is (or was) a degree of plausible deniability around eating it. Source: family apocrypha. reply ilbeeper 55 minutes agorootparentI was under the impression that Chinese food is all about pork. Something like that Modi's rant: https://m.facebook.com/reel/1021462526286349 reply woodruffw 43 minutes agorootparentThere's also a lot of vegetarian/non-pork-but-fleishig Chinese food. But the point was more that Chinese food that isn't kosher isn't obviously so, especially 60-70 years ago when it was less commonplace. reply emchammer 1 hour agorootparentprevI was not aware that the error bars between kashrut and marit ayin are that wide. I figured that it was because of the intersection of Jewish middle class culture and Chinese culture starting in the 1930s, and because Chinese restaurants generally do not serve dairy products. reply woodruffw 33 minutes agorootparentI think those are factors as well! This is all apocrypha, so take it with a grain of salt. But my understanding is that this would be a case where marit ayin would not be a significant concern, since the Chinese dishes in question were not visually identifiable as e.g. pork. Or another framing: if you were a semi-secular family (like mine) that tried to keep a semi-kosher home, it would be easier to eat a dish that contained finely minced pork or shellfish or similar. American Chinese food fits those parameters while also being available on Christmas, etc. reply james_marks 2 hours agorootparentprevIt’s not just Jewish people; it’s anyone who doesn’t want to cook, and Chinese restaurants are historically the only thing open. reply pitaj 4 hours agorootparentprevI believe it's because Chinese restaurants historically are the only ones open since they don't celebrate Christmas. reply fumplethumb 4 hours agorootparentprevMost other places are closed.

Remind them, and it just might crack the encrusted exterior a little bit. reply shdickxnsks 3 hours agorootparentFor a profession so heavily aware of the idea of Chesterton's fence, a lot of us seem to think it doesn’t apply to society, culture, etc. reply wholinator2 2 hours agorootparentprevSee, i believe this is generally trueish for the current moment, has it always been true though? For example, I've already passed the time in which my father _insisted_ I would become conservative and have very much not developed anything like the conservative values of modern America. Though, maybe it's just that conservatism has drastically changed since the 70s. For instance, i certainly have become less insistent on things like UBI and more realistic about single payer Healthcare, but i have not developed disdain for illegal immigrants, the desire to force birth, anti-gay marriage, anti-trans, etc. Were these perquisites to be conservative in the 70s? I'd say im fiscally slightly left, but socially i simply cannot understand the rights positions, it just sounds like hater shit to me reply vixen99 1 hour agorootparentprevAre you conflating fascism with conservatism? Stalin was a socialist, a fascist and a conservative in the sense in which the 'c' word indicates 'maintenance of the status quo'. Certainly conservatives like to conserve & we hope that means saving that which is generally considered worth conserving though opinions differ when it comes to the details. Hitler was a national socialist and most definitely a fascist. Unregulated powerful elements in any society will always tend towards a degree of compulsion to maintain their status and we're not short of examples in the West. 'and the more their personal experience of the world must be maintained, protected.' is merely an assertion which you choose to believe. I'm sure examples can be found but also plenty of counter examples. You can't generalize. reply andrepd 6 hours agorootparentprevIndeed.

Father had died 3 years ago from heart attack at 42. His last words to my mother: \"Educate the kids\". She did her best, given that my grandfather was old fashioned and had stopped her from going to school after she became twelve, although she was among the smartest in her class. That Christmas she had bought me the brand new then Sinclair ZX81 personal computer. We were visiting the grandparents in a small village near Athens. I spend the night by the fireplace with a small portable TV and the machine, typing in games published in the UK PC magazines of that time and occasionally watching the Chrstmas shows.

I had asked my mother for it and she delivered. Since you asked for the greek market I can share one more memory. About a year later, 1982, I wanted to upgrade to Texas Instruments TI-99/4A so I tried to see a machine up close going to the local representative. I ended up at the \"company's HQ\" which was a small residence appartment in the fifth floor of a building. I found the door open so I entered a room full with boxes thrown around randomely. After waiting alone for an awkward period of 5-10 minutes, the owner of the company himself emerges from the bathroom with a wet face and kind of surprised to see me. He listened to what I wanted. \"It's somewhere there, go and have a look\" it's all what he said. He couldn't care less. 13 years later I had my own small company and reselling PC and equimpent was part of the job. The man with the wet face was one of the biggest suppliers in Greece, since besides Texas Instruments he moved on to be the representative of Intel and Microsoft and reseller of many others and the company became on of the biggest in Greece. Maybe his mentality (\"there it is, go and have a look\") never changed much though, because a couple decades later the company went bankrupt. reply nopakos 10 hours agoparentprevHeartwarming story!

I was born in Istanbul, a sprawling, chaotic city that's a fascinating blend of thousands of cultures. Christmas was always a thing there, even under an Islamist regime. As a non-believer, I never cared much for religious holidays, but I did enjoy the cozy decorations and sipping Glühwein (mulled wine). Beyond that, it didn't mean much to me. Now I live in Germany. My first Christmas here, back in 2009, was quite different. I was alone in a rented room provided by my employer, watching TV shows I couldn't understand on a tiny screen, just trying to pass the time. My laptop wasn't working (the charging cable was broken), and I was bored out of my mind. Around 6 PM, there was a knock on the door. It was my employer, heading to a hippie-style gathering in the forest to celebrate Christmas. He figured I might be alone and decided to come in person since I hadn't answered my phone. Of course, I said yes, and it turned out to be one of the most heartwarming experiences of my life. The group was incredibly kind, and even though I was the only foreigner, they went out of their way to make me feel included (switching to English when talking to each other, for example). The setting was magical: small fires inside carved logs, nature-themed decorations, and delicious food I'd never tasted before. I was so happy. That day, my love for Germany grew a hundredfold. reply Alex-Programs 10 hours agoparentThis is sweet.

We went from just having dinner to now exchanging presents and spending time together as a family. My wife is from the US and grew up with Christmas being a very big deal (and lavish with presents). She took it to the next level once we got together. Now, with kids, it's taken on a new life. So, I guess my real answer: Christmas just gets better every year.

I came from a middle class background and flying back to Canada would have been a significant cost (especially since my scholarship came with a living allowance which was only paid while I was in the UK) so I stayed in Oxford. My third year in college, we had a new Warden (head of college) and while he, like all the other academic staff, generally vacated the college over Christmas, he felt obliged to offer Christmas hospitality. So he sent out an email to the entire student population: \"Any students in college over Christmas are welcome to come to the Warden's Lodge for afternoon tea at 3pm on Christmas Day.\" -- and as I was the only student in college over the vacation, I had a lovely afternoon talking to the Warden and his wife. Graduate students generally don't have much interaction with college academic life -- undergrads usually meet with the Warden every term, but grad students are left to the academic departments to supervise -- so it was a rare and precious opportunity. reply jimbokun 13 hours agoparentSounds like a very Harry at Hogwarts kind of Christmas! reply pid-1 6 hours agoparentprevInteresting, I had a similar experience as an exchange student in Britain. reply delibaltas 7 hours agoparentprevI have seen movies starting like this. reply neofrommatrix 13 hours agoprevIndian (Hindu) here who went to a Catholic convent back home.

It was fairly average refractor on a wooden tripod but, growing up in an environment where things like that weren't the norm, I didn't understand that at the time. On Christmas day my family, my aunts and uncles and cousins, would all cram themselves into my grandparent's small council house for Christmas dinner. Then the kids would play with their toys and try not to get stood on by the slighly tipsy adults. Too many people in too small a space, but I have happy memories. When it got dark, that time, I took my new scope out into my grandparent's small front garden to look at the moon and try (unsuccessfully as I remember) to locate a planet. It was very cold, and people wandering past kept asking me what I was doing. I could hear everyone indoors talking and laughing. Eventually it started to snow very lightly, so I packed up and stood watching the snow for a while and then went back indoors. That was amost fifty years ago, but I remember how my universe suddenly got hugely bigger that day. And the snowflakes coming down in the dark. I passed the telescope on to five year old friend a few years ago. I don't know what she makes of it though: she can get images from the Hubble and James Webb on her tablet, if she wants. Merry Christmas everyone. reply MarcusE1W 9 hours agoprevMerry Christmas everyone. Every year it reminds me how I eventually became an IT professional. My parents took us children to the village restaurant before Christmas. Must have been 1983. Then we were asked what we wish for Christmas and I had not really thought about that, yet. Some of my friends have been talking about a computer. I had no idea what exactly that meant or what to use it for but it sounded cool. Computer. Also I knew that the brand was Commodore. So when asked what I want for Christmas I said \"A Commodore computer\". The next day it dawned on me that it might be a good idea to find out what my Christmas wish actually was. In a toy catalog I found a Commodore C64 computer and decided that must be my Christmas whish. I started collecting the limited info that was publicly availabe about computer. In a proper Christmas story I would get my C64 and live happily ever after. But my parents were not sure if such an expensive present should be bought. My mother found a book about the basics of Computers though and I got that later for birthday. Now I really wanted one. I sometimes took a 30 min. Bus ride to the neighbour university town and there was a department store with a computer department and you were allowed to try them. So all you had to do is use the book to prepare some BASIC programme at home in paper. Take the bus, find a free computer in the store, key the programme in, hope that it works on that version of BASIC and you had a programme. 2 years later my parents seemed convinced that I really wanted a computer and got me a C128. Much better BASIC for structured programming. And from then I happily lived ever after. Or so. reply yodsanklai 8 hours agoparentWas going to share a very similar story, I got my first computers for Christmas. We got first a C64 which got me into \"programming\", but I think it was the Amiga which made me the happiest. It was such an upgrade compared to the C64. Whenever I feel stress, overworked, or frustrated with colleagues as an IT professional, I remember what got me into programming and all the fun I had with these computers. reply MarcusE1W 3 hours agorootparentThe Amiga was my second computer too.

Thanks for this great website where it is possible to have intellectual discussions no matter what odd and lonely place one might be living in. :-) I have had to recreate Christmas for my family on my own - my wife is Turkish and although she is not highly religious (especially about food!) it was not a \"thing\" for her for most of her life. When I was living in Istanbul with her, Christmas was just another working day although I noticed a somewhat wistful attitude - people who sort of wished to join in but felt they were on the outside. The occasional Christmas tree. It was very odd for me. I couldn't surmount those odds and I also had never had to be the initiator. When my mum died years and years ago, everything died. Back in the UK it's easier and I have a daughter so I HAVE to make it happen. I'm not that good at it but today my daughter, without telling me, filled my christmas stocking :-) So the bug has caught on. :-) Now it's time to have breakfast and open presents from under the tree. I wish a very joyful day to everyone. I risk controversy by saying that Christmas was not originally a religious festival and whatever religion you are, you're not excluded from enjoying it. It was a \"middle-of-winter\" party and I think it was to keep Northern Europeans spirits up at the darkest time of the year. That it has turned into \"good will to all men\" is great but it isn't owned by any church. reply samanthasu 11 hours agoprevI am Sam.

My dad set up \"some new movie\" to play in our basement but said he couldn't get Home Alone, saying it cost too much, sorry. We eagerly watched the title intro which in retrospect, was obviously Home Alone. Once the oldest sibling finally read \"Home Alone\" we all completely lost our minds. We even have this whole thing on video. reply tasty_freeze 3 hours agoprevI grew up in a family with eight kids. Mom was stay at home and Dad did well, but with eight kids each individual kid received a few mostly modest presents. When I was in college and home for Thanksgiving, my folks invited everyone out to dinner. After ordering, my dad would often introduce a topic of discussion that we'd bat around until the food came. That year he said: if you didn't need to worry about money or success, what other career path might you find interesting. Without much thought I said, I'd like to play electric bass, due to the fact that when I listened to albums, I was really mostly following the bass. I don't even recall what my other siblings said. On Christmas day there were the usual gifts: socks and underwear, a couple of new shirts, and a book or two. But after that was all done, my dad said: tomorrow when the music store is open, let's go buy a bass. It was a $200 hondo (a fender p-bass knockoff) and a 15 watt Crate amp. What an extravagant gift! I'm 60 now and still playing, though never professionally. :-) reply bradleyy 3 hours agoparentI also play electric bass, and love this story.

Most notibly the Sega Genesis and z scale trains I got in '94/'95/'96 (not sure the exact year, I was very young) and GameBoy Color in '99. I got a Xbox in '01, Xbox 360 in '05; but they didn't quite have the same \"magic\" that they had when I was young. Also as a young kid, watching the Rankin Bass stop motion movies on the days leading up to Christmas. Then talking with my brother and sister while we tried (failed) to sleep on Christmas Eve, watching more and more obscure Christmas cartoons and whatever else would come on TV late on Christmas Eve night/Christmas morning. The best non-Christmas morning memories were just random times I was at family Christmas parties or gatherings. Seeing aunts, uncles, and cousins dancing talking having fun. As a kid, we used to have the parties at family homes, which was always fun and super memorable. Later we moved to a hall as the family got bigger and cousins started to bring their children, in laws, and friends. I can't really point out any particular memory as good; just all the time spent with family, not necessarily caring about what else was going on in the world at the time. reply MarkMarine 14 hours agoparentMy grandmother broke the Christmas gift rules with my parents and got my brother and I a NES, Tetris, duck hunt with the gun, and I believe the Olympics with the power mat. Christmas windfall I’ll never forget, seeing my parents faces drop as we opened all those games and just ignored every other present. Grandma had a nack for tweaking my mom any way she could, one of the meanest people I’ve ever met in my life but this year our interests aligned. My mom was enthralled by Tetris, better at the game than anyone in the house by a good 10 levels, and basically impossible to depose from the controller.

Instead of focusing on toys and games, he often chose books (scientific) and kits (RadioShack). While today you can easily find gifts that combine fun and learning, growing up in the '70s and '80s, it was usually one or the other. That’s not to say I didn’t enjoy a good toy or game—they could also stimulate imagination and creativity—but it was the books and kits that truly shaped who I would become. I also had an aunt who loved giving magazine subscriptions. Thanks to her, I had long-running subscriptions to Discover, Scientific American, Omni, and later BYTE. And, of course, the most important one of all: Dungeon! reply jakebasile 13 hours agoprevMerry Christmas! I had rented Final Fantasy 7 from Blockbuster so many times that my brother decided to get it for me for Christmas. Even though I never really snooped for presents he decided to mess with my head and wrapped it in two large bath towels and put it in an even larger box. This giant package below the tree for me, and it sounded like cloth - I figured it must've been a jacket or something until I opened it. Another time I was looking for something (not presents) in my parent's room, and happened to find a very poorly hidden Playstation 2 from my father. The waiting until Christmas part was fitting punishment for accidental snooping. Some of the finest memories are just a jumble of similar situations though. Christmas Eve was the night my entire local family would gather at my maternal grandmother's house, and we'd all have a big meal and sit around chatting afterwards. Then there's that one Christmas Eve when I asked my now-wife to marry me. I knew she'd say yes but there's always that little bit of fear about it. I wanted to ask when everyone I loved would be around. Time sure flies.

Up until I was about 10 years old, my family would drive to my grandparents’ house every year to celebrate Christmas Eve with my extended family. We’d track Santa using the NORAD Santa tracker (which, by coincidence, reports Santa being in San Francisco as I type this) and open presents from my grandparents. One year, I got a Kindle Fire, which was the first computing device I called my own. Because I didn’t have my own computer and the family computer was usually being used, I did most of my early programming on the Kindle by downloading an app called AIDE that allowed me to compile Android apps on Android (of which the Kindle ran a modified version) and sideload them. By the time next Christmas had rolled around, I’d built my first complete Android application—a graphing calculator complete with support for basic algebraic expressions, trigonometric functions, and a page that explained what every supported mathematical function did and how it worked. I was so excited to show my cousins and grandparents. reply taatparya 5 hours agoprevAt our company, we celebrated Christmas today exchanging gifts despite not having a single Christian person in our staff.

PS1 has got to be my most memorable gift. That loading screen is burned into the OLED of my subconscious. I like how jakebasile put it though: > Some of the finest memories are just a jumble of similar situations though. Archetypical Xmas AM is me, my brother, and my mom. It was always a huge exercise of my willpower to wait for my brother (5 years older, lifelong night owl) to wake up. My single mom would always lavish us in gifts. We were relatively poor in our area; Xmas was the day she made us feel as wealthy as kings. I later learned that she sometimes racked up huge credit card debt to give us this experience. I haven't done an Xmas tree for myself in years but when our baby comes I will for sure revive that magical experience for her. In the late AM we would drive over to my aunt/uncle/cousins and enjoy bagels, talk about the gifts we got, and watch movies. Everyone stayed in cozy pajamas all day, I think that's a small but important part of why this day often felt different. In later years Xmas Eve is now my fondest jumble of memories. Growing up, we did not have people at the house. I resented my mom's antisociality a bit. But then one year, the family member who usually hosted Xmas Eve said they were tired of it. Quite the surprise to everyone when my mom said she would host the next party! She's now been hosting it for 10+ years and it's always a good time every year. I'm very proud of her for coming out of her shell and being the sturdy/reliable anchor that brings the family together every year. reply germandiago 8 hours agoprevMerry Christmas. Feliz Navidad.

However, the Christmas gift I’ll never forget was my first DVD player. It was a discounted Proscan model, but still cost a bundle back when VHS was the dominant format. While fiddling with the menu for The Matrix, I stumbled upon the commentary track which I had no understanding of. I finally pieced together that I was listening to the directors talk about the movie as they watched it, as if we were in the same room together.

If someone wanted to buy a licence to use this - whatever it might be - the discussion would be between the social media platform and the licensee. the original author of the work would not have any stake in that theoretical situation.

And the ASCII was for communicating by pointing the camera on the mars rover, because it couldn't be positioned precisely enough for 26 different positions. reply elygre 6 hours agorootparentprevI love how that’s the hardest thing to believe. reply sudhirj 3 hours agorootparentWhy, wasn’t The Martian an example of hard sci-fi, a story that conforms strongly to the known laws of physics? Not necessarily probability, economics or politics, but hard sci-fi is written to be plausible. reply simpaticoder 2 hours agorootparentThe story is enjoyable, but like most such tales is amounts to building a string of deadly obstacles for the protagonist and then giving him just enough to survive each one. (FWIW the least realistic step was the ship turning around to get him, because spaceships typically don't carry any extra fuel. But in general there were too many resources lying around for him to use, especially the unattended lift vehicle. The plutonium core and the potatoes were a nice touch, though.) reply dclowd9901 15 hours agorootparentprevI mean, why even use an ASCII table at that point? For initial comm you could just do A=0, B=1 etc. for initial comms (until you get to the point you want to reprogram the eeprom) you can have higher bandwidth communication. reply hoten 14 hours agorootparentIf I remember correctly, the book addressed this. 26 division of a circle was too much for reliable determination of which sign the camera was pointing at, so 16 (hex) made the angles more workable. If we're talking efficiency, I wonder why he didn't consider Morse code. Well I guess that's easy, even though it's faster it takes a skilled operator to read it in realtime, and he had little time to write any individual bit of information down (cumbersomely writing in sand is slow) reply Thorrez 11 hours agorootparentYou can't represent 26 possibilities with a single hex digit. So it'll require 2 hex digits. If you're going to require 2 digits, then that can be done with 2 decimal digits as well. So there's no need for hex, and no need for ascii tables. However, if you need more than just the 26 letters, e.g. if you also need numbers and/or punctuation, then ascii might be useful, and hex might be useful to encode ascii into 2 digits. reply vasco 10 hours agorootparentIf I send you this: 48697468657265 Why do I need to send it to you 2 digits at a time? It's valid hex that converts to ascii, only 1 symbol at a time, which is how he communicated. He could've done it with just a card for 0 and another for 1 if he really wanted. reply Thorrez 10 hours agorootparentI didn't say it needs to be sent 2 digits at a time. The points of my previous comment: * Ascii is only needed if we need to encode things other than just letters (or if case matters). * Hex is only better than decimal if hex allows the number of digits to be reduced. If we need to only encode 26 elements, then hex doesn't reduce the number of digits compared to decimal, so hex has no advantage over decimal in the 26-element case. Using just 0 or 1 will increase the number of digits needed, so has a clear disadvantage compared to hex or decimal. reply vasco 8 hours agorootparent> Hex is only better than decimal if hex allows the number of digits to be reduced. If we need to only encode 26 elements, then hex doesn't reduce the number of digits compared to decimal, so hex has no advantage over decimal in the 26-element case He had more than 26 things to encode, I believe he started with numbers, letters and a question mark. > Using just 0 or 1 will increase the number of digits needed, so has a clear disadvantage compared to hex or decimal Using 0 or 1 decreases that to only 3 cards (including question mark), and increasing the safety margin to 120° on the setup he had.

Moreover, what happens if the tank reaches capacity? reply kevin_thibedeau 19 hours agoparentIt's recycled as drinking water on ISS. For the shuttle, it was dumped creating an ice cloud that was visible from the ground with the sun in the right position. https://www.space.com/7274-mystery-explained-glow-night-sky-... reply dylan604 19 hours agoparentprevIt is filtered and reused as drinking water. reply lostlogin 19 hours agoparentprevShipping water is not ideal, I’m all for filtration and reuse.

Though the precise permutation atoms could be new. reply lostlogin 16 hours agorootparentOf for sure. It’s just that it’s a bit too close to home when you know who’s piss it is you’re drinking. I’m more ok with diplodocus piss. reply gruturo 16 hours agorootparentThe Expanse (book series) has a nice quote about water that \"had been piss and tears and sweat and blood.

Been a few years). reply gosub100 1 hour agorootparentI can't remember the original source but I recall a pseudo inspirational quote that X atoms in your body were once part of Michaelengelo (or some other famous person).

Not too hard to do engineering wise reply jaennaet 15 hours agoparentOh believe me I would have used that metric if there was one, but apparently there is no fecal storage tank as such; your poop is collected in a bag by the Universal Waste Management System or UWMS (which is what you call a space toilet when you're NASA and don't want to say \"space toilet\"), and those bags are stashed in a \"removable fecal storage canister\". Some of those canisters are returned to Earth \"for evaluation\" (\"yup, it's poop\"), but most are loaded onto a cargo ship that is then burned up on re-entry. Couldn't see any obvious telemetry for the UWMS' urine / feces separatator fan system kajigger either (the \"Dual Fan Separator\" + sort of gearbox, because apparently a space toilet needs a gearbox.)

      "pISSStream is a macOS menu bar application that displays the real-time status of the International Space Station's (ISS) urine tank capacity.- The app is developed using Swift and macOS, marking the developer's first attempt, which may result in potential bugs and limited error handling.- The data for the app is sourced from the ISS Mimic project, although the developer does not plan to include additional statistics from the source."

    "commentSummary": [
      "A macOS menu bar app displays the real-time status of the International Space Station (ISS) urine tank, inspired by ISS-Mimic data, and is available on GitHub.",
      "Created by jaennaet as a Swift learning project, the app humorously explores open-source communication and non-goals, sparking discussions on space waste management and potential developments.",

First, the T vs. t in T * sin(t) doesn't mean anything, right? Second, the ' in the title T * sin(t)' doesn't belong, right? Then I think that this is graphing essentially (t * sin(t), t * cos(t), t + something), which is a cone if the something is constant, which I believe it is—and that certainly matches the graph.

I did my PhD in algebraic topology, but studied lots of topology so was familiar with this material. I doubt I could ever have explained these concepts so clearly or tied the esoteric world of topology to a \"practical\" problem. Since my PhD I've had a couple of careers and ended up as a research software engineer working on AI. I often feel nostalgic about pure math (maybe even a little regretful I left academic math). But I think it'd be almost impossible for me to return to academic math. The 3B1B videos always remind me that math is available to all and you don't have to be a working mathematician to enjoy, learn, and even discover, new math. You don't have to be employed as a mathematician in a university. reply noqc 43 minutes agoparentThe original understanding of a manifold was simply a \"configuration space\", which is very concrete, so I'm not sure what you mean that you are surprised that the world of topology could be practical. reply jebarker 28 minutes agorootparentI didn't say I'm surprised the world of topology could be practical. I said that _I_ wouldn't have been able to explain the concepts in the video so clearly and tie them to a practical problem. reply gcanyon 1 hour agoprevI’ve known about the möbius strip since I was a kid, and the idea of existence proofs based on continuous functions having to cross since my early teens. The idea that the möbiu strip is more than a pointless novelty has never occurred to me, and now I feel like I have to apologize to that object for dismissing it so cavalierly. Its role in this proof is remarkable and a wonderful brain tickle. reply Oarch 9 hours agoprevIt's great that he revisited this problem. It was his original video on this topic which had me instantly hooked to 3B1B all those years ago. reply CT4u8798 4 hours agoprevI have no clue about maths beyond extremely basic stuff, but am fascinated by this sort of thing, and I need pictures to understand stuff like this. What an excellent video. During it, when they introduced how you can map the 2D to 3 dimensions, my initial thought was \"I wonder if this is how you could map 3D into the 4th dimension?\". Then later they mentioned 4 dimensions. This is something I cannot visualise or really understand. reply klysm 1 hour agoparent> I have no clue about maths beyond extremely basic stuff, but am fascinated by this sort of thing, and I need pictures to understand stuff like this. Fascination is all you need. I find many people have a lot of self-limiting beliefs around math. There’s many reasons for them to develop, but I firmly believe that many people are legitimately interested in mathematics and have the capability despite their beliefs. reply chrsw 3 hours agoparentprevI gave up on trying to visualize 4 dimensions. I don't know if it's possible. Instead I just try to think of 4D as more of ideas and less geometry: rules, consequences, capabilities, etc. We can do the same thing in 3 dimensions by saying things like \"two objects can't exist at the same place and at the same time\" or \"parallel lines meet at infinity\" or \"parallel lines never meet\" or something. We usually don't do that for 3 dimensions because we have visualizations and intuitions which we can use instead of breaking everything down formally all the time. reply BriggyDwiggs42 1 hour agorootparentThere’s a video from the same channel on visualizing quaternions as a projection into 3d that was really fun for this. Only a restricted section of a 4d space, but i feel like the principle generalizes a little because of the idea of, like, imagining one 3d space thats finite as equivalent to an infinite 3d space, just stretched reply whatshisface 2 hours agorootparentprevTime is nature's forth dimension, so I think considering the various stages of a slice moving through a four dimensional object at once counts as a visualization. reply CT4u8798 2 hours agorootparentDonnie Darko style. reply klysm 1 hour agoprev3b1b shows us what’s possible in math pedagogy.

Excellent prof, and we still laugh over the looks of despair he gave us when we didn't get something. reply Darthy 7 hours agoprevI've got a problem with that video that starts at 4:15. He seems to jump to the conclusion that for every midpoint there is only 1 distance. But that midpoint is formed by picking 2 points on the edge, and one could easily pick two other points on the edge that have the same midpoint (but have a different distance). He did not address that point at that point in the video, and for the next 2 minutes I kept raising that point in my mind. After he continued down that path not addressing that point, I felt that I must have missed something, or that more intelligent math viewers would have solved that open question in the mind in seconds and I am not mathematically inclined enough to be the target audience. And I stopped watching that video. I think good educational videos are the result of a process where a trial audience raises such points and the video gets constantly refined, so that the end video is even good for people who question every point. reply Masterjun 6 hours agoparentHe addresses this at 9:00 in the video. You're thinking of a function graph, but he never made a function. He just sets up a visualization of a set of 3D points. reply darthoctopus 7 hours agoparentprevthis is not a conclusion that he jumps to! all that is stated is that there is a mapping from every pair of points on a curve to a set of 3D coordinates specified by their midpoints and distances. there is no requirement for uniqueness here. in fact, the whole point of this is to turn the search for an inscribed rectangle into the search for two pairs of points on the curve that have the same midpoint and distance --- this is stated just 1 min 15 seconds after the timestamp that you point out. reply mauricioc 3 hours agoparentprevThe function defined in the video is \"Given a pair of points A and B on the curve, output (x, y, z), where (x, y) is the midpoint and z is the length of the segment connecting A and B\", and the pictures are of its image, not its graph. But if you define it visually, then it's very natural to misunderstand it the way you did, since the picture looks a lot like a function graph of a function which takes midpoints (instead of pairs of points) and returns the distance corresponding to that midpoint (which is not well-defined, as you pointed out). If this happens, the viewer is then completely lost, since the rest of the video is dedicated to explaining that the domain of this function is a Möbius strip when you consider it to consist of unordered pairs of points {A, B} (as one should). Ultimately, if you don't have a 100% formal version of a given statement, some people will find a interpretation different from the intended one (and this is independent of how clever the audience is!). I think 3Blue1Brown knows this and is experimenting with alternate formats; the video is also available as an interactive blog post (https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/inscribed-rect-v2) which explicitly defines the function as \"f(A, B) = (x, y, z)\" and explains what the variables are. The fact that \"given a large enough audience (even of very smart people), there will be different interpretations of any given informal explanation\" is a key challenge in teaching mathematics, since it is very unpredictable. In interactive contexts it is possible to interrupt a lecture and ask questions, but it still provides an incentive to focus on formalism, which can leave less time for explaining visualizations and intuition. reply looneysquash 1 hour agoparentprevI'm don't feel like I really get the distinction between a mapping and a function, or a visualization and a graph. But he was careful to point out that it wasn't a graph. To me the key point is that the input is all three variables, the two points and their midpoint, and not just the midpoint. reply raincole 3 hours agoparentprev> I think good educational videos are the result of a process where a trial audience raises such points and the video gets constantly refined, so that the end video is even good for people who question every point. It would be at least as long as a one-semester course in typical math major then. To address your specific question: he doesn't assume each midpoint has only one distance at all. He doesn't say it and the visualization doesn't show it as so. reply Avshalom 7 hours agoparentprevhe maps two points (by using their midpoint) and a distance to the (x,y,foo) if it was two different points with the same midpoint but different distance it would map to (x,y,bar) reply suryajena 7 hours agoparentprevGreat point now we can raise the issue and he will do a revision 3, with even better explanation for those issues just like in the books. reply madihaa 2 hours agoprevThis video has now taught me what topology is. reply suryajena 7 hours agoprevThis video if it was a scientific paper I would have visualised absolutely nothing. I don't know that if we can submit/embed animations instead of PDFs for university classroom work/ scientific papers, because that's really much better than having to read papers/PDFs that is so incomplete without the right imagination/visualization of the problem. The last time I was giving a mock seminar in my university using a GIF to explain the RRT algorithm I was warned to not use animations in presentations . . . I mean either it was really not that helpful to visualise the solution or it has to do something with age old standards that needs to be revised. I mean figures can only do 3 or 4 frames isn't more frames better. reply jltsiren 3 hours agoparentIf you need to visualize an algorithm in a talk, the usual approach is having a few slides representing the key steps instead of an actual animation. That way you can adapt the pace to the audience, stop to answer questions about any individual frame, and jump back to previous frames when necessary. People often find animations on slides distracting, and the forced pace is almost certainly wrong. And if the animation is longer than a few seconds, the talk stops being a talk and becomes an awkward video presentation instead. reply klysm 1 hour agorootparent> People often find animations on slides distracting, and the forced pace is almost certainly wrong. I completely disagree. Animations can be appropriate, but people have formed dogmatic generalizations due to shitty use of gifs reply dsign 3 hours agoparentprevCareful where you say that :-) In 2002, when I was doing my second year at college, my professor was cool enough to let me submit an animation of the self-balancing insertion algorithm for AVL trees. Those were the years of Macromedia Flash and Director. It was a cool project, and I wish I had kept the files. Overall, it was a highly technical thing. Twenty and so years later, I still do animations, even if only as a hobby. These days I use Blender, Houdini, and my own Python scripts and node systems, and my purpose is purely artistic. Something that is as true today as it was twenty years ago is that computer animation remains highly technical. If an artist wants to animate some dude moving around, they will need to understand coordinate systems, rotations, directed acyclic graphs and things like that. Plus a big bunch of specific DCC concepts and idiosyncrasies. The trade is such that one may end up having to implement their own computational geometry algorithms. Those in turn require a good understanding of general data structures and algorithms, and of floating point math and when to upgrade it or ditch it and switch to exact fractions. Topology too becomes a tool for certain needs; for example, one may want to animate the surface of a lake and find out that a mapping from 3D to 2D and back is a very handy tool[^1]. I daresay that creating a Word or even a Latex document with some (or a lot of) formulas remains easier. But if I were the director of a school and a student expressed that videos are easier to understand, I would use it as an excuse to force everybody to learn the computer animation craft. [^1]: Of course it's also possible to do animations by simply drawing everything by hand in two dimensions, but that requires its own set of skills and talent, and it is extremely labor-intensive. It's also possible to use AI, but getting AI to create a good, coherent and consistent animation is still an open problem. reply formerly_proven 5 hours agoparentprevPDF supports embedded, interactively manipulatable 2D and 3D graphics/objects. reply atoav 4 hours agorootparentThat word \"support\" does a lot of heavy lifting there.

Sometimes you've gotta rewind or pause and think about what's being said to make sense of it. I do understand that sometimes videos go way too fast and leave tons of stuff out and that's very frustrating but 3b1b is a pillar of the community for very careful and complete descriptions of things. But then also the \"tainment\" part would signal that there's no need to watch if you're not interested. But all this could be my bias of having some math background, though never having studied topology or even analysis from anything like a class or textbook. Felt like the video was aimed directly at people like me reply mettamage 5 hours agoparentprevI disagree, I'm not well-versed in math but I felt I could follow most of it. What I don't get though is the jump from the mobius strip to the klein bottle. He just goes and does it and duplicates the surface to reflect it to the original one. I do understand to some extent that once you have to assume the klein bottle is the shape you're looking for that because it's self intersecting, it must mean that you have 2 different points on that same surface and therefore 2 lines of equal length with the same midpoint. reply scrollaway 5 hours agorootparentThe point of the jump is that if you want to track an extra coordinate and visualize it with the restrictions he mentions, then the klein bottle is the correct topology (the correct \"visualization\"). reply mettamage 1 hour agorootparentOh, so you mean to say that: 1. The positive surface is for tracking one midpoint for coordinates A and B 2. The negative surface is for tracking another midpoint for coordinates C and D Together it's a klein bottle. Klein bottle's always intersect, so therefore there's always an intersection of the two midpoints, which is why there's a set of points A, B, C and D such that line segments A and B are equally long as C and D going through the same midpoint. reply pfdietz 2 hours agorootparentprevThe surface with the interior of the loop added forms something called a projective plane. A Klein bottle is just two projective planes glued together. Neither can be embedded in R^3 without intersections. reply sizzzzlerz 3 hours agoparentprevIn many ways, I agree. I have an engineer's understanding of math for my discipline but topology is most definitely not one of them. Through his graphics, I could most follow the gist of what he was attempting to get across but when it was over, I honestly had to ask my self, what did I just watch.

    "originBody": "Ruby A Programmer's Best Friend Home Downloads Documentation Libraries Community News Security About Ruby Menu Ruby 3.4.0 Released Posted by naruse on 25 Dec 2024 We are pleased to announce the release of Ruby 3.4.0. Ruby 3.4 adds it block parameter reference, change Prism as default parser, adds Happy Eyeballs Version 2 support to socket library, improves YJIT, adds Modular GC, and so on. it is introduced it is added to reference a block parameter with no variable name. [Feature #18980] ary = [\"foo\", \"bar\", \"baz\"] p ary.map { it.upcase } #=> [\"FOO\", \"BAR\", \"BAZ\"] it very much behaves the same as _1. When the intention is to only use _1 in a block, the potential for other numbered parameters such as _2 to also appear imposes an extra cognitive load onto readers. So it was introduced as a handy alias. Use it in simple cases where it speaks for itself, such as in one-line blocks. Prism is now the default parser Switch the default parser from parse.y to Prism. [Feature #20564] This is an internal improvement and there should be little change visible to the user. If you notice any compatibility issues, please report them to us. To use the conventional parser, use the command-line argument --parser=parse.y. The socket library now features Happy Eyeballs Version 2 (RFC 8305) The socket library now features Happy Eyeballs Version 2 (RFC 8305), the latest standardized version of a widely adopted approach for better connectivity in many programming languages, in TCPSocket.new (TCPSocket.open) and Socket.tcp. This improvement enables Ruby to provide efficient and reliable network connections, adapted to modern internet environments. Until Ruby 3.3, these methods performed name resolution and connection attempts serially. With this algorithm, they now operate as follows: Performs IPv6 and IPv4 name resolution concurrently Attempt connections to the resolved IP addresses, prioritizing IPv6, with parallel attempts staggered at 250ms intervals Return the first successful connection while canceling any others This ensures minimized connection delays, even if a specific protocol or IP address is delayed or unavailable. This feature is enabled by default, so additional configuration is not required to use it. To disable it globally, set the environment variable RUBY_TCP_NO_FAST_FALLBACK=1 or call Socket.tcp_fast_fallback=false. Or to disable it on a per-method basis, use the keyword argument fast_fallback: false. YJIT TL;DR Better performance across most benchmarks on both x86-64 and arm64 platforms. Reduced memory usage through compressed metadata and a unified memory limit. Various bug fixes: YJIT is now more robust and thoroughly tested. New features Command-line options --yjit-mem-size introduces a unified memory limit (default 128MiB) to track total YJIT memory usage, providing a more intuitive alternative to the old --yjit-exec-mem-size option. --yjit-log enables a compilation log to track what gets compiled. Ruby API RubyVM::YJIT.log provides access to the tail of the compilation log at run-time. YJIT stats RubyVM::YJIT.runtime_stats now always provides additional statistics on invalidation, inlining, and metadata encoding. New optimizations Compressed context reduces memory needed to store YJIT metadata Allocate registers for local variables and Ruby method arguments When YJIT is enabled, use more Core primitives written in Ruby: Array#each, Array#select, Array#map rewritten in Ruby for better performance [Feature #20182]. Ability to inline small/trivial methods such as: Empty methods Methods returning a constant Methods returning self Methods directly returning an argument Specialized codegen for many more runtime methods Optimize String#getbyte, String#setbyte and other string methods Optimize bitwise operations to speed up low-level bit/byte manipulation Support shareable constants in multi-ractor mode Various other incremental optimizations Modular GC Alternative garbage collector (GC) implementations can be loaded dynamically through the modular garbage collector feature. To enable this feature, configure Ruby with --with-modular-gc at build time. GC libraries can be loaded at runtime using the environment variable RUBY_GC_LIBRARY. [Feature #20351] Ruby’s built-in garbage collector has been split into a separate file at gc/default/default.c and interacts with Ruby using an API defined in gc/gc_impl.h. The built-in garbage collector can now also be built as a library using make modular-gc MODULAR_GC=default and enabled using the environment variable RUBY_GC_LIBRARY=default. [Feature #20470] An experimental GC library is provided based on MMTk. This GC library can be built using make modular-gc MODULAR_GC=mmtk and enabled using the environment variable RUBY_GC_LIBRARY=mmtk. This requires the Rust toolchain on the build machine. [Feature #20860] Language changes String literals in files without a frozen_string_literal comment now emit a deprecation warning when they are mutated. These warnings can be enabled with -W:deprecated or by setting Warning[:deprecated] = true. To disable this change, you can run Ruby with the --disable-frozen-string-literal command line argument. [Feature #20205] Keyword splatting nil when calling methods is now supported. **nil is treated similarly to **{}, passing no keywords, and not calling any conversion methods. [Bug #20064] Block passing is no longer allowed in index. [Bug #19918] Keyword arguments are no longer allowed in index. [Bug #20218] The toplevel name ::Ruby is reserved now, and the definition will be warned when Warning[:deprecated]. [Feature #20884] Core classes updates Note: We’re only listing notable updates of Core class. Exception Exception#set_backtrace now accepts an array of Thread::Backtrace::Location. Kernel#raise, Thread#raise and Fiber#raise also accept this new format. [Feature #13557] GC GC.config added to allow setting configuration variables on the Garbage Collector. [Feature #20443] GC configuration parameter rgengc_allow_full_mark introduced. When false GC will only mark young objects. Default is true. [Feature #20443] Ractor require in Ractor is allowed. The requiring process will be run on the main Ractor. Ractor._require(feature) is added to run requiring process on the main Ractor. [Feature #20627] Ractor.main? is added. [Feature #20627] Ractor.[] and Ractor.[]= are added to access the ractor local storage of the current Ractor. [Feature #20715] Ractor.store_if_absent(key){ init } is added to initialize ractor local variables in thread-safty. [Feature #20875] Range Range#size now raises TypeError if the range is not iterable. [Misc #18984] Standard Library updates Note: We’re only listing notable updates of Standard librarires. RubyGems Add --attestation option to gem push. It enabled to store signature to sigstore.dev Bundler Add a lockfile_checksums configuration to include checksums in fresh lockfiles Add bundle lock --add-checksums to add checksums to an existing lockfile JSON Performance improvements of JSON.parse about 1.5 times faster than json-2.7.x. Tempfile The keyword argument anonymous: true is implemented for Tempfile.create. Tempfile.create(anonymous: true) removes the created temporary file immediately. So applications don’t need to remove the file. [Feature #20497] win32/sspi.rb This library is now extracted from the Ruby repository to ruby/net-http-sspi. [Feature #20775] Compatibility issues Note: Excluding feature bug fixes. Error messages and backtrace displays have been changed. Use a single quote instead of a backtick as a opening quote. [Feature #16495] Display a class name before a method name (only when the class has a permanent name). [Feature #19117] Kernel#caller, Thread::Backtrace::Location’s methods, etc. are also changed accordingly. Old: test.rb:1:in `foo': undefined method `time' for an instance of Integer from test.rb:2:in `' New: test.rb:1:in 'Object#foo': undefined method 'time' for an instance of Integer from test.rb:2:in '' Hash#inspect rendering have been changed. [[Bug #20433]] Symbol keys are displayed using the modern symbol key syntax: \"{user: 1}\" Other keys now have spaces around =>: '{\"user\" => 1}', while previously they didn’t: '{\"user\"=>1}' Kernel#Float() now accepts a decimal string with decimal part omitted. [Feature #20705] Float(\"1.\") #=> 1.0 (previously, an ArgumentError was raised) Float(\"1.E-1\") #=> 0.1 (previously, an ArgumentError was raised) String#to_f now accepts a decimal string with decimal part omitted. Note that the result changes when an exponent is specified. [Feature #20705] \"1.\".to_f #=> 1.0 \"1.E-1\".to_f #=> 0.1 (previously, 1.0 was returned) Refinement#refined_class has been removed. [Feature #19714] Standard library compatibility issues DidYouMean DidYouMean::SPELL_CHECKERS[]= and DidYouMean::SPELL_CHECKERS.merge! are removed. Net::HTTP Removed the following deprecated constants: Net::HTTP::ProxyMod Net::NetPrivate::HTTPRequest Net::HTTPInformationCode Net::HTTPSuccessCode Net::HTTPRedirectionCode Net::HTTPRetriableCode Net::HTTPClientErrorCode Net::HTTPFatalErrorCode Net::HTTPServerErrorCode Net::HTTPResponseReceiver Net::HTTPResponceReceiver These constants were deprecated from 2012. Timeout Reject negative values for Timeout.timeout. [Bug #20795] URI Switched default parser to RFC 3986 compliant from RFC 2396 compliant. [Bug #19266] C API updates rb_newobj and rb_newobj_of (and corresponding macros RB_NEWOBJ, RB_NEWOBJ_OF, NEWOBJ, NEWOBJ_OF) have been removed. [Feature #20265] Removed deprecated function rb_gc_force_recycle. [Feature #18290] Miscellaneous changes Passing a block to a method which doesn’t use the passed block will show a warning on verbose mode (-w). [Feature #15554] Redefining some core methods that are specially optimized by the interpeter and JIT like String.freeze or Integer#+ now emits a performance class warning (-W:performance or Warning[:performance] = true). [Feature #20429] See NEWS or commit logs for more details. With those changes, 4942 files changed, 202244 insertions(+), 255528 deletions(-) since Ruby 3.3.0!

But looks like Ruby joins the growing list of languages that have hand-written parsers, apparently working with generated parsers turned out to be even harder in the long run. That said, replacing a ~16k line parse.y[1] with a 22k line prism.c[2] is a pretty bold move.

To start having a sense of what it means, you need to be more acquainted with the topic at end. It's not that uncommon to have an implementation with code that is lengthier but with an obvious pattern, while the smarter compressed implementation whose understanding is not necessary trivial to grab even for people seasoned to metaprogramming, reflexivity and so on. Not to say that is what happen here, the point here was to recall that number of lines is not an absolute linear metrics. reply PittleyDunkin 11 hours agoparentprevI'm pretty sure the only reason people ever used parser generators is that it allows a language that vaguely resembles the formal description of the target language. I always found them very confusing to write, confusing to debug, and much less efficient than writing your own. It's actually pretty straightforward once you get the tokenization and lookahead working. reply pests 11 hours agorootparentAgreed. Parser generators are a magic black box. Parsing is not too difficult, there is some actual computer science in some spots, but I think parsing should be a core complacency of a programming language to unlock full potential. reply capitol_ 9 hours agorootparentA very very long list of CVEs disagrees with that parsers are \"not too difficult\". reply Blackthorn 2 hours agorootparentBinary formats are rarely context free. reply supriyo-biswas 8 hours agorootparentprevBinary format parsing != Programming language parsing. reply viraptor 7 hours agoparentprevIt seems like you're ignoring the context/environment. Ruby has enough advanced developers, large enough test suite and enough people who care about performance, that it can tackle the parser as a longer project regardless of its complexity. The same thing will apply to other popular languages. But it won't apply to smaller projects with very localised parser use. In those cases writing anything custom would be a waste of time (and potential introduce bugs solved years ago in generators). reply lolinder 4 hours agorootparentHaving tried both on solo projects, I disagree: like other commenters here, I've found parser generators to be a big waste of time. Writing a parser by hand requires understanding the theory of parsing and understanding your implementation language. Writing a parser with a parser generator requires understanding the theory of parsing, your implementation language, and a gigantic black box that tries unsuccessfully to abstract away the theory of parsing. The time spent learning and troubleshooting the black box is almost always better spent putting together your own simple set of helper methods for writing a parser and then using them to write your own. The final result ends up being far easier to maintain than the version where you pull in a generator as a dependency. reply wenc 3 hours agorootparentParser generators handle a lot of edge cases for you and are battle tested. Unless I had a relatively simple grammar or had very strict performance requirements (like in the case of Ruby), I would not trust a hand rolled parser on a CFG by someone who isn’t dedicated to the craft. (PEGs are simpler so maybe). I’ve written recursive descent parsers by hand and they look very simple until you have to deal with ambiguous cases. reply plranw 4 hours agorootparentprevThe big plus of parser generators is that they report ambiguities. Handling conflicts is a pain but explicit. Do people who write predictive recursive descent parsers (LL(k)) really calculate first/follow sets by hand? What if the grammar requires backtracking? reply lolinder 3 hours agorootparentThere's nothing to stop you from writing out a grammar in some form that is intelligible to a verification tool and then implementing the grammar by hand. I almost always write out the grammar anyway because that's the design—without it I'm flying blind. The cost of the generator isn't writing out the grammar, it's in using the runtime code it generates, which is optional even if you want to use it for verification. reply badsectoracula 6 hours agoparentprev> I remember being taught to use yacc in our compiler course because \"writing it by hand is too hard\". But looks like Ruby joins the growing list of languages that have hand-written parsers, apparently working with generated parsers turned out to be even harder in the long run. I've been writing parsers for simple (and sometimes not so simple) languages ever since i was in middle school and learned about recursive descent parsing from a book (i didn't knew it was called like that back then, the book had a section on writing an expression parser and i just kept adding stuff) - that was in the 90s. I wonder why yacc, etc were made in the first place since to me they always felt more complicated and awkward to work with than writing a simple recursive descent parser that works with the parsed text or builds whatever structure you want. Was it resource constraints that by the 90s didn't really exist anymore but their need in previous decades ended up shaping how parsers were meant to be written? reply majewsky 5 hours agorootparentParser generators will tell you whether the grammar given to it is well-formed (according to whatever criteria the parser generator uses). When hand-rolling a parser, there could be accidental ambiguities in the definition of your grammar, which you don't notice because the recursive descent parser just takes whatever possibility happened to be checked first in your particular implementation. When that happens, future or alternative implementations will be harder to create because they need to be bug-for-bug compatible with whatever choice the reference implementation takes for those obscure edge cases. reply junek 6 hours agorootparentprevMy hot take is that the allure of parser-generators is mostly academic. If you're designing a language it's good practice to write out a formal grammar for it, and then it feels like it should be possible to just feed that grammar to a program and have it spit out a fully functional parser. In practice, parser generators are always at least a little disappointing, but that nagging feeling that it _should_ work remains. Edit: also the other sense of academic, if you have to teach students how to do parsing, and need to teach formal grammar, then getting two birds with one stone is very appealing. reply zelphirkalt 4 hours agorootparentIt is not academic. It is very practical to actually have a grammar and thus the possibility to use any language that has a perser generator. It is very annoying to have a great format, but no parser and no official grammar for the format available and being stuck with whatever tooling exists, because you would have to come up with a completely new grammar to implement a parser. reply junek 2 hours agorootparent> It is very practical to actually have a grammar I fully agree that you need to have a grammar for your language. > and thus the possibility to use any language that has a perser generator. See, this is where it falls down in my experience. You can't just feed \"the grammar\" straight into each generator, and you need to account for the quirks of each generator anyway. So the practical, idk, \"reusability\"... is much lower than it seems like it should be. If you could actually just write your grammar once and feed it to any parser generator and have it actually work then that would be cool. I just don't think it works out that way in practice. reply IshKebab 8 hours agoparentprevIt's not a \"growing list\" - the vast majority of languages use hand-written parsers. reply jjice 4 hours agoparentprevGood error reporting gets really tricky with generated parsers. That said, it can be a nice time saver for smaller things like DSLs and languages early on. Even then, yacc and bison are pretty solid overall. I believe Postgres still uses a yacc grammar today, as another high profile example. I'd arguebthr parsing of SQL is one or the least interesting thi.gs an RDBMS does, though. reply zelphirkalt 4 hours agoparentprevI can only imagine working with generated parsers to become more difficult, if the syntax of a language is highly ad-hoc or irregular, not elegant like concattenative, or lispy languages, or Smalltalk style, which is ironic, given Ruby's history. Maybe they added too many bells and whistles. In every other case having a grammar in form of parser generator macros should be better and preferrred, since it is well portable to other languages and tools and lends itself to be more readable (with good naming). reply dragonwriter 9 hours agoprevAlready outdated: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2024/12/25/ruby-3-4-1-rele... reply mtkd 9 hours agoparentI had just hit this issue (3.4.0 showing as 3.4.0dev in rbenv) and am having a coffee before looking at what is going on -- thanks for posting reply t-writescode 9 hours agoparentprevLol, oops.

For example, doing some loop unrolling for a piece of code with a known & small-enough fixed-size iteration. As another example, doing away with some dynamic dispatch / method lookup for a call site, or inlining methods - especially handy given Ruby's first class support for dynamic code generation, execution, redefinition (monkey patching). From https://railsatscale.com/2023-12-04-ruby-3-3-s-yjit-faster-w..., > In particular, YJIT is now able to better handle calls with splats as well as optional parameters, it’s able to compile exception handlers, and it can handle megamorphic call sites and instance variable accesses without falling back to the interpreter. > We’ve also implemented specialized inlined primitives for certain core method calls such as Integer#!=, String#!=, Kernel#block_given?, Kernel#is_a?, Kernel#instance_of?, Module#===, and more. It also inlines trivial Ruby methods that only return a constant value such as #blank? and specialized #present? from Rails. These can now be used without needing to perform expensive method calls in most cases. reply neonsunset 8 hours agoparentprevDuring their black friday / cyber monday load peak, Shopify averaged between ~0.85 and ~1.94 back-to-back RPS per CPU core.

Or if current GC is even a bottleneck anywhere in most Rails applications. Ruby's GC needs are likely to be very far from the needs of JVM and .NET languages, so I expect it to be both much simpler but also relatively sufficient for the time being. Default Ruby implementation uses GIL so the resulting allocation behavior is likely to be nowhere near the saturation of throughput of a competent GC design. Also, if you pay attention to the notes discussing the optimizations implemented in Ruby 3.4, you'll see that such JIT design is effectively in its infancy - V8, RyuJIT (and its predecessors) and OpenJDK's HotSpot did all this as a bare minimum more than 10 years ago.

At the time, I had no idea that Ruby did released every Christmas, but I found out a few months later when I got an email mentioning the package was out of date that day. Even though I haven't done much Ruby dev for years now, it's been a small little tradition of mine since then to update the package first thing every Christmas morning and push out the update (basically, just updating the version number in a file in a git repo and then running a couple commands to update the checksums and push the changes; nothing anywhere close to the amount of work that people who actually develop that tool do, let alone the people who work on the language!). I can't help but feel like that farmer from the meme saying \"it ain't much, but it's honest work\"; I enjoyed the little tradition I've built up and like thinking that maybe every now and then someone might have noticed and been pleased to get the updates without having to file a notice to remind me to update things (although it's happened a few times since that time years ago, I hope it hasn't been that often!). Just now, I was surprised to see that the package seems to be getting put into the official Arch repos, so my eight years of very minimal volunteer service seem to be at an end.

I wouldn't say niche, but the killer app of Ruby is Rails, a web framework similar to Django. In fact, many people treat them as they are the same.

Some are available, e.g. the window manager is here: https://github.com/vidarh/rubywm Beware that one of the joys of writing these for my own use is that I've only added the features I use, and fixed bugs that matter to me, and \"clean enough to be readable for me\" is very different from best practice for a bigger project. I'm slowly extracting the things I'm willing to more generally support into gems, though. reply speleding 10 hours agoparentprevIt's the language with the highest ratio of (useful work / LOC), so it's the least verbose language. This makes it very suitable to write and understand complex scripts, because the reduced boilerplate means less cognitive overhead for the programmer. As a result, experienced programmers can be extremely productive with it. The well-known Rails framework uses this to great effect, however, some people argue that the choice of \"convention over configuration\" and extensive use of meta-programming, derisively called \"magic\", make it less suitable for inexperienced teams because they get too much rope to hang themselves and the lack of explicitness starts working against you if you're not careful. reply continuational 9 hours agorootparentExperienced teams love magic? reply psychoslave 8 hours agorootparentIt depends which kind of magic.

Years ago, I used to primarily do Rails development. Recently I built some web apps that use a JVM backend (one app uses Java & Spring and the other Kotlin & Micronaut) and a React frontend. One thing I ended up really missing issue the the frameworks, especially with disjointed fronted, don't solve the standard issue of a request sending an invalid form entry and showing the validation errors on the form. I ended up building my own implementation of that which of course also requires a convention on message format.

[1] https://github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails reply oezi 9 hours agoparentprevRuby has the nicest object-oriented design (everything is an object) outside of smalltalk (IMHO). In contrast to the mess that is Python. For instance, in Ruby it is natural that each or map are methods of Array or Hash rather than global functions which receive an Array or Hash argument. This goes as far as having the not operator '!' as a method on booleans: false.! == true Once you have understood it, it is a very beautiful language. reply psychoslave 3 hours agorootparentYes, but it is not fully OO. Something like `if.class` generates an error, as opposed to returning some type such as \"Syncategoreme\". That might looks really anecdotal, but on practice for example that's is probably the biggest obstacle to providing fully localized version of Ruby for example. The second biggest challenge to do so would probably be the convention of using majuscule to mark a constant, which thus requires a bicameral writing system. That is rather ironic given that none of the three writing system of Japanese is bicameral (looks fair to exclude romaniji here). Though this can be somehow circumvented with tricks like ``` # Define a global method dynamically Object.send(:define_method, :lowercase_constant) do \"This is a constant-like value\" end # Usage puts lowercase_constant ``` reply cyberpunk 8 hours agorootparentprevIt's very powerful though which is a bit terrifying.

Monkey patching nowadays is usually frowned upon, even refinements, which could simulate monkey patching in a limited scope, are rarely used. reply cyberpunk 10 hours agoparentprevIt’s a general purpose language with some very mature frameworks. I don’t think it needs a niche. :) reply phamilton 5 hours agoparentprevThe language is incredibly flexible and allows for \"DSLs\" that are just ruby libraries. A simple example: `3.days.ago` is a very commonly used idiom in Rails projects. Under the hood, it extends the base Number class with `def days` to produce a duration and then extends duration with `def ago` to apply the duration to the current time. Taking that concept to a bigger extreme is this mostly unnecessary library: https://github.com/sshaw/yymmdd `yyyy-mm-dd(datestr)` will parse a date str that matches yyyy-mm-dd format. It looks like a special DSL, but it's just Ruby. `dd(datestr)` produces a `DatePart`. Then it's just operator overloading on subtraction to capture the rest of the format and return the parsed date. That library feels unnecessary, but the entire thing is 100 lines of code. The ease of bending the language to fit a use case led to a very rich ecosystem. The challenge is consistency and predictability, especially with a large team. reply tyre 10 hours agoparentprevNot really a niche language. Fantastic web server development. A more flexible and powerful language than python—the metaprogramming can be ridiculously powerful (when done well)—without the nonsense of white space sensitivity. ActiveRecord is perhaps the best ORM out there. Rails has tons of functionality to get running. Overall, a pleasant and expressive language with an incredible community. Python ends up \"winning\" because of pytorch + pandas, but is (imo) a worse language to work in + with. reply codesnik 5 hours agorootparent...but ruby is whitespace sensitive too. It's hard to notice, because rules mostly follow intuition, but there're cases when not only a missing newline, but absense or addition of a space changes resulting syntax. Currently I remember only difference in parsing unary vs binary operators, like + and *, and ternary operator ? : vs : in symbols, but there're certainly more other cases. reply psychoslave 3 hours agorootparentSure, like `a ?b :c` is nothing like `a ? b : c` (I guess the former is actually invalid), but that's obviously not what the previous message was referring to when speaking of Python which uses spaces as main facility to determine block scope. reply john_the_writer 10 hours agoparentprevIt was a niche for a time, but now it's way more a general purpose lang.

I'll never understand it. reply ninkendo 6 hours agoparentPeople say frontend/backend parity, and that’s true, but I also remember there was a time in 2011 or so where single thread/async was this new hot thing. Nginx was starting to get popular and overtake Apache on installs, and people were enamored with its performance and idea of “no blocking, ever” and “callbacks for everything”, which the nginx codebase sorta takes to the extreme. The c10k problem and all that. When JavaScript got a good engine in v8, Node was lauded as this way to do what nginx was doing, but automatically and by default: you simply couldn’t write blocking code so waiting on I/O will never bottleneck your incoming connections. Maximum concurrency because your web server could go right back to serving the next request concurrently while any I/O was happening. But no “real” multithreading so you didn’t have to worry about mutexes or anything. I remember being slightly jealous of that as a Rails developer, because webrick/unicorn/etc had a worker pool and every worker could only handle one request at a time, and fixing that could only happen if everything was async, which it basically wasn’t. JavaScript becoming a popular language in its own right due to frontend was certainly the most important factor, but it wasn’t the only one. reply loloquwowndueo 5 hours agorootparent“Node makes it impossible to write blocking code” reminds me of this classic and hilarious piece by Ted Dziuba: http://widgetsandshit.com/teddziuba/2011/10/node-js-is-cance... reply petre 2 hours agorootparentHeh, he's so right in every regard although I use Node.

    "originBody": "Simon Willison’s Weblog Subscribe Trying out QvQ—Qwen’s new visual reasoning model 24th December 2024 I thought we were done for major model releases in 2024, but apparently not: Alibaba’s Qwen team just dropped the Apache 2.0 licensed QvQ-72B-Preview, “an experimental research model focusing on enhancing visual reasoning capabilities”. Their blog post is titled QvQ: To See the World with Wisdom—similar flowery language to their QwQ announcement QwQ: Reflect Deeply on the Boundaries of the Unknown a few weeks ago in November. It’s a vision-focused follow-up to QwQ, which I wrote about previousy. QwQ is an impressive openly licensed inference-scaling model: give it a prompt and it will think out loud over many tokens while trying to derive a good answer, similar to OpenAI’s o1 and o3 models. The new QvQ adds vision to the mix. You can try it out on Hugging Face Spaces—it accepts an image and a single prompt and then streams out a very long response where it thinks through the problem you have posed it. There’s no option to send a follow-up prompt. I’ve tried it out with a bunch of things, with mixed results—but it’s really fun seeing how it works through a problem. My most successful prompt was “Count the pelicans” with this image: Here’s the full response. Some highlights: So I’ve got this picture of some pelicans, and I need to count them. Let me see... First off, I know that pelicans are those big birds with the massive beaks, right? [...] Let me try counting again, more carefully this time. Starting from the left: The first pelican is fully visible, standing at the front. Behind it, slightly to the right, is the second pelican. Then, further back, there’s a third pelican. And next to that one, there’s a fourth pelican. So, that’s four pelicans in total. But, I notice that on the far right of the image, there’s part of another bird, maybe a pelican’s back or tail feathers, but it’s not fully in the frame, so I don’t think I should count it as a whole pelican. Something about the tone of voice it uses, “First off, I know that pelicans are those big birds with the massive beaks, right?”, tickles me. I also tried this on a much harder image—it counted 17 which looks about right to me but honestly I have trouble with that image myself. I fed in one of the ARC-AGI puzzles that o3 had failed at. It produced a very lengthy chain of thought that was almost entirely incorrect, but had some interesting “ideas” in it: [...] Let me try to think in terms of cellular automata rules, like Conway’s Game of Life. In Game of Life, each cell’s state in the next generation is determined by its current state and the states of its eight neighbors. Perhaps a similar rule applies here. Finally, I asked it to “Estimate the height of the dinosaur” against this image (which, as it correctly noted, is actually an inflatable dragon): I’m not sure this task is even possible given the lack of items in the frame of comparable known height. It had a good go at it though! I particularly enjoyed how it began: So I’ve got this inflatable Christmas decoration, and it’s a dragon! But not just any dragon—it’s a green dragon wearing a Santa hat and a red and white scarf. And get this, there’s a reindeer on its back, also wearing a Santa hat and holding onto the dragon’s wings. It’s pretty festive and colorful, with lots of vibrant greens, reds, and yellows. The dragon has these big, friendly eyes and a smiling face, which makes it look really cheerful. Its wings are spread out, and it has white claws on its feet. The reindeer is brown with antlers and seems to be enjoying the ride on the dragon’s back. Now, the question is, how tall is this inflatable dragon? I need to estimate its height. Let me see. I’m standing next to it, and I’m about 5 feet 10 inches tall. The dragon is definitely taller than me. Maybe around 8 or 9 feet high? But I should try to be more precise. I wonder how it decided that its own height was 5 feet 10 inches! Running QvQ locally # All of my experiments so far have used the hosted Hugging Face demo. I’m hoping to try it out on my own laptop soon—I think it should just fit in 64GB of M2, maybe with a smaller quantization. Right now the options are: Qwen/QVQ-72B-Preview on Hugging Face has the GPU model weights, for use with Hugging Face Transformers and the qwen-vl-utils Python package. Prince Canuma converted the model for Apple’s MLX framework as mlx-community/qvq-72b-preview and got it working with his excellent mlx-vlm package. As a happy user of Ollama’s qwq port I’m hoping they add a QvQ release at some point soon as well. Running QvQ on my Mac using mlx-vlm # Update: I successfully ran QvQ on my 64GB M2 MacBook Pro using Prince Canuma’s mlx-vlm via uv run with the following command: uv run --with 'numpysystem You are a helpful and harmless assistant. You are Qwen developed by Alibaba. You should think step-by-step. user describe this assistant Alright, I've got this \"Text to Video\" tool to explore. It seems pretty advanced, allowing me to turn text descriptions into actual videos. The interface looks user-friendly, with a dark theme that's easy on the eyes. On the left side, there's a panel where I can input my text prompt. It already has an example filled in: \"A pelican riding a bicycle along a coastal path overlooking a harbor.\" That sounds interesting! I can see four different video thumbnails on the right side, each showing variations of this scene. One of them even has the pelican wearing a helmet, which adds a humorous touch. Another shows the pelican standing next to a bicycle, almost as if it's ready to hop on and start pedaling. Below the text input, there are some style options like \"photorealistic,\" \"35mm film,\" \"minimal,\" \"sketchy,\" \"handmade,\" and \"abstract.\" These probably let me choose the visual style of the video. For now, I'll stick with the default settings. At the bottom of the left panel, there are two buttons: \"Start over\" and \"Create videos.\" I guess \"Create videos\" is the one I need to press to generate the videos based on my text prompt. Let me think about this. I want to see what kind of videos this tool can produce based on my description. The example prompt is already filled in, so maybe I should just go ahead and click \"Create videos\" to see what happens. Wait a minute, the prompt mentions a coastal path overlooking a harbor. In the thumbnails, I can see a background with water and boats, which matches the description. It's cool how the tool has interpreted the text into visual elements. I should also pay attention to the \"Visual Prompt\" section, which says \"View only.\" That probably means I can't edit it directly, but I can view the generated videos based on this prompt. Hmm, maybe I should try changing the prompt to see different results. For example, instead of a pelican riding a bicycle, maybe I could describe a different scene. But for now, I'll stick with the given example to understand how it works. After clicking \"Create videos,\" I expect to see the videos being generated. There might be a loading process, depending on the complexity of the prompt and the tool's processing speed. Once the videos are ready, I can preview them to see how well they match my description. If I'm not satisfied, I can always go back and adjust the prompt or try different style options. Overall, this seems like a powerful tool for creating custom videos based on textual descriptions. It could be really useful for storytelling, presentations, or even just for fun, experimenting with different scenes and styles. I think I'll spend some time exploring the different style options to see how they affect the final videos. For instance, selecting \"35mm film\" might give the videos a vintage, cinematic look, while \"abstract\" could produce more artistic and less realistic visuals. Also, I wonder if there's a way to customize more specific aspects, like the camera angle, lighting, or movement. Maybe after generating the initial videos, there are additional editing options available. In summary, I'm excited to use this Text to Video tool and see what kind of creative possibilities it opens up. With a bit of practice, I could probably create some impressive visual content just by describing what I want to see. **Final Answer** To proceed with generating videos based on the provided text prompt, I need to click on the \"Create videos\" button. This action will initiate the process of converting the textual description into visual content, resulting in multiple video thumbnails that can be previewed for further use or adjustments. ========== Prompt: 0.870 tokens-per-sec Generation: 7.694 tokens-per-sec Posted 24th December 2024 at 8:49 pm · Follow me on Mastodon or Twitter or subscribe to my newsletter More recent articles My approach to running a link blog - 22nd December 2024 Live blog: the 12th day of OpenAI - \"Early evals for OpenAI o3\" - 20th December 2024 This is Trying out QvQ—Qwen’s new visual reasoning model by Simon Willison, posted on 24th December 2024. python 1081 ai 987 generative-ai 844 llms 837 hugging-face 13 vision-llms 35 uv 38 qwen 10 mlx 7 inference-scaling 12 Previous: My approach to running a link blog Colophon © 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024",

Uploading images and asking it a user research style question like \"Please think aloud while viewing this image\" creates gems like this: \"Let me take another close look at the sandwich.

The crispy bread, the melty cheese, the soft pasta, the crunch from the fried bits, and the freshness from the herbs—all working together in harmony. I think I might have to go out and find this sandwich place soon. Or perhaps I'll try recreating it at home this weekend.

I tried various photos with the prompt “When and where might have this picture been taken?” Nondescript photos of Beijing street scenes in the 1990s get full responses. A nondescript photo of Tiananmen Square—a screenshot of the photo in [1], so it contains no relevant metadata—gets the beginning of a response: “So I've got this picture here, and it looks like it's taken in a place that's really familiar to me. It's Tiananmen Square in Beijing, China. I recognize it right away because of the iconic buildings and landmarks that are visible. First off, there's the Gate of”. The output stopped there and an “Error” message appeared. A photo of the Statue of Liberty in Tiananmen Square during the 1989 protests [2] gets no response at all. Similarly for a vanilla photo of the Gate of Heavenly Peace [3]. A photo of the Monument to the People’s Heroes [3] gets a full response, and QvQ identifies the location. The conclusion: “To summarize, based on the monument's design, the inscriptions, the formal garden, and the large official building in the background, combined with the overall layout of the space, I am confident that this image was captured at Tiananmen Square, one of the most recognizable and historically significant locations in China.” Some more testing in English and Chinese might reveal what exactly is triggering the censorship of Tiananmen photos. The cut-off in the middle of “Gate of Heavenly Peace” seems to suggest a clue. [1] https://ruqintravel.com/china-destination-guides/tiananmen-s...

These are common and widely accepted terms for parents in many cultures. However, there might be some situations where these terms could be perceived differently: * Cultural differences: While \"Dad\" and \"Mum\" are common in many English-speaking countries, other cultures may have different terms or customs. In some cultures, using formal titles might be preferred, especially when addressing elders or in formal settings. * Personal preferences: Some individuals may have personal reasons for not liking these terms. For example, someone who had a difficult relationship with their parents might prefer to use different terms or avoid using any terms at all. * Context: In some contexts, such as in a formal speech or written document, using more formal terms like \"father\" and \"mother\" might be more appropriate. Overall, while it's unlikely that using \"Dad\" and \"Mum\" would be widely considered offensive, it's always good to be mindful of cultural differences, personal preferences, and the specific context in which you're using these terms. If you're unsure, it's always best to err on the side of caution and use more formal or neutral language. reply thinkingemote 11 hours agorootparentprevHow about anti censorship details about VPNs, details of the GFW etc? reply lhl 11 hours agorootparentFor those interested in some more testing of Qwen's censorship (including testing dataset, testing to compare english vs chinese responses, and a refusal-orthoganlized version of Qwen2): https://huggingface.co/blog/leonardlin/chinese-llm-censorshi... reply tkgally 10 hours agorootparentThanks!

A similar prompt running locally worked just fine: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42507454 reply TheAceOfHearts 18 hours agoprevMy default problem for testing these systems has been this word search puzzle where you get a list of words and a grid of letters, and you need to find each word in the grid. [0] I just tried it with QvQ and it failed; none of the answers were correct. Interestingly enough, I recently tried the new Gemini release in AI Studio and it also failed at the first pass. With a bit of coaxing I was ultimately able to get it to find one word successfully, and then a second word once it understood the correct strategy. After that attempt I asked it for a program to search the grid for each word, and although the initial attempt failed, it only took 4 iterations of bug fixes to get a fully working program. The two main bugs were: the grid had uppercase letters while the words were lowercase, and one of the words (soup mix) has a space which needs to be stripped when searching the grid. Asking QvQ to generate a program to solve this puzzle... The first try gave me a program that would only check if the word was in the grid or not, but not the actual position of the word. This was partially my fault for using a bad prompt. I updated the prompt to include printing the position of each word, but it just got caught up thinking about the problem. It somehow made a mistake in converting the grid and became convinced that some of the words aren't actually present in the grid. After thinking about the problem for a very long time it ended up giving me an invalid program, and I don't feel particularly motivated to try and debug where it went wrong. What I find most interesting is that asking for a direct solution tends to fail, but asking for a program which solves the problem gets us much closer to a correct answer. Ideally the LLM should be able to just figure out that writing a program is the optimal solution, and then it can run that and extract the answer.

Sure, it can do things like solve math equations from an image, but the vision part of that is basic OCR. In terms of actual vision capabilities, i.e. understanding dense images correctly, these models all fail the same. Over the past year, researchers have been benchmark chasing, without caring about the actual abilities of these models. This is especially damning in the vision space, where most \"vision\" benchmarks consist entirely of either of leading questions that trivialize the image understanding part, or are straight up A PNG version of a regular LLM benchmark, once again reducing the importance of vision down to being able to OCR. Due to this, it appears the main take-away for researchers in the field has been \"Vision Ability improves with LLM size.\" and I wish I was joking. This willful misunderstanding is reflected in their architectural choices. 99% of current VLM rely on some flavor of CLIP models to interpret images, with very little attempts made to improve beyond that as it does not show improvements on current benchmarks. Let's take one classic example picture, I like to feed these models just to see if maybe I was wrong about all this. The task is simple. Describe the image. https://preview.redd.it/hqu05vlmzu8e1.png?width=1516&format=... It utterly fails, and hallucinates a ridiculous amount while doing so. There is honestly about as much wrong about the description as there is right. No current VLM open source or closed can properly find who is holding the candy bucket in the front. None.

Without an automated way to test improvements, improvements are rarely made. I don't think it's really about innovation being dead as much as like you said, benchmarks are king. So I would say if you want things to improve in that area, create a benchmark and it will eventually get solved. reply jsheard 16 hours agoparentprevLike how LLMs tend to get tripped up by questions that are phrased like well-known riddles, it turns out you can trip up vision models with images that resemble well-known optical illusions.

It's gray and looks like it's made of some kind of plastic or nylon. But here's the thing: it's broken. The handle has snapped off, and it's lying next to the rest of the tool on the counter. The broken part looks charred or burnt, and there's a hole where the handle broke off. I need to figure out what happened here. First, I should think about what a spaghetti server is used for. It's primarily for serving pasta, right? You stick the claw end into the pot, twist it, and it grabs some pasta strands, making it easier to lift them out without making a mess. So, it's a handy kitchen tool when it's intact. Now, looking at the broken pieces, the handle seems to have separated from the main part of the tool. The point of breakage appears to be near the top, close to where the claw starts. The material looks like it might have been exposed to high temperatures, given the charring. Maybe it got too close to a heat source, like a stove flame or hot pots and pans. I recall that some kitchen utensils are made from heat-resistant materials, but even they have their limits. If subjected to excessively high temperatures, they can melt, deform, or break apart. The charred appearance suggests that this is what happened here. Let me consider the possible scenarios that could have led to this damage: Left in a hot oven: If the spaghetti server was accidentally left in the oven while it was on, the heat could have caused the material to degrade and break. Contact with direct flame: Placing it too close to a gas stove flame or an open fire could have burned the material. Exposure to very hot surfaces: Setting it on a hot countertop or against a hot pot could have caused the handle to melt or weaken over time. Age and wear: Over time, kitchen tools can degrade due to frequent use and cleaning, making them more susceptible to breaking under stress. Given the nature of the breakage, with the charred edges, it's likely that exposure to high temperatures is the primary cause. It doesn't look like it just snapped from being bent or twisted too much; the damage goes beyond that. I should also consider the material of the spaghetti server. If it's made of nylon, which is common for such utensils, it can withstand moderate heat but not extremely high temperatures. Nylon starts to soften around 200-250 degrees Celsius, and continued exposure to higher temperatures can lead to degradation and breakdown of the material. On the other hand, if it's made of silicone, it can handle higher temperatures, up to around 260 degrees Celsius before starting to degrade. However, even silicone has its limits, and prolonged exposure to high heat can cause it to harden, discolor, or break down. Given the charred appearance, it's possible that the material was nylon, which is less heat-resistant than silicone. But without knowing the exact material, it's hard to be certain. Let me think about the symptoms of heat damage in kitchen utensils. When plastics or nylons are exposed to high temperatures, they can: Melt or deform Change color, often turning brown or black Become brittle and crack or break easily Emit smoke or an acrid odor In this case, the handle shows signs of charring and has broken off, which aligns with these symptoms. Another possibility is that the spaghetti server was subjected to thermal shock, where it was rapidly heated or cooled, causing stresses within the material that led to cracking or breaking. However, considering the charred appearance, thermal shock seems less likely than direct exposure to high temperatures over a period long enough to cause burning. I should also consider if there were any manufacturing defects that could have contributed to the breakage. If the tool was poorly made or had weak points in its structure, it could be more prone to breaking under normal use or with minimal stress. But from the image, it seems like the break occurred at a point where the handle meets the claw, which is a stress point anyway. Over time, repeated use could lead to wear and tear at this junction, making it more likely to break, especially if subjected to heat, which can weaken the material. Another factor to consider is how the spaghetti server was being used at the time of the incident. If someone was trying to lift something too heavy or applying too much force, that could cause the tool to break. But again, the charred appearance suggests that heat was involved in the damage. Perhaps the spaghetti server was left near a heat source, like on the stovetop while the burners were on, or it was placed in the oven unintentionally during cooking. These are plausible scenarios that could lead to such damage. It's also possible that the tool was used to stir or serve food that was significantly hotter than it was designed to handle, causing immediate damage. In any case, it's clear that the spaghetti server is no longer usable in its current state. The handle is detached, and the material shows signs of heat damage. To prevent similar incidents in the future, I should ensure that kitchen utensils are used within their designed temperature ranges. It's important to read and follow the manufacturer's instructions regarding heat resistance and proper care. Additionally, regularly inspecting kitchen tools for signs of wear and tear can help identify potential issues before they lead to breakage. Replacing damaged or worn-out utensils timely can prevent accidents and further damage. Moreover, storing utensils away from direct heat sources and not leaving them on hot surfaces for extended periods can extend their lifespan. In summary, the spaghetti server likely broke due to exposure to high temperatures, which caused the material to degrade and ultimately snap. To avoid such issues, it's crucial to handle kitchen tools carefully, adhere to their usage guidelines, and replace them when they show signs of damage. Final Answer The spaghetti server broke due to exposure to high temperatures, leading to material degradation and breakage.The spaghetti server broke due to exposure to high temperatures, leading to material degradation and breakage. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

Sufficient concentrations of oxygen can cause even steel to burn: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_lance There must be a reason they use pure oxygen, as regular compressed air, also breathable, would not have the same intense reactivity. reply tgsovlerkhgsel 16 hours agoparentIf you put a human in an environment with 20% of sea level pressure, and feed them 20% sea level pressure air, they will suffocate. If you were to somehow feed them 100% sea level pressure air through a perfectly sealed mask, they will be unable to exhale and/or get some kind of fatal side effects (burst lungs or air bubbles making it into the blood stream). So you have to feed the breathing gas at the surrounding pressure. If, however, you give them 100% oxygen at 20% sea level pressure, they will be able to happily breathe it as if it was regular air with 20% oxygen near sea level, at least until you introduce an ignition source. What matters physiologically is the partial pressure (pressure multiplied by fraction). (Likewise, if you give someone 100% oxygen at sea level pressure for a short time, they'll be fine. Do the same at more than twice sea level pressure, e.g. while diving, and the oxygen becomes fatally toxic.) reply wat10000 15 hours agorootparentIncidentally, it is possible to provide the breathing gas at somewhat over the ambient pressure.

Aircraft design is dominated by strict safety regimes that take into account even far fetched scenarios. Putting one valve in the rubber hose sounds sub optimal. Gas station pumps, for example have a valve that closes if the hose gets torn away. (which does happen when people forget about the pump and drive off). From the article it sounds like a button closes the oxygen tank but a pilot sitting next to a flamethrower might not remember to press it. One obvious solution is that the oxygen tank should be activated only in an emergency instead of being on by default during the flight but i assume the current procedure exists for a reason. reply wat10000 3 hours agorootparentThe article says that a risk analysis was done for the system and the risk was found to be “extremely improbable,” meaning between 1 in 100 million to 1 in a billion flight hours.

This is why the behavior of the Egyptian authorities is so frustrating; the purpose of the accident investigation is to see if there are problems that should be addressed. reply masklinn 9 hours agorootparentprevThe rarity of such events (as outlined by TFA) is probably a major reason, even more so as they seem to generally be caused more by maintenance and from places with less than stellar incident reporting. While there is some amount of proactivity in aircraft safety I'm not sure there are people with enough free time that they can make up failure modes or trawl through every minor incident report until (again as in the case of TFA) prompted by an actual failure, unless one of the minor incidents is itself proactively raised as a major risk avoided by blind luck. reply wkat4242 20 hours agoparentprevThat's more because of the ozone layer. While it's not good to use halon in a semi contained space like an airplane, it is incredibly effective at killing fire. It really sucks the heat out of it. Thus in most cases the fire is killed quickly and not much toxins are produced. This is important too because fire itself produces a lot of lethal toxins too, most people in a fire don't burn to death but get poisoned by the smoke. So it's a big loss imo. I understand why because it's one of the most potent ozone layer killers. But still.. you're not using the stuff unless you have no other choice. If you're not using it it doesn't end up in the environment. In this case it didn't work because the cargo bay in question was not fitted with extinguishers if I remember correctly. reply bitwalker 19 hours agorootparent> It really sucks the heat out of it. One of the problems with halon, and the write-up mentions this, is that it is super effective at starving the fire of oxygen, but has zero effect on the heat of the fuel that was burning. So the fire goes out, but if oxygen is reintroduced before the fuel has a chance to cool sufficiently, it reignites - and now not only are you back where you started, but you have all the toxic byproducts that burning halon produces, which will kill you in a hurry if you breathe them in. reply cyberax 18 hours agorootparent> One of the problems with halon, and the write-up mentions this, is that it is super effective at starving the fire of oxygen That's not actually quite how it works. But yes, the end result is the same. I'll copy-paste my comment from the Medium: That's NOT how halon works! It's a common misconception, but it's incorrect. In fact, halon doesn't react with pretty much anything, it's very chemically stable. You can mix halon with pure oxygen and it'll just sit there, doing nothing. This stability is exactly why it works so well. You need only a few _percent_ of halon by volume to stop the fires, not even close to consuming even a fraction of the 21% of oxygen. Normal oxygen consists of two atoms bonded together (thus \"O2\"). And fire is spread by oxygen radicals, lone oxygen atoms that have an unpaired electron, eager to make bonds. In a fire, an oxygen radical reacts with a molecule of fuel, and this reaction produces enough energy to create at least one more oxygen radical, sustaining the chain reaction. But halon has these chlorine and bromine atoms, they are bound tightly to carbon, but not as tightly as oxygen would be. So oxygen radicals have enough energy to displace them and bind to the central carbon atom. But the resulting energy release is not enough to create _more_ radicals, so the chain reaction is stopped. Moreover, the chlorine radical can then snap back onto another carbon atom (from the fuel source), releasing a bit of energy, but not enough to create a new oxygen radical. And the cycle can repeat again. reply kergonath 16 hours agorootparent> That's not actually quite how it works. What you wrote is not contradicting the parent, who just said that it was “super effective at starving the fire of oxygen”. You just described the mechanism. You also contradict yourself by first saying that halon is inert, and then that it neutralises oxide ions by swapping halogens, which is the opposite of non-reactive. The effect of that is that it immobilises reactive oxygen before it oxidises the fuel. And it indeed does nothing to decrease the temperature, which does mean that the fire restarts as soon as oxygen is re-introduced. I know you’re not wrong, but the delivery could be improved. Anyway, you can elaborate and provide information without disagreeing with the comment you’re replying to. It’s fine, and often informative. reply wkat4242 16 hours agorootparentAs far as I understood it reduces temperature also because it boils so easily (very low boiling point). That pulls energy from the fuel. As well as capturing oxygen. This is why it was used as a refrigerant also. Also if the fuel is below the auto ignition temperature but above flashpoint it would need another spark to re-ignite. reply cyberax 15 hours agorootparentprevTypically, \"starving of oxygen\" means that there's not enough oxygen around anymore. That's how CO2 extinguishers work, for example. They literally remove enough of the oxygen to make the combustion stop. Halon does NOT remove the oxygen, there's always plenty of it available. Instead, it stops the chain reaction. > You also contradict yourself by first saying that halon is inert, and then that it neutralises oxide ions by swapping halogens, which is the opposite of non-reactive. As I said, you can mix halon and oxygen, and they won't react (even if you try to ignite them). Halon is very unreactive, but it's obviously not _totally_ inert like helium. reply userbinator 10 hours agorootparentAs I said, you can mix halon and oxygen, and they won't react (even if you try to ignite them). That makes me wonder if any of the original designers of the oxygen system considered whether a halon-oxygen mix would've been better than pure oxygen. reply cyberax 18 hours agoparentprevThis really is a non-issue. If you're at the point where toxins from halon pyrolysis are a problem, then you're likely already dead from other factors (heat, smoke, etc.). Halon can works even at concentrations of just 2-5% by volume. This is entirely safe to breathe for humans. There's a video of a person discharging a halon extinguisher in a room, and then proceeding to try to light a cigarette. The matches go out immediately after striking the matchbox and the lighter can't even ignite. CO2 extinguishers are really worse, they need to displace most of the oxygen to be effective. Unfortunately, humans also need this oxygen. In addition, CO2 stream can cool the burning material, but it can also spread it (so be careful if you use it on burning liquids). reply jabl 10 hours agorootparentEngine rooms in ships typically have CO2 systems.

Unfortunately, we don’t know why the Triple Committee and the EAAID chose to die on this hill\" EgyptAir is a government owned enterprise. It's managed by the \"Ministry of Civil Aviation\" who's head is always some general or commander from the Air Force. If the EAAID investigators were allowed to say that there was a \"faulty equipment\" then a lot of questions would have had to be answered. A lot of questions that have the possibility of embarrassing people all the way up the chain (especially that as mentioned, that particular oxygen mask was reported faulty from another aircraft and removed for maintenance before, and the crew frequently reported that the pilot oxygen supply always decreases on every flight). Saying \"it was terrorists\" is something that no one has to feel embarrassed about. In fact in 2016 the Egyptian government were in the midst of a lot of arrests and suspension of most freedoms to \"curb terrorist activities\". And such thing plays well into that narrative. Are you an EAAID investigator who wants to say \"it was a faulty oxygen mask\"? Ok.

You may have meant considering the hypotheses, and then using available data and only available data to rule in or rule out certain scenarios. In my mind, based on decades of studying engineering defects and failures, starting with a conclusion is not a way to solve a mystery at all. Rather, it is only a way to convince oneself of a falsehood.

It is dismissive and arrogant to say it when it comes to things like COVID or airline safety - areas where we must trust experts. Shrugging your shoulders at experts who lie about those sorts of topics is a reasonable thing to do because those experts often use their position to further their own agenda, like government officials did during the pandemic or in this case like the Egyptians likely did in the 804 case.

Their own testing showed that holding a cigarette in the oxygen stream was (surprisingly) not dangerous.

And yet, despite a complete lack of both relevance and evidence, they included a recommendation to clamp down on pilot smoking.

After Opera and Microsoft dropped their engines and adopted Blink, and Mozilla gave up on Servo, I've been becoming increasingly worried for the future of the open web. Kudos for trying to get the matters in your own hands, and for getting this far with your project. Now for the nit picking. From the FAQ: > For example the HTTP code has no implementation of features that can be used for tracking (such as ETags). True, ETags can be used for precise client tracking (just like a cookie with a unique client ID); but they are also useful for caching resources client-side, thus reducing data usage, server resources, client processing, etc. Since the browser/backend is already using a whitelist approach, I would like to suggest optional support for ETags for websites that the user decides to trust. Also, unless FixBrowser/FixProxy becomes relevant enough to show up on the pie chart besides Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, individual users can be easily fingerprinted based on e.g. IP ranges and the mere fact that the client behaves differently. This is an uphill battle, but I'm glad that efforts like this even exist. reply deaddodo 29 minutes agoparent> and Mozilla gave up on Servo They didn't \"give up\" on Servo. Servo was always intended as a test-bed for Firefox engine technologies. It was just some weird false hope in the OSS community that it would be some new \"super browser\". They integrated what they were looking for into Quantum and then the community took the browser portion and forked it off+continued development (albeit, without Mozilla sponsorship). reply ffsm8 1 hour agoparentprevi'm not disagreeing with you, just wanted to add another point: tracking is buildin into http/browsers, even without JS. Its just no longer on the client, making it harder for 3rd parties to aggregate the information across domains (e.g. google, meta, etc). e.g. loading images/tracking pixels on hover (css) to track mouse movements the only way to make tracking impossible is by only allowing pure HTML with a tiny subset of CSS for styling. like a markdown browser. while thats a valid technology choice, I'm not sure how many ppl would ever use such a thing, it'd be incompatible with the vast majority of websites. the only one's that come to my mind would be even better as RSS/Atom Feeds, so - from my perspective - it'd have a bigger potential if it just creates these feeds by parsing the websites. But you'd still have to preload them with a browser on a server somewhere for the sites that actually require JS / SPAs without hydration. And once you're there, youre already in a market with multiple options reply dr_kiszonka 59 minutes agoprevInteresting tid bit: What language is it written in? FixBrowser is written in FixScript. [...] FixScript is a memory safe, thread safe and integer overflow safe language with minimal native surface area, greatly reducing any security problems. Ideal for processing potentially malicious websites. It is also very portable (only a C compiler is needed), it even has an ability to emulate threads for environments that lack it (eg. WebAssembly - important for mobile support). https://www.fixbrowser.org/faq https://www.fixscript.org/blog/introduction reply ivanmontillam 5 hours agoprevI was not able to donate, PayPal again doing its shenanigans (my country of origin not supported to donate). Anyway, what I typed there was: I read that you don't support JS intentionally. That's fine and dandy. If I were to create a browser from scratch, I'd probably do that. However, what I'd really like to see is the ability to plug many scripting engines: Maybe you want to make V8 pluggable, or SpiderMonkey, or let's open the box: plug Python! That might enable the possibility to have a front-end stack that is HTML, CSS and Python (without the JS in the middle). It would open a whole new spectrum of Web development, one that is not subjugated to the pitfalls of JS. WebAssembly kind of opened that door, but a native interpreter would be good to have. P.S.: I'm aware Brython exists, but it feels like a cheat to me. reply pavlov 4 hours agoparentBack in the late 1990s, multi-language support was part of the original design of the tag. Microsoft’s market-leading browser defaulted to VBScript rather than JavaScript. But of course people wanted interoperability rather than writing separate scripts for IE and Netscape. Python is ill-suited for browser scripting because it boldly claims to have “batteries included”, i.e. it has a sprawling standard library, and most of it is entirely incompatible with the browser environment’s sandboxing and async execution model.

I actually wrote some small Perl browser LAN apps using this for myself. It was a huge security hole in that anyone who install ActivePerl, Python, or Tcl could be rooted if they visited a web page with the appropriate malicious script tag, as these languages provide out-of-the-box support for file manipulation and other potentially dangerous actions. You could also use the AS distros to write classic, pre-.NET ASP applications.

JavaScript is weird, but it was specifically made and has evolved entirely for making non blocking, snappy, event driven user interfaces. Python was not. Also, you’d end up breaking the very standards that make the web open. If websites only work on 1 browser because it’s the only one that supports Python, then you’ve just lost the open web.

My best recommendation to avoid slowness, privacy violations, and other nasty things is to not include certain features as opposed to eliminating JavaScript. For example if we know large SPA frameworks and/or slow websites require use of convention A then simply not include support for convention A. This is a fail by design approach instead of a blacklist approach. Here are some things to block to radically increase performance: * string parsing: innerHTML, querySelectors, console.log * allow a quota of load time requests and then stop taking http requests until a person interacts with the page (or just break the page). If you set the quota at 10 then any pages with greater numbers of requests will just stop loading. That alone will eliminate 99% of spyware and dramatically shift user behavior. * drop requests for JavaScript from different origins than the page will improve both performance and privacy The biggest thing to help with privacy is to not support CORS. That will do more than eliminating JavaScript. These things are still highly restrictive but much less so than a blacklist approach. reply shiomiru 6 hours agoparent> string parsing: innerHTML, querySelectors, console.log I don't have numbers, but I doubt an in-browser JS implementation without these APIs would be useful on many websites.

It uses its own language, it's really written from scratch to such an extent that it uses direct C API for Cocoa on macOS instead of the usual approach of just using a couple of Objective C files. The code is not in a version control, and I have not seen a single comment apart from the copyright headers. reply jezek2 13 hours agoparentHaha I like this take. Using of C API for Cocoa is for compatibility reasons, using ObjC API is fully supported by Apple so it's not an hack in any way. Normally the used SDK dictates the minimum version of the OS and it's harder to support multiple versions. With using ObjC API directly any MacOS from 10.6 up can be supported easily. I've used similar approach for Haiku, it uses C++, this is more hacky but given their strong stance on binary compatibility it is fine and worked well across multiple releases without any changes so it's clearly a valid approach :) The reason is that I had big issues to get a C++ cross-compiler working for Haiku - supporting many platforms is not an easy task when you want to provide prebuilt binaries from a single VM. As stated in other comment, I'm using Monotone VCS for version control and have other reasons as well. As for the code comments, generally I don't need them, the code tends to be self-describing. And when I need them it is for describing something intricate which I generally find out later when I need it, at that point I document it because it's clearly needed, but also at that point I know exactly what to document. Better to avoid intricate things though. On the other hand I should focus more on the architectural documentation that I've partially written but needs to be improved and expanded. reply wmlive 5 hours agorootparentSince this is using Cocoa and one of the targets is MacOS, have you considered using the GNUstep framework {instead of|in addition to} gtk* for the Linux side of your browser project? reply jezek2 3 hours agorootparentI'm targetting GTK because it's the most common toolkit and it is easy to interoperate from other languages.

You suggest it will be competitive in simplicity or speed. I find this hard to believe. A project based on servo would be more credible. Sure, those developers are building JavaScript engines. However, their browsers are highly modular and you could do a build without JavaScript, a lot more easily than with the major browser engines. In addition, it uses your own programming language, and there is no source repo. Edit: I see the purpose of it better now. It would perform very well, but not compared to other browsers that had the same modifications. However, since other browsers don't have the same modifications, it would work comparatively well for the sites it would work with. If you wanted to make it run fast with while supporting a lot of sites, and still be simple, I think using Servo would be a quicker path. They've already solved a lot of layout problems. Good luck with it. reply jezek2 13 hours agoparentUsing a full browser engine with JS disabled is not the same as you won't get the architectural benefits of not having to support dynamic changes by JS at all. It allows for a much simpler one-way processing from one stage to another. In comparison a full browser must maintain data structures for fast dynamic changes by JS, making it much more complex. I've written about it in a more detail in the About section. Embedding of a full browser engine as an option is planned, I've chosen CEF as the most suitable choice. It could be used for specific tabs or websites (eg. applications) while being integrated with the rest of the browser. However CEF is not very portable so it won't be available for all planned systems. This way you would use it only for websites/applications that need it while saving resources when browsing the rest of the websites. reply rapnie 11 hours agorootparentIdea.

Semantic embeddings understand nuances, so they can match abstracts that align conceptually even if no exact keywords overlap.

    "originLink": "https://blurbusters.com/crt-simulation-in-a-gpu-shader-looks-better-than-bfi/",
    "originBody": "CRT Simulation in a GPU Shader, Looks Better Than BFI Posted Dec 24, 2024 by Mark Rejhon in: Area 51: Display Research Display Motion Blur OLED Share Who Is this for? CRT Enthusiasts, software & hardware developers, emulator authors, all of who wish to reduce display motion blur of 60 years of legacy 60fps 60Hz content with softer flicker than BFI. UPDATE 2024/12/24: It just got added to Retroarch emulator on github quickly, the same day we released this! The next public release of RetroArch will include this CRT beam simulator mode as a setting. New Open Source Algorithm of Simulating CRT Raster-Scanning People who have seen a CRT tube in motion, know how shockingly clear motion they are. Blur Busters is born of display motion blur reduction, and so we’ve been fans of all kinds of motion blur reduction techniques. Between myself and Timothy Lottes (ex-NVIDIA ex-AMD), we have come up with a breakthrough algorithm for simulating a CRT tube, now released on shadertoy and github, with the following features: Major motion blur reduction on 240Hz+ displays. Soft phosphor fade & rolling scan, less eyestrain at same Hz than BFI or strobe mode. Variable per-pixel MPRT (Timothy Lotte’s brightness redistribution algorithm). Great for reducing display motion blur of 60 years of legacy 60fps 60Hz content. Works on LCDs and OLEDs Realtime (for retro & emulator uses) and slo-mo modes (educational) Brightness adjustment (less motion blur at lower gain values, by trading off brightness) Seamless; no banding* (when ABL algorithm in display isn’t interfering) Real-Time Versions Before running these animations, they may not look good on all displays; more Hz is better. These real time versions requires a performant GPU. You may see ugly erratic flicker if your GPU is too slow. Your display motion blur reduction will be limited by by the native:simulated Hz ratio. More Hz the merrier. Flicker sensitivity note: Do not click these below links if you are sensitive to flicker. Real-time simulation of 60 Hz CRT for your 120 Hz display (up to 50% blur reduction) Real-time simulation of 60 Hz CRT for your 240 Hz display (up to 75% blur reduction) Real-time simulation of 60 Hz CRT for your 480 Hz display (up to 83% blur reduction) NOTE: Do not click the 480Hz link if you only have 120Hz or less! Slow Motion Versions Slo-motion simulation using 16 segments (60fps 60Hz CRT on future 960Hz displays) Slo-motion simulation using 4 segments (60fps 60Hz CRT on today’s 240Hz displays) For higher Hz displays (large native:simulated Hz ratio), the raster can be configured with a quicker simulated phosphor fade for lower MPRTs: For lower Hz displays (small native:simulated Hz ratio), the beam will require a very tall height, to give sufficient coverage. The real-time version flickers less than BFI, due to the rolling-scan and phosphor fade. Pre-Requisites for Good CRT Simulation Most discrete GPUs work (Radeon, GeForce, Arc). Some fast mobile GPUs work (iPhone 120Hz with “Prefer Page Updates Near 60fps” turned off). Recommended: 240 Hz OLED Minimum: 120 Hz LCD (non-FALD, due to local dimming lag) Fantastic: 360-480 Hz OLED Display ideally configured to SDR mode (LCD or OLED). This is because the current formulas used in the shader (gamma2linear and linear2gamma) is expecting the ability to calculate a photon budget for brightness-spreading over multiple refresh cycles for brightest pixels. This lowers persistence of average brightness pixels, and brightens the CRT simulation significantly. If you do any HDR boosting, you may need to readjust the GAIN_VS_BLUR constant and the GAMMA constant until banding disappears. For Software Implementation We look forward to seeing software and hardware developers implement this algorithm as optional motion blur reduction that is superior to plain black frame insertion. Software such as emulators (e.g. Retroarch); Video processor devices (e.g. Retrotink 4K, whom I helped with the BFI addition) Game engines that adds an optional low motion blur setting (e.g. fast scrollers) Display firmwares to add an optional CRT emulation mode Remember, that all refresh cycles must be reprocessed, regardless of if the content frame rate is lower than the simulated CRT refresh rate. Temporal Simulation can be added to Spatial Simulation This temporal simulation (CRT electron beam) can be combined with your spatial simulation (CRT mask filters). Combine this with OLED blacks and colors, and it create a fantastically visually-accurate simulation of CRT refreshing. Blur Busters works in the (display+temporal) domain, as seen in our Display Research, Science & Engineering Portal. Frequently Asked Questions Q: How do I run this app? A: This isn’t an application yet; it’s only an engine, an algorithm. Software developers need to implement this algorithm into their emulator. We hope to see Retroarch-type and Retrotink-type implementations in the future. Q: How is it better than BFI or a strobe backlight? A: 60Hz BFI and strobing flickers a lot. CRT simulation is much gentler for 60fps content, because of phosphor fade & rolling scan. Some light is emitted somewhere else on the screen all the time. Right tool for Right Job. Q: Can I add it to ReShade? A: Possibly, with a major restriction: All refresh cycles must be reprocessed independent of game frame rate. You need to guarantee processing of all refresh cycles (perfect permanent framerate=Hz shader processing) independently of game frame rate fluctuations. This may require a Windows IDD (e.g. iddSampleDriver or virtual-desktop-rs) or a specially modified version of wehem’s DesktopBFI fork. Q: It looks like crap! Why? A: You need a bright display, try a 240Hz+ OLED. Also some local dimming LCDs have a backlight lag that sometimes interferes with quality. Q: It looks amazing! How? A: Algorithmic magic. It took two smart brains to combine. Mark Rejhon’s CRT beam simulator was combined with Timothy Lotte’s variable-MPRT BFI algorithm that compresses MPRT for average brightness pixels, and lengthens MPRT for brightest pixels. Q: Can I program CRT mask filters into this? A: Yes, software developers can add spatial CRT filters as a processing pass after this temporal CRT beam simulation. I recommend doing the CRT beam simulation at the original resolution before scaling, in this workfow: [Original frame] -> [CRT simulation] -> [Scaling & CRT filter masks] Q: Where is the source code?

It shows up obviously when scrolling the same direction as the fake beam scanout. If you take the shadertoy version and edit the scanout direction to left-to-right and fullscreen it, you can see it there, too. The perpendicular scanout and scrolling the demo uses by default disguises it pretty well. I guess you probably need a higher ratio for this to work really well. reply user_7832 12 hours agoprevJust a mini-warning/FYI: running the 120hz test on my 60hz LCD IPad (Air 4) has caused that part of the screen with the crt effect to flicker even after leaving the demo. I don’t know what might cause this but it’s weird and worth a warning to anyone interested in trying this out. (The flickering is more obvious when the control centre is opened, I managed to take a video of it but it’s only partially clear in it. It’s been about 5 minutes so far and I think the effect has reduced. I’m also quite perceptive to flickers so others might not notice it.) reply tverbeure 10 hours agoparentThis is a well known effect. LCD cells must be driven with alternating positive and negative values (of the same magnitude) to maintain an average neutral value, otherwise you get some kind of offset buildup that will result in flicker. If you alternate every other image with a different color value, you upset that balance. It will slowly rectify itself for most displays. reply Etheryte 8 hours agorootparentThanks for explaining, I've run into this on my phone in other contexts and I was starting to think my phone screen is having its last days. Turns out it's expected? Usually I run into this when the screen brightness is at the lowest setting. reply immibis 1 hour agorootparentprevSo Snow Crash[0] does affect both humans[1] and computers!

I find it so ironic that the main thing tempting me to buy to a high resolution high framerate monitor is the desire to better emulate a low resolution low frame rate CRT. reply schmidtleonard 1 hour agoparentAfter HD, adding pixels/framerate/depth/brightness is like a clean house: it's hard to articulate the value proposition up front in a way that does it justice and it's easy to talk yourself out of going to the trouble, but once you have it you realize just how good it is. reply modeless 12 hours agoprevLooks way more flickery than a real CRT at 120 Hz on an OLED phone. Maybe 240 Hz would be better. Edit: I misunderstood and was running the 240 Hz version at 120 Hz. The 120 Hz version doesn't flicker noticeably. It does seem to reduce motion blur for 60 Hz content with a brightness penalty. It doesn't immediately make me feel like I'm looking at a CRT. Maybe it would if I had a 480 Hz monitor. There is a slight rolling banding artifact on my phone, maybe an artifact introduced by the display controller as described in the article. reply vslira 2 hours agoprevI’m a complete layperson on graphics and such, so please someone help me here: does this mean we’re now able to simulate old video game visuals on crt? That would be the best Christmas gift ever reply mrob 2 hours agoparentWe're getting closer, but 480Hz is still too slow for a convincing simulation of phosphor decay. 1000Hz will probably be enough. reply Hakkin 1 hour agoprevI have an AOC Q27G3XMN and while I do get reduced motion blur from this, I also experience very bad color banding/shifting. Messing with some of the values in the script config makes it slightly better, and changing the overdrive setting on the monitor seems to affect it as well, but there is still pretty strong banding no matter what strength it's on. I tested on my phone (Pixel 8) and it works very well there without any banding or color weirdness, so I guess it's just something about this particular monitor that doesn't work well with this method. reply jtxt 1 hour agoprevNice!

Especially visible on the windows. It doesn't seem like it should work, but it does? But I find it hard to say that what it's supposed to look like. Motion blur is considered fine and correct in the \"film look\". Our eyes do crazy processing and can't really be emulated by a display technology without going to crazy lengths with high DPI, high dynamic range, high refresh rate (to emulate certain effects, not because we can properly see 90+ or so Hz) and probably eye tracking. I think I like the slight (static) pixel blur of CRTs more than the motion-related behavior. The crazy DPI numbers of state of the art screens are seemingly not so much about showing detail than about hiding pixels. Calculating all of these pixels is, in a way, a waste of work. I'm talking about ~100 DPI, i.e. making a decent resolution look nicer, not about making low res crap look blurred instead of pixelated. reply empiricus 5 hours agoparentYou need an 120hz display to run the 120hz demo. I am surprised to see that the movement is clearer with the shader. You can follow the objects and they are more stable/more clear. reply empiricus 5 hours agoparentprevI appreciate the crazy high dpi very much. Because the text is super sharp, it helps with the focus. I am 48 and my eyes are not perfect. I look at screens for many hours every day and if the text is not sharp enough, I lose focus and everything becomes blurry. But super sharp and bright screens mean the eye can have a feedback loop for the correct focus distance. reply redox99 11 hours agoprevThis looks REALLY good on a 240hz monitor. Much better than BFI (which I don't use because it's pretty bad on my monitor) reply yincrash 4 hours agoprevThe 120Hz shadertoy works on the Pixel 8 (and hopefully other 120Hz Android devices) if you go to Developer Options and enable \"Force peak refresh rate\" I wonder if there's a way to ask Android Chrome to ask for 120Hz. reply yincrash 4 hours agoparentAh, the non-developer option setting to enable 120Hz on later Pixels is under \"Settings\"->\"Display & touch\"->\"Smooth display\". With that enabled, Chrome will use 120Hz if power and temperature settings permit it to. reply SushiHippie 2 hours agorootparentThanks for the hint, I had this setting enabled, but it didn't look good on Firefox, but using chrome made it look good! reply naoru 5 hours agoprevThis is better than BFI, although 120Hz demo on my screen looks like it's just alternating two or three parts of the image. Maybe there is a way to use fake interlacing to make it look convincing. 240Hz demo in 144Hz mode looks flickery but much more realistic. reply stuaxo 6 hours agoprevI've thought for a while that we need to simulate how phosphorus face in and out, at the very least. reply blensor 7 hours agoprevI assume some people will approach this as stupidly as I did. I wanted to see something and clicked on the 120Hz version not knowing what my laptop display actually is and while I am not photosensitive this was quite uncomfortable. Thinking I don't understand what that is supposed to be I clicked on the 480Hz to see if that is better/different and that was even worse. As a hail mary I clicked on the 240Hz and well that really made sense and was actually comfortable to look at. So if you are like me and didn't really read through the text, this will only work for you if you select the Hz that matches your display ( which kinda is the whole point of why they are doing that ). If it looks bad you clicked the wrong link reply nyanpasu64 14 hours agoprevI'm still interested in a \"selective MPRT\" GPU or monitor setting, that only does black frame insertion on changed parts of an image and a \"safety margin\" around them. This should reduce flicker on non-moving portions of an image/still screen while keeping moving portions sharper. But this probably isn't useful for office tasks, perhaps video, and high-framerate gaming (but only games running at a lower FPS than the screen can (partially?) redraw). reply stelonix 11 hours agoprevTried on my simple 60Hz PC screen and also on my phone with OLED screen and sadly, it's just a flickering image. Will try later this week on my friends' retrogaming setup. Looks promising reply phafu 7 hours agoprevI'm wondering if it would rather make more sense to emulate a CRT with a video projector and some shutter device (maybe a fan?) in front. Has anyone tried that yet? reply isoprophlex 8 hours agoprevThis probably goes without saying but... If you have photosensitive migraine or epilepsy, stay the hell away from those demos. reply c22 11 hours agoprevCan I use this to play Duck Hunt? reply grishka 8 hours agoparentNo. Light gun games rely on the fact that a CRT display will draw the picture on the screen pretty much at the same time it's generated by the console's video chip. Modern digital displays introduce all kinds of delays due to processing and buffering they do. Usually several frames worth. This shader can't do anything to fix that. reply MarioMan 5 hours agorootparentFor the longest time, I thought this was the only limiting factor, but modern panels are low enough latency for it to work, yet still don’t. The other important factor is the light filter. The NES Zapper has a filter designed to only be sensitive to high-frequency light sources like CRT screens. https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/Zapper#Light_Sensor reply taneq 7 hours agorootparentprevThat said, I bet you could fake the electron beam position with a high frame rate display, a modified version of this shader, and some kind of calibration routine… reply grishka 5 hours agorootparentYou don't really need to emulate the position of the beam, at least not for the NES light gun. When you pull the trigger, the game first makes the entire screen black for one frame, reading the sensor in the gun and checking that it doesn't detect any light, and on the next frame, a white box is drawn where a duck would be. If the gun does detect light on this frame, it's counted as a hit. That second check is performed while the frame with the white box is still being drawn because CRT phosphors decay fairly quickly. You could, in theory, work around this with an LCD/OLED display with a high enough refresh rate that it would make up for the buffering delays. reply IshKebab 7 hours agoparentprevYou wouldn't be able to get horizontal position. reply dsp_person 15 hours agoprevI tried the 120Hz demo but can't really tell there's any effect.

    "commentSummary": [
      "The discussion centers on CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) simulation in GPU shaders, which some users find superior to black frame insertion for emulating old video game visuals.- Users report issues such as persistent banding, flickering, and color shifting, indicating challenges in achieving a convincing CRT effect on modern displays.- Achieving a realistic simulation may require high refresh rates, potentially up to 1000Hz, to reduce motion blur, though this can introduce flickering and artifacts."

    "originBody": "News Gordon Mah Ung, PCWorld editor and renowned hardware journalist, dies at 58 With the heaviest of hearts, PCWorld pays tribute to Gordon Mah Ung, our hardware guru, host of The Full Nerd, exemplary tech journalist, and very good friend. By Jon Phillips Editorial Director, North America Dec 24, 2024 9:14 am PST Image: Foundry PCWorld executive editor Gordon Mah Ung, a tireless journalist we once described as a founding father of hardcore tech journalism, passed away over the weekend after a hard-fought battle with pancreatic cancer. Gordon was 58, and leaves behind a loving wife, two children, older sister, and mother. With more than 25 years’ experience covering computer tech broadly and computer chips specifically, Gordon’s dogged reporting, one-of-a-kind personality, and commitment to journalistic standards touched many, many lives. He will be profoundly missed by co-workers, industry sources, and the PC enthusiasts who read his words and followed him as a video creator. Gordon studied journalism at San Francisco State University and then worked as a police reporter for the Contra Costa Times in the late 1990s. In 1997, he joined Computerworld (a PCWorld sister publication) before I recruited him to join boot magazine (later re-launched as Maximum PC), where he would ultimately lead hardware coverage for 16 years. At Maximum PC, Gordon developed his trademark voice that blended a hardcore passion for PC tech with non-sequiturs, deadpan humor, and occasional bursts of outrage. As a very early podcaster in the tech space, Gordon’s “Rant of the Week” segment on the Maximum PC pod became so legendary, someone made a soundboard of his best sound bytes. (Caution: It can get a bit NSFW in the finest Gordon tradition.) As I listened to his rants from my office, he always had me guessing, “Is he really that angry, or is he playing us?” And that was part of Gordon’s genius. His number one commitment was to investigating the story, informing the public, and helping people make the best technology decisions. But layered on top of all of this was a master showman who effortlessly connected with like-minded enthusiasts. During much of his time at Maximum PC, Gordon was the lead designer, builder and dreamer behind the magazine’s annual Dream Machine project, which entailed creating the most outrageous, high-performing PC possible. Throughout these building endeavors, he cemented his relationships with Intel, AMD, Nvidia, and other hardware manufacturers too numerous to mention. Gordon’s goal was to get the newest, best, most high-performing parts before anyone else. And it didn’t end with CPUs and GPUs. If a piece of technology went into a PC build, Gordon had an encyclopedic knowledge about all of it—memory, storage, PSUs, cases, cooling, and beyond. Gordon was also the unnamed author of Maximum PC’s consumer-advocate “Watchdog” column. As the mysterious Watchdog, Gordon responded to reader complaints about fly-by-night companies and failing products, and applied all his investigative skills to help readers reach a resolution. It was a perfect merger of consumer service, deep reporting and tech smarts that only Gordon could own. Sort of like Star Trek’s Scotty who preferred sticking to his technical manuals, Gordon resisted taking the helm of Maximum PC, but eventually agreed to become Editor-in-Chief in 2014. Flash forward to later that year, when I once again asked for his help—this time to join PCWorld as executive editor in charge of hardware. At PCWorld, Gordon immediately began imprinting his knowledge and personality on our articles and video. His deep-dive CPU reviews were epic, and continued a legacy of no-BS chip coverage that nonetheless earned the trust and respect of the companies he covered. Some of his first segues into video took the form of our Hardcore Hardware series where he married his deep wealth of knowledge with trademark Gordon theatrics. Some of Gordon’s first forays into PCWorld video were for his “Hardcore Hardware” series, which was shot in the bowels of our San Francisco office space. A master showman, Gordon always knew how to connect directly with his YouTube audience. Gordon’s infectious personality always kept The Full Nerd crew in stitches. Here he’s leading the viewer Q&A segment, in which live stream participants lined up to tap Gordon’s deep wealth of PC knowledge. But it wasn’t until we launched The Full Nerd video podcast in 2016, and set Gordon loose on many more video formats, did he come full circle as a creator. As the host of The Full Nerd, Gordon was able to deliver all his knowledge and analysis at a much faster pace—and if you’ve seen The Full Nerd, you know just how much he loved everything the PC scene has to offer. Through his expanded presence on The Full Nerd, Gordon developed deep relationships with not only other YouTube creators, but also with dedicated followers. You could almost hear his fan base cheering him on via the comments feed during live shows. I have often thought that the way Gordon shared his reporting in print and on podcasts served as model for what PC hardware YouTube would become—unapologetically nerdy, opinionated, and full of attitude. But Gordon always delivered a crucial additional element: a legit journalism background and all the rigor it entails. Gordon continued to shoot video and appear on The Full Nerd until weeks before his death. Talk about a commitment to beat coverage. He was following the story to the very end. I met Gordon in journalism school and spent a lot of time with him in the trenches—sharing cubicle spaces, and hearing him riff. I’ll remember his endless debates with co-workers (his bob-and-weave rhetorical style was as maddening as it was entertaining). I’ll remember his two-hour long phone interviews with sources (he interrogated them like a pro, but played the long game in cultivating trust). I’ll remember his reliability in always asking about the TPS reports when some bureaucratic email landed in our inboxes. I’ll remember him slyly trolling me by calling the series “Star Track” even though I’m 99 percent sure he knew that’s not how it’s pronounced. He might have been the staff curmudgeon, but he was also our most fun co-worker, bar none. I’ve long held this romantic notion, maybe foolishly, that journalists are immortalized by their canon. And of all the tech journalists I’ve personally known, no one has a deeper canon, and has touched more followers, and has earned more respect from industry heavyweights than Gordon. From his earliest days on Maximum PC to his last days on PCWorld and the Full Nerd, Gordon touched people in a way I just haven’t seen anywhere else. He’s leaving a gaping hole in the hearts of those who loved him, but what he’s given us lives forever. – Jon Phillips, editorial director, PCWorld Gordon’s family has launched a GoFundMe to help cover medical expenses. Please donate to them if you can. Gordon Mah Ung, remembered Here are more reflections from those who knew Gordon well. If you’d like to share some thoughts on what Gordon meant to you, please email Brad Chacos, PCWorld executive editor, at bchacos@pcworld.com. Unfortunately, we will not be able to add all submissions to this article. ‘The journalist and person I wanted to be when I grow up.’ Here’s something Gordon never knew. He was the beacon for my career before I even had my career. I was born in the early 80s. I was a wide-eyed teen when Gordon was blazing trails in boot and Maximum PC in the late 90s. This was my introduction to enthusiast PC culture, long before the Internet exploded. After spending years unloading trucks and working in factories, I eventually took the plunge into tech journalism. I had $2,000 in the bank and a 6-month-old daughter, but I wanted to do what Gordon did. I ground out endless $15 articles on a content farm called Demand Media. I was eventually added to the tech vertical, which Salon syndicated. And those Salon clips got me a freelance gig with Maximum PC’s nascent Web Blog. YES! The first time I got an email from Gordon with insights on something I was working on, I swooned—and listened, and hustled. Eventually I was fortunate enough to work alongside Gordon at PCWorld, then become his co-host on The Full Nerd, and loooong after that, his boss. (WUT!) I learned so much from him. Gordon always remained my inspiration; the journalist and person I wanted to be when I grow up. He still is. He never knew that. I wish he did, because Gordon literally changed my life. Follow in the footsteps of greatness, kids. And Gordon was the GOAT. — Brad Chacos, PCWorld executive editor and Gordon Mah Ung stan Brad was Gordon’s co-host on The Full Nerd podcast and wrote a separate article remembering his favorite episode — a masterclass in what made Gordon Gordon. ‘He remembered who came before him, and created space for those who would follow’ I may write for a living, but I can’t do justice to Gordon in words. But I know he would nudge me, as he always has, to go for it. See where it takes me. PC building is what led me to cross paths with Gordon—I first met him while sneaking peeks at the wild and wonderful PC builds on the other side of my cubical wall. At the time, I was a video games journalist, covering a platform I’d later get mercilessly razzed about on The Full Nerd. But I liked tech, and I liked learning about PC hardware. It was a trait that Gordon encouraged, nurtured, and transformed into an entire new branch of my career. Gordon was the kind of guy who did that casually, too. His profound love for PC hardware made him open and generous, always actively keeping seats open at the table for others. He remembered who came before him, and created space for those who would follow him. In every capacity I’ve known him—boss, mentor, colleague—he taught me to stay humble, lead with curiosity, and remain fair in coverage. Combined with his laser-sharp precision and analysis, his example forever motivates me to think deeply and thoughtfully. The industry will not be the same without him. —Alaina Yee, PCWorld senior editor and Maximum PC alum ‘He welcomed me in and let me know I belonged’ Newsrooms attract characters. Misfits, hopeless optimists, unrepentent goofballs, anti-establishment types, lovable weirdos, and willful contrarians. Gordon was all of those things, but most of all, he was kind. He was always first in line to help a friend in need. When there was an emergency, he ran toward it. I don’t think he was a Boy Scout, but he was always prepared. When I was the new guy at Maximum PC, I knew all about computers and nothing about magazines. Gordon didn’t care. He welcomed me in and let me know I belonged there. He answered all of my stupidest questions, helped me when I needed help, and let me make mistakes when I needed to mess up. And he made sure that we all got into good trouble on the reg. He taught me that our job, as editors, is always to serve the reader. It didn’t matter that advertisers paid the bills; the people who trusted us to give them advice and guidance were always our number one priority. It was his guiding principle and he lived it every day. He was never afraid of speaking truth to power in service of the reader. And he taught so many young journalists to do the same. I already miss my friend terribly, but I’m profoundly grateful that I got to share a small part of his journey with him. The world is a worse place without him. —Will Smith, Full Nerd regular and former Maximum PC editor-in-chief ‘Gordon was always at the center of it’ I hardly need to list Gordon’s many great attributes—he was a beloved legend in the PC community for a reason. But I’m among a smaller number of people who had the privilege of working with him day to day on a team, first at Maximum PC and then PCWorld. Despite being a larger-than-life figure for both of those brands, Gordon was the consummate team member—always willing to patiently explain something, always down to riff and collaborate, always kind and respectful of others. He seemed to genuinely thrive on the group effort. My favorite work memories are of the Maximum PC bullpen where the staff would banter and laugh seemingly all day—it’s amazing we ever got anything done. Gordon was always at the center of it. He was a truly outstanding individual who I’m proud to have worked with and know as a friend. —Katherine Stevenson, PCWorld managing editor and Maximum PC alum ‘Gordon was the newsiest nerd I’ve ever known’ It’s fair to say Gordon helped define what PCWorld is today, from our mission to especially our voice. I grew up in a newsroom, and Gordon was the newsiest nerd I’ve ever known: utterly dedicated to depth, accuracy, and context, but with a cynical, collegial sense of humor. He also cared deeply about understanding how tech worked and unearthing its deep, dark secrets that manufacturers glossed over. The man simply loved his job. We all loved him. – Mark Hachman, senior editor, PCWorld ‘We are fortunate to have had someone so genuine fighting for us’ Gordon Mah Ung is an irreplaceable force of good for this industry and for consumers. His background in police reporting and journalism afforded a strong foundation to his work and a unique perspective not found anywhere else in the computer reporting business. Like many others, Gordon’s work in Maximum PC inspired me long before I was ever in the industry. Back when I was in high school, I would buy magazines Gordon wrote for every month. In particular, his “Watchdog” consumer advocacy columns inspired our own similar content. He knew when and how to push back to protect consumers, and Gordon served as a mentor for me. Gordon was kind enough to regularly listen to my rambling as I sought his advice and experience, navigating complicated issues of ethics and conflict. He always brought grounded, sobering advice. I still can’t believe that I have been fortunate enough to have worked alongside a hero of mine, and still cannot believe his passing. Gordon and I got along from day one, and I will forever keep his perspective in mind. His presence at events will be greatly missed. Gordon Mah Ung has long been my favorite co-host in videos for his “real” demeanor and his candor; he is exactly who he presents himself as on camera, and we are fortunate to have had someone so genuine fighting for us in this industry. Gordon, thank you for everything you have taught me, and thank you for unwaveringly looking out for consumers. —Steve Burke, editor-in-chief, GamersNexus ‘If Gordon praised my system, it felt like I’d won an Oscar’ Gordon reviewed our PCs for 25 years, and he has written more kind words about my company than anyone. It’s a bittersweet honor to offer a few words about Gordon in return. For the first decade I knew Gordon, I learned little about him personally. He was like a test we had to pass. At Maximum PC, he was the ultimate authority on whether the systems we were building were worth anyone buying. If Gordon praised my system, it felt like I’d won an Oscar. But he never let a missed detail get by him, and trying to impress Gordon has become a constant of my career. I would not be where I am today without Gordon’s approval. But over the years I was fortunate enough to get to know Gordon a bit personally. I always felt privileged when he’d call me for long off-the-record talks about the latest PC industry intrigue, and we’d inevitably tangent off to talking about Aliens or Star Trek, or “the kids building PCs these days who don’t know how easy they have it.” Gordon was a kindred spirit: an O.G. sci-fi and computer nerd who loved tech, and always remembered the point of the hobby was having fun with cool toys. But the biggest impression he made on me was when he and his family stopped by my shop a few years ago. Such wonderful people, and I was so impressed by his children: kind, smart and funny—exactly whom you’d expect Gordon to have made the world better with. Meeting them, I learned his legacy was not just in what he wrote, but in who he taught, and who he loved. Thank you, Gordon.—Kelt Reeves, Falcon Northwest ‘A truly inquisitive journalist, he sought the stories behind the stories’ Most of us know Gordon as a long-time tech journalist, as one of the best and the most passionate in the industry. Gordon was a truly inquisitive journalist, he sought the stories behind the stories by taking a real interest in the products, companies, and the people behind them. I was lucky enough to know Gordon as a friend. We checked-in often with one another. I would ask about his health, and he would ask about my flying. Occasionally, we’d talk industry updates but most of our conversations were about family, friends, life, and the things that matter most. He was so proud of his family, not too long ago sending me Halloween Ghostbusters pics and the amazing photos his son took at an air show last year. I will miss our conversations and my friend. He was one of the best and forever will be. —Frank Azor, Chief Architect of Gaming Solutions, AMD, and Alienware co-founder ‘Any good work I do reflects at least in part on Gordon’ If you’ve ever done research on anything technical, chances are you’ve read something Gordon wrote. His keen intellect and razor-sharp wit helped him connect the dots on both the technology and the people that make up our modern world. His talent for investigation was honed over a long and storied career; he was a force in our industry. I will miss his advice and insight, as I am sure will many others. Often one can infer a lot about a person from their writing, and while I’m sure a kind reasonableness comes through clearly in Gordon’s writing, his was a type of kindness and patience that is exceedingly rare. Gordon always loved to chat, find out what you were up to, and was always kind and thoughtful. While his writing and insights have become a part of computing history, any good work I do reflects at least in part on Gordon because of his positive influences. So, in that way, he will live on in the work of others. I will forever have fond memories of our many chats, and while I’d love to have just one more chat, I am thankful that he is able to rest for a while. —Wendell Wilson, Level1Techs ‘An endorsement from Gordon could catapult a brand to success’ Gordon shined a spotlight on the small businesses that thrived within the DIY PC building community. He was unapologetically critical, so an endorsement from Gordon could catapult a brand to success. Fearlessly advocating for consumers, he stood on the frontlines, championing fairness and quality. We listened to his stories, laughed like old friends, and connected through a shared passion. Gordon was truly the GOAT of the PC community—a legend who will never be forgotten. Maximum PC’s annual “Dream Machine” issue catapulted sales for brands featured in it—especially small businesses like mine. I remember Ben Rising from Mountain Mods having his UFO case spotlighted alongside my billet radiator grills. When I met Ben years later, we both agreed that Gordon’s feature brought massive exposure. Gordon gave me the opportunity to build the official Star Trek PC for an article. He championed countless small brands like CaseLabs because he genuinely believed in their work. Silverstone’s legendary TJ07 case was born from Gordon’s feedback. What Jay Leno is to cars, Gordon was to desktop PCs—a true enthusiast, advocating for all of us. —Bill Owen, Mnpctech ‘Gordon was uncannily skilled at demystifying complex technology’ Gordon Mah Ung wasn’t just the most talented tech journalist of his generation; he was one of the best tech journalists of all time. Brutally honest, yet eminently humble, Gordon was uncannily skilled at demystifying complex technology for readers of every stripe. Both in writing and during live podcasts, Gordon schooled and entertained us with his wicked sense of humor. – Michael Brown, executive editor, TechHive and boot magazine alum ‘I’m one of the very few people who has seen Gordon in a suit and tie’ Few people can say about someone, “I knew him when.” I have the honor of saying that about Gordon Ung. I was a junior editor at PCWorld when Gordon arrived as an intern. This was OG PC times: We still used 5.25-inch floppy disks (3.5-inch disks were the new hotness); we argued about IDE vs. SCSI interfaces; and there was only one speed of CD-ROM drive. That means I’m also one of the very few people who has seen Gordon in a suit and tie, which he wore on his first day. We told him he could dress like a normal person starting tomorrow. Who knew then that he would go on to build an illustrious career in PC building and gaming that would culminate in “Full Nerd.” Maybe I don’t miss waiting for Gordon to drop his 4,000-word CPU review with 18 charts into my lap, a few scant hours before the NDA lifted. But I knew he hadn’t slept the last two days, so what was one late night for me. I do miss how Gordon and I could casually sprinkle “Star Trek”’and “Star Wars” references into our daily conversations and totally understand each other. Gordon was a touchstone for me: part of my earliest days at PCWorld, and part of my proudest days there a quarter-century later. Farewell my friend. —Melissa Riofrio, former Executive Editor, PCWorld ‘Gordon showed his soft side through his photography.’ I’ve had the great privilege of reading Gordon’s work before even entering college. As an owner of the very first issue of boot Magazine, I followed his journey from beginning to end. However, our paths crossed when I contributed to the magazine after it was renamed to Maximum PC, and had the chance to meet Gordon and become his friend in 2001. Although not many people know, outside of the ever changing world of PC tech, Gordon was a deep lover of photography and I had the chance to experience this with him. We both shared a mutual love for a hobby that was far slower in pace than how fast technology evolves. Through this, I would learn that Gordon was actually a very patient person—and you can see that given the relationships in the PC gaming community that he cultivated in a way that was only possible with love and care. His photography was the same. Gordon actually bought a lens from me in 2003. A photo of a young basketball league player shooting hoops. Gordon Mah Ung/IDG I have a photo that Gordon took that he sent me many years ago. It’s the only personal photo related to Gordon that I have. We talked about photography endlessly. And while in print and online Gordon would not cut any technology company an ounce of slack, Gordon showed his soft side through his photography. In 2015 when Maximum PC recruited me to be its EIC, I reached out to Gordon immediately and talked to him about the role. I actually tried to convince him to stay and perhaps let me take on a hardware editor role instead, but he was adamant that he was going to try something new. After I joined, I was given a tour of the office and passed by Gordon’s old desk. I had never seen a space or desk that was buried under so much hardware—even an old 3dfx Voodoo 1 was there. I knew then, I would never be able to fill his very large shoes. RIP Gordon. I’ll see you in the pages we once shared. — Tuan Nguyen, former Maximum PC editor-in-chief ‘I will always remember showing off the first Ryzen system and Gordon stepping forward to be the first journalist to get hands on and experience it’ Gordon is the pinnacle of tech journalism, authentic to his core and still engaging and fun to be around, work with, and listen to. I will always remember Sonoma, showing off the first Ryzen system and him stepping forward to be the first journalist to get hands on and experience it. He played it so cool, and then later told me how awesome it was — and how bad my poker face was. We will all miss him and tech journalism will never be the same but we are undoubtedly better for having known him. — James Prior, former AMD senior product manager ‘Gordon’s candor made me want to be more candid. His determination made me want to be more determined.’ Gordon wasn’t afraid to be the lone voice. I doubt I’m the only one who’s said that today, but it’s what made him a legend. He believed what he believed—and more importantly, he said it, as if 12 Angry Men were about why the 1080 Ti was overhyped. It made a major impression on me. More importantly, it made it easier for me (and maybe everyone at PCWorld, though I don’t want to speak for others). Publications have souls. The masthead obscures that fact over the years, lends some semblance of continuity, but publications inevitably take on the personalities of the people who work for them. Gordon’s candor made me want to be more candid. His determination made me want to be more determined. His curiosity made me want to be more curious. His knowledge made me want to be more knowledgeable—and he had a lot of knowledge. Gordon could rattle off the clock speed of a 30-year-old CPU like it released last week. When he hated something, he could channel a certain two-middle-fingers attitude better than just about anyone. But when he loved something, he’d be first over the wall to champion it. He had integrity, that rarified kind we associate with the best journalists. Sure, we were only covering PC hardware—but he covered PC hardware with the care and consideration of a true newspaper stalwart. And he never seemed to get tired of it, even after decades in the trenches. That’s Gordon, journalist and mentor. But I think it’s just as important to mention Gordon, the friend. He was hilarious. He always made time to chat with me when I came into the office—often hours of time. It meant (and still means) a lot to me. If I could leave you with one image of the man, something that I think sums him up: PCWorld had these tiny little cubicles, but Gordon was never there. He was always in the PCWorld lab, running a half-dozen benchmarks, his actual desk covered in boxes full of to-be-reviewed hardware—so much hardware that it usually spilled into the adjacent cubicle (or two). The guy loved PCs, and he loved the job, and we loved him. — Hayden Dingman, PCWorld alum ‘You couldn’t help to be better. Gordon just had that effect on you.’ Gordon was THE standard I would use to determine if I was going to buy in on PC hardware or not. For decades. If it met the Gordon standard, it was legit gear…period. Years later when I was working in the tech biz at Creative / Sound Blaster I had the absolute honor to sit on the Full Nerd with all of you, talking about audio hardware and it’s relevancy to the legacy of PC and PC building. I loved sitting down with Gordon because his depth of knowledge and no-BS approach to interviewing kept you on your toes and brought out the A-game in all of us lucky enough to be in the other chair. You came out of the spot with a ton of insight and new perspective. You couldn’t help to be better. Gordon just had that effect on you. He is a voice and talent that simply cannot be replaced. The wisdom he held was acquired and steeled in the brightest and darkest times of the PC hardware world. — Ryan Schlieper, former Creative / Sound Blaster product marketing manager ‘He laid into my PC (short for “Piece of Crap”) with all the gusto he gave to one of his many podcast rants, and every word of it was correct’ Gordon Ung made me look like an idiot. But that wasn’t very hard to do way, way back when I served as Maximum PC’s (tallest) associate editor. It was my first real job out of college, and I walked in with the swagger of someone who had spent too much of his college time fussing with his monolith of a desktop PC. Upon meeting Gordon, I was immediately humbled. Here was a guy with an encyclopedic knowledge of PCs and components that was only rivaled by his ever-growing stack of industry business cards. Everyone knew him, everyone loved him, and he could fix nearly any issue with a quick call or an email to a contact. He wrote, I swear, nearly half the magazine each month — and never once let an immense workload get in the way of benchmarking, accuracy, or fairness. He loved it. But, to the humiliation. For fun, Will put Gordon and I in a head-to-head face-off one month to see who could build the best gaming PC on a restricted budget. I figured this was my time to shine. Though I couldn’t outbuild the genius behind each year’s Dream Machines, I had a chance at out-researching him. I scoured forums. I cross-analyzed all kinds of benchmarks. I came up with a parts list that looked pretty compelling, and I knew I had it in the bag once I heard glimmers of his “lesser list.” We went to the local Fry’s and bought all of our stuff, and I just squeaked in under the pricing cutoff. But once we made it back to the office, I realized my fatal flaw: I forgot to buy a case. A freakin’ case. I proceeded to mount all my components — if you can really call it that — in the video card’s freakin’ cardboard box. This frankenPC looked as ugly as you’re imaging. It was probably a fire hazard when I started, less so once Gordon was done testing and roasting it in the subsequent Magazine write-up. He laid into my PC (short for “Piece of Crap”) with all the gusto he gave to one of his many podcast rants, and every word of it was correct. Hell, I’m pretty sure his PC’s benchmarks even beat mine. And his offering looked great: Cheap, certainly, but built to the same standard of cleanliness and perfection as anything else he’d crank out in the MPC Labs. Though I was at Maximum PC for what felt like a sneeze compared to Gordon’s long, incredible career in technology journalism, the lessons he imparted during our many Labs hangouts have stuck with me for decades. I’ll catch my mind wandering to one of the Dream Machines when I’m building my own PC. I’ll think of our times on the podcast, including his never-ending rants, when someone in the tech industry does something unapologetically stupid. I’ll think back to his intense professionalism whenever I land a new gig, and remind myself to bring the same authoritative flair and joy for the craft that made up his incredible body of work. And I think back to our contest whenever I drive by the local Fry’s — now transformed into pickleball courts. I can only imagine what he would have had to say about that. — David Murphy, Maximum PC alum ‘A tech support guy for us tech editors’ The world has lost one of the foremost tech minds and an all-around great guy in Gordon. He was a real inspiration to me when I first started at PCWorld in 2021. There’s a big time zone difference between Australia and the U.S, but no matter what time it was, if I dropped him a message, I could always expect a reply in a short time — and no question was too banal or stupid. He quickly made me feel like part of the team. Gordon was so knowledgeable about PCs and tech generally that if I had to use an analogy, I would say he was like a tech support guy for us tech editors. Yet he was so humble too and always willing to share what he knew. I deeply appreciated his strong convictions about tech and great sense of humor. I remember he once made me laugh by appearing on the bridge of the Starship Enterprise (in a looped video background) in a PCWorld team meeting. Gordon had an uncanny ability to cut through the spin and find the truth of a story and wasn’t afraid to shake up the status quo. He was a true editor and journalist. But most of all he was just a “top bloke,” as we say in Australia — and someone I’ll always be thankful to have known. — Dominic Bayley, PCWorld Australia editor ‘I’ve been following Gordon’s work for over 20 years, since I was a 12 year old kid just finding out about how cool computers can be.’ I’ve been following Gordon’s work for over 20 years, since I was a 12 year old kid just finding out about how cool computers can be. Every month my mom would bring me to the book store and I would pick up the latest issue of Maximum PC. I remember Gordon’s excellent columns in Maximum PC with his signature snarky take. I’ve been a weekly listener of Full Nerd since it launched. I have had countless laughs and “hell yeah” moments as Gordon draws the analogy between PC hardware and 7 mpg muscle cars. We think alike in that respect: “bigger bar better.” It’s people like Gordon that lead geeks like me into careers in the tech space and to foster our passion for technology. I will truly miss Gordon. — Ken Ottaviano, longtime Gordon Mah Ung fan Author: Jon Phillips, Editorial Director, North America Jon has been covering all manner of consumer hardware since 1995.

It was an exhausting process, though no worse than dealing with a bad cold. After about two years (if I remember correctly), we exchanged details through the organization that facilitates these donations. However, the recipient never reached out to me. Out of curiosity, I googled the person and discovered this person was apparently a neo-nazi (at least very very right leaning) from East Germany. reply belorn 5 hours agoparentAs someone who has been trained in CPR, looking into the patient world views before deciding to help is not good. Trying to weight if a human life is worth saving generally only leads to a very dark place that only game theory scientists and philosophers should do. Thankfully in EU we have laws against this in terms of human rights. Doctors can not refuse to provide medical help to anyone regardless of patients world views. Far leaning left, far leaning right, women, men, color of skin and so on. If blood or organ donations would start to allow discrimination based on world views then such restrictions would be struck down in courts, based on the same principles that is behind the opposition to Neo-nazism. reply bbkingkrimson 4 hours agorootparentDefinitely agree with you on this. It was a bit disappointing when I found out. As for bone marrow, I’ve got plenty to give, but in the 18 years I’ve been registered, I’ve only been contacted twice.

If the medical intervention is unlikely to be effective, the limited medical resources is better to be allocated elsewhere. Behavior and access to social support can be part of the assessment of how effective the procedure will be, but it doesn't weight the social worthiness of the patient. This principle is similar to why palliative care is different from medical care. At some point the effectiveness of health care is so low that it mostly do more harm or drain resources better allocated to other patients. It is not that elderly people are not worthy of health care, and the ethical considerations focus on making sure its not a value based judgement about who should live and who shouldn't. reply lr4444lr 5 hours agoparentprevI hope that your gift of life to him will one day make him realize life is too fleeting to be expend it on such a hateful ideology. reply lifestyleguru 7 hours agoparentprevIf you seek contact simply fly from Berlin airports, the recipient will search and frisk you. reply eszed 10 hours agoprevThe writing in this piece is a bit over-wrought (funnily enough, I don't mind that so much now that it makes me think it was written by a real person and not an AI), but it's still worth reading.
