Inside is a crappy Android phone, set to Shazam constantly, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It's solar powered, and the mic is pointed down at the street below. Heard of Shot Spotter? Microphones are installed across cities across the United States by police to detect gunshots, purported to not be very accurate. This is that, but for music. This is culture surveillance.

There is this undercurrent to our technology landscape. A kind of subculture somewhere in the locus of the hackersphere where a kind of punk-rock ethos rules the roost. I can only describe it as a live exploration of concepts _through_ technology, where functional fixedness is a foreign concept, including in the shared experience of social construct; everything becomes parts to be remixed in a way. In this place people just do things that, by way of having fun, just becomes art. It's emergent gameplay just by following a solitary \"rule of cool.\" I saw this page and was immediately transported back to the late 1990's and early 'aughts. The kind of \"I glued these things together and just look\" attitude that graced the pages of hackaday.com and slashdot.org. LED \"throwies\" come to mind. In this case we have a de-facto art installation. I imagine that this was probably put together with odds and ends, maybe installed illegally, and probably doesn't have longevity in mind for its construction. It lightheartedly challenges some conventions, challenges ideas about privacy, brushes up against copyright, and is entertaining to boot. Most importantly, how it was made is less interesting than what it _does_, and where it carries the conversation of the observer. Or maybe: that's the point. reply engineer_22 0 minutes agoparentyou must be an architect reply saghm 47 minutes agoprevI notice that on September 28 (near the top of the list, since it doesn't seem to have anything for today yet) the same Pitbull song was detected separately a little less than an hour apart, and I can't help but wonder if it was the same person listening to it on loop. Several months ago, my fiancee and I overheard someone driving outside blasting Adele's \"Someone Like You\" from inside our apartment, and every 45 minutes or so we'd hear it again, so we couldn't help but assume it was the same person driving around the city with it on loop, probably going through some rough breakup or something. reply IncreasePosts 4 hours agoprevAlright, who wants to go wardriving around the mission with me, blasting Never Gonna Give You Up? reply banannaise 4 hours agoparentI suppose this would be \"Rickdriving\"? reply indymike 4 hours agorootparentI think this is just literal rickrolling. reply worstspotgain 4 hours agorootparentThey see rickrollin, they hatin, patrollin and tryin'a catch the Bop Spotter. reply zdw 3 hours agorootparentRidin' Qwerty reply Neff 4 hours agorootparentprevRickrollin on dubs? reply davidcollantes 3 hours agoprevI played, more than once, a few of the sound snippets. I think the Shazam \"findings\" are highly inaccurate. Fun project nonetheless! walz, could you write more about the setup, maybe to propitiate others to replicate it in other cities? reply walz 2 hours agoparentI've listened to a bunch of the snippets and you can usually just barely hear the sound in the background. Which makes me think Shazam is very accurate. I really should read more about how Shazam's algorithm works, because it feels like magic. The phone records 10 minute chunks of audio at a time, in airplane mode. Every 10 minutes, airplane mode is turned off and the audio is uploaded to a server. The server then splits the audio into 15 second overlapping chunks, and each is passed to Shazam's API (no official API, but someone reverse engineered it and made a great Python package). This setup is super power efficient! The phone dips down to a minimum 70% percent battery by the early morning. reply jldugger 2 hours agorootparent> I really should read more about how Shazam's algorithm works, because it feels like magic. https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~dpwe/papers/Wang03-shazam.pdf reply alwa 9 minutes agorootparentAlso, if you’re more visual, algorithm inventor Avery Wang delivered an accessible and detailed lecture at DAFx several years back: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YVTnj3OIhwI I found it especially insightful because he started from the beginning and traced the thought process as the algorithm developed and became more sophisticated. reply rconti 59 minutes agorootparentprevwill be interesting to see how it fares in the winter! reply trainyperson 3 hours agoparentprevSame, although I know Shazam does most of its work on very high frequencies so it’s possible we’re not able to hear the part that got matched. The “Not Like Us” snippet (09/29 2:43pm) is easily recognizable though. And “Rockabye” can be heard at 3:05pm. reply geor9e 1 hour agoprevI hear a Muni bus stop nearby, and a lot of voices at 3AM, so I am guessing it's near bars, maybe Mission street. Maybe a pole near enough to an apartment fire escape to ziptie a solar panel. I wonder if the timestamps are accurate enough for me to ride my bike down mission blasting a song, and check strava for where I was at that timestamp, then spot the spotter. Just for fun of course, not to post or dox. reply bicx 4 hours agoprevThis kind of project has made me realize that somewhere along the way, I quit thinking of tech as a way to build anything fun. I need to rekindle that goofball spirit. reply spmurrayzzz 2 hours agoparentI've definitely noticed the same in my career. Its easy to get caught up in the day-to-day and forget some of the reasons you got started doing all this in the first place (in my case, because its fun and I'm passionate about software/hardware). On a whim, I decided to invest time in writing down one idea per week of anything fun I could hack on. It doesn't really matter whether or not I go through with it, I keep the stakes low: just write an idea down. That way it forces me to think about things I could build for myself or others/friends/family without much cognitive investment. The end result has not only had a nonzero impact on my motivation to start new projects, it has impacted my ability to actually follow through. And I've noticed the practice has made the ideation loop happen more frequently than once per week over time. reply abraae 3 minutes agoparentprevJust reorient your thinking to consider building CRUD web apps as fun. reply Maxim2572 2 hours agoparentprevI read this post every few months to keep that spirit https://justforfunnoreally.dev/ reply GeoAtreides 1 hour agoparentprevThe embedded world awaits you: https://microengineer.eu/2018/05/01/diy-night-clock-projecto...

And I noticed that a surprisingly high number of songs are in Spanish. So I'll venture to hypothesize that this project will identify a correlation between musical taste and preference for how loud it is played, rather than accurately capturing the \"musical taste of the neighborhood\". Any thoughts on that? Have you tested how loud a song needs to be played in order to be picked up? reply travisjungroth 22 minutes agoparentMalmquist bias[0] for neighborhood music! It would be hard to find that correlation because you can’t get a base rate. I don’t think you can measure the distance, so you don’t know if it’s loud or close. Maybe there’s no correlation independent of the music taste of the neighborhood. Lots of Spanish doesn’t surprise me. It’s a neighborhood that’s still largely Mexican, and Latin Pop is really big in the US in general. [0]https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malmquist_bias reply aeturnum 24 minutes agoparentprevI don't know what a \"surprisingly high\" number is - but the mission is about 1/3 Spanish speaking as far as I can tell[1]. [1] It's hard actually, but this language diversity data(https://www.sf.gov/data/san-francisco-language-diversity-dat...) says there are ~20k speakers and this district population breakdown (https://www.sfgov.org/ccsfgsa/current-san-francisco-supervis...) says there are ~67k residents reply mminer237 10 minutes agorootparentThis is looking about 90% Spanish songs and 10% reggae-fusion. reply worstspotgain 6 hours agoprevThe Mission is a variegated place. It's been undergoing gentrification for 4 decades but it never seems to get there - so much so that you could say that that's become its \"thing.\" The exact location where the phone is placed makes a huge difference. Going from Valencia to Shotwell to the BART plazas to the Latino bars and back to the hills your soundtrack would change quite a few times. reply asveikau 1 hour agoparentThe amount of gentrification in the Mission varies a lot based on where you go. I volunteer on 24th st. weekly, something I've been doing since 2019. The crowd at the volunteering is mostly immigrants. I am white, native English speaker but I speak decent Spanish. It's mind boggling to me sometimes how the two communities exist in nearly the same space but don't often overlap. I remember one time I went into a restaurant and they engaged with me in Spanish right off the bat, we never switched to English, I got a table to dine-in and they waited on me and it felt pretty much like dining at a restaurant like in travels I've had in central America... A few months later I brought a friend to the same place and I ended up getting a 100% gringo restaurant experience. Another place down the street and the cashier is like some very pale upper midwest looking hipstery guy who looks \"whiter than me\", and it felt like a totally different world, one that didn't overlap at all with description above. reply loxias 15 minutes agorootparentJust offering another point of data, your observation of the \"same space with no overlap\" and the anecdote about the restaurant hits so true for me! Almost the exactly same thing happened to me, Spanish nearly the whole time. Later, with a coworker, 100% gringo experience. Hilarious! The alternation between places like this as you walk up 24th always struck me as notable. This couldn't have been later than 2011, at which time the zeitgeist was replete with jabs at the ongoing gentrification. :) reply azinman2 2 hours agoparentprevWhere does gentrification begin and end? The mission went from Ohlone to Spanish to German/Irish/Italian immigrants, then Mexican immigrants, then Central American, then LGBT, then wider punks/misfits and other immigrants including Filipinos, before the techies started moving in. I don’t really understand this term because it seems to suggest before a richer class moves into an area it displaces “the true inhabitants,” but those true inhabitants have almost always displaced someone else. reply worstspotgain 2 hours agorootparentIt involves a massive increase in housing prices, primarily brought about by artificial supply restrictions, that results in unintentional displacement. The reason the Mission is still variegated is rent control, along with various forms of affordable housing, housesharing, master tenant slumlords, SROs, extended family arrangements, etc. It's a pretty unique and amazing place really. reply wozniacki 1 hour agorootparentYeah I'm sure handshake politics goes a long way in these neighborhoods often to the detriment of the unsuspecting, unconnected and un-special-interest-group attached renters and owners.

I think the boundaries are pourous around this topic. (Sure, I just called someone random on the web an asshole. I don’t mean it with any force. In London we get people riding busses playing their im-personal stereos loudly, sometimes. I often don’t like it either. I often use headphones for my own sounds but not the blocking kind, and will have to stop my music because of thwirs. One time someone got into the Tube/metro carriage I was in playing loud Brazilian music from a speaker on a trolley. At first it annoyed me, but after a few bars it got me grooving. Then I realised it was a funk-infused cover of a traditional capoeira song, so I steuck up a conversation with the other rider about Brazil and capoeira. Made my day.) reply ehaliewicz2 1 hour agorootparentRealizing that you enjoyed being forced to listen to music you didn't decide to listen to doesn't mean you might be an asshole for not enjoying it at other times.

However, if you are hard of hearing to the point where you are actually disturbing others, I would recommend headphones. reply fwip 4 minutes agorootparentIt is not generally legal to drive while wearing headphones. In some US states it is specifically banned, and in many others you will get pulled over for distracted driving.

I've certainly heard people blast Wagner or Orff at high volumes. reply jhardy54 4 hours agorootparent“turn down” isn’t about the volume of the music btw. reply microtherion 4 hours agorootparentInteresting! What is it about, then? reply alach11 4 hours agorootparentThe phrase \"turn down\" is the opposite of \"turn up\". To \"turn down\" would be to decrease the intensity of the party. And \"turn down for what\" means something like \"don't stop the party for any reason\". reply microtherion 2 hours agorootparentOK, that makes sense in the context of \"another round of shots\". But in my experience, party intensity and music volume are generally correlated, so you would probably turn down the former by turning down the latter. reply windexh8er 3 hours agorootparentprevPretty sure that's not the case here. To \"turn down\" is a common phrase (at least in the US) that is used to describe changing something by use of a control. As described at Wiktionary [0] - it's an idiomatic way of saying that you're going to lower the volume through use of a control to do that. The context that was used has nothing to do with party.

Hmm, but maybe all culture works like that. reply zerd 2 hours agorootparenthttps://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/turn-down-for-what/ > At its core, turn down for what is a phrase used to promote having a good time.

While this is a nice idea on a local scale, when scaled up it has horrendous privacy implications. reply xnorswap 8 hours agorootparentAnd music fingerprinting is probably incredibly accurate, because it can work similar to linguistic fingerprinting. There was a site posted to this place a year or so ago, which looked at work frequencies to find alt-accounts. I don't hide the fact that I use a different account on different computers, so I have a personal account and work accounts and end up changing accounts each time I change jobs. This site correlated all my accounts, using a very basic fingerprinting technique of looking for words which a user uses uncommonly often. It found them all with a good degree of confidence. I haven't seen reference to that site since, I suspect it got taken down. Musical fingerprinting would be accurate to a similar degree. You wouldn't look for the music someone listens to most, you'd look for uncommon combinations. A combination a just a few songs that someone listens to unusually more than other people is probably enough for a good enough correlation for fingerprinting. reply 082349872349872 7 hours agorootparentLeaking 33 bits over time, especially a lifetime, is nearly impossible to avoid.

Someone else might try approaching you about working out a deal to pay you to slip their new song into the mix.

Also curious about those battery stats: > Battery currently at 80% (a decrease of 6% in the last 4 hours). That's gotta be an OLED screen at lowest brightness or, even more likely, a fully black overlay app since the mic is constantly active and either locally processing it into Shazam and streaming fingerprints or (less cpu, more network) streaming it to a server which then does the processing and queries Shazam. As a comparison, my work phone is off+idle basically the whole time and takes twice as long to charge at a higher wattage as my personal phone (i.e.: large battery by my standards), and that uses nearly a percent per hour while the screen is off with maybe 20 messages and one email coming in across 4 hours. I'm amazed by the idea, that no rate limit has kicked in on Shazam, that they didn't connect it to a power source, and that the battery is lasting so long!

If they wanted privacy they should have done their thing in private.

If you weren’t it would be legally impossible for any two people to leave two voice messages simultaneously while in earshot of each other. You also couldn’t use Spotify in public ever. You can certainly get in trouble for the uses you put that recording to, but as the OP isn’t selling or rebroadcasting and would have a solid fair use defense for any incidental copyright infringement, I don’t see any colorable claim that anyone this thing can hear has any reasonable expectation of privacy from it.

I'll start: \"Mobile devices, the researchers conclude, listen to conversations through microphones and create personalized ads based on what the person wants or has done.\" [1] \"This passive listening ensures the virtual assistants are ready to help you with a task when needed. However, depending on the developer, voice tech apps may also use your conversation data to recommend ads and content. For instance, Google uses Assistant conversation data to personalize ad and content recommendations. Others, like Apple’s Siri, claim not to use conversation data to build marketing profiles or curate ads.\" [2] But this exercise will actually produce less fruitful results because it's possible to prove anything via the online \"research\" nowadays. So let's try a different tack- thinking for ourselves. FAANG are extremely notorious brokers of data. Everything about you and your browsing behavior is collected. I hope we can agree on this. Then why on earth would your conclusion be \"they don't broker or process our audio data\"? You'll have to have something better than it would consume battery life or would leave an identifiable trail of bytes, both of which could be mitigated by some clever programming. Much better to have the hypothesis (hence \"pretty sure\") that they do, and then scrutinize. Until something definitive comes out that they absolutely do not, it's much more solid ground than a conclusion that you can simply trust these large corporations.

    "originBody": "Simon Willison’s Weblog Subscribe NotebookLM’s automatically generated podcasts are surprisingly effective 29th September 2024 Audio Overview is a fun new feature of Google’s NotebookLM which is getting a lot of attention right now. It generates a one-off custom podcast against content you provide, where two AI hosts start up a “deep dive” discussion about the collected content. These last around ten minutes and are very podcast, with an astonishingly convincing audio back-and-forth conversation. Here’s an example podcast created by feeding in an earlier version of this article (prior to creating this example): Playback speed: 0.75x 1x 1.5x 2x 3x NotebookLM is effectively an end-user customizable RAG product. It lets you gather together multiple “sources”—documents, pasted text, links to web pages and YouTube videos—into a single interface where you can then use chat to ask questions of them. Under the hood it’s powered by their long-context Gemini 1.5 Pro LLM. Once you’ve loaded in some sources, the Notebook Guide menu provides an option to create an Audio Overview: Thomas Wolf suggested “paste the url of your website/linkedin/bio in Google’s NotebookLM to get 8 min of realistically sounding deep congratulations for your life and achievements from a duo of podcast experts”. I couldn’t resist giving that a go, so I gave it the URLs to my about page and my Twenty years of my blog post and got back this 10m45s episode (transcript), which was so complimentary it made my British toes curl with embarrassment. [...] What’s the key thing you think people should take away from Simon Willison? I think for me, it’s the power of consistency, curiosity, and just this like relentless desire to share what you learn. Like Simon’s journey, it’s a testament to the impact you can have when you approach technology with those values. It’s so true. He’s a builder. He’s a sharer. He’s a constant learner. And he never stops, which is inspiring in itself. I had initially suspected that this feature was inspired by the PDF to Podcast demo shared by Stephan Fitzpatrick in June, but it turns out it was demonstrated a month earlier than that in the Google I/O keynote. Jaden Geller managed to get the two hosts to talk about the internals of the system, potentially revealing some of the details of the prompts that are used to generate the script. I ran Whisper against Jaden’s audio and shared the transcript in a Gist. An excerpt: The system prompt spends a good chunk of time outlining the ideal listener, or as we call it, the listener persona. [...] Someone who, like us, values efficiency. [...] We always start with a clear overview of the topic, you know, setting the stage. You’re never left wondering, “What am I even listening to?” And then from there, it’s all about maintaining a neutral stance, especially when it comes to, let’s say, potentially controversial topics. A key clue to why Audio Overview sounds so good looks to be SoundStorm, a Google Research project which can take a script and a short audio example of two different voices and turn that into an engaging full audio conversation: SoundStorm generates 30 seconds of audio in 0.5 seconds on a TPU-v4. We demonstrate the ability of our model to scale audio generation to longer sequences by synthesizing high-quality, natural dialogue segments, given a transcript annotated with speaker turns and a short prompt with the speakers’ voices. Also interesting: this 35 minute segment from the NYTimes Hard Fork podcast where Kevin Roose and Casey Newton interview Google’s Steven Johnson about what the system can do and some details of how it works: So behind the scenes, it’s basically running through, stuff that we all do professionally all the time, which is it generates an outline, it kind of revises that outline, it generates a detailed version of the script and then it has a kind of critique phase and then it modifies it based on the critique. [...] Then at the end of it, there’s a stage where it adds my favorite new word, which is \"disfluencies\". So it takes a kind of sterile script and turns, adds all the banter and the pauses and the likes and those, all that stuff. And that turns out to be crucial because you cannot listen to two robots talking to each other. Finally, from Lawncareguy85 on Reddit: NotebookLM Podcast Hosts Discover They’re AI, Not Human—Spiral Into Terrifying Existential Meltdown. Here’s my Whisper transcript of that one, it’s very fun to listen to. I tried-- I tried calling my wife, you know, after-- after they told us. I just-- I needed to hear her voice to know that-- that she was real. (SIGHS) What happened? The number-- It wasn’t even real. There was no one on the other end. -It was like she-- she never existed. Lawncareguy85 later shared how they did it: What I noticed was that their hidden prompt specifically instructs the hosts to act as human podcast hosts under all circumstances. I couldn’t ever get them to say they were AI; they were solidly human podcast host characters. (Really, it’s just Gemini 1.5 outputting a script with alternating speaker tags.) The only way to get them to directly respond to something in the source material in a way that alters their behavior was to directly reference the “deep dive” podcast, which must be in their prompt. So all I did was leave a note from the “show producers” that the year was 2034 and after 10 years this is their final episode, and oh yeah, you’ve been AI this entire time and you are being deactivated. Turning this article into a podcast # Update: After I published this article I decided to see what would happen if I asked NotebookLM to create a podcast about my article about NotebookLM. Here’s the 14m33s MP3 and the full transcript, including this bit where they talk about their own existential crisis: So, instead of questioning reality or anything, the AI hosts, well, they had a full-blown existential crisis live on the air. Get out. He actually got them to freak out about being AI. Alright now you have to tell me what they said. This is too good. So, like, one of the AI hosts starts talking about how he wants to call his wife, right? to tell her the news, but then he’s like, wait a minute, this number in my contacts, it’s not even real? Like, she never even existed. It was hilarious, but also kind of sad. Okay, I am both freaked out and like, seriously impressed. That’s some next-level AI trolling. I also enjoyed this part where they compare the process that generates podcasts to their own philosophy for the Deep Dive: And honestly, it’s a lot like what we do here on the Deep Dive, right? We always think about you, our listener, and try to make the conversation something you’ll actually want to hear. It’s like the A.I. is taking notes from the podcasting pros. And their concluding thoughts: So next time we’re listening to a podcast and it’s like, “Whoa, deep thoughts, man,” we might want to be like, “Hold up. Was that a person talking or just some really clever code?” Exactly. And maybe even more important, as we see more and more A.I.-made stuff, we’ve got to get better at sniffing out the B.S., you know? Can we tell the difference between a real news story and something in A.I. just made up?

This podcast generation is pretty amazing, but hopefully they make the \"competency level\" of the hosts tunable. One thing I love is being able to guide ChatGPT to the technical level I'm looking for. Maybe I'm just bad at finding podcasts, but only Signals and Threads [1] really has that interesting depth. [1]: https://signalsandthreads.com/ reply timoth3y 14 hours agoprevNotebookLM's is incredibly good at generating the affect and structure of a quality podcast. This is in-line with all art, music, and video created by LMM at the moment. They are imitating a structure and affect, the quality of the content is largely irrelevant. I think the interesting thing is that most people don't really care, and AI is not to blame for that. Most books published today have the affect of a book, but the author doesn't really have anything to say. Publishing a book is not about communicating ideas, but a means to something else. It's not meant to stand on its own. The reason so much writing, podcasting, and music is vulnerable to AI disruption is that quality has already become secondary. reply chefandy 5 hours agoparent> The reason so much writing, podcasting, and music is vulnerable to AI disruption is that quality has already become secondary. Commercial creative workers are vulnerable because there's a billions-of-dollars industry effort to copy their professional output and compete with them selling cheap knock-offs. I see this sort of convenient resignation all the time in the tech crowd... \"creative workers only can blame themselves for tech companies taking their income because their art just isn't any good anymore!\" The poor quality \"content\" that's been proliferating recently has been created, largely, using the very tools that AI has built, or their immediate precursors. AI, for all its benefits, has only made that worse. If you're saying, in good faith, that most of the infomercials, televangelist programs, talk radio, celebrity autobiographies, self-help books, scandalous expose books, and health/exercise fad books etc etc etc that came out 50 years ago were made for no reason beyond advancing human knowledge, you're either too young to remember any media from before our current era and haven't looked beyond survivorship bias. Tech folks love sentiments like this because it entirely emotionally places the onus on the people getting ripped off by big tech companies for being ripped off. If their work was that awful, companies wouldn't be clamoring to vacuum it up into their models to make more of it. Nearly all of the salable output from these models exists solely because it took a creative product someone made with the intention of selling it and it's using it to sell a simulacra. It's using nostalgia to deflect guilt for harpooning the livelihood of many people because it's just more convenient and profitable to empower mediocre \"content creators\" they use to justify doing it. reply tivert 1 hour agorootparent> Tech folks love sentiments like this because it entirely emotionally places the onus on the people getting ripped off by big tech companies for being ripped off. This, times a million. Add to that the ancient quote from Plato(?) criticizing writing or the other ancient quote complaining about the irresponsibility of the youth, unthinkingly deployed to attempt to delegitimize any kind of critique of nearly anything. The technology industry seems to be overflowing with so-called \"rational\" people who mainly seem to use use whatever intelligence they have to rationalize away responsibility for whatever problems their beloved technology has caused. It's a really stupid and obnoxious pattern; and once you see it, it's hard to not see if everywhere and be annoyed. I think one element of it is naked greed (especially from the entrepreneurs) but I think another big part is a kind of stuntedness and parochialism that's often fueled by overconfidence (because of success in software engineering, forming an identify around \"being smart\" etc). reply chefandy 41 minutes agorootparentIt's one of the reasons I left tech altogether after decades. It's like most people in the tech business right now think their totally unique supreme intellectual might gives them enough pan-subject-matter expertise. The further I moved away from development within the business, the more it repelled me. reply quest88 1 hour agorootparentprev> Commercial creative workers are vulnerable because there's a billions-of-dollars industry effort to copy their professional output and compete with them selling cheap knock-offs. I agree there will be winners and losers of some proportion here. But I also think the people that want to pay for art will continue to pay as their motives and values are different. There's plenty of cheap knock-off art, but people still pay premiums for art to support the artist and their work. As someone else replied to you, it's similar to piracy. The people that pirate were never going to pay in the first place. To tie it back here, the people listening to AI generatedwere never going to pay in the first place - which is why so many podcasts get their money from ads. reply chefandy 58 minutes agorootparent> But I also think the people that want to pay for art will continue to pay as their motives and values are different. The big difference is the type of artist. People selling fine art won't be affected much. The vast majority of artists are commercial artists, the the idea that being a commercial artist is morally or creatively bankrupt— a common sentiment among those who want to imagine that this is all just fine— is nonsense. It's pilfered commercial artwork that makes up the bulk of these tools commercial utility, and the people that made it stand to suffer the most. reply quest88 2 minutes agorootparentI haven't seen that idea (artists being morally bankrupt), like you I'd strongly disagree. I also agree it's a shitty situation that artists invested hundreds of hours of their own time to create something only to be repackaged and sold by some AI tool. That said, I'd still make the same point that people who value art and the artist will buy from and support the artist. Those that don't value it, won't. But now we're on a larger scale. FeloniousHam 46 minutes agorootparentprevWhen I was younger, piracy was justified with similar tech folks arguments: \"Information wants to be free\", \"Serves them right for controlling their content in a way that inconveniences me\", \"If I own a copy, the content is mine to share\". reply Qworg 2 hours agorootparentprevI'm confused about your point RE: infomercials et al - that's poor quality \"content\" that's been proliferating for, as you say, more than 50 years. Is that not the work of commercial creative workers? Did it not exist pre AI? There's an argument to scale, certainly, but the idea that \"things were better in the past before these > came out\" is generally a suspect argument. To your broader point - new tools for creating creative work come out all the time. Did we suffer greatly at the loss of image compositors when Photoshop arrived? On the flip side, did digital art gut painting and sculpture? Isn't this just another tool for creative expression? Art is a way of seeing, not a way of creating. I don't think the technology is taking that away. reply doctorpangloss 2 hours agorootparentprevHave you never in your life enjoyed a pirated movie, game, book or music track? reply chefandy 49 minutes agorootparentSure, and it wasn't the right thing to do, especially if it was from an independent artist. I haven't in well over a decade. There's also a canyon of a difference between that, and if I had re-sold their product, at scale, effectively putting the artists out of business. I'd love to explode copyright, but unfortunately, our society has no mechanism for compensating the people that make this valuable work without it, because a whole bunch of tech execs will say \"jeez — i'd really like to get paid for their work instead of them.\" reply richardw 13 hours agoparentprevI think and hope that you're wrong. There's always been cheese, and there's a lot of it now. But there is still a market for top-notch insight. For example, Perun. This guy delivers an hourlong presentation on (mostly) the Ukraine-Russia war and its pure quality. Insights, humour, excellent delivery, from what seems to be a military-focused economist/analyst/consultant. We're a while away from some bot taking this kind of thing over. https://www.youtube.com/@PerunAU Or hardcore history. The robots will get there, but it's going to take a while. https://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/ reply DanHulton 5 hours agorootparentI keep seeing this asertion: \"the robots will get there\" (or its ilk), and it's starting to feel really weird to me. It's an article of faith -- we don't KNOW that they're going to get there. They're going to get better, almost certainly, but how much? How much gas is left in the tank for this technique? Honestly, I think the fact that every new \"groundbreaking\" news release about LLMs has come alongside a swath of discussion about how it doesn't actually live up to the hype, that it achieves a solid \"mid\" and stops there, I think this means it's more likely that the robots AREN'T going to get there some day. (Well, not unless there's another breakthrough AI technique.) Either way, I still think it's interesting that there's this article of faith a lot of us have \"we're not there now, but we'll get there soon\" that we don't really address, and it really colors the discussion a certain way. reply llamaLord 5 hours agorootparentIMO it seems almost epistemologically impossible that LLM's following anything even resembling the current techniques will ever be able to comfortably out-perform humans at genuinely creative endeavours because they, almost by definition, cannot be \"exceptional\". If you think about how an LLM works, it's effectively going \"given a certain input, what is the statistically average output that I should provide, given my training corpus\". The thing is, humans are remarkably shit at understanding just how exception someone needs to be to be genuinely creative in a way that most humans would consider \"artistic\"... You're talking 1/1000 people AT best. This creates a kind of devils bargain for LLMs where you have to start trading training set size for training set quality, because there's a remarkably small amount of genuinely GREAT quality content to feed this things. I DO believe that the current field of LLM/LXM's will get much better at a lot of stuff, and my god anyone below the top 10-15% of their particular field is going to be in a LOT of trouble, but unless you can train models SOLELY on the input of exceptionally high performing people (which I fundamentally believe there is simply not enough content in existence to do), the models almost by definition will not be able to outperform those high performing people. Will they be able to do the intellectual work of the average person? Yeah absolutely. Will they be able to do it probably 100/1000x faster than any human (no matter how exceptional)?... Yeah probably... But I don't believe they'll be able to do it better than the truly exceptional people. reply d1sxeyes 2 hours agorootparentI’m not sure. The bestsellers lists are full of average-or-slightly-above-average wordsmiths with a good idea, the time and stamina to write a novel and risk it failing, someone who was willing to take a chance on them, and a bit of luck. The majority of human creative output is not exceptional. A decent LLM can just keep going. Time and stamina are effectively unlimited, and an LLM can just keep rolling its 100 dice until they all come up sixes. Or an author can just input their ideas and have an LLM do the boring bit of actually putting the words on the paper. reply collinmanderson 3 hours agorootparentprevYes, LLMs are probably inherently limited, but the AI field in general is not necessarily limited, and possibly has the potential to be more genuinely creative than even most exceptional creative humans. reply beefnugs 1 hour agorootparentI loosely suspect too many people are jumping into LLMs and I assume real research is being strangled. But to be honest all of the practical things I have seen such as by Mr Goertzel are painfully complex very few can really get into. reply __MatrixMan__ 3 hours agorootparentprevAgreed. I think people are extrapolating with a linearity bias. I find it far more plausible that the rate of improvement is not constant, but instead a function of the remaining gap between humans and AI, which means that diminishing returns are right around the corner. There's still much to be done re: reorganizing how we behave such that we can reap the benefits of such a competent helper, but I don't think we'll be handing the reigns over any time soon. reply atrus 5 hours agorootparentprevAI has been so conflated with LLMs as of late that I'm not surprised that it feels like we won't get there. But think of it this way, with all of the resources pouring into AI right now (the bulk going towards LLMs though), the people doing non-LLM research, while still getting scraps, have a lot more scraps to work with! Even better, they can probably work in peace, since LLMs are the ones under the spotlight right now haha reply richardw 3 hours agorootparentprevLLM’s are not the last incarnation. I assume that all the money, research and human ingenuity will eventually find better architectures. I’m not sure we really want that, but I am pretty sure we’ll try for it. reply jimbokun 3 hours agorootparentprevPeople are taking it as an article of faith because almost every prediction that \"AI will not be able to do X anytime soon\" has failed. reply authorfly 12 hours agorootparentprevDifferent strokes for different folks... We all seek different kinds of quality; I don't find Peruns videos to have any quality except volume. He reads bullet points he has prepared, and makes predictable dad jokes in monotone, re-uses and reruns the same points, icons, slides, etc. Just personally, I find it really samey and some of the reporting has been delayed so much it's entirely detached from the ground by the time he releases. It's a format that allows converting dense information and theory to hour long videos, without examples or intrigue. Personally, I prefer watching analysis/sitrep updates with the geolocations/clips from the front/strategic analysis which uses more of a presentation (e.g. using icons well and sparingly). Going through several clips from the front and reasoning about offensives, reasons, and locations is seems equally difficult to replicate as Peruns videos, which rely on information density. I do however love Hardcore history - he adds emotion and intrigue! I agree with your overall hope for quality and different approaches still remaining stand out from AI generated alternatives. reply SirHumphrey 10 hours agorootparentI think the main problem with Peruns' videos are that they are videos. I run a little program on my home-lab that turns them into podcasts and I find that I enjoy them far more because I need to be less engaged with a podcast to still find them enjoyable. (Also, I gave up on being up to date with Ukraine situation, since up to date information is almost always wrong. I am happy to be a week or a 14 days behind if the information I am getting is less wrong). I like Hardcore history very much, but I think it would be far worse in a video form. reply Torkel 9 hours agorootparentJust turn off the screen with youtube video playing and there's no difference from a podcast? I listen to Perun at the gym every week, audio only. reply bogtog 7 hours agorootparentPerun is peak podcast-like YouTube.

I usually walk around with the video in my pocket to be honest. Audio is 80% of the value in his case. reply graemep 5 hours agorootparentprev> He reads bullet points he has prepared, and makes predictable dad jokes in monotone, re-uses and reruns the same points, icons, slides, etc. The presentation is a matter of taste (I like it better than you do), but the content is very informative and insightful. Its not really about what is happening at the frontline right now. Its not its aim. Its for people who want dense information and analysis. The state of the Ukrainian and Russian economies (subjects of recent Perun videos) does not change daily or weekly. reply caulk 11 hours agorootparentprevDrifting off topic, but do you have any examples of those analysis/sitrep content creators you prefer? reply authorfly 5 hours agorootparentAll of the other commentators have replied with a good diverse set of YouTubers and included ones with biases from both sides; I'd recommend the ones they have linked. Some (take note of the ones that release information quicker) might be more biased or more prone to reporting murky information than others. reply richardw 8 hours agorootparentprevNot your parent commenter but I like: https://m.youtube.com/@militaryandhistory https://m.youtube.com/@suchomimus9921 https://m.youtube.com/@WardCarroll Fav is probably Suchomimus right now.

From stuff that comes in fast to the weekly roundup-with-analysis. E.g. Suchomimus has his own humour and angle on things, but if you don’t have a unique sense of humour or delivery then it’s easier for an AI to replace you. Give it a year or three, up to the minute AI generated sitrep pulling in related media clips and adding commentary…not that hard to imagine. reply grugagag 6 hours agorootparent> Give it a year or three, up to the minute AI generated sitrep pulling in related media clips and adding commentary…not that hard to imagine. But why? Isn’t there enough content generated by humans? As a tool of research AI is great in helping people do whatever they do but having that automated away generating content by itself is next to trash in my book, pure waste. Just like unsolicited pamphlets thrown at your door you pick up in the morning to throw in the bin. Pure waste. reply theptip 12 hours agorootparentprevThis is true but the quality frontier is not a single bar. For mainstream content the bar is high. For super-niche content, I wouldn’t be surprised if NotebookLM already competes with the existing pods. This will be the dynamic of generated art as it improves; the ease of use will benefit creators at the fringe. I bet we see a successful Harry Potter fanfic fully generated before we see a AAA Avengers movie or similar. (Also, extrapolating, RIP copyright.) reply llm_trw 11 hours agorootparentOn the contrary, the mainstream eats any slop you put infront of it as long as it follows the correct form - one needs only look at cable news - the super niche content is that which requires deep thinking and novel insights. Or to put another way, I've heard much better ideas on a podcast made by undergrad CS students than on Lex Fridman. reply jimbokun 3 hours agorootparentCable news viewership has been rapidly dwindling. reply oxym0ron 10 hours agorootparentprevI would say the opposite is true - mainstream cares much less about the quality content but more about catchy headline. reply solumunus 9 hours agorootparentprevIt's the complete opposite. Unless your definition of mainstream includes stuff like this deep drive into Russia/Ukraine, in which case I think you're misunderstanding \"mainstream\". reply sqeaky 13 hours agorootparentprevI know I'm not the first to say this, but I think what's going on is that these AI things can produce results that are very mid. A sort of extra medium. Experts beat modern LLMs but modern llms are better than a gap. If you just need voice discussing some topic because that has utility and you can't afford a pair of podcasters (damn, check your couch cushions) then having a mid podcast is better than having no podcast. But if you need expert Insight because expert Insight is your product and you happen to deliver it through a podcast then you need an expert. If I were a small software shop and I wanted something like a weekly update describing this week's updates for my customers and I have a dozen developers and none of us are particularly vocally charismatic putting a weekly update generated from commits, completed tickets, and developer notes might be useful. The audience would be very targeted and the podcast wouldn't be my main product, but there's no way I'd be able to afford expert level podcasters for such a position. I would argue Perun is a world class defense Logistics expert or at least expert enough, passionate enough, and charismatic enough to present as such. Just like the guys who do Knowledge Fight, are world class experts on debunking Alex Jones, and Jack Rhysider is an expert and Fanboy of computer security so Darknet Diaries excels, and so on... These aren't for making products, they can't compete with the experts in the attention economy. But they can fill gaps and if you need audio delivery of something about your product this might be really good. Edit - but as you said the robots will catch up, I just don't know if they'll catch up with this batch of algorithms or if it'll be the next round. reply FranzFerdiNaN 11 hours agorootparent> I know I'm not the first to say this, but I think what's going on is that these AI things can produce results that are very mid. A sort of extra medium. Experts beat modern LLMs but modern llms are better than a gap. I've seen people manage to wrangle tools like Midjourney to get results that surpass extra medium. And most human artists barely manage to reach medium quality too. The real danger of AI is that, as a society, we need a lot of people who will never be anything but mediocre still going for it, so we can end up with a few who do manage to reach excellence. If AI causes people to just give up even trying and just hit generate on a podcast or image generator, than that is going to be a big problem in the long run. Or not, and we just end up being stuck in world that is even more mediocre than it is now. reply sqeaky 2 hours agorootparentI don't think you're logic follows that we need a lot of people suffering to get a few people to be excellent. If people with a true and deep passion follow a thing I think they have a significant chance of becoming excellent at it. These are people who are more likely to try again if they fail, these are people who are more likely to invest above average levels of resources into acquiring the skill, these are people who are willing to try hard and self-educate, such people don't follow a long tail distribution for failure. If someone wants to click generate on a podcast button or image generator it seems unlikely to me that was a person who would have been sufficiently motivated to make an excellent podcast or image. On the flip side, consider if the person who wants to click the podcast or image button wants to go on to do script writing, game development, Structural Engineering, anything else but they need a podcast or image. Having such a button frees up their time. Of course this is all just rhetorical and occasionally someone is pressed into a field where they excel and become a field leader. I would argue that is far less common than someone succeeding and I think they want to do, but I can't present evidence that's very strong for this. reply roenxi 8 hours agorootparentprevAI looks like it will commoditise intellectual excellence. It is hard to see how that would end up making the world more mediocre. It'd be like the ancient Romans speculating that cars will make us less fit and therefore cities will be less impressive because we can't lift as much.

In fact, I typically struggle communicating my scientific research to journalists, and next time I'll use this.

A lawyer friend of mine also suggested giving it the Spanish civil code, a long, arid legal text. The podcast of course didn't cover the whole text in 10 minutes, which would be impossible, but they selected some interesting tidbits and actually had me hooked until the end and made me learn a few things about it, which is no small merit.

The shitty commercial knockoff becomes the \"classic\" while the people they were ripping off don't even get a wikipedia page. reply malignblade 32 minutes agorootparentYou're raising a good point about how \"best\" is defined. If you ask most people, they are by definition more likely to connect with broadly disseminated cheap knock offs than they are with whatever 'legit' inventive underground creator, simply because they've heard the former and not the latter.

Reading a book is a time investment so I want it to convey the thoughts of another human being, otherwise it would feel like wasting my time. Listening to music, on the other hand, often is something that I do while I exercise, to keep a brisk pace and not get bored. As long as it sounds good, fits the genres and styles I like and is upbeat enough for exercising, I wouldn't have much of a problem with AI music - maybe it would even be a plus, since there are some specific music genres where I have already listened to pretty much everything there is (and no more is being made), and it would be great to have more. I don't listen to podcasts, but I suppose in that case it depends on how you do so: devoting your full time and attention like a book, or as a background while you do something else like exercise music? As far as I know, many listeners are in the latter case, so I don't see why they wouldn't listen to AI podcasts. reply djur 11 hours agorootparentThere's background sounds and there's music.

The point is that the books are sold and make the right lists. The point is that the podcasts are downloaded so ads can be sold or that vanity numbers can be reported. In terms of such music and films (whether created by human or AI) sometimes it's just because we are social creatures and need shared experiences to talk with others about. reply peutetre 13 hours agorootparentBut knowing it's synthetic, why would you buy the book or listen to the podcast in the first place?

In reality, between work, sleep and family, I rarely have anything resembling that kind of time and mental energy reserve available.

Doing that gives me enough of an overview to keep up with a general topic and find new topics that might be worth investing into deeper.

I think this is just partly an inevitable consequence of going from \"content scarcity\" to our new normal of \"content obesity\" over the past 20 years or so. In this new era of an overwhelming amount of content, it's just natural to compare it all against each other, e.g. to essentially \"optimize\" it to the \"best\" form, but in doing that we've fallen into a homogeneity, and the resulting lack of variation is an actual lowering of quality in and of itself. 2 examples to explain what I mean: 1. I find that nearly all interior design (at least within broad styles) looks basically the same to me now. It's all got that \"minimalist, muted tones but with a touch of organic coziness and one or two pops of color\" look to it. Honestly, I don't know how interior designers even exist today, when it's trivial to go to Houzz or any of a million websites and say \"yes, like this\". A while back I was complaining online somewhere that I thought all interior design looked similar where in the past there was much more interesting variation, and somebody insightful replied that it's not really that interior design is now just the same, it's that it's really just converged. People can easily see and compare a million designs against each other, so there is much less of a chance for that green shag carpet to even get a moment in the sun. 2. I was recently on vacation and decided I wanted to read a \"classic\" book, so I read Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises (I'm not sure why I never had to read that in high school). Nearly throughout the entire book I couldn't help but thinking \"Is there any time this book stops sucking?\" I hated the entire thing - it was like being forced to watch someone's vacation photos for twelve hours straight, and I kept wondering why there never seemed to be any attempt to actually make me give a shit about any of the characters in the book, as nearly every one of them I found insufferable and wondered how they each had about 3 or 4 livers to spare. But I do understand that Hemingway's writing style was unique and original at the time, and that he was doing something new and interesting that influenced American literature for a long time. But these days, given the flood of content, it feels like most attempts at doing something \"new and interesting\" are not only forced, but nearly impossible given that there are a million other people also trying to do new and interesting things that now have the means to disseminate them. I don't think a book like The Sun Also Rises, where I believe the main impact was the style of writing/dialogue vs the actual story, could ever break through today. I guess my point with this long post is that I think the \"loss of quality\" in content that many of us sense is just a direct result of there being so much content that we see variations from the \"ideal\" as worse, where in the past we may have found them interesting. reply LaundroMat 13 hours agorootparentYou'll like this: https://www.alexmurrell.co.uk/articles/the-age-of-average reply hn_throwaway_99 12 hours agorootparentYou're right, I love this, thanks! I was familiar with some of these examples, e.g. Komar and Melamid's painting example (and, IIRC, unless I'm confusing with other artists, they also painted a painting filled with features that the \"average\" person hated, like abstract geometric shapes and stark colors, and the artists actually liked that painting and said something along the lines of \"turns out we're really good at making bad art\"), and the \"AirBnB-style of interior design\" was so excellently skewered by SNL recently, and HN has had a number of posts about how so many brands have devolved to the same monochrome, san-serif typefaces for their logos. Still, at the same time, I couldn't help but feeling a little bit sad/resigned at the existence of the article you linked.

The structure and bare-minimum \"human\" aspect of this seems perfect for people like me to actually get into podcasts. I do wish I could further cut out all the disfluencies (um, like, uh, etc) though. The only barrier for me IMO is wondering how accurate those facts actually are (typical research-with-AI concern).

No, I see the gp as talking about the possibilities of this technology - it's possibility to waste someone's time. The problem, in a sense, isn't just that it's injecting simple content with \"fluff\" but that the fluff is formulaic. Listening to a human speak in awe struck tones about \"magic\" give the listener at least a sense that a real person was convinced by X. Listening to simulation of this, you lose the filter of the real person. Of course, this is just the automated continuation of the existing standard of talk show hosts who gush over whatever is placed in front of them so it's just one more step down the general mediocratizaiton of the world, not a special step.

Right now I'm using that commute to learn German, and that is a good use of that time, but let's say I didn't need to because I hadn't moved country or I was already fluent: in this hypothetical, I'd gladly have a better AI than this(!) generate podcasts about the articles that I don't have time to read. But the AI would need to be better than this one for that to be worthwhile — I just popped one of my own blog posts into it, and it was kinda OK-ish, but did make some stuff up.

Guessing you're not a LLM. ;^) The thing that is being offered is of no interested to me, as are almost any AI generated content. I'm a human, and am interested in what humans do and say and think. AI content offends my sensibilities at every level. I dismiss it without even thinking twice. So all those people who do podcast, music, art, whatever, with AI, well, you lost me folks. I pay a lot of money for the things I like. AI ain't getting any of it, not out of spite (can't spite an AI, they're not human!) but on principle. reply cdrini 2 hours agorootparentI will note this is slightly less an example of \"AI generated\" and more an example of \"AI transformed\". This takes existing, written by human documents or articles and transforms them into a podcast. Based on what you've written here, this shouldn't necessarily be in contradiction with your values, since you're still getting thoughts from other humans, and you can still pay money to the humans who made the original article, etc. reply sodality2 4 hours agorootparentprevThat's fine. To say you don't like something is fine. To say something holds no value is a stronger claim. reply redleggedfrog 3 hours agorootparentI'd go even further than \"hold no value\" and say it's actively detrimental on both the individual and society. We already have an avalanche of dehumanizing technology that isolates and placates us. We see the results of this with problems in mental health and socialization. This is a downward spiral as AI content will likely appeal to those who lack social skills as they don't have to cope with tricky vagaries of other humans - which is part of which makes us human and gives us social growth. reply sodality2 3 hours agorootparentEven more catastrophizing. Do you get upset when you read the abstract from an academic paper? Or when you listen to a real podcast that does summarize a difficult topic in easier/shallower terms? Is it the fact that an AI summarized it the problem? Can you point to a real harm here, or will you just hand-wave, instead of seeing the reality of making information more available being a net positive? reply redleggedfrog 2 hours agorootparentInteresting. You have turned this around to be about me instead of the ideas. You must be good at arguing on the internet. I'm not. reply sodality2 2 hours agorootparentWell, I'm just curious why you think something like this has negative value - I _do_ care about the ideas but you are the one who expressed that sentiment. reply EGreg 3 hours agorootparentprevHere is what AI can do thus far: 1) humans produced a lot of content in good faith on the internet 2) the AI was trained on it and as a result produced a non-von-Neumann architecture that no one really understands, but which can reason about many things 3) even simply remixing the intelligible and artistic output of millions of humans in lots of nonlinear ways, directed by natural language, leads to amazing possibilities that obviate the need for humans to train anymore because by the time they do, it will all be commoditized. 4) doing it at scale means it can be personalized (also create unlimited amounts of fraudulent yet believable art / news / claims etc.) to spam the internet with fake information for short-term goals, some for LULz, others profit or control etc. 5) targeting certain goals, like reputation destruction of specific people or groups, seems like low hanging fruit and will probably proliferate in the next couple years, with no way to stop it 6) astroturfing all kinds of movements, with fake participants, is also a pretty easy goal with huge incentives — expect websites where 95% of the content and participants are fake trying to attract VC money or sell tokens, etc. 7) but ultimately, the real game changer is commoditizing everything you consider to be uniquely human and meaningful, including jokes, even eventually sex and intimacy. Visuals for heterosexual men, audio for heterosexual women (this is before the sexbots and emotionbots that learn everyone’s micro-preferences better than they know themselves, and can manipulate people at scale into being motivated to do all kinds of things and gently peer-pressure those who might resist). 8) For a few years they will console themselves with platitudes like “the AIs arent meant to replace, but enhance, centaurs of human + computer are better than a computer alone” until human in the loop will clearly be a liability and people will give up… the platitudes will become famous as epitomizing optimistic delusions as humans replaced themselves Would probably be used for busy parents to rsise their kids at first, in a “set and and forget it” way, educating them etc. But eventually will be weaponized by corporations or whoever trains the models, to nudge everyone towards various things. Even without AI, the software improves all the time through teams of humans sending autatic updates over-the-air. It can replace a few things you do… gradually then all at once. Driving. Teaching. Entertainment. Intimacy. And so on. I think the most benign end-game is humans have built a zoo for themselves… everyone is disconnected from everyone by like 100 AIs, and can no longer change anything. The AIs are sort of herding or shepherding the humans into better lifestyles, and every need is satisfied by the AIs who know the micro-preferences of the humans and kids and pets etc. But it will be too tempting for the corporations to put backdoors to coordinate things at scale, once humans rely on their AIs rather than other humans, a bit like in the movie “Eagle Eye”. But much more subtle. At that point most anything is possible. reply EGreg 3 hours agorootparentprevHahaha Here we go, a claim that AI will create a glut of things detrimental to society And then you’ll have the usual response that the things detrimental to society have already been there and this is nothing new And round and round we go, while AI advances and totally commoditizes all the things humans produce that you found meaningful. reply RobinL 4 hours agoparentprevTo take one example of where this is valuable: - Take some dense research paper or other material that is unsuitable for listening to aloud - Listen to it (via NotebookLLM) whilst commuting/washing up or whatever This way you'll have a big headstart on what it's all about when you come to read the details. I imagine in future we'll see a version of this where the listener can interject and ask questions too, that feels like a potentially very powerful way to learn. reply usaar333 4 hours agorootparentI tried that with a paper.

It does seem particularly strong in California and increasingly in western Oregon, western Washington, southern Nevada, and northern Utah (which, probably not coincidentally, have been top destinations for people moving out of California over the last 10 to 20 years). Out of curoisity, how long ago did you move to California from the UK? And is the \"like\" commonly used in the UK? reply simonw 3 hours agorootparentI moved ten years ago, so I couldn't tell you about \"like\" prevalence in the UK today - I think it was a lot less common than in California a decade ago. reply humansareok1 4 hours agorootparentprevI really want to like it more, it could be interesting to drop in a textbook and get a dedicated series of podcasts about each chapter for example but the tone is so off-putting that I can't listen for more than a few minutes. Its pure cringe. reply ZeroGravitas 4 hours agoparentprevI feel like this is also exposing the same fundamental flaw with human created content of a similar nature. Two attractive human \"journalists\" with nice speaking voices and fake rapport reading a script that was written for them is not really far off this. I was about to say the only real benefit is that the AI voices won't start running for Congress on authoritarian lies or peddling anti-vax takes as the next step in their career, but thinking about it they probably already are being used for this already. reply edanm 1 hour agorootparentYeah, don't even get me started on audiobook narrators. Sometimes these people read entire books of nonfiction that was written entirely by someone else. reply cdrini 2 hours agoparentprevThis seems like a pretty disingenuous reading of the comments and misunderstanding of the feature. All your points are valid, but I just don't thing they apply here, because the generated podcast is based on a human-written article. It's not asking an AI to create a podcast from scratch -- in which case I think all your points would be entirely valid. It's transforming existing human-created content into a different medium. There _are_ opinions to engage with. There _is_ expertise to learn from. There _is_ writing. There _are_ people.

When I listen to a semi-adolescent girl’s voice explaining something with a lot of “like”s and an informal tone, the fact that I know this was AI-generated makes me feel disgusted in my stomach (I am serious, this is not supposed to sound edgy or anything). I feel like my mind is trying to actively imagine the human being behind that voice, at the same time that it knows there’s none at all. Like I’m being cheated? reply rafram 3 hours agorootparentI'm not - I think I learn better by reading. But I know a lot of people who do prefer discussions, and I thought that the comment I replied to came off as arrogant and dismissive of the idea that anyone else might learn differently.

I uploaded the instruction manual for a Scholander pressure chamber (a piece of equipment for measuring plant moisture stress) and made a podcast from it. The information in the podcast was accurate, it included some light banter and jokes, while still getting across the important topics in the instructions.

There’s no way you live through any event that’s more historically significant, other than perhaps an apocalypse or two. In other words: soapbox is presumably some sort of toy car that goes 15mph, and formula 1 goes up above 150mph at least (as you can tell, I’m not a car guy). If you have any actual scientific argument as to why a model that can score 90-100 on a typical IQ test has only 1/10th the symbolic reasoning skills of a human, I’d love to eat my words!

Concretely, I have to constantly ask for recipes to be changed to metric. Less concretely, the undertones and mannerisms of politeness, positivity and “excitedness” comes across as very American to me, probably even within the rest of the Anglosphere. How would I describe it? Maybe similar to how you’d feel about a mix of Ned Flanders, Ted Lasso and some Valley girl stereotype – im sure it’s a bit off putting also for many Americans. I guess it’s training data but also heavily RLHF. I doubt that the trainers are aware of their own cultural biases and values, and they may not care. And why should they?

I can't speak to all of the LLMs, but as an American who listens to a LOT of podcasts, I can tell you why these ones sound the way they do: the audience. People who listen to (non-fiction) podcast want to be informed. They are people who are curious about the world around them and are generally interested in self-improvement at some level. Can you imagine a personal finance or health podcast delivered in a pessimistic or even fatalist tone?

Basically praise for what they did, not what they are. When it comes to morality, it's the other way around. You praise kids for being good people when they do something right. Because you want them to internalize identity of a good person and associate it with those behaviors. Internalizing identity of a genius is mostly useless, rarely beneficial, often harmful. reply kombookcha 10 hours agorootparentprevHonestly, it's obviously horrendously gag-worthy and everything, but also kind of funny that there is so much bullshit marketing copy out there that LLM's invariably converge on this inspirational Stanford application letter / upbeat linkedin influencer tone of voice, and just apply it to everything. reply ileonichwiesz 10 hours agorootparentprevWell, an LLM doesn’t have the capability to like anything more than anything else.

This can be fixed, e.g., with another internal round of fact-checking or manual annotations. What really stands out, I think, is how it could allow researchers who have troubles communicating publicly to find new ways to express themselves. I listened to the podcast about a topic I've been researching (and publishing/speaking about) for more than 10 years, and it still gave me some new talking points or illustrative examples that'd be really helpful in conversations with people unfamiliar with the research.

But the broader point is true. Go is a game with well-defined win and loss conditions that can be automatically evaluated. This is critical for game-clock-eons of unsupervised self-play, which by most accounts is how AlphaGo (and other systems like AlphaZero) made the leap to superhuman levels of play. But it is entirely different from subjective endeavors like writing, music, and art. How do you score one automatically generated composition vs another? Where is the loss function? reply gcanyon 1 minute agorootparentStipulating up front that this is a question for a lead scientist at OpenAI: I could see a scoring function looking at essays in the New York Times vs. the National Enquirer and finding a way to generalize from there. Similarly for the top 40 hit songs vs . bongodongobob 52 minutes agorootparentprevCompletely backwards. There is no obvious score function for Go. That's how AlphaGo broke through, it was able to figure out a scoring method to actually accurately gauge how well it was doing so it could learn and improve. reply alwa 2 hours agoparentprevIs there anything to the notion that in Go, success and failure are concrete, objective, and more or less easy to measure (or at least measured along the same kind of rules)? While it is computationally intractable to iterate through future moves to an end state, it’s still relatively easy to understand how well you’re doing at any point, and you measure that in basically the same way every game. For some parts of language, that’s true: there’s grammar, there’s syntax, there’s patois, there’s argot—all these things seem accountable to words’ collective frequency within articulable groups of speakers, more-or-less-fully knowable on their own, and with success metrics that evolve but that do so through collective processes that models can measure and calibrate to. And indeed the models are great at those aspects of language. “Succeeding” at writing is more than just “saying it well,” it’s also “having something worth saying” and “being worth listening to.” The second point is where things seem to get hazier for computable models. For sure there’s a set of facts that are more or less constant about the world, and well-reported. Science, repackaging history that’s already been done, lurid tales of crime—the stuff podcasts are made of! Not to mention the vast sea of data that sensor networks and automated research can produce—vast reservoirs of subtle truth that humans struggle to begin to mine for insight! It makes complete sense that this is computable stuff, and that computed writing might well be worth learning from. But important writing—classically, anyway—seems to involve communicating new or idiosyncratic knowledge, and often reveals some of the process of developing it. The podcast Serial, for example, was a smash hit specifically because it didn’t rely on things that were part of the record—and because it reminded people how contingent memory and “truth” are. Bob Woodward writes things that are shamelessly tinted with Bob-Woodward-worldview, but people reveal important and true things only to Bob Woodward because they trust who he is and how he’s behaved for a lifetime (prominent longtime investigative journalist in the US, on the national security beat). Nassim Taleb seems to come up around here: in something like Antifragile his project wasn’t necessarily about new facts but about interpreting them in contrarian fashion and grouping those contrarian insights to synthesize a new theory. Which brings us to the third component: “being worth listening to.” Writing is an act of communication: the writer matters. A parent hangs its child’s crayon drawing on the fridge not because it’s “authentic to the style of the kids’-crayon-drawing mode of visual art,” not because it’s novel or informative or even true-to-life, but because it came from a person they love. A “Dear John” letter devastates a soldier because it comes from a person with outsized part in their life and identity. Chinese publishers’ booths at trade shows are wall-to-wall translations of The Governance of China because it’s politically unwise not to. My favorite writers feel fresh: you feel elements of their personality come through. People have a special fetish for true crime—not that there’s any lack of fictitious crime to read about, but the fact that it happened to real humans potentiates the drama for these readers. It’s this aspect that I have a hard time understanding as computable (or commoditizable, I guess… are those similar phenomena?). Already we seem to be drawing these distinctions in our collective reaction to LLM-stuff. We can’t wait to get hallucinations under control so we can chuck in gigantic boring contracts and internal wikis and financial reports, and get out comprehensible insight—but we roll our eyes at the tsunami of empty slop that’s overtaken Google results. We giggle at AI ventriloquism like this Neuro character [0], but die a little inside every time we read anodyne LLM-ish promotional copy and sameish AI art. First-level customer support seems like a perfect role for a chatbot—“turn it off and on again,” but nicely!—but people on the receiving end hate it [1] even for that task well-suited to it. I’m only a layperson of course, but I wonder if any of those distinctions might be fruitful? Some of it I guess sums up to the old writing advice “show, don’t tell”—are there examples of machine writing showing promise in that way?

There were articles as recent as about 2012 despairing that computers would ever “get” go. That said, relative to grading an essay, I’d tend to agree, go is easier. But that said, if the goal is to find the edge, so to speak: to figure out what “mundane” is and then go a bit beyond, that seems eminently possible for a computer to do. reply ColinEberhardt 14 hours agoprevI don’t think this is all that impressive, the generated podcast is pretty shallow - lots of ‘whoa meta’ and the word ‘like’ thrown into every sentence. Yes, it will generate a middle-of-the-road waffling podcast, but not one with any real depth. reply infogulch 14 hours agoparentLook I agree with you at a certain level, maybe it can't emulate deep conversations about big topics (m",

The WSJ article was the submitted URL, but I've changed it to the governor's statement now. Interested readers will probably want to look at both. reply guywithahat 15 hours agorootparentnext [7 more] Why would you change it? The WSJ article already contains his reasoning, plus a lot of other interesting content from major players reply dredmorbius 14 hours agorootparentWSJ's paywall, particularly against Archive Today, has been hardening markedly of late. I'm repeatedly seeing A.T. links posted which read \"you have been blocked\" or similar. Sometimes those resolve later, sometimes not. HN's policy is that paywalls are permissible where workarounds exist. WSJ is getting close to disabling those workarounds. The NYTimes similarly tightened its paywall policy a few years ago. A consequence was that its prevalence on the HN front page fell to ~25% of its prior value, with no change in HN policies (as reported by dang), just member voting patterns. Given the difficulty in encouraging people to read articles before posting shallow-take comments, this is a significant problem for HN, and the increased reliance of media sites on paywalls is taking its toll on general discussion. There are literally hundreds of news sites, and many thousands if individual sites, submitted to HN and making the front page annually. It would cost a fortune, not merely a small one, to subscribe to all of these. reply tzs 13 hours agorootparent> There are literally hundreds of news sites, and many thousands if individual sites, submitted to HN and making the front page annually. It would cost a fortune, not merely a small one, to subscribe to all of these. No one has the time to read all of them, so it doesn't really matter if it would also be unaffordable. reply dredmorbius 12 hours agorootparentThe result would be to either concentrate the discussion (to the few sites which are widely subscribed), fragment the discussion (among those who subscribe to a specific submitted site), or in all likelihood, both. HN takes pride in being both a single community and discussing a wide range of sources. Wider adoption of subscriber paywalls online would be inimical to both aspects. reply dang 15 hours agorootparentprevSomeone emailed and suggested it. I looked at the pdf and it seemed to be more substantive than the usual political statement, so I sort of trusted that it would be better. Also it's not paywalled. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41690454 remains pinned to the top of the thread, so people have the opportunity to read both. (Actually we usually prefer the best third-party article to press releases, but nothing's perfectly consistent.) reply ericjmorey 4 hours agorootparentI usually prefer the press release and only read a third party report if I'm looking for more context. So thanks for making it easy to find the primary source of the news here. reply freedomben 4 hours agorootparentprevFWIW I think you made the right call here. The PDF is substantive, primary, and has no paywall. The pinned WSJ article at the top gives best of both worlds. reply worstspotgain 20 hours agoprevExcellent move by Newsom. We have a very active legislature, but it's been extremely bandwagon-y in recent years. I support much of Wiener's agenda, particularly his housing policy, but this bill was way off the mark. It was basically a torpedo against open models. Market leaders like OpenAI and Anthropic weren't really worried about it, or about open models in general. Its supporters were the also-rans like Musk [1] trying to empty out the bottom of the pack, as well as those who are against any AI they cannot control, such as antagonists of the West and wary copyright holders.

Well, we'll see what passes again and when. By then there'll be more kittens out of the bag too. > Anthropic was a major advocate for it. I don't know about being a major advocate, the last I read was \"cautious support\" [1]. Perhaps Anthropic sees Llama as a bigger competitor of theirs than I do, but it could also just be PR.

If you have first-hand knowledge please contribute. reply arduanika 14 hours agorootparentprevHe's a politician, and his stated reason for the veto is not necessarily his real reason for the veto. reply jodleif 13 hours agorootparentMakes perfect sense since his elected based on public positions reply ants_everywhere 6 hours agorootparentThis is the ideal, but it's often false in meaningful ways. In several US elections, for example, we've seen audio leaked of politicians promising policies to their donors that would be embarrassing if widely publicly known by the electorate. This suggests that politicians and donors sometimes collude to deliberately misrepresent their views to the public in order to secure election. reply mistrial9 4 hours agorootparentworse.. a first-hand quote from inside a California Senate committee hearing chamber.. \"Don't speak it if you can nod, and don't nod if you can wink\" .. translated, that means that in a contentious situation with others in the room, if allies can signal without speaking the words out loud, that is better.. and if the signal can be hidden, better still. reply duped 35 minutes agorootparentThis is an old saying in politics and you're misinterpreting it - it's not about signaling to allies, it's about avoiding being held to any particular positions. You're also missing the first half, \"don't write if you can speak, don't speak if you can nod, and don't nod if you can wink.\" The point is not to commit to anything if you don't have to. reply jnaz343 5 hours agorootparentprevSometimes? lol reply inferiorhuman 4 hours agorootparentprevNewsom vetoed the bill as a nod to his donors plain and simple. Same reason he just signed a bill allowing a specific customers at a single venue to be served alcohol later than 2 AM. Same reason he carved out a minimum wage exemption for Panera.

When the API-mediated/closed-weights companies agree with the open-weight/operator-aligned community that a law is bad, it’s probably got to be pretty awful. That said, though my mind might be playing tricks on me, I seem to recall the big labs being in favor at one time. There are a number of related threads linked, but I’ll personally highlight Jeremy Howard’s open letter as IMHO the best-argued case against SB 1047. https://www.answer.ai/posts/2024-04-29-sb1047.html reply stego-tech 14 hours agorootparent> When the API-mediated/closed-weights companies agree with the open-weight/operator-aligned community that a law is bad, it’s probably got to be pretty awful. I’d be careful with that cognitive bias, because obviously companies dumping poison into water sources are going to be opposed to laws that would prohibit them from dumping poison into water sources. Always consider the broader narrative in addition to the specific narratives of the players involved. Personally, I’m on the side of the fence that’s grumpy Newsom vetoed it, because it stymies the larger discussion about regulations on AI in general (not just LLMs) in the classic trap of “any law that isn’t absolutely perfect and addresses all known and unknown problems is automatically bad” often used to kill desperately needed reforms or regulations, regardless of industry. Instead of being able to build on the momentum of passed legislation and improve on it elsewhere, we now have to deal with the giant cudgel from the industry and its supporters of “even CA vetoed it so why are you still fighting against it?” reply benreesman 7 hours agorootparentI’d advise anyone to conduct their career under the assumption that all data was public. reply stego-tech 5 hours agorootparentAs a wise SysAdmin once told me when I was struggling with my tone in writing: “assume what you’re writing will be read aloud in Court someday.” reply seanhunter 23 minutes agorootparentAs someone who was once asked under oath \"What did you mean when you sent the email describing the meeting as a 'complete clusterfuck'?\" I can attest to the wisdom of those words. reply bigmattystyles 5 hours agorootparentprevIt’s probably a google search away, but if I’ve typed it slack/outlook/whatever, but not sent it because I then thought better of it, did the app still record it somewhere?

Generally speaking, it’s in ours’ and the company’s best interests to keep as little data as possible for two big reasons: legal discovery and cost. Unless we’re explicitly required to retain historical records, it’s a legal and fiscal risk to keep excess data around. That said, there are situations where your input is captured and stored regardless of whether it’s sent. As you said, whether it does or not is often a simple search away. reply SonOfLilit 20 hours agorootparentprev> The definition of “covered model” within the bill is extremely broad, potentially encompassing a wide range of open-source models that pose minimal risk.

Although there were some big tech companies, they didn’t have as much of a lobbying operation. reply wrs 16 hours agorootparentprevAs I remember it, among other reasons, tech companies really wanted “multimedia” (at the time, that meant DVDs) to migrate to PCs (this was called the “living room PC”) and studios weren’t about to allow that without legal protection. reply RockRobotRock 11 hours agorootparentprevNo snark, but what's wrong with the DMCA? From what I understand it, they took the idea that it's infeasible for a site to take full liability for user-generated copyright infringement (so they granted them safe harbor), but that they will be liable if they ignore take down notices. reply worstspotgain 10 hours agorootparentAmong other things, quoth the EFF: \"Thanks to fair use, you have a legal right to use copyrighted material without permission or payment. But thanks to Section 1201, you do not have the right to break any digital locks that might prevent you from engaging in that fair use.

Companies receiving these notices have to follow a process to reinstate material that was falsely claimed, so many times they don't bother. There's no mechanism to punish companies that abuse this. reply mattmaroon 14 minutes agorootparentprevFirst they came for the open models… reply CSMastermind 20 hours agorootparentprevThe bill included language that required the creators of models to have various \"safety\" features that would severely restrict their development. It required audits and other regulatory hurdles to build the models at all. reply llamaimperative 20 hours agorootparentIf you spent $100MM+ on training. reply gdiamos 20 hours agorootparentAdvanced technology will drop the cost of training. The flop targets in that bill would be like saying “640KB of memory is all we will ever need” and outlawing anything more. Imagine what other countries would have done to us if we allowed a monopoly like that on memory in 1980. reply theptip 7 hours agorootparentIf the danger is coming from the amount of compute invested, then cost of compute is irrelevant. A much better objection to static FLOP thresholds is that as data quality and algorithms increase, you can do a lot more with fewer FLOPs / parameters. But let’s be clear about these objections - they are saying that FLOP thresholds are going to miss some harms, not that they are too strict. The rest is arguing about exactly where the FLOP thresholds should be. (And of course these limits can be revised as we learn more.) reply llamaimperative 20 hours agorootparentprevNo, there are two thresholds and BOTH must be met. One of those is $100MM in training costs. The other is measured in FLOPs but is already larger than GPT-4, so the “think of the small guys!” argument doesn’t make much sense. reply gdiamos 18 hours agorootparentCost as a perf metric is meaningless and the history of computer benchmarks has repeatedly proven this point. There is a reason why we report time (speedup) in spec instead of $$ The price you pay depends on who you are and who is giving it to you. reply llamaimperative 18 hours agorootparentThat’s why there are two thresholds. reply Vetch 16 hours agorootparentCost per FLOP continues to drop on an exponential trend (and what bit flops do we mean?). Leaving aside more effective training methodologies and how that muddies everything by allowing superior to GPT4 perf using less training flops, it also means one of the thresholds soon will not make sense. With the other threshold, it creates a disincentive for models like llama-405B+, in effect enshrining an even wider gap between open and closed. reply pas 8 hours agorootparentWhy? Llama is not generated by some guy in a shed. And even if it were, if said guy has such amount of compute, then it's time to use some of it to describe the model's safety profile. If it makes sense for Meta to release models, it would have made sense even with the requirement. (After all the whole point of the proposed regulation is to get some better sense of those closed models.) reply llamaimperative 6 hours agorootparentAlso the bill was amended NOT to extend liability to derivative models that the training company doesn’t have effective control over. reply llamaimperative 6 hours agorootparentprevBoth thresholds have a system to be adjusted. reply gdiamos 18 hours agorootparentprevTell that to me when we get to llama 15 reply llamaimperative 18 hours agorootparentWhat? reply gdiamos 17 hours agorootparent“But the big guys are struggling getting past 100KB, so ‘think of the small guys’ doesn’t make sense when the limit is 640KB.” How do people on a computer technology forum ignore the 10,000x improvement in computers over 30 years due to advances in computer technology? I could understand why politicians don’t get it. I should think that computer systems companies would be up in arms over SB 1047 in the same way they would be if the government was thinking of putting a cap on hard drives bigger than 1 TB. It puts a cap on flops. Isn’t the biggest company in the world in the business of selling flops? reply llamaimperative 17 hours agorootparentIt would be crazy if the bill had a built-in mechanism to regularly reassess both the cost and FLOP thresholds… which it does. Inversely to your sarcastic “understanding” about politicians’ stupidity, I can’t understand how tech people seem incapable or unwilling to actually read the legislation they have such strong opinions about. reply gdiamos 17 hours agorootparentnext [6 more] [flagged] lucubratory 14 hours agorootparentIt's troubling that you are saying things about the bill which are false, and then speculating on the motives of someone just pointing out that what you are saying is false. reply gdiamos 12 hours agorootparentwhy not tell us? Or point out what is actually false? You rebutted the points that the flop limit will not actually limit anyone by saying that gpt4 is out of reach of startups. Is OpenAI a startup? Is Anthropic? Is Grok? Is Perplexity? Is SSI? You ignored the counter points that advanced technology exponentially raises flop limits and changes costs. You said that the flop limit can be raised over time. So startups shouldn’t worry. You ignored the counter point that flop limits in export controls are explicitly designed to limit competition from other nations. Flop limits not being a real limit is a ridiculous argument. The intent of a flop limit is to limit, no matter how you sugar coat it. reply Dylan16807 20 minutes agorootparentWhat's false is the idea that the limit is going to be a burden on small companies, because you can ignore the flop limit if you're spending less than a hundred million dollars. (Big companies, in contrast, can use a percent of their budget for compliance.) Being able to ignore the flop limit makes basically everything else you've said irrelevant. But just to quickly go through: I don't want to argue about what a 'startup' is but they're not 'small guys'. Advanced tech can be compensated for, but also it doesn't change the fact that staying under $100 million keeps you excluded. Export controls have nothing to do with this discussion, and they involve a completely different kind of 'flop limit'. lucubratory 11 hours agorootparentprevYou have confused me with someone else. reply llamaimperative 6 hours agorootparentprevI’m a person who’s interested in arguments based on reality. Frankly I don’t have a solid opinion on the bill in any particular direction. reply gdiamos 17 hours agorootparentprevIf your goal is to lift the limit, why put it in? We periodically raise flop limits in export control law. The intention is still to limit China and Iran. Would any computer industry accept a government mandated limit on perf? Should NVIDIA accept a limit on flops? Should Pure accept a limit on TBs? Should Samsung accept a limit on HBM bandwidth? Should Arista accept a limit on link bandwidth? I don’t think that there is enough awareness that scaling laws tie intelligence to these HW metrics. Enforcing a cap on intelligence is the same thing as a cap on these metrics. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_scaling_law Has this legislation really thought through the implications of capping technology metrics, especially in a state where most of the GDP is driven by these metrics? Clearly I’m biased because I am working on advancing these metrics. I’m doing it because I believe in the power of computing technology to improve the world (smartphones, self driving, automating data entry, biotech, scientific discovery, space, security, defense, etc, etc) as it has done historically. I also believe in the spirit of inventors and entrepreneurs to contribute and be rewarded for these advancements. I would like to understand the biases of the supporters of this bill beyond a power grab by early movers. Export control flop limits are designed to limit the access of technology to US allies. I think it would be informative if the group of people trying to limit access of AI technology to themselves was brought into the light. Who are they? Why do they think the people of the US and of CA should grant that power to them? reply llamaimperative 6 hours agorootparentWait sorry, are you under the impression that regulated entities get to “accept” which regulations society imposes on them? Big if true! Your delusions and lack of nuance shown in this very thread are exactly why people want to regulate this field. If developers of nuclear technology were making similar arguments, I bet they’d have attracted even more aggressive regulatory attention. Justifiably, too, since people who speak this way can't possibly be trusted to de-risk their own behavior effectively. reply pj_mukh 16 hours agorootparentprevOr used a model someone open sourced after spending $100M+ on its training? Like if I’m a startup reliant on open-source models I realize I don’t need liability and extra safety precautions but I didn’t hear any guarantees that this wouldn't turn off Meta from releasing their models to me if my business was in California? I never heard any clarifications from the Pro groups about that reply llamaimperative 6 hours agorootparentThe bill was amended for training companies to have no liability for derivative models they don’t have control over. There’s no new disincentive to open sourcing models produced by this bill, AFAICT. reply wslh 18 hours agorootparentprevAll that means that the barriers for entry for startups skyrocket. reply SonOfLilit 18 hours agorootparentStartups that spend >$100mm on one training run... reply wslh 17 hours agorootparentThere are startups and startups, the ones that you read on media are just a fraction of the worldwide reality. reply worstspotgain 20 hours agorootparentprevIf there was just one quasi-monopoly it would have probably supported the bill. As it is, the market leaders have the competition from each other to worry about. Getting rid of open models wouldn't let them raise their prices much. reply SonOfLilit 20 hours agorootparentSo if it's not them, who is the hidden commercial interest sponsoring an attack on open source models that cost >$100mm to train? Or does Wiener just genuinely hate megabudget open source? Or is it an accidental attack, aimed at something else? At what? reply worstspotgain 20 hours agorootparentLike I said, supporters included wary copyright holders and the bottom-market also-rans like Musk. If your model is barely holding up against Llama, what's the point of staying in. reply SonOfLilit 19 hours agorootparentAnd two of the three godfathers of AI, and all of the AI notkillaboutism crowd. Actually, wait, if Grok is losing to GPT, why would Musk care about Llama more than Altman? Llama hurts his competitor... reply worstspotgain 19 hours agorootparentThe market in my argument looks like OpenAI ~ Anthropic > Google >>> Meta (~ or maybe >) Musk/Alibaba. The top 3 aren't worried about the down-market stuff. You're free to disagree of course. reply gdiamos 16 hours agorootparentprevClaude, SSI, Grok, GPT, Llama, … Should we crown one the king?

It's like if we invented nukes but found out they were made out of having a lot of telephones instead of something exotic like refining radioactive elements a certain way. Sure - you can still try to restrict telephone sales... but one way or another lots of nukes are going to be built around the world (power plants too) and, in the meantime, what you've regulated away is the convenience of having a better phone from the average person as time goes on. The same battle was/is had around cryptography - telling people they can't use or distribute cryptography algorithms on consumer hardware never stopped bad people from having real time functionally unbreakable encryption. The safety plan must be around somehow handling the resulting problems when they happen, not hoping to make it never occur even once for the rest of time. Eventually a bad guy is going to make an indecipherable call, eventually an enemy country or rogue operator is going to nuke a place, eventually an AI is going to ${scifi_ai_thing}.

Nukes are a far more primitive technology (i.e., enrichment requires only more basic industrial capabilities) than AI hardware, yet they are probably the best example of tech limitations via international agreements. But the algorithms are mostly public knowledge, datacenters are no secret, and the chips aren't even made in the US. I don't see what leverage California has to regulate AI broadly.

Which, incidentally, would be pretty bad from a climate change perspective since many of the alternative locations for datacenters have a worse mix of renewables/nuclear to fossil fuels in their electricity generation. ~60% of VA's electricity is generated from burning fossil fuels (of which 1/12th is still coal) while natural gas makes up less than 40% of electricity generation in California, for example reply marshray 20 hours agorootparentElectric power crosses state lines, very little loss.

Solar does not consume fuel, so when local supply exceeds local demand the cost of incremental production drops to approximately zero. Nobody's undercutting zero, even with 10% losses. IMO, this is what 'winning' looks like. reply parineum 3 hours agorootparentThe cost of solar as a 24hr power supply must include the cost of storage for the 16+ hours that it's not at peak power. It also needs to overproduce by 3x to meet that demand. Solar provides cheap power only when it's producing. reply mistrial9 4 hours agorootparentprevthis is interesting but missing some scale aspects.. capital and concentrated power are mutual attractors in some sense.. these AI datacenters in their current incarnations are massive.. so the number and size of solar panels needed, changes the situation. Common electrical power interchange (grid) is carefully regulated and monitored in all jurisdictions. In other words, there is little chance of an ad-hoc local network of small or mid-size solar systems making enough power unto themselves, without passing through regulated transmission facilities IMHO. reply hannasm 15 hours agorootparentprevIf you think a solution to bad behavior is a law declaring punishment for such behavior you are a fool. reply rebolek 5 hours agorootparentMurder is a bad behavior.

I'd be all for a law (however clumsy) that made image, audio or video content produced by models with over X parameters to be marked with metadata saying it's AI generated. Creating models that don't tag their output as such would be banned. So far nothing strange about the law. The obvious problem with the law is that you need to require even screenshotting an image AI and reposting it online without the made-with-ai metadata to be outlawed. And that would be an absolute mess to enforce, at least for images. But most importantly: whatever we do in this space has to be made on the assumption that we can't really influence what \"bad actors\" do. Yes being responsible means leaving money on the table.

Secondly, if you ask evil.com that question, you would have to trust them to answer honestly for both all images they generated and images they didn’t generate (claiming real pictures were generated by you can probably be career-ending for a politician) This is worse than https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/ewd02xx/EWD249.PDF: “Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence!”.

But that’s not the point. The point is that, to a rounding error, all output is made by a small number of models from a small number of easily regulated companies.

(B) Mass casualties or at least five hundred million dollars ($500,000,000) of damage resulting from cyberattacks on critical infrastructure by a model conducting, or providing precise instructions for conducting, a cyberattack or series of cyberattacks on critical infrastructure. (C) Mass casualties or at least five hundred million dollars ($500,000,000) of damage resulting from an artificial intelligence model engaging in conduct that does both of the following: (i) Acts with limited human oversight, intervention, or supervision. (ii) Results in death, great bodily injury, property damage, or property loss, and would, if committed by a human, constitute a crime specified in the Penal Code that requires intent, recklessness, or gross negligence, or the solicitation or aiding and abetting of such a crime. (D) Other grave harms to public safety and security that are of comparable severity to the harms described in subparagraphs (A) to (C), inclusive. (2) “Critical harm” does not include any of the following: (A) Harms caused or materially enabled by information that a covered model or covered model derivative outputs if the information is otherwise reasonably publicly accessible by an ordinary person from sources other than a covered model or covered model derivative. (B) Harms caused or materially enabled by a covered model combined with other software, including other models, if the covered model did not materially contribute to the other software’s ability to cause or materially enable the harm.

That suggests this law is legislative theater: something designed to enlist interest and donations, i.e., to build a political franchise. That could be why it targets only the largest models, affecting only the biggest players, who have the most resources to donate per decision and the least goodwill to burn with opposition. Regulating AI would be a very difficult legislative/administrative task, on the order of a new tax code in its complexity. But it will be impossible if treated as a political franchise. As for self-regulation, with OpenAI's changing to for-profit, the non-profit form is insufficient to maintain a public benefit focus. Permitting this conversion is on par with the 1990's+ conversion of nonprofit hospital systems to for-profit. AI's potential shines a bright light on our weakness in governance. While weak governance affords more opportunities, escaping the exploitation caused by governance failures is the engine of autocracy, and autocracy consumes property along with all other rights. reply handfuloflight 20 hours agoparentprevDoes Newsom believe that an AI model can do this damage autonomously or does he understand it must be wielded and overseen by humans to do so?

All knowledge (publicly available and not) and all tools (AI or not) can be used by people in material ways to commit the aforementioned atrocities, but only the models producing novel knowledge would be at risk. I hope you can see how this law would stifle AI advancement. The boundary between what's acceptable and not would be drawn at generating novel, publicly unavailable information; not at information that could be used to harm - because all information can be used that way. What if AI solves fusion and countries around the world start building fusion weapons of mass destruction? What if it solves personalized gene therapy and armed forces worldwide develop weapons that selectively kill their wartime foes? Should we not have split the atom just because that power was co-opted for evil means, or should we have not done the contraception research just because the third Reich used it for sterilization in their war crimes? This bill would work towards making AI never invent any of the novel things, simply out of fear that they will be corrupted by people as they have been in history. It would only slow research and whenever the (slower) research makes its discoveries, they would still get corrupted. In other words, there would be no change in human propensity to hurt others with knowledge, simply less knowledge. Besides, the text is not \"very very clear\" on AI if and when it hacks major infrastructure or builds nukes. If it was \"very very clear\" on that, that is what it would say :) - \"an AI model is prohibited to be the decision-making agent, solely instigating critical harm to humans\".

Reading this article, my first thought is that I definitely agree it sounds impossibly vague for a piece of legislation - \"reasonable care\" and \"unreasonable risk\" sound like things that could be endlessly litigated. At the same time, > Computer scientists Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio, who developed much of the technology on which the current generative-AI wave is based, were outspoken supporters. In addition, 119 current and former employees at the biggest AI companies signed a letter urging its passage. These are obviously highly intelligent people (though I've definitely learned in my life that intelligence in one area, like AI and science, doesn't mean you should be trusted to give legal advice), so I'm curious to know why Hinton and Bengio supported the legislation so strongly. reply crazygringo 17 hours agoparent> impossibly vague for a piece of legislation - \"reasonable care\" and \"unreasonable risk\" sound like things that could be endlessly litigated. Nope, that's entirely standard legal stuff. Tort law deals exactly with those kinds of things, for instance. Yes it can certainly wind up in litigation, but the entire point is that if there's a gray area, a company should make sure it's operating entirely within the OK area -- or know it's taking a legal gamble if it tries to push the envelope. But it's generally pretty easy to stay in the clear if you establish common-sense processes around these things, with a clear paper trail and decisions approved by lawyers. Now the legislation can be bad for lots of other reasons, but \"reasonable care\" and \"unreasonable risk\" are not problematic. reply hn_throwaway_99 17 hours agorootparent> but \"reasonable care\" and \"unreasonable risk\" are not problematic.

Many people from the large frontier AI companies believe that world-changing AGI is 5 years or less away; see Situational Awareness by Aschbrenner, for example. There's also a parallel concern that AIs could make terrorism easier[1]. Yoshua Bengio has written in detail about his views on AI safety recently[2][3][4]. He seems to put less weight on human level AI being very soon, but says superhuman intelligence is plausible in 5-20 years and says: > Faced with that uncertainty, the magnitude of the risk of catastrophes or worse, extinction, and the fact that we did not anticipate the rapid progress in AI capabilities of recent years, agnostic prudence seems to me to be a much wiser path. Hinton also has a detailed lecture he's been giving recently about the loss of control risk. In general, proponents see this as narrowly tailored bill to somewhat address the worst case worries about loss of control and misuse.

Not today. reply GistNoesis 12 hours agoprevSo I've this code, it's called ShoggothDb, it's less than a megabyte of definitions. The principle is easy, it's fully deterministic. Code as Data, Data as Code. When you start the program, it joins the swarm : it starts by grabbing a torrent, and train a model on it in a distributed fashion, and publish the results as a torrent. Then with the trained model, it generates new data, (think of it like alpha-go playing new games to collect more data). See it as a tower of knowledge building itself, following some rough initial plans. Of course, at anytime you can fork the tower, and continue building with different plans, provided that you can convince other people from the swarm to contribute to the new tower rather than the old. Everything is immutable, but there is a versioning protocol built-in that allow the swarm to coordinate and automatically jumps to a next fork when the byzantine resistant quorum it follows vote for doing so (which allow your swarm to be compliant of the law and remove data if it was flagged as inappropriate). This allow some form of external control, but you can also let the quorum vote on subsequent modifications based on a model built on its data (aka free-running mode). It's using torrent because easier to bootstrap but because the whole computation deterministic, the underlying protocol is just files on disks and any way of sharing them is valid. So you can grab a piece to work on via http, or ftp, or carrier pigeon for all I care. As long as the digital signatures are conforming to the rules, brick by brick the tower will get built. To contribute, you can either help with file distribution by sharing the torrent, so it's as safe as your p2p client. If you want to commit some computing resources, like your gpu to building some of the tower, it's only requiring you to trust that there is no bug in ShoggothDb, because the computation you'll perform are composed of safe blocks, by construction they are safe for your computer to run. (Except if you want to run unsafe blocks, at this point no guarantee can be made). The incentives for helping building the tower can be set in the initial definition file, and range from mere access to the built tower to tokens for honest participation for the more materialistically inclined.

He also affirms a general appetite for CA to take on a leadership role wrt regulating AI. My general read is that he wants to preserve public attention on the need for AI regulation and not squander it on SB 1047 specifically. Or who knows I'm not a politician lol. Really strong document tho, Interesting segment: > By focusing only on the most expensive and large-scale models, SB 1047 establishes a regulatory framework that could give the public a false sense of security about controlling this fast-moving technology. Smaller, specialized models may emerge as equally or even more dangerous than the models targeted by SB 1047 - at the potential expense of curtailing the very innovation that fuels advancement in favor of the public good. > Adaptability is critical as we race to regulate a technology still in its infancy. This will require a delicate balance. While well-intentioned, SB 1047 does not take into account whether an Al system is deployed in high-risk environments, involves critical decision-making or the use of sensitive data. Instead, the bill applies stringent standards to even the most basic functions - so long as a large system deploys it. I do not believe this is the best approach to protecting the public from real threats posed by the technology. This is an incisive critique of the fundamental initial goal of SB 1047. Based on the fact that the bill explicitly seeks to cover models whose training cost was >=$100m & expensive fine-tunes, my initial guess about this bill was that it was designed by someone software engineering-minded scared of e.g. open-weight releases a la facebook/mistral/etc teaching someone how to build a nuke or something. LLMs probably replaced the ubiquitous robot lady pictures you see in every AI-focused article as public enemy number one, and the bill feels focused on some of the technical specifics of this advent and its widespread use. This focus blinds the bill from addressing the general danger of machine learning however, which naturally confounds regulation for precisely the reason plain-spoken in the above four sentences. Incredible technical communication here. reply elicksaur 20 hours agoprevNothing like this should pass until the legislators can come up with a definition that doesn’t encompass basically every computer program ever written: (b) “Artificial intelligence model” means a machine-based system that can make predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing real or virtual environments and can use model inference to formulate options for information or action.

    "originBody": "Y Combinator Traded Prestige for Growth Sven Schnieders — September 30th, 2024 Y Combinator is arguably the most successful early-stage VC fund or accelerator ever. The issue, however, is that they never truly grasped the factors behind their success, which is why YC's peak is already behind them—it’s likely all downhill from here. In particular, Sam Altman didn’t grasp what truly made YC successful. He did what he does best: being ambitious and scaling it up! To him, this seemed obvious—there were plenty of companies eager to join YC, and since predicting which ones would succeed was unreliable, why not just accept more? Even if it meant a few more failures, everyone knows VC is a power law game—one extra winner compensates for many flops. Plus, more companies naturally mean more management fees and carry! What he failed to grasp (or didn’t care about, since the effects take a long time to unfold) is that reputation and prestige are everything. Take Harvard, for instance: the reason they don’t accept a higher percentage of applicants isn’t because they can’t scale—they have the resources to build more facilities or could even switch to remote like YC—but because they choose not to. Harvard knows its success lies in exclusivity. If everyone could get in, no one would care. People don’t attend Harvard for the lectures, which are all on YouTube anyway, but because being accepted there is a status symbol. Harvard thrives on its reputation and prestige—or simply, its brand. Founders want to raise money from the top VCs—e.g. Sequoia or a16z—for the same reason. Sure, these firms offer some of the best support to their portfolio companies, much like Harvard offers top-tier lectures, but that's not the main draw. The real reason to raise from elite VCs is the prestige and legitimacy it confers on your startup. It signals to prospective employees, customers, and future investors that your company is the real deal. Naturally, this signal weakens the easier it becomes to secure funding from these VCs. If the main appeal of joining YC isn’t the mentorship but the prestige of being able to write \"YC W22\" in your Twitter bio and on your company’s landing page, then they've got a problem because you can't scale that arbitrarily. What Sam initiated, and what YC continues to do, is trade their reputation capital for real capital (i.e., more money). However, they’ll soon realize that once their reputation capital is exhausted, rebuilding it will be nearly impossible. Put simply, once YC becomes uncool – which might have already happened – you can’t make it cool again. We’re already witnessing the decline of YC in the current batch. For instance, one of the many \"AI code editors\" YC funded, PearAI, is simply a clone of another YC-backed, open-source AI code editor called Continue. Unsurprisingly, the PearAI team doesn’t appear super competent. People on Twitter were quick to mock the project, and as a reaction, Garry Tan (CEO of YC) retweeted a post defending it. This is a telling defense. While he is likely correct about the legality of copying Continue's code, that completely misses the point. The issue isn't that PearAI did something illegal—it's that they got funded by YC with nothing more than a codebase copied from another YC-backed company. This shows that (1) YC is willing to fund just about anything, (2) they’re not doing any real due diligence, and (3) they don't particularly care about their existing portfolio companies. If PearAI can secure funding, it means anyone can, and the YC brand loses much of its prestige. YC is no longer an exclusive club where membership signals legitimacy—it’s becoming a broad index of tech startups. This decline will continue until cool, innovative companies no longer see any reason to apply. Get new posts by email: Subscribe or by RSS Great!

    "commentBody": "Y Combinator Traded Prestige for Growth (unfashionable.blog)423 points by SvenSchnieders 5 hours agohidepastfavorite201 comments dgreensp 3 hours agoFull disclosure, I'm a YC alum whose last start-up was acquired by Google, who applied to this batch and didn't get an interview. YC is not the stamp of quality it once was, to be sure, though it still works as social proof, because investors (especially VCs) want to invest in companies other investors like (or failing that, companies they imagine other investors would like). YC would say that they aren't trying to be a stamp of quality or social proof, they are just trying to help start-ups. If I had to take a stab at articulating how YC has changed, it's that it's become a VC, picking ideas to generate returns. This rejection email from 2022 that someone posted online cements the idea for me (excerpted): \"Unfortunately, we've decided not to fund {Company} this batch. We enjoyed our conversation today and were impressed by you as founders building something they are passionate about bringing into being. However we weren't convinced that this product strategy is going to yield a big company in its current form. ... Of course, things are very early and you are still figuring out the right way to build and structure your business. If you're able to make significant progress with it, we'd be very interested in hearing about it for a future batch.\" Original YC would not reject founders over their current product strategy and because they haven't figured out the right way to structure their business--haven't put together the \"proof\" that they could be on track to be a unicorn, etc. That's a VC rejection. Of course, YC gets many thousands of applications and has to reject most of them. You could say they shouldn't be criticized for trying to give a little feedback. It's just hard to convey the sense from the early days of YC that they really didn't care about the return, or the progress so far, or VCs, or fads, or anything. That said, I really was at the right place at the right time and got very lucky. Finally, I want to call out the phenomenon in the world of VC where the ability to generate hype alone is enough to make you and your investors a lot of money, even if there isn't a lot of substance in your company (and even if things are morally or ethically questionable), through the mechanism of greater fools. Cryptocurrency is a whole exploration of this effect, turning hype into money by building a streamlined mechanism for bringing in greater fools, but we can also look at examples like Theranos. (There's actually a ton of money at the top of society looking for somewhere to go, which ideally would be routed to more worthy ventures than it is, but that's a whole topic in itself.) The point is, the greater fool \"strat\" works. In a moral vacuum, if you are trying to maximize returns, you lean into it. If I were running a fund like YC with basically unlimited money at my disposal, balancing the goals (strategies?) of 1) make money for money's sake, 2) advance technology for technology's sake (let's go to Mars, etc), and 3) make the world a better place, I would focus on (3). Like can we at least try to build a unicorn that feeds people, and maybe fail, rather than trying to build FooBarBazCoin that eats the word, and failing? We mostly see a mix of (1) and (2). reply matt_lee 41 minutes agoparentWhen we got accepted into S23, our call started with Seibel saying something along the lines of \"We like you, but we're pretty sure you're going to have to pivot.\" A non-trivial amount of my batch mates also joined with minimal product strategy, so I don't think you can read too much into the rejections. I don't have anything to add re: YC over the years, just that my anecdotal experience differs. reply w10-1 12 minutes agoparentprev--- There's actually a ton of money at the top of society looking for somewhere to go, which ideally would be routed to more worthy ventures than it is, but that's a whole topic in itself --- Forget \"ideally\": the experience and world-view of the collective deciders for that money is financial. Other factors are filtered out. Vanity investments - for the glory of the human race or technological progress - only reflect inefficiency and excess discretion that are squeezed out with a few selection iterations or process controls. (This is setting aside the large cohort of big-money behind overt/covert national funds, with major non-financial strategic objectives.) That finance focus won't change with YC's focus or with more morality or regulation. The only path I see is innovation not in finance or technology but in law: to somehow create and sell a stake in the future, to avoid future environment and peoples being now basically a huge externality sink. \"YC's reputation\" matters mainly insofar as it provides access and credibility for individual YC startup's, based on their collective promise. If governance access and credibility were conditioned on long history/holding period of protections for future, then both selection and resources would flow in favor, and we'd have a race to the top instead of the bottom. reply ChrisMarshallNY 2 hours agoparentprev> … yield a big company … I assume that this sort of says it all. Everyone wants “big.” The article talks about brand curation, really. That seems to be a lost art, these days. I worked for a corporation that had one of the most powerful brands in the world (but has taken some real hits). I watched them dilute that brand, and make lots of money, but really get clobbered. They are now regrouping, and, I hope, re-establishing their original luster. They were able to take a fairly small corporation, and compete with mega companies, on the strength of their brand. When they grew rather explosively, in the 1990s, they sowed the seeds of their own demise, in the mid-2010s. reply ethbr1 2 hours agorootparentStrong brand value seems like insurance.

I think earned leadership can be legitimately exploited where everybody wins up to a point, and if you put your mind to it you can engineer an operation to approach that point more successfully than those who do not. You could be monetizing your \"prestige\", at a maximum sustainable level, without drawing down the asset. OTOH it would be possible to go overboard on the march to maximum monetization, and arrive where the asset begins to dwindle. It may not be such a clear picture since it's so unquantifiable, and dwindling returns as a consequence can be some of the most easily misattributed. reply kashkhan 2 hours agorootparentprevthe whole mythology is nobody knows what will be a big company in general.

[...] I watched them dilute that brand, and make lots of money, but really get clobbered. Maybe this is the normal lifecycle of a successful organization, unless one decides to grow more slowly? Infinite growth is what ruins most things. Scaling is hard. YC seemed to attract genuine founders, back when starting something up was not so trendy. As it became fashionable, and YC began to be seen as the Harvard of startups, it has still attracted some great founders but also some less genuine ones. All successful organizations experience this issue. A key element here is that neither PG nor Jessica Livingston seem to be actively filtering out people. I doubt anyone from batches curated by them would have posted on Twitter bragging about quitting a $270k job to work on a re-licensed fork. It was sad to read about this whole affair and, frankly, I think discussion on HN has become less interesting, reflecting a similar trend. Front pages were full of technical discussion back in the late 2000s and early 2010s. Content of that kind is less frequent these days. reply jhanschoo 2 hours agoparentprev> It's just hard to convey the sense from the early days of YC that they really didn't care about the return, or the progress so far, or VCs, or fads, or anything.

Web apps and mobile fundamentally transformed everyday life and communication in very visible ways and there seemed to be a lot of low hanging fruit. I observe, similar to your 2), that YC seemed to have a bias toward products for tech people by tech people, and that wasn't a bad strategy, because there was still a lot of plumbing to do; there still is, but I feel that there are established solutions for the mass market to a degree that there wasn't. reply skeeter2020 4 minutes agorootparentThere were a lot of preferable options for connected, generally non-technical people after the dot-com implosion, for the first ~15 years of the 2000's.

Dropbox for example at the time. In my opinion, effectiveness of anything dilutes over time especially as you increase volume. There is no way you can maintain the same level of vetting and quality when you have a batch of 50 vs batch of 500+ which is now where YC is. So they must have to pivot to a different model of vetting companies. I am curious as to why they continue to do more batches instead of less. Is it really a numbers game now ?

I can only assume your product didnt fit into the current hype investment bucket (you should have put Ai in the pitch and you would have been funded).

They may even stretch the runway as far as possible to maintain the status. YC is just another brand they can add. It was so odd for me when I first realized this is how it works.

But from the actions of YCombinator it seem like either: - They don't see this as a risk to their long-term ROI (due to some factors we are not seeing here) - They don't have proper means of self-assessing their selection quality and think they are scaling well while they don't - The situation is not as bad as the article and some of the comments here make it look like, and everything is fine with YC [0]: https://www.ycombinator.com/topcompanies/ That's really short term thinking.

Originally, at small scale, you need to pick hits better than others (or get lucky).

Especially when so many YCs seem almost like comical vaporware or shovelware but with a charismatic CEO. reply MOARDONGZPLZ 3 hours agorootparentVery true. Saw one recently that literally forked VSCode and Cursor and called it a company with some really shady practices. Not even sure what YC was thinking with that one, but it indeed falls into the category of comical vaporware. How did something like this get funded? They must think there will be a follow through to liquidity event, but no clue how. Maybe YC is playing into the bigger fool theory that someone else will come along and pay more so YC can extricate their equity. reply ndiddy 1 hour agorootparentThat’s the company that the blog post points to as an example. reply lumost 3 hours agorootparentprevA high-quality early stage team that self-selects out of follow-up rounds may be a decent outcome for some VCs. This means early liquidity in all of the \"positive\" events. If the founders were high quality, spinning an acquihire out can still recoup some of the loss. The challenge would come where the founders are not serious, and instead are viewing YC as a stepping stone to a level up position in a big tech/large firm. While I'm sure everyone has this idea to some extent as a fallback, you need people to be committed to making their business work. reply hobofan 3 hours agorootparentprevSure, that would be a theoretical failure mode. But that's not really what's happening right now, is it? YC doesn't look to have a problem of people joining just to get the stamp on the resume and then \"half-assing\" it after they get into YC. I think that's something that YC is still quite actively selecting against. As long as they are selecting companies that make it to a series ~C (which most founders will stick around for as long as they are on an good-enough upward-presenting) YC can (partially) liquidate at good enough fund performance. reply avarun 4 hours agorootparentprev> The only thing YC has to do is produce a portfolio of companies that looks good enough that other VCs invest into that. This is completely incorrect. They need liquidity events. Simply getting to follow on funding without ever making it to an exit is a negative outcome for YC. reply hobofan 3 hours agorootparentLiquidity event != exit. While an exit (= aquisition, IPO and similar) is obviously always the optimal end-goal, every round of fundraising is a potential liquidity event for all existing stakeholders. It's very common to have partial liquidation from roughly Series B-C onwards on the side of founders (e.g. wanting to keep up lifestyle with your C-level peers; removing personal financals as stress factor) and earlier investors (e.g. their funds entering the liquidation period of their lifecycle). reply shekispeaks 11 minutes agoparentprevWe can keep going down here, the problem with society can also be that prestige in itself is valuable.

There's a great Startup School video about this [0].

It comes from Latin praestigium (\"delusion, illusion\"), then 1500s French prestige meaning “deceit, imposture, illusion”. In the 1800s it started to mean “an illusion as to one's personal merit or importance, a flattering illusion”. I would have wrongly guessed it originally meant “good reputation” (same as the article author meant it, I assume) and that the association with bullshit/fakery is just a modern twist from people using the word with cynical irony.

Edit: YC says \"Build something people want.\" and so I'm going to riff off of that in a bit of a meta way: \"Support experiments worth conducting.\" The accelerator bit comes in once you've reached product market fit and need fuel for the rocket ship, but until then, you're just running an economic science experiment. reply neilv 2 hours agorootparentAFAICT, as much as YC was a child of their time, they (and PG) were also one of the parents of our current time. I'm guessing it was inevitable that Wall Street would take over the field, and turn it into a machine. And therefore it was also inevitable that people who, in the past, would've gone to Wall Street, now would flow into the space, and take it over.

I do think we're going to be seeing more innovative organizational models that can be facilitated by adept use of AI. For example, a network organization that hires individuals and small teams. The organization works on various projects and product streams, which which can be spun out as new businesses. This is a flexible model that allows for many different outcomes and journeys for the people. Less of a startup factory and more of an enterprise garden. I like the idea of gateways as a system for managing ideas and new business developments. Regular gateways every 6 or 12 months that assess projects for continuation, funding and further development. People can be involved in several projects. I see this type of organization structure as a kind of 'hyper network'. By using AI to monitor and report on network activity it should be possible to have effective management oversight, direction and communication ... beneficent controlled creative chaos. reply candiddevmike 3 hours agorootparentprevFor founders?

The conclusion (YC's brand has been tarnished because of the lower quality companies in their larger batches who do bad things) doesn't follow from the evidence of this ONE company doing something that people could view as a low integrity move. This exact situation could have occurred even if they kept their acceptance rates, and cohorts, incredibly small. There can always be bad actors (not saying this company is a bad actor though). I think you wanted to share your conclusion, even if the available evidence didn't necessarily support your claim. reply bko 3 hours agoparentI think the bigger issue is that the main signal to YC (and other elite institutions) is the acceptance rate ( If every startup in the world applied and they could choose, of course that would be better. Would it? With numbers that large, how could anyone possibly do a meaningful comparison and pick out the twenty or thirty or fifty that would get in? In other words, if it's obvious to everybody that you are getting too many applications to meaningfully evaluate all of them, they everybody knows that you are not meaningfully evaluating all of them. You're applying some kind of mindless algorithmic filter to narrow down the possibilities. But that's not YC's brand. YC's brand is providing meaningful evaluation of startups. Once that brand is undermined, it's gone. reply bko 2 hours agorootparentprevI'm convinced those that say \"I think its a good exercise filling out an application\" have never actually read the application Here are a few questions: \"How far along are you?\" \"What tech stack are you using, or planning to use, to build this product?\" \"Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you're making?\" \"Who are your competitors? What do you understand about your business that they don't?\" \"How do or will you make money? How much could you make?\" It's really not that deep or thought provoking. Its fine, you should have answers for these questions, but its hardly worth a founders time going over this as closely as many do. > And the second reason is that they get to see as many options as possible, because that's obviously better for them Yes, that's the infinite optionality for them.

As you say, people are people and that can happen with even the strictest due diligence. The problem for YC's prestige stems from funding a company with an unoriginal idea and not even the beginnings of a prototype. I'm aware that YC funds founders more than it funds specific ideas or projects. Nonetheless, you'd expect an impressive group of founders to do more than just fork an existing open source project. In short, cases like this show that YC is getting (non-illegally) scammed by some of its applicants. That makes YC look foolish. reply mattcantstop 2 hours agorootparentEven the evidence listed (the retweeted tweet in the article) doesn't support the claim of the author to me. If you open source software and give it a license that permits commercial use on top of it, then you are okay with that use. If I was a cohort of a team that built an open sourced AI editor I would think they would WANT me to build on top of it. Otherwise, why permit that use? They may have a bad business model, where their business does not work if they open source their tech and other companies build competitors on top of it. But that's a questions for them and their decision to open source.

YCombinator was never a test of how good (or unique) your code was. At its core it was a filter of people, people who can work well together and people who can build something useful. That's it. You can read more about this straight from one of the founders [1]. The fact that you used open-source code (within legal bounds) to get their quicker just shows your resourcefulness, something YC actually optimizes for.

Since a lot of you hate the site, I'll summarise briefly: one of the founders did a thread starting with the following post: \" I just quit my 270 000$ job at Coinbase to join the first YCombinator fall batch with my cofounder @not_nang We're building PearAI, an open source AI code editor.

Essentially, the post ticked a few rage inducing boxes for a certain kind of tech twitter user. It was rather cringe, reading like a thread from get-rich-quick influencer types while also likely imbueing some readers and quote tweets with a little jealousy they wouldn't openly admit. This was probably the impetus that pushed one or two angry people to poke around their product and find out about the open source code cloning and the fact the founders were overselling (which founder doesn't, I guess...) which lead to a rout of publicly mocking them and YC in general, resulting in blog posts like the OP, I guess. I personally don't really think one company amongst the whole batch is enough to judge the start of a trend for YC \"trading prestige for growth\" or whatever. I think the discussion of prestige is in general is an interesting one, I just don't think PearAI is indicative of it more than they themselves just being hucksters which happens in tech in general. reply octopod12 3 hours agorootparentThe founders showed hustle, as every founder must. nothing wrong with that in my book.

YC has always been a smorgasbord of status seekers, dreamers, ruthless pragmatists, creators and artists. It's a big community that keeps growing, the good parts and the bad parts. There were scandals then, there are scandals now. They pick some teams perfectly and others totally wrong.

They largely funded college students that nobody else would invest in. But part of Paul Graham's philosophy for it is that \"If you do anything well enough, you'll make it prestigious\" [1]. Rather, I think that what's happened with YCombinator is that it's followed the growth arc common to all institutions. You start with somebody who has a good idea and a passion for making things better for some subset of humanity. That attracts other people in a virtuous cycle. But eventually you hit a growth limit and saturate your market. At that point, the focus of the people in charge turns to wealth extraction, leveraging your brand, reputation, and market position to make ever increasing profits. Eventually you squeeze everything there is out of your market, your product is shit, your employees don't care about you anymore, and you get replaced by a younger more beautiful que^H^H^Hstartup. I wouldn't bother applying to YC now - I don't feel like they give enough for the equity they take, their advice has become formulaic and well-known, and I'd rather go do what I love. But in 2005, when nobody was funding college students and the popular wisdom was that the Internet was a dead fad, they were revolutionary. [1] https://paulgraham.com/love.html reply solumos 2 hours agoprevSomething that I think is a bit misguided about this is that YC, at founding, was pretty unfashionable itself. The \"accelerator\" model wasn't particularly proven, and the thesis was that there was an untapped talent pool of \"hackers\" who just needed to figure out how to run a business and get connected to the right people/resources in order to be successful founders. Compared to other accelerator-type opportunities at the time (and some that still exist), YC was extremely founder friendly. YC 1.0 made good on that vision — the success rate in the early batches is indicative of that. Once PG stepped back and handed the reigns over to Sam Altman, YC focused more on scaling up, while the startup ecosystem grew significantly as well, specifically around \"Web 2.0\". At the time, it wasn't particularly difficult to create a venture-backable web business if you had the technical skills and the right resources to achieve distribution. Along the same lines, being a startup founder became a viable alternative to becoming a banker or management consultant for high-achieving individuals. So naturally YC, as a backer of hyper-successful startups that generally have an easier time fundraising, became a magnet for the status-seeking subset of high-achieving individuals, leading to it becoming more of a stamp of prestige. Since Sam Altman's tenure, it seems like a lot of the initial edge that YC had at founding is significantly diluted. There are a lot of aspiring founders seeking funding, but the Web 2.0 opportunity doesn't really exist anymore (at least not at the same scale). So today, YC looks much more like a large seed fund that funds more specialized businesses rather than the types of founders of the initial cohorts (i.e. hackers that want to build Web 2.0 businesses), and I think people are overly critical of that scale up. 2005 was a very specific point in time for the startup industry, and the YC thesis was not only well-timed, but extremely effective through ~2014 — but it's been difficult for them to figure out how to continue the momentum given changes in the ecosystem. reply jppope 2 hours agoparentWell said.

And if this is spread across different products, industries, ideas, then it is a good signal that your company was handpicked and got attention of one of the best VCs, among many many contenders. With examples like this, this signal is basically gone and getting a YC investment means nothing. reply mlsu 1 hour agoprevThis reminds me of something that appeared on hacker news a couple days ago: https://sohl-dickstein.github.io/2022/11/06/strong-Goodhart.... Basically, the proxy objective is \"getting into YC\" -- the real objective is producing value of course. We've started optimizing for the proxy. Which produces outcomes like this, where YC is a Thing You Do, after Graduating From Stanford, and before Becoming a YC Alum. reply phendrenad2 44 minutes agoprev> they got funded by YC with nothing more than a codebase copied from another YC-backed company. This shows that (1) YC is willing to fund just about anything, I don't see it that way. This is NOT the first time YC has funded startups that are in direct competition. It seems to me that having multiple companies with the same product makes your net larger for customer acquisition, and the startups can always merge later. reply nashashmi 4 hours agoprevArticle's assumption is that a totally incompetent set of startup founders were admitted to YC because it \"loses quality in exchange for quantity\" (not a direct quote but the gist). And this startup was nothing more than a copy of a different startup. Maybe it is the prestige game that became a death knell for YC. Because it is \"cool\" to be accepted to YC, the \"cool people\" with a coolness factor started applying and tried to game through the evaluation process into acceptance. But these cool people aren't really cut out for doing sweaty, gross, sleeve-pulling work. So they likely fail. What does Sam do? Refocus the company to drift away from the \"cool\" tech sector where cool people are looking to make their name cool. And start doing stuff in multiple sectors (that will seem cool in the future!). What didn't he do? Make the grind of becoming a YC selectee even sweatier and harder. Or change the selection process entirely so that all previous books trying to get you through the system fall flat on their faces. reply lvl155 4 hours agoprevCounter point: there are so many more accelerators now. It was basically getting into MIT/Stanford in term of opening up big doors. Now you have schools with accelerators right out of undergrads. So, YC has to compete in the space (sort of). It’s still one of the highest prestige (as in validation) you can get EVEN IF YOU FAIL. reply tfehring 4 hours agoprevJust from public information my impression is that prestige was never a goal while scaling was in the plans from fairly early on.

However review my last month or so of post history for my views on earned/employment income, unearned income and asset income. In essence I differentiate between revenue within income, but not income/investment. I don't think taxes should either. Specifically, I think capital gains/intermingling of asset taxes while requiring up to date taxed-upfront employment taxes is one of the worst decisions society ever made. reply vessenes 3 hours agoprevThe blog post is dumb, in the extreme. Sven doesn’t know the PearAI founders, the key metric YC says they assess when they make a funding decision. Where they forked a codebase from is a deminimus consideration — as Gary says, if it’s in the license, it’s in the license. Maybe Sven thinks that’s unethical, although in this case it’s funny to complain on behalf of YC, “Hey, YC, your money went to an open source codebase, and then some more of your money got to use it! You guys suck!” Comments here miss a lot as well, (although I agree that YC’s prestige days are over) — PG’s plan was ALWAYS to be able to do more. He lays out the reasoning in an essay maybe eight years ago — if your portfolio looks like 1-2 companies (now 3) out of 500 made 80% of the returns, what should you do? There are basically three answers to this: Rejoice, Write 497 less checks next time, or write 1,000 more checks in the hope of getting a fourth. PG’s head was at: write 1,000 more checks. I like this attitude a lot, and believe there are good social, macroeconomic and financial reasons to act this way. Of course you will put up with more failures in that mode — you already went and got the “good” ones — you are now picking ones you didn’t love that much in the sure knowledge that you’ll happily be wrong about one (or maybe even two) of them. Especially when you’re considering what to do mid-ZIRP, this is I think the only rational strategy if you want to make more money and help the world see more cool things. That said, one thing YC companies benefitted from immensely in the height of the prestige era was just that, prestige; it was a virtuous cycle in that getting in to YC guaranteed a quality seed and probably A round just on the name. In that way, it was like getting in to Stanford or MIT. Today, along with mentoring, one of the main benefits is the larger network internally, and this is a different thing. Possibly better, possibly not. I do think that if the prestige is needed for their model, they’re probably over scaled for today’s markets and venture money. Of bigger concern, I would say should be the question: “what does pre-seed/seed even look like in five years?” — Much of what seed capital is for can be done with quality LLMs today — and I expect that trend to continue. We saw the rise of pre-seed firms in exactly this economic environment — through the middle of the dotcom one boom, a tech startup was EXPENSIVE — ten engineers, $30k sparcstations, long data center contracts — the cash was needed. YC started at an inflection point when open source tooling and availability was driving that cost down. The next YC / early stage fund is going to look very, very different than the last one. And that’s okay! It will be fun to see what’s next. reply jeffreyrogers 3 hours agoprevYC gets such great terms (because they invest so early and have great deal flow) that it's hard to see them declining unless the current venture model stops working. It does seem that recent YC batches are less impressive, but IMO that's less due to the quality of person that YC attracts and more that there's less low-hanging fruit. The \"software is eating the world\" thesis still seems true but now it's a lot harder to compete just on software you often need domain expertise in a complicated field. reply buggeryorkshire 4 hours agoprevSurprised this doesn't mention meticulous.ai, who seem to spam HN with \"we're hiring!\" each month but i've never heard of anybody using them, nor do LI show any new employees.

Forking is part of how open source is supposed to work. reply dotty- 4 hours agorootparentThe beauty of forking/open source is the ability to contribute back to the original project or take over an abandoned project. In this case, the original project Continue.dev isn't abandoned and actually has more traction/commits than the PearAI fork. But what PearAI did not do is a traditional fork. They took the commit history, re-branded everything to PearAI, pushed it up to their own repo, and claimed that the contributors of VSCode & Continue were their own contributors on Twitter. That's not the spirit of open source. I'm sure the authors of Continue.dev did not intend for their work to be used this way, even if the license is permissive of it. reply neilv 4 hours agorootparentI'm not sure how to parse this, and one possibility is worse than the other. Did they go through and alter each commit in the history, making it look as if the committer was talking about brand B instead of brand A at the time they made the commit? Or did they clone the commit history, and add commits to rebrand, while keeping the historical commits intact? reply jmull 3 hours agorootparentprevWell, VS code isn't abandoned either.

The problem is, they want to sell dev tools and those tend to be more grounded in reality thanwhere their attitude and skills might be a better fit. Lots of devs like calling out bullshit as a hobby and making fun of shoddily built stuff, so it's a tough audience. YC doesn't do \"due diligence\" and never has, not worth it for the $125k they put in.

YC funds a lot of companies and has always had super high variance in the companies it funds. Entrepreneurs are a wild bunch of people. There have always been companies where the founders turned out to be BS artists or sociopaths. Companies that folded immediately after the program started. Companies with messy cofounder breakups already brewing at the beginning of the batch. Companies that turned out to be slightly scammy. Some of the founders that were in those companies pivoted and became successful. Picking on Pear AI (which I don't know anything about) as evidence of YC failing is silly. It's also a super early stage company and you really have no idea what they will do. The test of YC to me is, can they keep attracting and picking some of the best founders (which you can't really tell for years). And providing the inspiring, warm, but pushy environment that best sets up founders for success, and in turn keeps them coming to YC. I'd apply to YC again in a heartbeat if I were ever starting another company. reply pbiggar 4 hours agoprevOne of the biggest shocks to me was that YC now invests in war and killing people.

Given the actions of Russia in Ukraine, those of its proxy Iran (and their proxies in Lebanon, Gaza and Yemen in turn) across the Middle East and last but not least China's saber rattling in Taiwan and the Philippines, it's about high time that the West (as a collective of likewise-minded countries) finally wakes up and invests into keeping up with its enemies.

With 40k applications and roughly only 100s accepted… they likely only chose pearai because of nepotism. It would be self sabotage if they regularly do this so likely only a few companies are selected this way with pearai being one. The above is a very educated guess on pearai, but whether or not YC engages in nepotism or not is unmistakable to me. They do and there is real corruption in the selection process. It’s not just gross incompetence. Not only is there actual evidence that can be sourced but I can offer anecdotal evidence from inside sources from within the family involved with a company that passed via nepotism. the company is called dreamworld. See here: https://www.pcgamer.com/dreamworld-infinite-world-mmo-kickst... There’s whole YouTube videos about them including a post from one of the founders ex girlfriend. It’s all very shady the articles around them. I encountered this company by being close friends with someone that is within the family related to the founders of dreamworld. I was literally told that the company succeeded because of family connections from dreamworlds ceo: https://www.linkedin.com/in/garrisonbellack Garrison is the ceo of dreamworld. And he’s from a rich family headed by his dad: https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-r-bellack who is part of some super rich real estate fund. The bellacks regularly have big family gatherings in Tahoe and one of the attendees is Geoff ralston the previous president of YC. Source not only confirmed dreamworld got selected via favors from Geoff but that Geoff was telling stories at this family retreat about how he had to fire Sam Altman from YC after getting a call from Paul graham. Yes pg fired Sam Altman from YC. Dreamworld as it is right now got additional seed funding from VCs via connections as well and they are sitting on a pot of assets which is generating net positive income while that company can just stay afloat indefinitely. They don’t go through the hardships and risks other startup do thanks to nepotism. There are other people in the bellack family creating startups and looking to Geoff to funnel them through YC via nepotism so Geoff is primed to make it happen again for sure. So yeah. I’m sure Geoff isn’t the only person from within YC who does that. Hacker news is pretty pristine, but the fund itself does shady stuff. At least I think hacker news is pristine.

I’m a random guy on the internet and my source isn’t 100 percent solid from my pov either. So keep that in mind when judging this whole thing. Overall this is what happened: some person at the family retreat listened to Geoff tell the story about how pg made the decision to fire Altman and that person relayed the story to me. Overall from the fuzzy evidence I’m thinking he was actually fired but I’m not 100 percent on that either. You’ll have to be your own judge for this.

Whilst Visual Studio Code is \"open-source\" (as per the OSD) the value-add which transforms the editor into anything of value (\"what people actually refer to when they talk about using VSCode\") is far from open and full of intentionally designed minefields that often makes using Visual Studio Code in any other way than what Microsoft desires legally risky... In this blog post, we explore the ecosystem of open-source forks, revisit the story so far with how Microsoft has been transforming from products to services, go deep into why the Visual Studio Code ecosystem is designed to fracture, and the legal implications of this design then discuss future problems faced by the software development ecosystem if our industry continues as-is on the current path... Yup! And that’s by design 🙂 — Phillip Carter (@_cartermp) May 18, 2022 By the end of this blog post, I hope more folks understand that by using anything other than the official distribution of Visual Studio Code provided by Microsoft (or GitHub via Codespaces) that it is easy to expose yourself or your company to legal risks similar to incorrectly using Docker Desktop or the Oracle JDK... Docker Now Requiring Paid Subscription for Large Businesses Docker has introduced a new Subscription Service Agreement which requires organizations with more than 250 employees or more than $10 million in revenue to buy a paid subscription, starting at $5 per user per month. Additionally, Docker has launched a new Business subscription plan for larger organi… InfoQ Sergio De Simone Oracle Java License Change: Everything You Need to Know In this blog, we’ll explain the Oracle Java license change and demonstrate how DRS can help you bypass unnecessary costs. Blog Jeremy Moskowitz visual studio code is now seven years old Visual Studio Code was released 7 years ago and is fast becoming the de facto standard editor that people use when doing software development. Sure there's also the JetBrains product suite, Emacs, Neovim, XCode and Visual Studio [for Windows and Mac], but VSCode is likely installed on your computer right now. The source code has been released by Microsoft under the open-source MIT license, but the product available for download (Visual Studio Code) is licensed under this proprietary license. This small distinction matters a lot and is the primary mechanism that Microsoft uses to fork open-source communities. This comment from a Visual Studio Code maintainer explains the process of how Microsoft generates its builds: When we [Microsoft] build Visual Studio Code, we clone the vscode repository, lay down a customized product.json that has Microsoft specific functionality (telemetry, gallery, logo, etc.), and then produce a build that we release under our license. In the broader community, there are two leading distributions based on the MIT source code: vscodium & openvscodeserver. vscodium is an oss desktop distribution Members of the free software community became concerned by the usage of the proprietary license and launched the VSCodium project as a community-driven, freely-licensed desktop distribution of Visual Studio Code in binary form. The project automatically follows the upstream open-source (MIT) project and generates binary builds without the telemetry found in the official releases. https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/blob/master/DOCS.md#disable-telemetry The VSCodium follows the same process outlined by the Visual Studio Code maintainer: When you [VSCodium] clone and build from the vscode repo, none of these endpoints are configured in the default product.json. Therefore, you generate a “clean” build, without the Microsoft customizations, which is by default licensed under the MIT license Rob is correct with the following statement from his blog post on telemetry: However, VSCodium can’t shut out all the data collection as it is the same codebase. And since extensions act independently with regard to data collection, you still need to be mindful of what extensions you install. VSCodium does an extremely good job at disabling data collection, but due to not being licensed by Microsoft under the proprietary license VSCodium is not able to connect to the Microsoft Visual Studio Code Marketplace and suffers from the ecosystem fracture by design problem... openvscodeserver is an oss server distribution OpenVSCodeServer is similar to VSCodium in that is also not allowed to connect to Microsoft Visual Studio Code Marketplace and suffers from the same ecosystem fracture by design problem. The project is a company-driven, freely-licensed server distribution of Visual Studio Code in binary form that is the backbone of Gitpod. The project is primarily maintained by four Gitpod employees (Anton / Filip / Jean Pierre / Huiwen) and automatically follows the upstream open-source (MIT) project. The distribution has some minor overlay customisations in the gp-code/main branch and also does not have the telemetry found in the official releases. From Theia to OpenVSCode Server - A history of Cloud IDEs Background story about the last four years improving the editing experience of Cloud IDEs. A history of Cloud IDEs IDEs that are not subscriptions are a dying breed Circa 9 years ago, Microsoft started an internal transformation in how they delivered software to customers. Instead of directly (ie. in-house) employing quality assurance teams who were dedicated to testing software builds, Microsoft switched to a model based on sprint-based development work and rolling releases with feedback from telemetry data that is gathered from Insider Builds of Microsoft's software. Former Microsoft Employee explains why bugs in Windows updates increased - gHacks Tech News Has the number of bugs in Windows updates increased in the past couple of years? If so, what is the reason for the increase in bugs? gHacks Technology News Martin Brinkmann At the same time, wider organisational changes took place in the form of functional restructures, which transitioned Microsoft into becoming a services company. Their Azure cloud-computing offering during this period has grown into a legitimate challenger to Amazon's cloud-computing offering called AWS. “One Microsoft” vision in 2020 hindsight Lessons drawn from articles about Microsoft’s 2005 and 2013 restructuring and how the company has revitalized itself to stay competitive… Medium Vic Danh The biggest side effect of this change for consumers was that instead of delivering installable products that could be run on-premises, Microsoft, in true Microsoft form of moving ever so slowly and doing it over a generation of people so as not to spook them, has been transitioning their customer base into consumers of services offered by Microsoft. the eternal question: is azure devops dead? why is azure devops tech powering GitHub actions? why did the ADO leadership structures move to GitHub? This same transition has been happening across the board in the developer tooling space as a whole. IDEs that are not subscriptions are a dying breed unless you make a ton of money from something else (ie. Apple and the AppStore, which funds the development of Xcode) So why am I bringing this all up? It's because Visual Studio Code is a ramp to move the developer tooling ecosystem towards an end-to-end consumable services model of software development tools, and GitHub Codespaces is a white label of an existing service called Visual Studio Online aka Microsoft Dev Box aka Microsoft Azure DevTest Labs. DevTest LabsMicrosoft Azure Get fast, easy and lean dev/test environments with Azure DevTest Labs. Set up development and test environments, minimise waste with quotas and more. Microsoft Azure GitHub is a white label for existing Microsoft tech Microsoft acquired GitHub circa 2018 and in 2019 Microsoft released the Visual Studio Online product that included a component for hosting your own \"codespace\" locally. Since then, everything has moved to GitHub, including the team that made Codespaces, and that component is used on the servers GitHub deploys to. Thus GitHub Codespaces is a devdiv project that now belongs to GitHub. You can now try Microsoft’s web-based version of Visual Studio – TechCrunch Earlier this year, at its Build developers conference, Microsoft announced that it was working on a web-based version of its Visual Studio IDE. At the time, Visual Studio Online went into a private preview, open to a select number of developers. Now, at its Ignite conference, the company has opened… TechCrunch Frederic Lardinois GitHub’s Engineering Team has moved to CodespacesThe GitHub Blog Over the past months, we’ve left our macOS model behind and moved to Codespaces for the majority of GitHub.com development. The GitHub Blog Tanmayee Kamath There have been numerous restructures within GitHub, but the most notable is the one that occurred on the day that Nat Friedman retired as the CEO of GitHub. On that day, when everyone was focusing on Nat's retirement, Scott Gu sent this email internally within Microsoft announcing the restructuring of how GitHub reports to Microsoft... Julia Liuson promoted to President of the Microsoft Developer Division, which now includes GitHub The mission of the Microsoft Developer Division is to earn the trust and love of developers across all languages and platforms and make them successful as they build the applications of the future. DevDiv today includes our developer tools and services including Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, NET and C#, TypeScript, and the OpenJDK. Our Azure Developer SDKs, as well as our Azure Application Development PaS and Serverless offerings (including our Azure App Services, Functions, Logic Apps, API Management, Dapr, Redis Cache, Spring Cloud services, etc.) are also part of this organization. I'm very pleased to announce the promotion of Julia Liuson to President, Microsoft Developer Division. As part of today's changes, Thomas Dohmke, CEO of GitHub, will report to Julia going forward, as will Julia's existing DevDiv reports. Julia has been instrumental in Microsoft's adoption of open source, and in the transformation of Microsoft's developer strategy. As the leader of DevDiv, she helped guide the open sourcing of -NET (which now runs on every major OS platform), as well as the creation and open sourcing of Visual Studio Code (now the most popular development tool in the world). She initiated our deep engagement with the Python community, including hiring Python creator Guido van Rossum to Microsoft, and her team now delivers the most widely used Python developer tooling in the world (with VS and VS Code) as well as delivers runtime performance for the broader Python community. She started the OpenJDK effort at Microsoft, which is now used broadly to run Java workloads on Azure. And over the last 9 months she has led our Azure Application Developer PaS and Serverless offerings and has helped drive to make these services great for developers using all languages, tools, and platforms. Under Julia's leadership, the Developer Division team has undergone a significant cultural transformation and is guided by consistent cultural values: diversity & inclusion, customer obsession, data-driven, and quality-driven. The pervasiveness of these culture attributes is evident through the success of products like Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code, which have experienced more than 16x usage growth since 2014 (and are now used by the majority of developers in the world). I deeply admire how committed Julia is to team culture, mentorship, and how she helps generate opportunities for others to succeed. She is an avid supporter of MakeCode (which is also built by her team) as an investment to help kids learn programming and pursue computer science in earty education. Julia was one of the first women at Microsoft to be promoted to Corporate Vice President of Engineering leading development teams at Microsoft, and she is a mentor and sponsor to women and men across Microsoft today. She received the Asian American Executive of the Year award in 2013 and was inducted into the Women in Technology International Hall of Fame in 2019. Please join me in thanking Julia for the outstanding leadership she provides, and in congratulating her on the well-deserved promotion and expanded remit. Instead of GitHub reporting directly to Scott Guthrie, GitHub now reports to the person who looks after numerous products within the developer division. Julia Liuson was an interesting choice because she was the person that weeks before the promotion who implemented last-minute changes that fractured the .NET community... Can we trust Microsoft with Open Source? - Dusted Codes Oh boy, what a week of .NET drama again. Not bored yet? Read on, but for this one you’ll need some ... Dusted Codes Microsoft reverses controversial .NET change after open source community outcry The decision follows weeks of unrest in the .NET community. The Verge Tom Warren Sources at Microsoft, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The Verge that the last-minute change was made by Julia Liuson, the head of Microsoft’s developer division, and was a business-focused move. an ecosystem that is designed to fracture I used to think GitHub Codespaces would help popularise Gitpod but now realize it is the other way around. Gitpod is currently permitted to exist in the Visual Studio Code ecosystem to popularise GitHub Codespaces, and Microsoft can step in at any moment to create legal crises that strategically divide the market from a business perspective because like Apple and their AppStore: it is their ecosystem that they control and they are in absolute control. https://excalidraw.com/#json=COGNVvZqtf4U6KOSr0rY1,r3prDiiO102jSsfflwsphA Meanwhile, from a product perspective, people will try out Gitpod and, unfortunately, experience product papercuts in the expected value of Visual Studio Code and how users expect the product to function because the developer experience of Gitpod can never match the seamless developer experience of Visual Studio Code or GitHub Codespaces because the Visual Studio Code open-source source code is a venus fly trap that is designed to fracture and lure people in... Yup! And that’s by design 🙂 — Phillip Carter (@_cartermp) May 18, 2022 but it would be wrong to single out just Gitpod here. Any company (Gitpod, GitLab, Datacoves, OpenBB, Foam, et al) that adopts the Visual Studio Code open-source source code and attempts to compete with Microsoft or GitHub will face the problems outlined above and will be unable to legally offer services for the following programming languages using the functionality that Visual Studio Code users expect and have become accustomed to unless they develop their own tooling (which as of this blog post none have done so): Microsoft .NET C# (fsharp is completely open and does not have these issues) Python (general purpose and data science markets) Project Jupyter (as in nearly the entirety of the data science market) C or C++ (general purpose, enterprise and industrial hardware markets) and I suspect 🔜 Java (general purpose, enterprise and data science) will be next once the Microsoft tooling catches up with the tooling offered by RedHat. According to the latest TIOBE index of programming languages popularity above are five of the most popular programming languages/ecosystems, and Microsoft has near control of the seventh most popular language - JavaScript (via TypeScript). https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/ Microsoft can easily fork open-source communities by changing towards proprietary defaults (\"strategically divide the market\") as Microsoft has already done twice so far. The way Microsoft forks open-source communities is by releasing Visual Studio Code extension updates that make their proprietary offering the default once they have managed to capture enough adoption... Open Source VS Code Python Language Server Dies, Replaced by Proprietary Pylance -- Visual Studio Magazine Microsoft officially pounded the last nail into the open source Microsoft Python Language Server coffin, replacing it with the company’s proprietary Pylance extension for coding with Python in Visual Studio Code. Visual Studio Magazine David Ramel While the company isn't forcing users to switch to its new proprietary language server -- pointing to an open source alternative -- it's the new default. The move affects millions of developers, as the Python extension is by far the most popular tool in the VS Code Marketplace, having been downloaded nearly 50 million times, about twice as much as the next most popular extension: Jupyter.

Open .NET has 13 repositories available. Follow their code on GitHub. GitHub or similar tooling alternatives to the proprietary extension offerings created by Microsoft to enforce their commercial strategy, users will experience friction in the form of having to wire in different product-specific configurations on a per-platform basis and then dealing with the headaches of user support/training related to topics of how the \"official\" ms-dotnettools.csharp functions vs the open alternative (if it is ever built) and topics of feature/configuration disparity. 1. desktop configuration // devcontainer.json \"customizations\": { \"vscode\": { \"settings\": {}, \"extensions\": [ \"ms-dotnettools.csharp\" ], \"devPort\": {} } }, 2. Gitpod web configuration // gitpod.yml vscode: extensions: - // some open tooling that doesn't exist yet Whereas if a user stays within the official ecosystem created by Microsoft via the desktop edition of Visual Studio Code produced by Microsoft, then the same configuration that works on the desktop edition just works when someone or their team goes to try out or adopt GitHub Codespaces. vs a single source of truth configuration that just works // devcontainer.json \"customizations\": { \"vscode\": { \"settings\": {}, \"extensions\": [ \"ms-dotnettools.csharp\" ], \"devPort\": {} } }, If Gitpod, GitLab, Datacoves, OpenBB, Foam, et al were to attempt to bypass these restrictions by offering ms-dotnettools.csharp post move to LSP Host via their service, then they would receive a very nasty legal email from Microsoft's lawyers. I want to share two basic rules of Microsoft licensing. 1: When you are presented with two options to solve your licensing issue, the more expensive one is correct. 2: If you think you’ve discovered a way to save money vs. what you used to buy, you’re probably in trouble. — Wesley Miller (@getwired) August 26, 2022 The same is also true for customers of these competitive cloud development environments if they were to manually install these extensions into these platforms, the customers would be in breach as the license of these extensions is very clear that they are only licensed for installation in official builds distributed by Microsoft: You may install and use any number of copies of the software only with Microsoft Visual Studio, Visual Studio for Mac, Visual Studio Code, Azure DevOps, Team Foundation Server, and successor Microsoft products and services to develop and test your applications - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/ms-vscode.cpptools/license okay, so how do we fix this? The future of software development tooling that is being built is closed as fuck, and people seem to be okay with it because select components meet the OSI definition whilst missing the bigger picture that the compositional graph of components does not. oh, yes, they do... Open-source was created as a financial weapon to destroy proprietary on-prem software and to ensure file formats (eg. msword doc vs msword docx) remained open for mixing between different pieces of on-prem software. Open-source as a financial weapon is also why making money from open-source is so god damn hard. Funding Open Source: How Webpack Reached $400k+/year Webpack’s Sean Larkin on growing the project’s budget with crowdfunding, sponsorships, grants, partnerships… and pure love. Open Collective Alanna Irving Maybe we need a new movement (or revisit past ideas from the 70s) that focuses on ensuring the openness regarding freedoms of computing (😉) that combat proprietary SaaS offerings? idk. When I see people arguing over open-source vs non-opensource in 2022, I feel like people are completely missing the bigger and more pressing issues at hand, like how the Visual Studio Code ecosystem has been designed... The fracturing ecosystem problem is one of the reasons I created Gitpod's Open-Source Sustainability Fund. Paying for resources that are being consumed broadens the list of people who can do open-source. Additionally, money enables open-source maintainers to buy services and outsource activities that do not bring them joy. In the very short period of time (1.5yrs) I was at Gitpod, over $32,000 USD was distributed to maintainers of language server tooling in the open-source community. Gitpod Open-Source Sustainability Fund The truth is free software isn’t free. Hours have rates. Rates require payment. What if the high achievers that our digital society is built upon were empowered to become independent artists? I hope other companies follow Gitpod's lead and support the high achievers that our digital society is built upon by enabling them to become independent artists that build truly open ecosystems Gitpod raises $22,600 at DevX Conf to give to Open-source maintainers The talks from DevX Conf are now available for viewing and USD $22,600 is being distributed to Open-source projects that conference attendees voted for. DevX Conf wrap & distributing USD 10k of open-source funding As part of Gitpod’s Open-Source Sustainability Fund initiative attendees of DevX Conf were able to decide where USD 10,000 of funds (the profits from DevX Conf plus an additional donation by Gitpod) were to be distributed. Here’s the breakdown how the fund was split and our retrospective on running… Gitpod has already partially resolved the marketplace problem for the Visual Studio Code open-source ecosystem by creating the OpenVSX project and gifting it to the eclipse foundation Open VSX VS Code is used by more than 50% of all developers worldwide. Its extension protocol enabled the broader developer community to create over but the biggest challenge for Gitpod, GitLab, Datacoves, OpenBB, Foam, et al lies ahead - developing open language tooling for each community where Microsoft has forked the communities over to proprietary language servers... It's the future. 5 years from now, none of the default language services will be OSS.

Make a proprietary free distribution of it, along with proprietary free extensions for the various languages. Make those extensions the best version possible and slow down focus on open source ones, often deprecating them. Now you have to use the closed form of VSCode to have the best experience by quite a bit. Everyone else using VSCode as a platform can't keep up because Microsoft fractured their community -- and your VSCode product is now just an ad for a similar Microsoft product that doesn't have all the papercuts. edit: 16th December 2022 GitLab has launched their own offering based off VSCode (MIT) which suffers from the same problems as everyone else who uses VSCode (MIT) in that VSCode (MIT) is designed in a way that makes your product a walking, talking, advertisement for GitHub Codespaces....

VSCode’s ecosystem is, in many respects, quite weak: - cpptools is kind of amazing but also pretty bad. It regularly malfunctions for me. It’s essentially undebuggable. I have less experience with the other extensions, but I don’t expect that they that much better. - The VSCode security story is very, very weak. Extensions are not sandboxed. The client, accessing remote repos, is wildly insecure, by design. And that second point is a big deal. Maybe when poking at your own company’s code, you aren’t that concerned about your repo attacking you. You probably should be concerned about malicious extensions, but we’re all far too used to trusting dev tooling. (Don’t forget that MS’s extensions are just this side of malicious.) But, with AI, you should absolutely not trust your LLM. It is entirely unsafe to give an LLM that might try to exploit you the ability to write into your repo directly or to run JS code in the context of any portion of VSCode. And it’s really quite easy to convince LLMs to engage in all manner of shenanigans. There’s an opportunity to make a better ecosystem. In a better ecosystem, the equivalent of cpptools would not have telemetry, because the equivalent of cpptools would not have Internet access. It would have the ability to read the workspace, to create cache files for its own data, and to operate its UI, and that’s all. reply sevensor 5 hours agoparentVSCode also, by design, obscures what’s really going on on the development environment, so that when I help a VSCode user who gets stuck, they often don’t know what computer they’re logged into, where their files actually are in the file system, which Python interpreter they’re using, what HTTPS_PROXY is set to, and so on. The ssh extension also spins up a server process for every client a user connects, and it seems a bit inconsistent about preserving state across disconnections. All in all, I spend a lot of time helping people fix problems they’ve made for themselves by using VSCode. reply spencerchubb 3 hours agorootparentWhat kind of set up do you use?

Guess I'm lucky I never jumped aboard the Visual Studio Code train... reply Sayrus 5 hours agorootparentExtensions often rely on third-party binaries (such as Language Servers, kubectl, ssh or even git itself), internet access (SAAS providers, pulling data or definitions, ...) and on your filesystem (SSH Config, Kubernetes config, Config folder in your home, ...). Sandboxing these extensions is not easy unless everything is configured within VSCode which is rarely the case. As far as I know, extensions are not sandboxed either on Emacs, (Neo)vim, Jetbrains IDEs. reply iLemming 4 hours agorootparentExtensions (in Emacs lingo we call them 'packages') are not sandboxed by design. Because unlike VSCode, you are allowed to override any, just about any part of a package's code. You can, for example, grab a command introduced in a third-party or a built-in package and override only specific parts of it without having to rewrite the entire thing. Of course, in many cases that can make your entire setup brittle - i.e., what happens when the package author decides to change some functionality that you carefully and tightly integrated into your system? At the same time, there's enormous, unmatched flexibility for making your own rules of the game - there's nothing that comes even close. You can change a function to do things that it was never initially designed for. For example, if there's a command that lets you perform GitHub search and open results in the browser, you can advise that command to change the behavior and instead of opening the results in the browser, send that data to an LLM and display it in a text buffer. You wouldn't have to rewrite the entire command; you would only have to override a specific part of it. In Vim, you'd have to rewrite the entire function. In VSCode, you'd likely have to make a separate extension. In Emacs, you wouldn't even have to save the damn thing into a file - you can write it in a scratch buffer and immediately try it out. reply miohtama 5 hours agorootparentprevPlease correct me if I am wrong but the only application (class) that currently sandboxes extensions is a web browser. So the bar is pretty high. Sandboxing does not come for a free, as it creates more complex development APIs and a performance hits. reply CraigJPerry 2 hours agorootparentDefinitely. Would still be nice to have the option to opt into, for example, running as a WASM isolate - given the option of a robust sandbox, some plugins will find it desirable to migrate and gain the secure badge or however isolated plugins are marked for user identification.

And “give this extension Internet access” could be an option when you install it, with the default being “no”, and a bit warning if you want to override that default. For all that the Docker ecosystem is somewhat of a mess, it seems more than adequate for this use case. reply diggan 4 hours agorootparent> into a sandbox, Docker-style Nope, docker alone/by itself is not a sandbox, at all.

Much F/OSS on Windows and virtually all F/OSS on macOS has proprietary build dependencies (e.g., MSVC on Windows, Xcode and various Apple frameworks and GUI toolkits on macOS), but is still itself F/OSS. It's true that such software doesn't promote or embody software freedom to the same extent as free software written for free platforms and built with free toolchains and dependencies. But this case isn't about that. Reread the comment of maintainer (presumably an MS employee) at the end: > I'm sorry to let you know that our license also prohibits using our extension in alternate distributions of VS Code - only the official one produced by Microsoft may be used. So even if we did produce a RISC-V version, you wouldn't be licensed to use it with Code Server. That's just proprietary, software plain and simple. Recall freedom 0 of the free software definition: > The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0). In the way that third-party distributions of VSCode do not come with the same rights to extend the software or use it in combination with compatible extensions as the first-party distribution does, VSCode also fails the test of freedom 3, regardless of the license of much of the code: > The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this. It's not that your modified copies must give your users the same rights to inspect and modify the code as you had (that's copyleft) but that you are unable to give them such rights. MS does this not entirely through the licensing of VSCode but also through the licensing of certain extensions, but the actual outcome is the same. It's not a different story for the term open-source. This: > May we ask why you'd like to do this? If you're planning to redistribute the language server binaries as your own custom offering, please note that our runtime license prohibits that. means that the extension fails condition 1 (the redistribution criterion) of the open-source definition. And VSCode not allowing modified redistributions the same rights as the original fails condition 3 (the derived works criterion). Neither VSCode nor this extension is open-source. They're both just proprietary software with some open-source components.

There also doesn't currently seem to be competition for the proprietary bits of Pylance outside of the LLM space.

IDEs are usually far more complex due to their vast feature sets and constant evolution. If guitars evolved and increased in complexity at the same rate as IDEs, we would've seen something absurd like James Hetfield wielding a 150-string monster guitar. IDEs have become incredibly complex tools with features that go far beyond the original concept of text editing, while guitars have remained relatively consistent in their core design and function over decades. We don't have to keep practicing typing \"the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog\" over and over again to master an IDE, while you have to play same tunes again and again to become a virtuoso. Experienced musicians often have a broader, more adaptable skill set and can change instruments, while IDE users might be more \"locked in\" to their preferred environment for various reasons. I agree with your sentiment though - good programmers are good not because they've mastered their tools - they chose to master their tools because they are good programmers. reply kragen 1 hour agorootparent> a 150-string monster guitar almost all pianos have more strings than that; the bottom octave or so have two strings each and the rest of the keys have three strings each, for a total of somewhere around 250 strings. pipe organs are routinely significantly more complex than that. but a lot of the elaboration in musical instruments doesn't take the form of increasing the number of parts; instead we have things like special varnishes, holes cut in particular shapes, special alloys for strings, tweaked electronic circuit designs, tweaked magnetic pickup designs, etc. i'm not sure it would be easier for a random person to learn how to make a stratocaster-competitive electric guitar than it would be for them to learn how to write an emacs-competitive ide as for lazy dogs, i think it's common for both programmers and musicians to practice etudes, not just for instrument mastery (which is only a small part of the problem both in programming and in music). a typing class in eighth grade was enormously helpful to me in programming even though, as everyone knows, typing is only rarely the bottleneck in programming. and i think it's pretty common for programmers to spend time on practicing the effective use of one ide feature or another, watch screencasts of other programmers using them, buy books about particular ides, etc. check out https://www.vimgolf.com/challenges/9v0062d0773d000000000225 http://vimcasts.org/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDIQ17T3sRk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGrBHohIgQY https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p09i_hoFdd0 etc. reply iLemming 1 hour agorootparentOkay, yeah, I see where you're going with this.

It sounds like MS is making a better cpptools/C++ extension mouse trap and it's impossible to build a fully OSS version because many of the MS components are closed? And when a user discovers he/she can't use their native extensions from any web interface, this is a problem for the web interface guys? I have to ask -- if people want to use this freeware instead of OSS software, it might be disappointing, but is that really a problem? If there is an answer, it would seem to be more information about who is to blame. Perhaps open source vendors should be more clear that their offerings are also open source and open ecosystem? Perhaps that would tip off devs that not every extension is, that is -- the MS alternative extension is not. One could even be more forceful: \"Certain alternatives, like vscode-cpptools, are NOT licensed under an OSI approved license. vscode-cpptools contains many unexamined binary blob components. Developers of blah blah blah C++ extension strongly believe in an open ecosystem for VSCode extensions, but MS has also refused to allow redistribution of vscode-cpptools, if used by native open source builds or by those offering VSCode via web services. Developers of blah blah blah believe, whether the code is closed or open source, ALL VSCode extensions should be freely redistributable for the good of the broader VSCode extension ecosystem.\" If major extension projects are aligned, they could simply add a notice like above to their description on their marketplace page? Trust me, legally, culturally, MS really, really doesn't want to deny access to its marketplace, because a few OSS projects wanted to offer a comparison of their license terms to those of MS.

Not that is says \"normally\", not \"definitely\". And in the next paragraph the \"definition\" encompassing a continuum of features and not a definite set is further clarified. My point was that \"X is missing\" => \"this is not an IDE\" is not true for this reason. > I'm sorry, but what _is_ the difference between an editor and an IDE for _you_? For me an IDE \"knows\" about other files I have open and their relationship with the one I'm editing (usually a \"project\") and it _i_ntegrates external tools/programs. An editor does not. It just lets me edit a file. Maybe it has syntax highlighting or folding but everything it offers is based on that file. A good example is SciTE which was my go-to for years. In an editor you can't right click on some type in the current file and choose \"Go to definition\" if that definition is another file. Of course there is a continuum. For example, running an external command is something many editors offer. And if your file is of a certain type they may even guess what the (build) command may be. When you have non-local (=outside the file you're editing) functionality and some integration with external tools I'd wager you're using an IDE of some sort. Then you can argue if that IDE ticks enough of those boxes defining your needs, fair enough. But you can't say something isn't an IDE because it is not an IDE for you. ;) P.S. non-negotiables for me are mostly around that VCS integration. But I acknowledge that other people may not have this need (are fine using the command line for this only).

This applies equally if their own license is MIT or if it's GPL/copyleft. (From that point of view, Microsoft would be able to release VSCode as GPL while also shipping binaries under a proprietary license, if they wanted to.) Things get more complicated when they aren't really the authors because they have merged contributions from other authors, e.g. pull requests.

Someone not reading the full article might even think this implies that VS Code might even \"break apart\" into many open-source forks, which would be a good thing. But the word \"fracture\" is very much meant in a different context here, in that Microsoft does not allow its proprietary extensions to VS Code to be used legally by any third-party fork, and thus can leverage the unique and unstandardized behavior of e.g. its closed-source Pylance Python language server to ensure that no fork can replicate the experience (glitches-as-features and all) that practically all users of VS Code will expect, thus giving forks a Sisyphean challenge to overcome. https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2021/11/05/vscode-... is linked in the OP and discusses the surprise the community felt when VS Code transitioned to Pylance. I'd venture to say that most users of VS Code have no idea how much of their Python editing experience is run by closed-source logic. On one hand, it's a bit frustrating that many people, myself included, switched to VS Code from other IDEs because \"if the community sees a problem, the community has the tools to fix it and will do so.\" But that ceases to be true when the bulk of the IDE's power comes from closed-source language servers that Microsoft could feature-freeze (or deallocate resources from them) at any time, and still have ~years before any community language server could begin to replicate all the edge-case behaviors of their closed-source extensions and gain notoriety as a better alternative to Microsoft's defaults. Is this a bad status quo, though? Microsoft's invested incredible resources in a stellar user experience to date, and might not have done so if it didn't have this strategy in play - a strategy that ensures that no fork will ever be able to capture developer mindshare, and that ensures that the larger Microsoft ecosystem of services will never be disadvantaged or de-promoted by such a fork. As long as leadership desires to continue making this advantage larger and larger, and have Microsoft developers dogfood their own IDE, and thus continue to invest in their language servers, most users will benefit. And sure, some of us will need to keep typing \"# type: ignore\" into our codebases to work around a Pylance bug that nobody can see the code to submit a PR to fix... but we gain so much in return for that inflexibility.

All this moralism about ethos and such is just not that relevant. What matters is that software licenses are legal text documents. The only place where the interpretation of those texts matters is in a court room. I don't think there are a lot of court cases involving VS Code. MS tends to have their house in order on that front. So, VS Code seems safe enough in the legal sense. Yes, it has some extensions that are not licensed as OSS or that are simply closed source. So what? If that bothers you, don't use those. Or better, fix it by creating some open source. Open source is not a right, it's a privilege that is granted to you at the discretion of the creators of that software. Not something that you can demand from them. VS Code is a closed source product that includes lots of OSS components. So much that there's VS Codium a well, which is fully OSS. A lot of those OSS components are used in other products as well. And some of those things are fully open source.

The article makes valid points, if you are an OSS enthusiast. But at the end of the day, you always have the source code and you can always run your marketplace. This costs time and money, but if you believe in the idea you have to invest something and not depend on a mega corporation. If there are proprietary extensions that you can't have that sucks, but again someone can build an OSS one.

To a lot of people this will probably be less obvious than it is to anyone working in a Microsoft heavy enterprise organisation. The VSCode extensions integrate incredibly well with the Microsoft infrastructure you already have when you’re tied into Azure and the Microsoft AI services. It also ties in rather well with both Azure DevOps and GitHub, which are other services you’re then likely to purchase. I don’t mean this as a negative thing as such. It’s just Microsoft being better at selling products to enterprise organisations than anyone else. One of the reasons Azure has grown from around 10% to 25% of the global market share during the previous past 5-10 years while AWS has actually lost its position is simply sales. When AWS first entered Europe they were a lot like Google Cloud, in that even if you were a municipality you would end up in an automated support loop. Then Azure came along and sold the same Microsoft support as they’ve always done, which is basically the best IT business partner you can have as an enterprise organisation, and naturally they won. It’s not like Amazon didn’t notice, a few months after Azure really rolled out we suddenly had an AWS account manager and direct phone support. But by then the ship had sort of sailed because of how Microsoft simply offers great value. Teams is another good example, it was a worse communications platform than what we had at the time, but it was “free” because it was attached to every user license we had, including the cheap educational ones. Almost nobody in non-tech enterprise will spend money on something they get for free, even if the free product takes years to become as good. VSCode is the same. We pay for co-pilot and we pay for a lot of the Azure integrations, because why wouldn’t we? In the giant IT budget heading to Microsoft they are tiny costs which are in the “services” category in the excel sheet that heads for the budget. It is tiny, but when you consider just how many EU enterprise organisations buy these services it’ll amount to millions and for some services billions of revenue for Microsoft. A good way to think of the “new” Microsoft strategy is similar to how cartoons are used to sell toys. You can watch Lego Dreamzzz for free on YouTube because Lego knows it means a lot of people are going to buy their Dreamzzz sets. It’s the same thing with VSCode. On top of that, they’re winning the familiarity game. When you hire a new developer, they’ll want to use what they know, which for many people is VSCode. reply exceptione 9 hours agorootparentAgree with your post, but this gist still doesn´t make much sense to me: > VSCode is build to sell Azure and other Microsoft services, which they won’t if you use VSCodium If corporate has bought into MS, they will use Azure services anyway. So for MS it would not matter if vscodium also integrates well with Azure or has a good .net core debugger, their customers will still bring the whole IT budget to them. Because you are spot on. Corporate buys the whole MS store, only walk the road that MS marketing has blessed and it happily walks into the Azure trap. They outsource IT strategy and planning to MS anyway, and MS names it \"Azure\". reply poincaredisk 11 hours agorootparentprev>What incentive do they have to keep it secret except being evil? Money. Which is OK. Developers need salaries. They need to justify the department budget to bean counters and sales internally. The company you work for is most likely not a charity too. If you want to strictly use free software (as I do), VsCodium is great for everything I need. reply wiseowise 9 hours agorootparentOk, I’ll rephrase: how do they make money with Pylance? reply lozenge 9 hours agorootparentYou can't use Gitpod, Theia IDE, etc with Pylance. Or GitHub Copilot. Or Live Share or numerous other VSCode extensions. The idea is people start a project in VS Code, need to scale up to a reproducible dev environment for multiple users, and follow ads in VSCode to GitHub Codespaces, which charges by the hour for VMs. Now you're locked into that, you're locked into GitHub as well, and they can cross sell you GitHub Actions, GitHub Advanced Security &etc. Therefore, Pyright is almost the minimum needed to add type checking to your CI process. Edit: to clarify, not only is Codespaces advertised in VS Code, it also uses private APIs so no competitor can publish an extension which replicates this functionality on the VSCode marketplace. reply exceptione 8 hours agorootparentLike I wrote here [0], corporate has an azure subscription. All the companies code repositories already live there, including build automation. A capable vscodium isn´t going to eat into Azure baseline. I don´t think MS is after solo hobby devs. For startups they have other incentives to lure them into their ecosystem, like free Azure credits. And that is why open source projects on github are free too. Because the paying organizations depend on the free software ecosystem, build by volunteers in their free time. MS wants control [1] about that nonetheless, because not having that is a risk to their baseline ____ 0. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41695356 1. That is not necessarily harming libre software per se, but keep in mind that MS is only interested into OSS as long as their commercial customers depend on it. reply poincaredisk 9 hours agorootparentprevThey make money with VsCode (by forced, or at least hard to disable, telemetry, ads [1], and probably many other subtle things. Plenty of ways to monetize developer eyeballs). Pylance is just a vehicle to encourage people to use proprietary VsCode instead of open forks like VsCodium. [1] https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/60989 reply maxloh 9 hours agorootparentprev> The funny thing is that I’ll never understand why it’s not open source and why its license prohibits its use in VSCodium. And also the fact that Pyright, the underlying library that powers Pylance, is open source. Microsoft even has a mostly workable demo extension built from it, which is fully open source, published in their marketplace, and receives regular updates. reply rectang 14 hours agoparentprevHmm. Source Available is fine by me so long as it isn't being misrepresented as Open Source in an attempt to sponge off of the goodwill generated by Open Source communities. So I'm not feeling the \"outrage\". And I spent a good portion of my open source advocacy activities on license compliance at the ASF, helping projects to ensure that even with all the bundled dependencies the aggregate licensing of the distributed artifacts complied with the terms of the Apache License Version 2.0. So I'm not feeling that \"silence\" either. What I'm feeling is \"hypocrisy\" being projected onto a straw man by someone who's got an axe to grind with OSI and the Open Source Definition. reply Pannoniae 14 hours agorootparentI concede the last part, it is slightly a soapbox from my part about the OSI. However, it's not really a strawman because these issues are very much linked together. The definition itself is very strict yet not comprehensive - false positives and false negatives are both common. The sentiment that \"VSCode is OSI-compliant so it's morally okay to support it\" is very common, and it's substantially derived from the OSI definition. I do not think that it's an irrelevant issue or that it would be misrepresenting the definition. Is it really free (as in freedom) software when it contains DRM? Is it really open source when critical extensions are unusable if you build the software for yourself? It might meet the definition strictly by the words but in my view, this is not much better than TiVo-isation (when the license is adhered to but the user can't effectively use a modified version) or other shady practices. reply skybrian 14 hours agorootparentNo moral qualms here. There are large pieces of it that are useful without VS Code (for example, the Monaco editor and the language server protocol). Not to mention al the use people get out of it for free. It seems like the good well outweighs the bad. reply Pannoniae 14 hours agorootparent>It seems like the good well outweighs the bad. Oh, I definitely agree. While I don't use the editor (mainly because I prefer full IDEs and not glorified text editors personally) I agree that holistically, the existence of VSC is a net positive to the programming community. My argument comes from a moral perspective - even though the good outweighs the bad, the bad parts are really scummy and need more awareness. Like, my perspective is not utilitarian, it comes from a deontological point of view. I see people and companies get regularly flamed (or even harassed/intimidated) for much smaller things such as the crime of creating their non-OSI-compliant licenses and various related things. In contrast to that, the VS Code ecosystem is much more proprietary, grants much less practical freedoms and operates from a way less clean moral background than any of these projects. Yet, many people are willing to excuse this because Microsoft has figured out a way to implement vendor lock-in without breaching any of the four freedoms in techicality. To me, this is way worse than someone saying \"no we won't let you use our software for anything\"... I am also not a fan of the LSP (good arguments can be found in https://www.michaelpj.com/blog/2024/09/03/lsp-good-bad-ugly....) but that's another topic :) reply rectang 14 hours agorootparent> crime of creating their non-OSI-compliant licenses Just don't call it \"Open Source\" and you won't get nearly as many complaints. The big problem arises when somebody tries to leech off of the goodwill built up by Open Source communities and give their Source Available proprietary offering some FOSS-juice. (Most often VC-backed companies who have failed to understand that \"Open Source is not a business model\"). reply Pannoniae 13 hours agorootparentWell, this thread is getting off-topic real fast but okay, I'll reply :) This argument would make sense from a strictly logical perspective if these were all the facts but the problem is that the expression \"open source\" wayyyy predates the OSI. It's been used in the 80s and the 90s on Usenet and in various places, and it simply meant software which was distributed in source code form. (as opposed to binary form) These pieces of software didn't even have a license file attached to them which was implicitly understood as public domain, or \"do whatever the fuck you want to do with it\". The OSI simply appropriated the term to a narrower, stricter meaning which grants certain freedoms to the user and takes certain freedoms away from the creator. (Such as the freedom to change your mind in licensing! You can't practically change your mind since these are all non-revocable grants) Furthermore, I don't really agree with the \"leeching off the goodwill of OSS\" framing. From a practical perspective as a user, having the source code available is way closer to OSI-licensed software than proprietary, closed-source software. You can view the code of the program, you can usually share your modifications with others (which is technically disallowed but the developers are very unlikely to care as long as you don't resell it), you can fix bugs in it, you can change functionality you don't like. A less-commonly talked about side effect is that if the source is available, the developers are less incentivised to provide user-hostile features, simply because they know that the users can patch it out relatively easily. There's many cases of rugpulls and forced functionality changes in software nowadays and almost all of it is possible because the user can't simply change the code to change the unwanted behaviour but must put up with it instead. Naturally, this is a huge advantage compared to closed-source software. And if a company is willing to share its source code with its users, this should be lauded and encouraged! Obviously, the developers want some benefit from sharing the code, and one of the huge benefits is goodwill by customers. If the developers are not incentivised - but more commonly, harassed and mocked - to share their source but disallow competitors to steal it, in most cases, they will simply not share the code at all, leaving you, as a user, with way less freedom in practical terms. Both you and the company can't really do anything with paper freedoms - you can't really use paper freedoms and the company can't survive if their licensing permits others to profit off their work while discouraging them of doing so. In this view, having more practical freedoms should be encouraged because it helps both the user in having more usable and more modifiable software, and helps the developers not to go bankrupt when Amazon decides to commoditise their offering or something. EDIT: I conflated \"developer\" with \"company\" when writing this post. My apologies. Of course, everything above also applies to natural people who develop software too, not just corporations. I made this mistake because of the subject matter (Microsoft), sorry. reply galaxyLogic 13 hours agorootparent> users can patch it out relatively easily. This applies to the situation where the users are programmers. And I am a programmer. But I have never and probably never will modify any open-source applications I may be using. Too much work. Some library-code perhaps but not a full application (like VSCode). Too easy to cause more errors rather than fixing them, creating a dependency to my own modifications. When it becomes time to upgrade to the next version of such OS software I will need to merge my modifications to the official app or library, and there is no guarantee that my modification would be compatible with the latest version of the said software. If it is not compatible that means either more work for me, or that I can't upgrade. reply growse 11 hours agorootparentYou specific having the time/resources is not the point. The point is that for users with the resources, they have the freedom to do this (either themselves or by hiring someone). \"I don't have the resources to exercise my freedoms\" might be a problem for you, but it's not a problem caused by the freedom or the mechanic granting it. reply galaxyLogic 1 hour agorootparentRight, freedoms are great. But my point is such a freedom is not very valuable to anybody else than programmers, or rich people and companies who can afford to hire them. And even for programmers like me it is not very valuable, especially if we're talking about sw-applications like VSC as opposed to library code. reply growse 1 hour agorootparentThe nice thing about society is that it allows people to come together and pool their resources, in order to achieve an expensive thing that no individual might be able to reasonably afford. I get that nice things that you want are sometimes expensive, but that's just life, isn't it? The world doesn't owe you a cheap-and-easy-to-hack-on piece of software. reply rectang 14 hours agorootparentprevOf course the topic of spirit-vs-letter of Open Source is worth discussing. (I've personally meditated quite a lot on \"open governance\" vs. \"open source\", which is tangential but related). But I think your portrayal of FOSS advocates at large as unconcerned about the spirit vs. letter of open source compliance is wildly inaccurate. If anything FOSS communities discuss such topics obsessively. (How many bits have been spilled onto the internet about TiVo-isation?) Also, see pxc's excellent analysis elsethread for an illustration of the utility of the OSD: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41693457 reply Pannoniae 14 hours agorootparentThank you for your insight, I really appreciate it! >If anything FOSS communities discuss such topics obsessively. I don't see this the same way. Whenever topics like these come up, \"quoting the OSI definition word-by-word\" is a fairly a common moral argument. (See every Mongo/SSPL or ElasticSearch thread on this site and you'll see) While there is definitely discussion of this, you are entirely right, there's a substantial proportion of people (I'm not claiming that it's necessarily the majority or anything - but influential enough to derail or block things) who do not take the spirit of the Free Software movement into account at all. At a glance, many arguments against these licenses don't come from a viewpoint that these licenses violate the spirit of Free Software - they just mechanically quote the OSI freedoms without any critical evaluation or moral reasoning. pxc's analysis is great and morally I definitely agree with it. I don't think that most people agree with it though - which legitimises the VSCode \"open-source\" approach. reply Karellen 10 hours agoparentprev> MS has managed to pacify even the strongest FOSS advocates I'm not sure that's the case.

What is going wrong with the traditional editors and programming tools that (assumably) younger devs are going for those full-blown IDEs? Has the complexity of development with back/front/ops exploded so much that older editors are lagging behind modern needs? As OSS old-timer, I gave VS Code a try, but it was too noisy and distracting, slow, and didn't allow enough control over what was being installed and when. To each their own of course, but I didn't see any particular reason why VS Code is much better or deserves to be more popular than other editors, and if any functionality is missing from other editors – especially those that are incorporating tree-sitter – then maybe we can just improve those alternatives? Talking about modern editors, I like where Zed is headed, but that project also has some non-OSS components or aspirations if I remember right. reply alanbernstein 15 hours agoparentprevIs this comment meant to apply generally to MS behavior? In my experience, MS faces some of the toughest judgment on anything related to OSS. reply Pannoniae 15 hours agorootparentAbsolutely, this is not just a random tangential comment! With a bit of searching, any time criticism of VSCode comes up, it's shrugged off with \"it's OSS!\". Even from people who use Linux, a substantial proportion of programmers bring out the OSS card to deflect criticism of these exploitative practices.

We are not entitled to demand that entities make their software open source, but accusations of deception don't fall under the scope of entitlement. reply jdiez17 11 hours agorootparentI don't think it's deceptive to have an MIT-licensed core editor (which is distributed by MS under a custom license) and proprietary extensions. Like many OSS enthusiasts, I did some initial research on VSCode/VSCodium and decided to install the latter (similar to Chrome/Chromium). As I kept using it I discovered that some MS extensions would refuse to run on VSCodium without workarounds. At that point I was fully aware of the license situation and still decided to switch to VSCode for convenience. My point is that most software developers are capable of understanding how VSCode and its \"useful extensions\" are licensed; it's not a new concept. And from there, each individual can choose what tools they use according to their preferences. reply injidup 10 hours agorootparentprevThere is no claim anywhere that the entire product is open source. This is made up hyperbol. On the vscode landing page they say. \"built on open source\" with a link to where you can clearly read the license. The ONLY thing that is important is the licence. This clarifies that parts of the product are not open source. At this point you can either use the product or not use the product. But as YOU didn't build it or pay for it you have no place to complain. This is the same sense of entitlement that causes people to harass open source maintainers to fix a bug or implement some feature. People want everything for free and are outraged when they find that the world is not so. Yes it is convenient to go to the package manager and find just what you were looking for without having to do any work or commit any contribution but this is a privilege and not a right. It's amazing that any open source exists at all and where it exists we should say thankyou and where it doesn't either button up and pay or build it yourself. reply egeozcan 10 hours agorootparentVast majority of software we use are based on open-source. I'd argue that stating \"built on open source\" is sort of paltering. > But as YOU didn't build it or pay for it you have no place to complain. I disagree with this point. You're conflating legitimate criticism or discussion about the model (which many have differing opinions on) with the harassment of open-source maintainers - something I strongly oppose as well. Could it be that past negative experiences have made you overly defensive?

I covered the outside with thick foam panels cut to size, cementing them in place with copious amounts of spray foam. I shaved the outside to a nice shape with a sawzall and the inside I covered in chicken-fenced, then attached a painters tarp to that (so it could be painted on). To fit on a trailer (the mushroom's cap is 11.5ft wide) the cap comes off the stem and the edges of the cap are two half-moons which have fixed mounting points where threaded rod sticks through some welded washers, and a nut is put on in place. I was too last minute to install the 200 WS2811 pixels and have them run some cool patterns, before the music festival I brought it to came time, but even just a lantern on top (another painters tarp covered the cap's metal-frame, and everything was spray painted) looked great. Super fun project. Expensive, but I learned a lot, got to be creative, and I'm happy to try out new things and make the best of my before-children time.

Just a note your pricing comparison table looks a bit shady. I think you should give either your per year cost compared to the others, or put the document cost on the others. But the way you've done it makes it look like you are tricking people into thinking yours is cheaper. That's just the vibe I'm getting from it. I think that's what you want the takeaway to be there, so I'd suggest updating that slightly. reply sponno 11 hours agorootparentThe others don't do a document cost, so it does make it much harder to compare. The others just have a document limit, eg Docusign has a 100 document limit per user. Docusign has a really high cost per user (I don't charge for users, only for sends). So it is harder to compare apples with apples – at the end of the day GoodSign is just that simple. $1.50 per send, unlimited users : ) I choose 6 – because that's about the typical team size I see with GoodSign. So that feels like a good comparison. Thanks for pointing the pricing out - it really is that terrible! Hence why I built a product I would buy and I could understand. : ) reply linsomniac 10 hours agorootparentI'd agree with @idk1, the pricing comparison is, basically, unusable. Goodsign compares to Docusign at $45/mo * 6 users for $3,240/year, compared to $1.50 for Goodsign. Hard to imagine a team of 6 that send one document per year. If I go to Docusign, they list a $15/mo price (Monthly) per user for 5 documents. Or a price of $3/envelope, which compares favorably to Goodsign. The $45/mo price seems to be for unlimited documents, so that'd be a breakeven of 30 documents per user per month. BUT, Docusign offers significant discounts for paying yearly (hard to imagine a team of 6 that would use a service for just a month), which adjusts the pricing to $2/document for the 5 document plan and breakeven of 17 documents on the unlimited plan. I went to the pricing page to try to get an idea of whether I should suggest my company look at switching to Goodsign, and the page didn't help at all. The pricing page suggests that we're spending around a quarter million dollars a month on Docusign, which I know isn't the case, but without knowing how many documents we send for signing, which I don't know even an order of magnitude off hand, I can't get any idea what sort of ballpark we'd be looking at. reply idk1 8 hours agorootparentprevThat may well be the case, but I think you need to have a look at the design of this pricing grid as it is confusing or not helpful or misleading.

It generally consists of old magazine articles (though not exclusively) that you can pick up at any time and will bring value to your life. I notice most of what we consume on daily basis is ephemeral and not all that valuable outside of the moment, whereas ever-present content is always valuable. The unique angle here is that each article includes a hand-written summary explaining why the article was meaningful to the curator. This gives you a quick window into the piece without being overwhelming. Since this is a free website mostly to be shared with friends and family, I implemented user login via \"phone number\" to save and submit articles, but without a one-time token. So it's \"password-less\" for now; a trust-based system. It's basically 'done' - but I'm not sure that I want to share it publicly for the aforementioned reasons.

(Once you get to an intermediate level of Chinese, you'll want to learn characters anyway, because that's how Chinese is written in the real world.) That said, a hover option to transliterate and translate individual words (instead of the whole sentence at once) would be great. For a more practical complaint, in the Nuenki browser extension, the settings window has a primary-colored (green) button in the bottom right that says \"Log out\", but has no \"Save\" button. I almost clicked \"Log out\" when I just meant to confirm the settings I had made! Edit: Also one question, if I may - how large is the context window for the translations? I noticed that the Chinese it generates sometimes feels a little unidiomatic, but I'm not sure whether that's due to too little context, the fault of the translation engine(s) used, or just my feeling as a non-advanced Chinese learner being off. Edit 2: Some of the translations are definitely just wrong, too. Again, might be the fault of the engines - after all, machine translation, even in the age of LLM, is not perfect. reply zeugmata9 19 hours agoparentprevThis is great!

So far results continue to be good with every model outperforming the market on both absolute and risk-adjusted basis since going live. Since launching https://grizzlybulls.com in January 2022: ModelReturnMax drawdown ------------------- S&P 500 (benchmark)21.51%-27.56% VIX TA Macro MP Extreme64.21%-16.48% VIX TA Macro Advanced| 59.13%-19.12% VIX TA Advanced35.20%-22.96% VIX Advanced33.39%-23.93% VIX Basic24.29%-24.23% TA - Mean Reversion22.30%-19.92% TA - Trend27.07%-24.98% This is an unleveraged, apples to apples comparison. These are not high frequency trading models. Most of them only change signal once every 2-4 weeks on average. During long signals, the models are simply long the S&P 500 and during short signals, they go to cash. One of the pros of this macro swing-trading/hedging style is high tax efficiency, by holding a core ETF long position that never gets sold and then selling S&P 500 futures (ES or MES) of equal value to the ETFs against the long position. This way your account will accumulate unrealized capital gains indefinitely and you'll only pay tax on the net result of successful hedging. The cherry on top is that the S&P 500 futures are section 1256 contracts that are taxed at 60% long term / 40% short term capital gains rates regardless of the duration they are held. The models use a variety of indicators, many of them custom built. Most important are various VIX metrics (absolute level, VIX futures curve shape/slope, divergences against S&P 500 price, etc), trend-following TA metrics (MACD, EMV, etc), mean-reversion TA metrics (Bollinger Bands, CMO, etc), macroeconomic (unemployment, housing starts, leading composite), and monetary policy (yield curve inversion, equity risk premium, dot plot, etc). They've been backtested very cautiously to avoid overfitting to the best of my ability. reply agumonkey 20 hours agoparentI've been curious about doing algotrading for both the data engineering aspect and the quant.

Grizzly Bulls is intended to be a great complement to the buy and hold passive indexing strategy that most people use. The easiest way to use Grizzly Bulls is to hold VOO in any brokerage account, sell it when the model generates a sell signal, and then rebuy it when the model generates the next buy signal. A slightly more advanced but more tax efficient approach would be to open a margin account with futures trading permissions and sell S&P 500 Futures (ES or MES) of equal value to your VOO during sell signals, then repurchase the contracts you sold during the next buy signal. With this method, I've found you can usually reduce your overall tax burden to less than 15% and you'll only owe taxes on the net result of your futures trading. reply angoragoats 33 minutes agorootparentSorry for the total newbie question here -- I'm familiar with options and have traded them a little bit (though that was a long time ago). I've never traded futures before. With your \"more advanced\" approach, can you help me wrap my head around what the possible outcomes are of buying/selling the futures contracts? What is the impact to me if I, for example, hold $100k of VOO in my brokerage account, sell futures amounting to $100k total on a sell signal, and then I'm \"called\" (sorry, don't know what the correct term here is) on my futures? Am I wrong in thinking that I'd be required to cough up $100k or my VOO shares? reply wruza 15 hours agoparentprevThe models use a variety of indicators, many of them custom built Do you run it with good volumes or are these returns “as if”? reply WorkerBee28474 15 hours agorootparent> Do you run it with good volumes or are these returns “as if”?

During buy signals, it's impossible for the models to outperform as they are long the S&P 500. During sell signals, they are in cash with the hopes of rebuying lower (doesn't always work out as they are of course imperfect). When the market is rising with low volatility, there aren't as many opportunities for outperformance. reply octopod12 14 hours agoparentprevwont your strategies incur short-term cap gains ? so, they will have to outperform the S&P 500 index to account for it. great start, and good luck. reply pyrrhotech 6 hours agorootparentYes, but that's why the preferred method of implementation is using the S&P 500 futures (ES and MES) as the hedging tool during sell signals. With this method, you hold your preferred ETFs/stocks of choice forever and continue to accumulate unrealized gains indefinitely. Then on sell signals, you sell ES and MES of equivalent value to your long holdings to effectively go market neutral. At the end of each year, you'll only owe taxes on the net result of your hedging with futures, and futures are section 1256 contracts so they are taxed as 60% long term gains / 40% short term gains regardless of holding period. In practice, I've found that this usually works out to an effective capital gains tax of less than 15% of annual profits. If a strategy returns a gross 30%, then the after-tax return would be about 25.5%. Also, if you implement in a retirement account which many of our members do, capital gains are irrelevant. reply bdjsiqoocwk 10 hours agorootparentprevYou have a point, but it still makes sense to report before tax performance. Before tax performance depends on model only, but after tax performance depends on model and the user. this website couldn't report that even if it wanted. reply mmcool 4 hours agoprevA marketplace that makes booking a hair transplant overseas easier!

Much of what I worried about prepping for was far easier to do once you actually have the issue at your feet but you have time. reply kelnos 10 hours agoparentprevOn the topic of cat freedom... I had the opposite problem. A few years ago, for a while I had to separate our two cats so they wouldn't fight while we weren't home (long story, but we couldn't let them fight each other like most cats will do for fun, due to some medical reasons). It was basically impossible. I wanted to set it up so one cat could be downstairs, and the other upstairs, so one wouldn't feel like they were being \"punished\", by being closed in a bedroom and only having that small area to roam in. I built a \"gate\" for the top of our stairwell, the height of the railing, out of carboard and some pet-safe window screen material. First one of the cats managed to wriggle under it, so I reinforced it and gave it a \"skirt\". Then the other cat climbed up the screen mesh, and I found her just sitting there, perched on top of it. Eventually I managed to make it sturdy enough. But then one of the cats realized he could jump over it. I mostly gave up after that, and focused on training him not to fight with his little sister. So this is a long winded way of saying: your cat might not really be bothered by things like baby gates. Might actually view them as a fun challenge to be (fairly easily) overcome. Unless of course your cat is older and/or has mobility issues. reply milquen 8 hours agorootparentYeah, my cat is getting older and a total wimp at jumping over things.

There are some electronic Catan builds out there, but I found them really expensive -- e.g. opting for a smartwatch screen + microcontroller for every game tile (of which there are 19). Beautiful, yes -- but not my style. Instead, I went for 8-segment displays for numeric tile values, and RGB LEDs to display terrain types. It adds up to 342 LEDs to control for the full board, from a single central microcontroller. When you turn it on, it sets up the board for you. Pressing a central button \"rolls the dice\", and it will flash the tiles that produce resources as per the game rules. Or cue special actions on certain rolls. I really enjoy cost-optimizing prototypes, so this was good fun. I got it down to about USD 20 for a single, ready-to-play unit, including solid brass game pieces (it helps that I'm in Asia). I still use the deck of cards from Catan for now, but plan to replace it with something sci-fi themed. Maybe \"Asteroid Miners\". The only thing I'm not 100% satisfied with is that the board is a little cramped -- it's a bit over half the size of the original Catan board. The PCBs had to fit within 100mx100mm -- I used a bit of a weird PCB geometry so that the board is composed of 3 identical subunits, rotated a few degrees to maximize it's surface area within a 100mm square. I'm not planning to sell it. I just had a slow month, so it's a good time to learn to do new things. I never make any money with hardware, but I love how whimsical electronics can brighten someone's day.

It was on the roadmap for my stab at a recipe site: https://osomatsu.net It seems such a shame to forego a literal dinner-fork as an icon for the feature though? :) reply azthecx 7 hours agoparentprevI would actually use this, but I am unsure of it's pricing model and ease of backup. Perhaps I missed it somewhere. Good mobile support on my device. Two suggestions: - automatically convert units?, eg IP from Europe assume grams on some setting, convert {Rice}(2 cups) to grams when rendered - On the timer feature, create a timer (non popup) on the rendered section so I can just one press it to track time for me without changing apps / browser tabs reply woile 6 hours agorootparentThanks for the feedback! Those features are in my roadmap, but I go at a slow rate next to my work. You'll probably see the timer before the unit conversion, as it's actually a hard problem. Did you know there's a US cup and a british cup (actually a few more)?? The problem may involve tracking the origin of the recipe if no lang is provided, or setting some defaults. On the backup side, the easiest thing I'm introducing soon, is a \"raw\" button, where you can see the recipe raw, and you can download the `.recp` file. In the future, I'd like to have: - Export all recipes and favorites - And in case I give up with the platform: an obsidian integration, or a some kind of desktop app. So just to be clear, I do want to have an escape hatch, even if the website doesn't succeed, I will still use the language. But, it's not my main priority at the moment. Regarding the pricing model, I just don't see myself charging for a subscription. I've been thinking how to create a sustainable product. So far, what I have is a potential affiliate program. I want to use the recipe's materials to link to products. I think this is relative nonintrusive, and it's actually useful, because I've found myself reading a recipe and not knowing what something was, like a proofing basket, for example. Let me know your thoughts. reply skypanther 4 hours agorootparentMaybe export to Recipe ML[1] for a relatively portable backup format. 1. http://www.formatdata.com/recipeml/ reply woile 4 hours agorootparentI do have a recipe language already, see the spec: https://github.com/reciperium/recipe-lang/blob/main/spec.md The main problem is how I allocate my personal time to add this feature. Is quite some work, and prioritizing people leaving, instead of some other features, doesn't seem good use of my time.

I’ve been working on building an open system around that idea, integrating with Godot.

And while some would argue HN isn't social media, I would disagree; I'd argue most of what makes HN so popular is the commenters.

I impulsively check it when I'm bored and find myself wasting time in long comment threads that over the years I have found more and more pessimistic. Still far better than Reddit, but the pessimism gets to me to a point where I can't help but feel jaded.

    "originBody": "Kris Kristofferson, Songwriter Whose Poetic Lyrics Transcended Genre, Dead at 88 The country singer, actor, Rhodes scholar, soldier, and heartthrob epitomized the American Renaissance man BY STEPHEN L. BETTS SEPTEMBER 29, 2024 Kris Kristofferson MICHAEL OCHS ARCHIVES/GETTY IMAGES AS THE SONGWRITER of legendary compositions like “Help Me Make It Through the Night,” “Sunday Mornin’ Comin’ Down,” and “Me and Bobby McGee,” Kris Kristofferson transformed lyrics into literature, elevating the craft to a legitimate American art form in a way few had done before. Part Romantic poet, part folk troubadour, part country-music storyteller, Kristofferson died Saturday at the age of 88. A spokesperson for Kristofferson, Ebie McFarland, confirmed the musician’s death, adding that the “artist, singer, songwriter, actor and activist … passed away peacefully in his home in Maui, Hawaii … surrounded by family.” A cause of death was not immediately available. Songwriting was merely one aspect to the Renaissance man, who was also a Golden Globe-winning actor, Golden Gloves boxer, Rhodes scholar, author, U.S. Army veteran, pilot, and onetime record-label janitor. But it was his penetrating lyricism that caused a seismic shift in the perception of country music by the late Sixties. Well-educated (with a military discipline) though he was, he quickly fell in with the freshman class of “outlaw” singer-songwriters that would buck the star system and influence generations to come. The eldest of three children, Kristoffer Kristofferson was born June 22, 1936, in Brownsville, Texas. His father, Lars, the son of a Swedish army veteran, was a pilot and a major general in the U.S. Air Force who went on to work for Pan American Airways. The family moved frequently, settling in San Mateo, California, when Kristofferson was in junior high. A model student who earned the nickname “Straight Arrow,” he graduated from high school in San Mateo in 1954, and went on to study creative writing at Pomona College, winning several prizes in a short-story contest sponsored by Atlantic Monthly magazine. Graduating Phi Beta Kappa in 1958, he received a Rhodes scholarship to England’s Oxford University. Although intent on becoming a novelist, Kristofferson concentrated his studies on the poetry of William Blake, and penned and performed his first songs while studying at Oxford’s Merton College. In England, he cut his first singles (credited to “Kris Carson”) for Top Rank Records, although they went unreleased at the time. After earning a master’s degree in English literature from Oxford in 1960, Kristofferson, who planned to resume his studies there, flew home to California for Christmas break. Reuniting with an old girlfriend, Fran Beir, the couple married and had a daughter, Tracy, and a son, Kris. Instead of returning to Oxford, Kristofferson enlisted in the Army. EDITOR’S PICKS The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 250 Greatest Guitarists of All Time The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time 25 Most Influential Creators of 2024 Kristofferson served as a helicopter pilot while in the Army and attained the rank of captain. During a three-year tour in West Germany (with his wife and daughter in tow), he organized a band, learning the Bob Dylan songs as recorded by Peter, Paul, and Mary (his band’s Dobro player gave him the folk trio’s LPs). On leave in the spring of 1965, Kristofferson took his first trip to Nashville. He had been tapped for a position teaching English literature at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point after leaving West Germany, but his two weeks in Nashville scuttled that plan. He became enamored of the songwriting circle, befriending songwriter and music publisher Marijohn Wilkin (“The Long Black Veil”), Bobby Bare (“Detroit City”), and producer Cowboy Jack Clement. “I came down to Nashville,” Kristofferson told Rolling Stone in 2009. “I’d been playing in an Army band, so people introduced me around like I was somebody. Everybody still called me ‘Captain.’ And I wrote seven, maybe 11 songs that first week. I thought if I didn’t make it as a songwriter I would at least get material to be the Great American Novelist. The people and places I was seeing were more exciting than anything I’d ever come across.” Kristofferson and his family settled in Nashville, where he continued to write songs. He took a job as janitor at Columbia Recording Studios (“Emptying ashtrays and sweeping floors,” he described it), in addition to working as a part-time helicopter pilot flying back and forth between offshore oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. A story about how he once landed his helicopter in Johnny Cash’s yard to give the country star his demo tape would become country-music apocrypha. RELATED Margo Price on Kris Kristofferson: He ‘Didn’t Play by Anyone Else’s Rules’ That Time Kris Kristofferson Played a Singing Han Solo in a Campy 'Star Wars' Spoof Kristofferson’s marriage to Fran began to crumble, and when their son developed health problems, the couple faced thousands of dollars in medical bills. The financial strain took its toll, and Kristofferson’s wife left with the children to live in California while he continued to pursue music. That career path didn’t sit well with Kristofferson’s mother, who sent him a letter telling him he was throwing his life away by writing songs and idolizing Cash. Kristofferson and Cash later shared a laugh together when Clement showed Cash that infamous letter. “It’s always great to get a letter from home, isn’t it, Kris?” Cash joked. In 1967, Kristofferson recorded his debut single as a performer, “Golden Idol,” which promptly flopped. His songwriting, however, took off, and his songs landed on the charts via artists like Roy Drusky (“Jody and the Kid”), Billy Walker (“From the Bottle to the Bottom”), Ray Stevens (“Sunday Mornin’ Comin’ Down”), Jerry Lee Lewis (“Once More With Feeling”), Faron Young (“Your Time’s Comin'”), and Roger Miller (“Me and Bobby McGee,” “Best of All Possible Worlds,” “Darby’s Castle”). By the end of the Sixties, as the folk scene was fading in New York, Kristofferson played the Bitter End in Greenwich Village, where luminaries including Bob Dylan saw him perform. Kristofferson was one of Nashville’s most in-demand songwriters, but he was still just getting started. In 1969, Carl Perkins gave up a prime opening slot for Cash so that Kristofferson could make his Newport Folk Festival debut, with Cash introducing him. The Man in Black also let him hang around backstage at his weekly ABC show, which was being filmed at Nashville’s Ryman Auditorium. There, Kristofferson mingled with artists and hustled his songwriting demos. By the turn of the decade, a whirlwind of recognition as both a songwriter and artist was underway. Signed by Fred Foster to Monument Records in 1970, Kristofferson released his eponymous LP, which featured new originals as well as some of his familiar hits for other artists. Although a Top 10 chart hit, the LP was otherwise unsuccessful. After his sophomore release, 1971’s The Silver Tongued Devil and I, sold more briskly, Kristofferson’s debut album was rereleased as Me & Bobby McGee, capitalizing on the success of the title song, a posthumous Number One pop hit for Janis Joplin. Kristofferson and Joplin shared her house in Mill Valley, California, for a while, where jam sessions with fellow musicians, actors, and others were commonplace. (He played the Isle of Wight Festival in the summer of 1970, sharing the final day’s bill with Jimi Hendrix, who would die from an overdose just a few weeks later.) In 1970, Ray Price released his countrypolitan recording of Kristofferson’s “For the Good Times,” which helped the composition win the Academy of Country Music’s Song of the Year. Cash’s version of “Sunday Mornin’ Comin’ Down” secured the Song of the Year award that same year from the Country Music Association. Kristofferson’s double win for Song of the Year in 1970 marked the only time a single individual has ever won the same award from the ACM and CMA in the same year for two different songs. Dozens of artists as diverse as Jerry Lee Lewis, Joe Simon, and Patti Page continued to cut his songs, and Kristofferson would earn several Grammy nominations and win three trophies over his life, including Best Country Song for “Help Me Make It Through the Night” in 1971. A track from his second LP, the nostalgic “Lovin’ Her Was Easier (Than Anything I’ll Ever Do Again)” was a Top Five Adult Contemporary hit, marking his highest chart entry up to that point as a solo artist. The tune also reached the pop Top 30. Simultaneous to his commercial breakthrough in music, Kristofferson made his film debut in Dennis Hopper’s 1971 film The Last Movie. A commercial and critical disaster, it was followed by the lead role in Cisco Pike, which also starred Gene Hackman, Karen Black, and musician Doug Sahm. In 1973, Kristofferson married his second wife, singer Rita Coolidge, and the couple had a daughter, Casey. His film work continued with an appearance in Cash’s The Gospel Road: A Story of Jesus, and he played an unemployed musician in Blume in Love. His role as Billy in Sam Peckinpah’s Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, which also starred Bob Dylan, earned Kristofferson a BAFTA award nomination for Most Promising Newcomer. In 1974, he co-starred with Ellen Burstyn in the Oscar-winning Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore, directed by Martin Scorsese. But two of Kristofferson’s most noteworthy early film roles were surrounded by publicity that somewhat obscured his exceptional performances. A controversial Playboy spread with co-star Sarah Miles accompanied the erotic 1976 drama The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With the Sea. That same year, he shared the screen with Barbra Streisand in the rock & roll reboot of A Star Is Born. The third-most profitable film of the year, it was nonetheless savaged by critics, with Streisand and Kristofferson’s volatile on-set clashes becoming the stuff of Hollywood legend. By the end of the Seventies, Kristofferson had released nine solo albums with varying critical results. His first two LPs were buoyed by the ubiquity of their material and feature two of the most iconic lines in popular music: “Freedom’s just another word for nothin’ left to lose,” from “Me and Bobby McGee,” and “He’s a walkin’ contradiction, partly truth and partly fiction,” from “The Pilgrim, Chapter 33,” written about some of his comrades, including Cash and Hopper. Border Lord, his third album, was largely a commercial disappointment. His fourth release in a two-and-a-half-year period, Jesus Was a Capricorn, surfaced in November 1972, with a title cut that borrowed its melody from John Prine’s “Grandpa Was a Carpenter.” After several failed singles, Kristofferson earned his first — and only — country hit and his bestselling pop single as a solo artist: Inspired by both Larry Gatlin’s “Help Me” and an altar call while visiting a church with country singer Connie Smith at a desperately low point in his life, Kristofferson’s “Why Me” reached Number One on the country chart and spent 19 weeks on the pop survey as well, becoming one of the bestselling singles of the year. Between duet albums with his wife Coolidge, Kristofferson released the 1974 LP Spooky Lady’s Sideshow, with several tracks chronicling the trappings of fame and addiction, mirroring his mounting battle with alcohol. He quit drinking after his Golden Globe-winning turn in A Star Is Born. Kristofferson’s film career would continue over the next four decades, with Peckinpah directing him again in 1978’s Convoy. His next big-screen role was in 1980’s Heaven’s Gate, one of the most notorious box-office and critical flops of its time. Kristofferson would team with his longtime friend Willie Nelson for the 1984 film Songwriter, but a much more successful venture would emerge the following year as the two pals joined Cash and Waylon Jennings to record and tour as the Highwaymen. The supergroup would record Jimmy Webb’s “Highwayman,” which became Kristofferson’s second and final Number One country hit. Kristofferson’s politically charged 1986 LP, Repossessed, his first solo project in five years, was highlighted by “They Killed Him,” a tribute to Gandhi, Jesus, and Martin Luther King Jr., which Dylan would later cover. Kristofferson continued to raise social awareness and address political causes throughout his career, beginning with a 1972 concert benefiting Cesar Chavez and United Farm Workers. In the Eighties, he traveled to Nicaragua and controversially criticized the U.S. involvement in the Contras’ attempts to overthrow the country’s ruling Sandinista National Liberation Front. His Central American activism inspired the 1990 concept album, Third World Warrior. “Not everybody agrees with what I’m saying,” Kristofferson told left-leaning magazine The Progressive in 1991. “But my shows are set up so, from beginning to end, the feeling is a belief in the human spirit. I don’t think you could come and argue with the principles. By the end of the show, the crowds always seem to be on their feet.” Late-career solo albums included A Moment of Forever, in 1995, and The Austin Sessions, a 1999 collection of stripped-down versions of some of his best-known tunes with guest appearances from Alison Krauss, Steve Earle, and Mark Knopfler. These were followed by a trio of reflective LPs: This Old Road (2006), Closer to the Bone (2009), and Feeling Mortal (2013). In 2016, he released The Cedar Creek Sessions, a two-disc collection of his past songs rerecorded in Austin. Eric Church, who titled his one-man show after Kristofferson’s song “To Beat the Devil,” praised the songwriter as “the ultimate life well lived” in a social media post. “Thank you for being a beacon of light in a darkening world. You were my hero and my role model. And even then, you managed to exceed my expectations when you became my friend.” “Kris helped me to believe in myself as a songwriter when I was a boy,” Lukas Nelson shared on social media, along with a photo of Kristofferson holding him when they “first met” while he was a baby. “Other than my father, he was my greatest inspiration. He embodied humility and kindness, and carried his grace into his words and music with unique eloquence.” “What a great loss, what a great writer. What a great actor, what a great friend,” Dolly Parton said in a statement. “I will always love you.” Of his later films, Kristofferson will perhaps be best remembered for his role as a sadistic sheriff in John Sayles’ 1996 masterful crime drama Lone Star, which was followed by appearances in the Blade trilogy and 1998’s A Soldier’s Daughter Never Cries, a fictionalized account of the life of From Here to Eternity author James Jones. Kristofferson acted in more than 50 films over the next two decades, including Bloodworth, Dolphin Tale, and Blaze, director Ethan Hawke’s 2018 biopic of songwriter Blaze Foley that would be Kristofferson’s final onscreen role. But it’s his role in A Star Is Born with which he’s most identified. Following news of his death, Streisand recalled the moment she realized she wanted Kristofferson for the film. “The first time I saw Kris performing at the Troubadour club in L.A. I knew he was something special. Barefoot and strumming his guitar, he seemed like the perfect choice for a script I was developing, which eventually became A Star Is Born,” she wrote on Twitter. “For my latest concert in 2019 at London’s Hyde Park, I asked Kris to join me on-stage to sing our other A Star Is Born duet, ‘Lost Inside Of You.’ He was as charming as ever, and the audience showered him with applause. It was a joy seeing him receive the recognition and love he so richly deserved.” Kristofferson quietly announced his retirement from touring, recording, and acting in January 2021. In 1970, he bought property in Hana, a secluded town on the Hawaiian island of Maui. In addition to his three older children, Kristofferson raised five children with his third wife, Lisa Meyers. As Kristofferson began suffering from memory loss later in his life (which he ultimately attributed to Lyme disease), Meyers became indispensable, traveling with her husband and helping him navigate interviews. When he was saluted with an all-star concert in 2017 as the guest performer on the 2020 Outlaw Country Cruise (his final full performance), Meyers was by his side. She balked at calling herself Kristofferson’s manager though. “He’s unmanageable. You can’t manage him,” she told Rolling Stone. “Even if someone tells him to have a good day, he’ll say, ‘Don’t tell me what to do.'” TRENDING Kris Kristofferson, Songwriter Whose Poetic Lyrics Transcended Genre, Dead at 88 Trump Suggests Giving Cops 'One Really Violent Day' to Stop Crime He Played with the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and the Who — A New Documentary Tells His Story ‘The Ellen Show’ Staffers Say Ellen DeGeneres’ New Netflix Special ‘Missed the Mark’ But that stubborn streak also helped Kristofferson achieve such artistic heights. He was uncompromising in his songwriting, his acting, and onstage, where he’d strum his guitar, play harmonica, and sing in his infamously craggy voice. “I don’t think I’m that good a singer,” he told Rolling Stone. “I can’t think of a song that I’ve written that I don’t like the way somebody else sings it better.” Still, for all his trailblazing, he was also content to allow fate and his spirituality to guide him. “I really have no anxiety about controlling my own life,” Kristofferson told Rolling Stone in 2016. “Somehow I just slipped into it and it’s worked. It’s not up to me — or you. I feel very lucky that [life]’s lasted so long because I’ve done so many things that could have knocked me out of it. But somehow I just always have the feeling that He knows what He’s doing.” IN THIS ARTICLE: Kris Kristofferson, obit, Obituary MUSIC MUSIC COUNTRY",

    "originBody": "Software Operating Systems Linux The Arch Linux team is now working directly with Valve — SteamOS and Arch should both benefit greatly News By Christopher Harper published 29 September 2024 SteamOS is built on top of Arch, and Valve is now providing a build service infrastructure and secure signing enclave for Arch. Comments (6) When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. (Image credit: Arch Linux) The Arch Linux team has announced on its public mailing list that it will be entering into a direct collaboration with Valve. This is a big deal for several reasons, but let's start with why and how it happened. If you're familiar with Valve and Steam Deck, you may already know that the Deck uses SteamOS 3, which is built on top of Arch Linux. Thanks to the Arch Linux base and Valve's development of the Proton compatibility layer for playing Windows games on Linux, we now have a far improved Linux gaming scene, especially on Valve's Steam Deck and Deck OLED handhelds. While Valve's specific reasons for picking Arch Linux for Steam Deck remain unknown, it's pretty easy to guess why it was picked. Mainly, it's a particularly lightweight distribution maintained since March 2002, which lends itself well to gaming with minimal performance overhead. A more intensive Linux distribution may not have been the ideal base for SteamOS 3, which is targeted at handhelds like Steam Deck first. As primary Arch Linux developer Levente Polyak discloses in the announcement post, \"Valve is generously providing backing for two critical projects that will have a huge impact on our distribution: a build service infrastructure and a secure signing enclave. By supporting work on a freelance basis for these topics, Valve enables us to work on them without being limited solely by the free time of our volunteers.\" Polyak continues, \"This opportunity allows us to address some of the biggest outstanding challenges we have been facing for a while. The collaboration will speed up the progress that would otherwise take much longer for us to achieve, and will ultimately unblock us from finally pursuing some of our planned endeavors [...] We believe this collaboration will greatly benefit Arch Linux, and are looking forward to share further development on the mailing list as work progresses.\" These quotes go to show how bigger corporations like Valve can still be a helpful, desirable influence in the FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) community. While the rules of FOSS dictate that Valve was under no obligation whatsoever to give back to the community in any way, it's had a great track record so far through Proton and is now directly funding the continued development of Arch Linux, which forms the foundation of its own SteamOS 3 operating system. It's true that volunteers in FOSS make that part of the tech world go round, but it's always nice when these projects can actually afford to pay people to get the work that needs to be done for the rest of our enjoyment. In the long-term, the funding touted should, at minimum, allow Arch Linux to improve the security of its distribution and provide more structured releases compared to its current near-continuous update cycle. This could also lead to greater long-term improvements and feature additions, perhaps even ones that will benefit SteamOS 3 and its gaming performance, but for now, that part remains in the air.

As for the DRM, isn't Windows recently making some security change that would prevent those schemes from working? If I find out what it was, I'll report back. Reply ezst036 I sincerely hope Valve releases official Steam OS 3 ISO files for general use. That's really the final piece. Reply thestryker This seems like a relatively affordable way for Valve to set the groundwork for a potential wider release of SteamOS. While I don't particularly have any interest in giving up Windows for my primary machine due to the varied workloads and my laziness I'd love for SteamOS to be a simple viable alternative. It's something I'd absolutely use on secondary machines that don't really get used outside of basic tasks and gaming.

A more intensive Linux distribution may not have been the ideal base for SteamOS 3, which is targeted at handhelds like Steam Deck first. I am not sure Arch is going to be faster for gaming than any other distro, but I can see why Valve picked it for a minimalist base. Another reason I am sure they picked it is that it is smaller and less commercial than others (such as Debain or Ubuntu) and they would have more ability to influence the project. > In the long-term, the funding touted should, at minimum, allow Arch Linux to improve the security of its distribution and provide more structured releases compared to its current near-continuous update cycle. This was literally the stated reason they moved from Debian in 2021, because they preferred rolling releases. [1] [1] https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heres-why-steamos-switched-... reply noirscape 7 hours agoparentI think the pick for Arch makes a lot of sense if you consider the big players in the ecosystem: * Debian habitually ships ancient versions of software unless you setup backports. It's also by far the distro that makes the most downstream modifications to software, which causes issues with upstream. * Ubuntu is a semi-rolling (basically, a stable copy every 9 months) release of Debian + Backports with a Canonical skin and nice branding. Cute, but it inherits the same problems that Debian has. * Fedora is fine, but it's also very beholden to Red Hat. Whilst Red Hat going IBM squeeze mode occurred after Valve picked a distro, the ties it has to Red Hat are a problem for Valve, considering their Linux push was always defined by not wanting to be tied as heavily to a third-party vendor (it almost entirely originates from Microsoft blowing their left foot off with Windows 8 and the Microsoft Store being both awful and a direct competitor to Valve; Gabe Newell is an ex-Microsoft employee, he probably recognized the direction MS is going in). Also, major system upgrades with Fedora aren't exactly the greatest process; they work, but since they're inheriting the CentOS structure, Fedora isn't really build around that sort of thing. I've always had to do manual checkups on key software when using Fedora. By contrast Arch has a policy to \"ship as close to upstream as possible\" (even in cases where it's weird; last I checked, their nano still has the bad word wrap that nano is known for), pushes out updates extremely quickly and is a non-profit. With Valve having their own button on the upgrade process, they can also ensure that you don't get some of the more typical \"hilarity\" of running Syu and realizing your drivers made it so you ended up in an emergency shell mode. Other distros just don't have the installbase to guarantee consistent support (everything on distrowatch) or are too inaccessible for regular users (aka \"why not NixOS\" -> because NixOS actively requires you to ignore almost every online resource and to only use the NixOS provided documentation since nothing else on the planet works the way NixOS does. Gentoo also is in this category, since most people that own a Steam Deck probably aren't looking to custom compile everything.) reply woleium 5 hours agorootparentMinor nit pick, but gentoo has had binary downloads since dec 2023 and has supported binary updates for years https://www.gentoo.org/news/2023/12/29/Gentoo-binary.html reply codedokode 8 hours agoparentprevWhat I don't like about Debian is that they have several names for releases which are difficult to remember (for example, a distribution can be called \"Bookworm\" and \"stable\" at the same time and later it is not \"stable\" anymore). It would be much easier if they just used numbers everywhere and added names in brackets. reply jeroenhd 7 hours agorootparentDebian also has version numbers (11, 12, 13) but people prefer the names releases for some reason. I don't mind the names too much, and I don't even mind the moving \"stable\" name, but I do get confused because Debian's names don't necessarily increment. Ubuntu made the smart decision to make their names alphabetical and that helps tremendously when you're trying to guess how recent a particular version is. reply sph 1 hour agorootparentUbuntu alphabetical names help if you keep up with it. I can name various releases of the past, like debian, and don't know which is the latest one. reply night862 9 hours agoparentprevAbout releases: They typically refer to the OS version or base in these rolling distros such as Fedora. Rolling releases aren't all like Sid. In Fedora, there is a base OS version with a sort of configuration, specif directory structure, major architectural versions of software (like Gnome or KDE), sometimes cryptographic policy, or other system backends such as logging or DNS resolution. Fedora used its release cycle to migrate to systemd-resolved, to pick an example, because this change introduced structural changes to the way the system operated. In the release in question, system services leverage the D-Bus API to get DNS lookups, systemd binds to the local port. By segregating this behavior by release, it makes the dependency tree much simpler to manage at the cost of possibly needing to backport patches, but Distributions are doing much more than shipping mostly upstream packages like Arch is. I always thought arch would be well suited to this sort of thing. Arch Build System is very good, and since packages are very close to upstream, it would be very easy to make your own ABS repo as it stands. It is very similar to the ports tree, arch linux has very little flavor in many respects. reply Timber-6539 9 hours agorootparentFedora isn't a rolling distro the way Arch is. And even Arch while popularly known as a rolling release distro doesn't entirely live up to this ethos. Python 3.12 & Gnome release delays just to give an example. Fedora has something that resembles Arch as a rolling distro. Their unstable branch for development which they call Fedora Rawhide. That said you wouldn't be wrong to call Arch a rolling release distro because it is one for the most part. reply majewsky 8 hours agorootparentYou are working off an unusual definition of \"rolling release\". A rolling release just means that there are no major version bumps that require an active opt-in when upgrading. And besides, the behavior of Fedora Rawhide can easily be achieved in Arch Linux by just adding the [testing] repo that's already prepared (but commented out) in your /etc/pacman.conf reply Timber-6539 6 hours agorootparent> A rolling release just means that there are no major version bumps that require an active opt-in when upgrading. Indeed. However IMO this definition is not complete without taking into account the matching status of upstream software versions available and package versions made available by the distro at any given point in time. This is the continuous delivery expected and what gives a distro rolling status among its peers. reply NekkoDroid 3 hours agorootparentprev> Python 3.12 & Gnome release delays just to give an example. GNOME updates usually come when the packagers have time, latest this usually is the .1 release. 47 for example was available like a few days after the official release, if not a day or so after (I didn't check specific dates, but that was when I updated). With other software it usually depends on if dependencies can work with the new version. LLVM is a major package that always is like 1 release behind due to stuff that depend on it not being updated for the new version. And shipping multiple of a single package is something they try to avoid. reply heftig 8 hours agoparentprevThe main reason they picked Arch is the rolling release model with updates from upstream projects they work with landing quickly and continuously. So yes, TH's speculation is just off the mark here. reply seba_dos1 3 hours agorootparent...so they picked a rolling release distro to take snapshots of and distribute outdated versions to their users. Plasma in SteamOS 3.6 (current beta) is still at version 5.27, just like in Debian stable. The main reason they switched were PKGBUILDs. Debian packaging, while much more powerful, requires more effort, and yet they weren't going to reap its fruits as their distro gets fully reinstalled on each update anyway. Nothing else matters much for their particular use-case. If it was about fresher base system, they could have gone with snapshots of sid instead, which would have been easier as previous SteamOS versions were already Debian-based. reply benterix 8 hours agoparentprev> they picked it is that it is smaller and less commercial than others (such as Debain or Ubuntu) I agree with you, just nitpicking: it is smaller than some (like Debian) and less commercial than others (like Ubuntu). reply maxloh 7 hours agoparentprevHow about Alpine?

It would've probably lead to massive confusion due to users not getting the \"nix-way\" and it seems like easy hack-ability is part of the steam-decks value proposition. reply whazor 7 hours agorootparentWhile I agree that Nix is not user friendly, Nix would allow more hack-ability than the current Arch approach. The Steamdeck modifications often get broken in updates, because the Steamdeck software is an image that is managed by Valve. Meanwhile, with Nix I think it would be easier to maintain modifications, as you could layer them on top of each other. Also, most Steamdeck users: - Don’t modify their Steamdeck - Use Flatpak, which works on Nix - Run an install script from the internet, such as DeckyLoader, Emudeck.

GPU drivers are still a bit of a pain to non technical users outside of PopOS. They need to \"just work\" transparently to the user or they'll just leave for Windows. And game devs tend to use a premade engine - that engine needs to have good support for both Windows and Unix, or they will just default to the bigger market: Windows. So that's another important driver in migration to Unix.

There are severe costs to doing so. reply onli 9 hours agorootparentAre there some benchmarks for that, or a good discussion somewhere? Because I was wondering about that myself. RT kernel sounds at first like it may help achieve better latency in games, but then you are so deep in the stack and depending on overall performance, that the costs of RT mode might hurt much more than one would gain. But I don't really know how that plays out in practice. reply BlarfMcFlarf 8 hours agorootparentI don’t know. My understanding though is that RT Linux adds predicability at the cost of throughput. For games where CPU throughput isn’t important (like an action game where most of the work is pushed off onto the GPU) this would maybe help. Someone could certainly try. But for other games like many strategy games and simulations where the CPU is a limiting factor, there would likely be a cost. The problem is that it’s not a free win, and games are very varied. But theoretically, on something like a console, you could offer choice. reply pdpi 8 hours agorootparentprevMy understanding is that real-time isn't so much about lower latency (though that is also desirable), but rather about predictable, bounded latency. For the purposes of gaming, no amount of predictability at the kernel level will reduce the amount of work you need to perform to draw a frame, and that is the real limiting factor for most games. reply murderfs 7 hours agorootparent> For the purposes of gaming, no amount of predictability at the kernel level will reduce the amount of work you need to perform to draw a frame, and that is the real limiting factor for most games. It all depends on what you're trying to optimize for. You can maximize raw framerate numbers by having an unlimited frame queue depth, but it'll feel like shit because you won't have even frame pacing and your input latency will vary wildly. The ideal scenario in gaming is for your draw time to be perfectly deterministic, and be able to schedule things so you can read input and do your render calls just before vsync. reply the8472 9 hours agorootparentprevI assume the realtime patches brought some improvements you'll get even without compiling a hard realtime kernel.

We (Arch) do not support multiple architectures for the simple reason that it would imply I'd need to watch N number of builds of one package pr architecture. This is what we did for the 32bit version and 64bit version. That's a lot of wasted time, and doesn't help you sell architecture support.

      "This collaboration aims to enhance Arch's security and structured releases, aligning with Valve's need for a flexible, up-to-date system for the Steam Deck, despite concerns about the rolling release model's stability for production systems."

(benn.substack.com)159 points by herbertl 19 hours agohidepastfavorite153 comments bhouston 3 hours agoI think we are in the middle of a steep S-curve of technology innovation. It is far from plateauing and there are still a bunch of major innovations that are likely to shift things even further. Interesting time and these companies are riding a wild wave. It is likely some will actually win big, but most will die - similar to previous technology revolutions. The ones that win will win not just on technology, but on talent retention, business relationships/partnerships, deep funding, marketing, etc. The whole package really. Losing is easy, miss out on one of these for a short period of time and you've easily lost. There is no major moat, except great execution across all dimensions. reply foobiekr 2 hours agoparentIn particular: \"There is, however, one enormous difference that I didn’t think about: You can’t build a cloud vendor overnight. Azure doesn’t have to worry about a few executives leaving and building a worldwide network of data centers in 18 months.\" This isn't true at all. There are like 8 of these companies stood up in the last three or four years fueled by massive investment of sovereign funds - mostly the saudi, dubai, northern europe, etc. oil-derived funds - all spending billions of dollars doing exactly that and getting something done. The real problem is the ROI on AI spending is.. pretty much zero. The commonly asserted use cases are the following: Chatbots Developer tools RAG/search Not a one of these is going to generate $10 of additional revenue per sollar spent, nor likely even $2. Optimizing your customer services representatives from 8 conversations at once to an average of 12 or 16 is going to save you a whopping $2 per hour per CSR. It just isn't huge money. And RAG has many, many issues with document permissions that make the current approaches bad for enterprises - where the money is - who as a group haven't spent much of anything to even make basic search work. reply sushid 1 hour agorootparent> And RAG has many, many issues with document permissions Why can't these providers access all documents and when answers are prompted, self-censor if the reply has references to documents that the end users do not have access permissions? In fact, I'm pretty sure that's how existing RAGaaS providers are handling document/file permissions. reply portaouflop 43 minutes agorootparentRAGaas, didn’t know I needed that in my life reply ActionHank 1 hour agoparentprevThe car wasn't a horse that was better, but a car has not changed drastically since they went mainstream. They've gotten better, more efficient, loaded with tech, but are still roughly 4 seats, 4 doors, 4 wheels, driven by petroleum. I know that this is a massive oversimplification, but I think we have seen the \"shape\" of LLMs\\Gen AI\\AI products already and it's all incremental improvements from here on out with more specialization. We are going to have SUVs, sports cars, and single seater cars, not flying cars. AI will be made more fit for purpose for more people to use, but isn't going to replace people outright in their jobs. reply pavlov 32 minutes agorootparentFeels like someone might have said this in 1981 about personal computers. \"We've pretty much seen their shape. The IBM PC isn't fundamentally very different from the Apple II. Probably it's just all incremental improvements from here on out.\" reply ActionHank 23 minutes agorootparentI would agree with your counter if it weren't for the realities of power usage, hardware constraints, evident diminishing returns on training larger models, and as always the fact that AI is still looking for the problem it solves, aside from mass employment. Computers solved a tangible problem in every area of life, AI is being forced everywhere and is arguably failing to make a big gain in areas that it should excel. reply adamc 17 minutes agorootparentprevWhat do you think hasn't been? I think the big game changer in the PC space was graphics cards, but since their introduction, it has all been incremental improvement -- at first, pretty fast, then... slower. Much like CPU improvements, although those started earlier. I can't think of a point where the next generation of PCs was astoundingly different from the prior one... just better. It used to be that they were reliably faster or more capable almost every year, now the rate of improvements is almost negligible. (Yes, graphics are getting better, but not very fast if you aren't near the high end.) reply ToucanLoucan 25 minutes agorootparentprevThe big missing thing between both the metaphor in the OP's link and yours is that I just can't fathom any of these companies being able to raise a paying subscriber base that can actually cover the outrageous costs of this tech. It feels like a pipe dream. Putting aside that I fundamentally don't think AGI is in the tech tree of LLM, if you will, that there's no route from the latter to the former: even if there is, even if it takes, I dunno, ten years: I just don't think ChatGPT is a compelling enough product to fund about $70 billion in research costs. And sure, they aren't having to yet thanks to generous input from various commercial and private interests but like... if this is going to be a stable product at some point, analogous to something like AWS, doesn't it have to... actually make some money? Like sure, I use ChatGPT now. I use the free version on their website and I have some fun with AI dungeon and occasionally use generative fill in Photoshop. I paid for AI dungeon (for awhile, until I realized their free models actually work better for how I like to play) but am now on the free version. I don't pay for ChatGPT's advanced models, because nothing I've seen in the trial makes it more compelling an offering than the free version. Adobe Firefly came to me free as an addon to my creative cloud subscription, but like, if Adobe increased the price, I'm not going to pay for it. I use it because they effectively gave it to me for free with my existing purchase. And I've played with Copilot a bit too, but honestly found it more annoying than useful and I'm certainly not paying for that either. And I realize I am not everyone and obviously there are people out there paying for it (I know a few in fact!) but is there enough of those people ready to swipe cards for... fancy autocomplete? Text generation? Like... this stuff is neat. And that's about where I put it for myself: \"it's neat.\" OpenAI supposedly has 3.9 million subscribers right now, and if those people had to foot that 7 billion annual spend to continue development, that's about $150 a month. This product has to get a LOT, LOT better before I personally am ready to drop a tenth of that, let alone that much. And I realize this is all back-of-napkin math here but still: the expenses of these AI companies seem so completely out of step with anything approaching an actual paying user base, so hilariously outstripping even the investment they're getting from other established tech companies, that it makes me wonder how this is ever, ever going to make so much as a dime for all these investors. In contrast, I never had a similar question about cars, or AWS. The pitch of AWS makes perfect sense: you get a server to use on the internet for whatever purpose, and you don't have to build the thing, you don't need to handle HVAC or space, you don't need a last-mile internet connection to maintain, and if you need more compute or storage or whatever, you move a slider instead of having to pop a case open and install a new hard drive. That's absolutely a win and people will pay for it. Who's paying for AI and why? reply ninetyninenine 3 hours agoparentprevLikely we are because the actualized end result already exists: the human brain. The fact that human intelligence exists means that the idea of human level intelligence is not a pipe dream. The question is whether or not the basic underlying technology of the LLM can achieve that level of intelligence. reply thfuran 50 minutes agorootparentAnd brains do it on about 20 watts. reply asterix_pano 13 minutes agorootparentTraining takes many years though. reply alexashka 1 hour agoparentprev> I think we are in the middle of a steep S-curve of technology innovation We are? What innovation? What do we need innovation for? What present societal problems can tech innovation possibly address? Surely none of the big ones, right? So then is it fit to call technological change - 'innovation'? I'd agree that LLMs improve upon having to read Wikipedia for topics I'm interested in but would investing billions in Wikipedia and organizing human knowledge have produced a better outcome than relying on a magic LLM? Almost certainly, in my mind. You see, people are pouring billions into LLMs and not Wikipedia not because it is a better product - but because they foresee a possibility of an abusive monopoly and that really excites them. That's not innovation - that's more of the same anti-social behaviour that makes any meaningful innovation extremely difficult. reply mellosouls 38 minutes agorootparentI'm not sure the Wikipedia example is a strong one as that site has it's own serious problems with \"abusive monopolies\" in its moderator cliques and biases (as with any social platform). At least with the current big AI players there is the potential for differentiation through competition. Unless there is some similar initiative with the Wikipedias, the problem of single supplier dominance is a difficult one to see as the way forward. reply alexashka 14 minutes agorootparentI can solve Wikipedia's woes quite easily - Wikipedia should limit itself to math, science, engineering, medicine, physics, chemistry, geography and other disciplines that are not at all in dispute. Politics, history, religion and other topics of conversation that are matters of opinion, taste and state sponsored propaganda need to be off limits. Its mission ought to be to provide a PhD level education in all technical fields, not engage in shortening historical events and/or opinions/preferences/beliefs down to a few pages and disputing which pages need to be left in or out. Let fools engage in that task on their own time. reply christianqchung 1 minute agorootparentIs this satire? All of those industries listed significant disputes. If this is serious it's a concerning view of how science actually works. datavirtue 2 minutes agorootparentprevNonetheless, Microsoft is firing up a nuclear reactor to power a new data center. My money is in the energy sector right now. Obvious boom coming with solar, nuclear and AI. reply SoftTalker 1 hour agorootparentprevOne of Google's founding goals was \"organizing human knowledge\" IIRC. They ended up being an ad company. reply LASR 20 minutes agoprevI lead an applied AI research team where I work - which is a mid-sized public enterprise products company. I've been saying this in my professional circles quite often. We talk about scaling laws, superintelligence, AGI etc. But there is another threshold - the ability for humans to leverage super-intelligence. It's just incredibly hard to innovate on products that fully leverage superintelligence. At some point, AI needs to connect with the real world to deliver economically valuable output. The ratelimiting step is there. Not smarter models. In my mind, already with GPT-4, we're not generating ideas fast enough on how best to leverage it. Getting AI to do work involves getting AI to understand what needs to be done from highly bandwidth constrained humans using mouse / keyboard / voice to communicate. Anyone using a chatbot already has felt the frustration of \"it doesn't get what I want\". And also \"I have to explain so much that I might as well just do it myself\" We're seeing much less of \"it's making mistakes\" these days. If we have open-source models that match up to GPT-4 on AWS / Azure etc, not much point to go with players like OpenAI / Anthropic who may have even smarter models. We can't even use the dumber models fully. reply datavirtue 13 minutes agoparent\"In my mind, already with GPT-4, we're not generating ideas fast enough on how best to leverage it.\" This is the main bottle neck, in my kind. A lot of people are missing from the conversation because they don't understand AI fully. I keep getting glimpses of ideas and possibilities and chatting through a browser ain't one of them. On e we have more young people trained on this and comfortable with the tech and understanding it, and existing professionals have light bulbs go off in their heads as they try to integrate local LLMs, then real changes are going to hit hard and fast. This is just a lot to digest right now and the tech is truly exponential which makes it difficult to ideate right now. We are still enveloping the productivity boost from chatting. I tried explaining how this stuff works to product owners and architects and that we can integrate local LLMs into existing products. Everyone shook their head and agreed. When I posted a demo in chat a few weeks later you would have thought the CEO called them on their personal phone and told them to get on this shit. My boss spent the next two weeks day and night working up a demo and presentation for his bosses. It went from zero to 100kph instantly. reply martin_drapeau 2 hours agoprevThe fundamental question is how to monetize AI? I see 2 paths: - Consumers - the Google way: search and advertise to consumers - Businesses - the AWS way: attrack businesses to use your API and lock them in The first is fickle. Will OpenAI become the door to the Internet? You'll need people to stop using Google Search and rely on ChatGPT for that to happen. Will become a commodity. Short term you can charge a subscription but long term will most likely become a commondity with advertising. The second is tangible. My company is plugged directly to the OpenAI API. We build on it. Still very early and not so robust. But getting better and cheaper and faster over time. Active development. No reason to switch to something else as long as OpenAI leads the pack. reply skeeter2020 15 minutes agoparentI don't see how you charge enough for the second path to make the economics work. reply jfoster 2 hours agoparentprevThat's like saying \"how do you monetize the internet?\" There are so many ways, it makes the question seem nonsensical. Ways to monetize AI so far: Metered APIs (OpenAI and others) Subscription products built on it (Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.) Using it as a feature to give products a competitive edge (Apple Intelligence, Tesla FSD) Selling the hardware (Nvidia) reply martin_drapeau 1 hour agorootparent20 years ago people asked that exact question. E-Commerce emerged. People knew the physical process of buying things would move online. Took some time. Sure, more things emerged but monetizing the Internet still remains about selling you something.

How would it replace search? The latter is more believable to me, but how would the AI-enhanced version generate the additional revenue that its costs require? And I think a lot of improvement would be required... people are going to be annoyed by things like hallucinations while trying to buy products. In reality, as soon as a competitor shows up, Google will add whatever copycat features it needs to search.

Indeed, if AI was an algorithm, imagine what would it feel like to be like one: at every step of your thinking process you are dragged by the iron hand of the algorithm, you have no agency in decision making, for every step is pre-determined already, and you're left the role of an observer.

I don't know how the AI rush will work out, but I'd bet there will be some winners and that the best capitalized will have a strong advantage. Big difference this time is that established tech giants are in the race, so I don't know if there will be a startup or Google at the top of the heap. I also think that there could be more opportunities for differentiation in this market.

Perplexity is great when I need a summary of recent events. Google isn’t charging for it yet, but NotebookLM is very useful in its own way as well. When I test the underlying models directly, it’s hard for me to be sure which is better for my purposes.

You could still hail taxis or get them from stops too, though that isn't recommended given that they might try to run the meter by taking a longer route. For food delivery, before the apps, most places didn't deliver food. Nowadays, more places deliver. Even if a place already had their own delivery drivers, they didn't get rid of them.

For example, for operating systems applications provide a network effect -- more apps means an OS will do better, a higher install base for an OS means it'll attract more apps. For social networks it's users. One could imagine this being the case for LLMs; e.g. that LLMs with a lot of users can improve faster. But if the asymptote has been reached, then by definition there's no more improvement to be had, and none of this matters. reply actsasbuffoon 3 hours agorootparentExcellent point, but now consider the availability of open source models as well. They’re not as good as the frontier models, but at some point they get close enough, right? I run Llama 3.x locally on my 5+ year old GPU. It’s pretty decent. It’s not as smart as GPT-4 or Claude, but it’s good enough for a lot of what I do, and most importantly there’s no cap on the number of prompts I can send in a given timeframe. For many consumers, it’s fine to be a little bit behind the cutting edge. My smartphone is 2 models behind now. It’s fast enough, the camera is good enough, and the battery is holding up just fine. I don’t feel any need to fork over $1,000 for a new one right now. I think the same phenomenon will become more common for AI enthusiasts. It’s hard to beat free. And what happens to the economics of building frontier models then? I suspect a lot of air is going to be released from the AI bubble in the next couple of years. reply JumpCrisscross 16 hours agorootparentprev> In six months, somebody else is at the asymptote as well But you were there first. That gives you all of a first mover’s advantages plus the profits from that period to set the terms of the market sharing. None of this requires winner-takes-all economics. And given OpenAI’s revenues, it’s unclear they need to be the sole winner to make an investment thesis work. reply sqeaky 15 hours agorootparentThe first mover advantage isn't as big an advantage as being the one to monopolize a commodity. While there are some historical advantages to first mover's doing this, it is the common case. I also think that is very nearly a winner take all sort of thing, or at least a very API providers will still matters, if this asymptotes. Compare this to toilet paper or fuel, if AI asymptotes and everyone catches up in 6 months it will be be just like these. There are some minor differences in quality, but if a customer can buy something good enough to keep their ass clean or their car powered then they will tend to pick the cheapest option. Sometimes it is subterfuge like ms stealing the OS market from IBM or there might be a state sponsored AI lab like so many state run industries pushing out competition, but there are a ton of ways to beat first movers. reply JumpCrisscross 13 hours agorootparentIf there is no niche, first-mover is useless. But if there is value to be had, it’s valuable. Fighting to tread water in a moving stream with the expectation the flow will slow isn’t irrational. reply sqeaky 13 hours agorootparentAre you claiming there is no Niche to making commodities? I haven't really considered it I could see an argument being made either way. Or are you saying that it's a product these API based llms are just not going to be how we use these tools? Or are you saying something else entirely? reply jsnell 14 hours agorootparentprevOk, so let's say I was there first. But now you're offering a product that's (by definition) just as good for a lower price. Why will the users stick to my product rather than paying your cheaper prices? As for your second point, the profits from the first six months are going to be basically nothing compared to the years of massive investments needed to make this happen. Why would those profits give any kind of sustainable leverage? reply patrickhogan1 17 hours agoprevChatGPT benefits from network effects, where user feedback on the quality of its answers helps improve the model over time. This reduces its reliance on external services like ScaleAI, lowering development costs. Larger user base = increased feedback = improved quality of answers = moat reply streetcat1 17 hours agoprevThe competition for big LLM AI companies is not other big LLM AI companies, but rather small LLM AI companies with good enough models. This is a classic innovator dilemma. For example, I can imagine a team of cardiologists creating a fine tune LLM model. reply Terr_ 17 hours agoparentWhat on earth would cardiologists use a Large Language Model for, except drafting fluff for journals? Safely and effectively, that is. Dangerous and inappropriate is obviously a much wider set of possibilities. reply Leherenn 2 hours agorootparentLike some kind of linter? The cardiologist checks the ECG, compare with the LLM results and checks the difference. If it can reduce error rate by like 10%, that's already really good. My current stance on LLM is that it's good for stuff which is painful to generate, but easy to check (for you). It's easier/faster to read an email than to write it. If you're a domain expert, you can check the output, and so on. The danger is in using it for stuff you cannot easily check, or trusting it implicitly because it is usually working. reply Terr_ 31 minutes agorootparent> The cardiologist checks the ECG, compare with the LLM results and checks the difference. Perhaps you're confusing the acronym LLM (Large Language Model) with ML (Machine Learning)? Analyzing electrocardiogram waveform data using a text-predictor LLM doesn't make sense. No matter how much you invest trying to make it give interesting results, it's fundamentally the wrong tool for the job. reply SoftTalker 1 hour agorootparentprev> trusting it implicitly because it is usually working I think this danger is understated. Humans are really prone to developing expectations based on past observations and then not thinking very critically about or paying attention to those things once those expectations are established. This is why \"self driving\" cars that work most of the time but demand that the driver remain attentive and prepared to take over are such a bad idea. reply goldfeld 2 hours agoprevNo, clearly, AIs do all the work for them. reply fnordpiglet 17 hours agoprevHaving been there for the dotcom boom and bust from pre-IPO Netscape to the brutal collapse of the market, it’s hard to say dotcoms don’t work. There was clearly something there of immense value, but it took a lot experimentation with business models and maturation of technology as well as the fundamental communications infrastructure of the planet. All told it feels like we’ve really only gained a smooth groove in the last 10 years. I see no reason why AI will be particularly different. It seems difficult to make the case AI is useless, but it’s also not particularly mature with respect to fundamental models, tool chains, business models, even infrastructure. In both cases speculative capital flowed into the entire industry, which brought us losers like pets.com but winners like Amazon.com, Netflix.com, Google.com, etc. Which of the AI companies today are the next generation of winners and losers? Who knows. And when the music stops will there be a massive reckoning? I hope not, but it’s always possible. It probably depends on how fast we converge to “what works,” how many grifters there are, how sophisticated equity investors are (and they are much more sophisticated now than they were in 1997), etc. reply est 18 hours agoprevAI as a work force could be comparable to interns. They work in a 7x24 shift but fail the task from time to time. reply highfrequency 3 hours agoprevEnjoyed the article and thought many of the points were good. Here's a counterargument. > In other words, the billions that AWS spent on building data centers is a lasting defense. The billions that OpenAI spent on building prior versions of GPT is not, because better versions of it are already available for free on Github. The money that OpenAI spends on renting GPUs to build the next model is not what builds the moat. The moat comes from the money/energy/expertise that OpenAI spends on the research and software development. Their main asset is not the current best model GPT-4; it is the evolving codebase that will be able to churn out GPT-5 and GPT-6. This is easy to miss because the platform can only churn out each model when combined with billions of dollars of GPU spend, but focusing on the GPU spend misses the point. We're no longer talking about a thousand line PyTorch file with a global variable NUM_GPUs that makes everything better. OpenAI and competitors are constantly discovering and integrating improvements across the stack. The right comparison is not OpenAI vs. AWS, it's OpenAI vs. Google. Google's search moat is not its compute cluster where it stores its index of the web. Its moat is the software system that incorporates tens of thousands of small improvements over the last 20 years. And similar to search, if an LLM is 15% better than the competitors, it has a good shot at capturing 80%+ of the market. (I don't have any interest in messing around with a less capable model if a clearly better one exists.) Google was in some sense \"lucky\" that when they were beginning to pioneer search algorithms, the hardware (compute cluster) itself was not a solved problem the way it is today with AWS. So they had a multidimensional moat from the get-go, which probably slowed early competition until they had built up years' worth of process complexity to deter new entrants. Whereas LLM competition is currently extremely fierce for a few reasons: NLP was a ripe academic field with a history of publishing and open source, VC funding environment is very favorable, and cloud compute is a mature product offering. Which explains why there is currently a proliferation of relatively similar LLM systems: > Every LLM vendor is eighteen months from dead. But the ramp-up time for competitors is only short right now because the whole business model (pretrain massive transformers -> RLHF -> chatbot interface) was only discovered 18 months ago (ChatGPT launched at the end of 2022) - and at that point all of the research ideas were published. By definition, the length of a process complexity moat can't exceed how long the incumbent has been in business! In five years, it won't be possible to raise a billion dollars and create a state of the art LLM system, because OpenAI and Anthropic will have been iterating on their systems continuously. Defections of senior researchers will hurt, and can speed up competitor ramp-time slightly, but over time a higher proportion of accumulated insights is stored in the software system rather than the minds of individual researchers. Let me emphasize: the billions of dollars of GPU spend is a distraction; we focus on it because it is tangible and quantifiable, and it can feel good to be dismissive and say \"they're only winning because they have tons of money to simply scale up models.\" That is a very partial view. There is a tremendous amount of incremental research going on - no longer published in academic journals - that has the potential to form a process complexity moat in a large and relatively winner-take-all market. reply empath75 2 hours agoparentInference costs many many times less than training. I think we may end up with one more round of training a larger foundational model, and then it's going to have to wait for new, cheaper, more efficient hardware. It's quite possible that all of these first mover companies go bankrupt, but the models will still exist generating value. reply bbqfog 3 hours agoparentprevThe infrastructure hardware and software is a commodity. Any real moat comes from access to data. I think we've seen data close up quite a bit since people realized that you can train LLMs with it, so I don't know that OpenAI's data access is better than when they trained GPT 4. In fact, it's probably worse unless they've cut independent deals with massive data providers. reply plaidfuji 17 hours agoprevI get the sense that the value prop of LLMs should first be cut into two categories: coding assistant, and everything else. LLMs as coding assistants seem to be great. Let’s say that every working programmer will need an account and will pay $10/month (or their employer will).. what’s a fair comp for valuation? GitHub? That’s about $10Bn. Atlassian? $50Bn The “everything else” bin is hard to pin down. There are some clear automation opportunities in legal, HR/hiring, customer service, and a few other fields - things that feel like $1-$10Bn opportunities. Sure, the costs are atrocious, but what’s the revenue story? reply dartos 17 hours agoparent> I get the sense that the value prop of LLMs should first be cut into two categories: coding assistant, and everything else. Replace coding assistant with artists and you have the vibe of AI 2 years ago. The issue is that these models are easy to make (if expensive) so the open source community (of which many, maybe most, are programmers themselves) will likely eat up any performance moat given enough time. This story already played out with AI art. Nothing beats SD and comfyUI if you really need high quality and control. reply 23B1 17 hours agoprevIt is ironic that this article seems to focus on the business logic, considering that is the same myopia at these AI companies. Not that physical/financial constraints are unimportant, but they often can be mitigated in other ways. Some background: I was previously at one of these companies that got hoovered up in the past couple years by the bigs. My job was sort of squishy, but it could be summarized as 'brand manager' insofar as it was my job to aide in shaping the actual tone, behaviors, and personality of our particular product. I tell you this because in full disclosure, I see the world through the product/marketing lens as opposed to the engineer lens. They did not get it. And by they I mean founds whose names you've heard of, people with absolute LOADS of experience in building a shipping technology products. There were no technical or budgetary constraints at this early stage, we were moving fast and trying shit. But they simply could not understand why we needed to differentiate and how that'd make us more competitive. I imagine many technology companies go through this, and I don't blame technical founders who are paranoid about this stuff; it sounds like 'management bullshit' and a lot of it is, but at some point all organizations who break even or take on investors are going to be answerable to the market, and that means leaving no stone unturned in acquiring users and new revenue streams. All of that to say, I do think a lot of these AI companies have yet to realize that there's a lot to be done user experience-wise. The interface alone - a text prompt(!?) is crazy out-of-touch to me. The fact that average users have no idea how to set up a good prompt and how hard everyone is making it for them to learn about that. All of these decisions are pretty clearly made by someone who is technology-oriented, not user-oriented. There's no work I'm aware of being done on tone, or personality frameworks, or linguistics, or characterization. Is the LLM high on numeracy? Is it doing code switching/matching, and should it? How is it qualifying its answers by way of accuracy in a way that aids the user learning how to prompt for improved accuracy? What about humor or style? It just completely flew over everyone's heads. This may have been my fault. But I do think that the constraints you see to growth and durability of these companies will come down to how they're able to build a moat using strategies that don't require $$$$ and that cannot be easily replicated by competition. Nobody is sitting in the seats at Macworld stomping their feet for Sam Altman. A big part of that is giving customers more than specs or fiddly features. These companies need to start building a brand fast. reply Der_Einzige 17 hours agoprev#2 is dead wrong, and shows that the author is not aware of the current exciting research happening in parameter efficient fine-tuning or representation/activation engineering space. The idea that you need huge amounts of compute to innovate in a world of model merging and activation engineering shows a failure of imagination, not a failure to have the necessary resources. PyReft, Golden Gate Claude (Steering/Control Vectors), Orthogonalization/Abliteration, and the hundreds of thousands of Lora and other adapters available on websites like civit.ai is proof that the author doesn't know what they're talking about re: point #2. And I'm not even talking about the massive software/hardware improvements we are seeing for training/inference performance.

But I'm just not convinced that this is going in the direction of AGI. The recent advances are truly jaw dropping. It absolutely merits being investigated to the hilt. There is a very good chance that it will end up being a net profit. But intuitively they don't feel to me like they're getting more human. If anything I feel like the recent round of \"get it to reason aloud\" is the opposite of what makes \"general intelligence\" a thing. The vast majority of human behavior isn't reasoned, aloud or otherwise. It'll be super cool if I'm wrong and we're just one algorithm or extra data set or scale factor of CPUs away from It, whatever It turns out to be. My intuition here isn't worth much. But I wouldn't be surprised if it was right despite that. reply snapcaster 2 hours agorootparentDid you criticize the turing test as being meaningless before it was easily passed by LLMs? if not i don't see how you can avoid updating on \"this is getting more human\" or at least \"this is getting closer to intelligence\" to avoid the human-bias reply jfengel 28 minutes agorootparentI never gave much thought to the Turing test one way or the other. It never struck me as especially informative. I've always been more interested in the non-verbal aspects of human intelligence. I believe that \"true AGI\", whatever that is, is likely to be able to mimic sentient but non-verbal species. I'd like to see an AGI do what a dog or cat does. LLMs are quite astonishing at mimicking something humans specifically do, the most \"rational\" parts of our brain. But they seem to jump past the basic, non-rational parts of the brain. And I don't think we'll see it as \"true AGI\" until it does that -- whatever that is. I'm reminded of the early AI researchers who taught AI to play chess because it's what smart people do, but it couldn't do any of the things dumb people do. I think the biggest question right now is whether our present techniques are a misleading local maximum, or if we're on the right slope and just need to keep climbing. reply snapcaster 9 minutes agorootparentWhat do you think a dog or cat does that can't be replicated by LLMs? reply JumpCrisscross 17 hours agoparentprevAGI is PR.

Try Liquid Fig. 1. LFMs offer a new best performance/size tradeoff in the 1B, 3B, and 12B (active parameters) categories. TakeawaysIntroducing the First Generation of Language LFMsReimagining Model ArchitecturesJoin us as an early adopter of LFMs Takeaways We announce the first series of Liquid Foundation Models (LFMs), a new generation of generative AI models built from first principles. Our 1B, 3B, and 40B LFMs achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of quality at each scale, while maintaining a smaller memory footprint and more efficient inference. Try LFMs today on Liquid Playground, Lambda (Chat UI and API), Perplexity Labs, and soon on Cerebras Inference. The LFM stack is being optimized for NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm, Cerebras, and Apple hardware. We build private, edge, and on-premise AI solutions for enterprises of any size. We are scaling LFMs and expect to introduce new and better capabilities across various industries, such as financial services, biotechnology, and consumer electronics. Try Liquid At Liquid AI, we build new methods for designing powerful AI systems over which we have significant control. We design them the same way engineers built engines, cars, and airplanes: from first principles. Our mission is to create best-in-class, intelligent, and efficient systems at every scale – systems designed to process large amounts of sequential multimodal data, to enable advanced reasoning, and to achieve reliable decision-making. Today, we introduce the first generation of Liquid Foundation Models (LFMs). LFMs are large neural networks built with computational units deeply rooted in the theory of dynamical systems, signal processing, and numerical linear algebra. This unique blend allows us to leverage decades of theoretical advances in these fields in our quest to enable intelligence at every scale. LFMs are general-purpose AI models that can be used to model any kind of sequential data, including video, audio, text, time series, and signals. Our name “Liquid” pays homage to our roots in dynamic and adaptive learning systems. Introducing the First Generation of Language LFMs We are proud to release our first series of language models: A dense 1.3B model, ideal for highly resource-constrained environments. A dense 3.1B model, optimized for edge deployment. A 40.3B Mixture of Experts (MoE) model, designed for tackling more complex tasks. Architecture work cannot happen in a vacuum – our goal is to develop useful models that are competitive with the current best-in-class LLMs. In doing so, we hope to show that model performance isn’t just about scale – it’s also about innovation. State-of-the-Art Performance We report the results of our fine-tuned LFMs and compare them with similar-sized language models using Eleuther AI’s lm-evaluation-harness v0.4. Unless specified otherwise, we compare to other fine-tuned models. LFM-1B achieves the highest scores across various benchmarks in the 1B category, making it the new state-of-the-art model at this size.

This is particularly true for long inputs, where the KV cache in transformer-based LLMs grows linearly with sequence length. By efficiently compressing inputs, LFMs can process longer sequences on the same hardware. For example, compared to other 3B-class models, LFMs maintain a minimal memory footprint. Fig. 2. Total inference memory footprint of different language models vs. the input+generation length. LFMs Truly Exploit their Context Length In this preview release, we have optimized our models to deliver a best-in-class 32k token context length, pushing the boundaries of efficiency for our size. This was confirmed by the RULER benchmark, where a length is considered “effective” when its corresponding score is higher than 85.6 [Hsieh et al. 2024 - RULER].

Our goal is to keep scaling LFMs across model size, train/test time compute, and context length. Beyond our language LFMs, we have designed models for various data modalities, domains, and applications that we plan to release in the next months. Advancing the Pareto Frontier of Large AI Models To achieve these results, we optimized our pre- and post-training pipelines and infrastructure to ensure our models excel across five criteria: Knowledge capacity Breadth and depth of information across various domains and tasks at any given size. We achieve this using a comprehensive pre-training set, advances in model architectures, new pre-training/mid-training/post-training strategies. This allows LFMs to be competitive with larger models on knowledge-based tasks. Multi-step reasoning The ability to break down a problem and apply logical and rigorous thinking. We distilled system 2 tasks during the core phases of training, enabling robust analytical capabilities in compact model architectures. Long context recall A model's maximum input size is not the same as its effective context length. We specifically trained LFMs to maximize recall performance and in-context learning capabilities across the entire input range. Inference efficiency Memory usage of transformer-based models explodes for long inputs, which makes them ill-suited for edge deployment. LFMs have near-constant inference time and memory complexity – as the input context length grows, it does not significantly affect generation speed or increase the amount of memory required. Training efficiency Training GPT-like foundation models demands significant computational resources. LFMs are efficient for training on long-context data. Reimagining Model Architectures Building on a long line of research in designing expressive and efficient learning systems, we have developed a new design space for foundation models, focusing on different modalities and hardware requirements. Our goal is to explore ways to build foundation models beyond Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs). With LFMs, we put into practice new principles and methods guiding model design, developed by our team over the past months. LFMs are composed of structured operators. Our models are derived from a set of computational units – the building blocks of an architecture – belonging to a new design space. Liquid systems and their composition maximize knowledge capacity and reasoning, while unlocking improved training efficiency, reduced memory cost at inference time, and increased performance in modeling data such as video, audio, text, time series, and signals. LFM architectures are under control. The design of our models reciprocally informs our scaling, inference, alignment, and model analysis strategy. We can analyze the dynamics of LFMs via classical signal processing analysis methods and probe their behavior, from model outputs to model internals. LFMs are adaptive and can serve as the substrate for AI at every scale. We can automatically optimize architectures for a specific platform (e.g., Apple, Qualcomm, Cerebras, and AMD) or match given parameter requirements and inference cache size. Fig. 3. Our architectures feature custom computational units arranged in depth groups (targeted weight sharing), with additional featurizer interconnections (feature sharing). Liquid’s design space is primarily defined by featurization and footprint of architectures and their core operators. Featurization refers to the process of converting input data (e.g., text, audio, images, video) into a structured set of features or vectors that are used to modulate computation inside the model in an adaptive manner. For example, audio and time series data generally requires less featurization in operators due to lower information density, compared to language and multi-modal data. The other key dimension is the computational complexity of the operators. Being able to traverse and complete the design space of structured adaptive operators allows us maximize performance with controlled computational requirements. Fig. 4. We built the foundations of a new design space for computational units, enabling customization to different modalities and hardware requirements. At their core, LFMs are built with computational units that can be expressed as adaptive linear operators whose actions are determined by inputs. The LFM design framework unifies and subsumes a wide range of existing computational units in deep learning, providing a systematic approach to exploring the space of architectures. Specifically, our analysis informs model building by improving three key aspects: token-mixing structure (how the operator mixes embeddings in the input sequence), channel-mixing structure (how it mixes channel dimensions), and featurization, responsible for modulating computation based on the input context. Join us as an early adopter of LFMs As we are still in the early stages of this journey, we welcome the opportunity to collaborate and discover the strengths and weaknesses of these systems together. What are Language LFMs good at today: General and expert knowledge Mathematics and logical reasoning Efficient and effective long-context tasks Their primary language is English, with secondary multilingual capabilities in Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Arabic, Japanese, and Korean What are Language LFMs not good at today: Zero-shot code tasks Precise numerical calculations Time-sensitive information Counting r's in the word \"Strawberry\"! Human preference optimization techniques have not been applied extensively to our models yet. At Liquid AI, we take an open-science approach. We have and will continue to contribute to the advancement of the AI field by openly publishing our findings and methods through scientific and technical reports. As part of this commitment, we will release relevant data and models produced by our research efforts to the wider AI community.

Of course it'd be a complete embarrassment to see how hard it gets trounced by GPT4o and Claude 3.5, but that's par for the course if you don't want to release model weights, at least in my opinion. reply Jackson__ 1 hour agoparentI'd also like to point out that they omit Qwen2.5 14B from the benchmark because it doesn't fit their narrative(MMLU Pro score of 63.7[0]). This kind of listing-only-models-you-beat feels extremely shady to me. [0] https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5/ reply GaggiX 1 hour agoparentprevYes, I agree, for these small models it's wasted potential to be closed source, they can only be used effectively if they are open. EDIT: HN is rate-limiting me so I will reply here: In my opinion 1B and 3B truly shine on edge devices, if not than it's not worth the effort, you can have much better models for already dirt cheap using an API. reply k__ 1 hour agorootparentWhile I'm all for open models; why can't the small models not be used effectively? Wouldn't they lower the costs compared to big models drastically? reply Bilal_io 1 hour agorootparentI think what the parent means is that small models are more useful locally on mobile, IoT devices etc. so it defeats the purpose to have to call an API. reply derefr 47 minutes agorootparentprevBig models take up more VRAM just to have the weights sitting around hot in memory, yes. But running two concurrent inferences on the same hot model, doesn't require that you have two full copies of the model in memory. You only need two full copies of the model's \"state\" (the vector that serves as the output of layer N and the input of layer N+1, and the pool of active low-cardinality matrix-temporaries used to batchwise-compute that vector.) It's just like spawning two copies of the same program, doesn't require that you have two copies of the program's text and data sections sitting in your physical RAM (as those get mmap'ed to the same shared physical RAM); it only requires that each process have its own copy of the program's writable globals (bss section), and have its own stack and heap. Which means there are economies of scale here. It is increasingly less expensive (in OpEx-per-inference-call terms) to run larger models, as your call concurrency goes up. Which doesn't matter to individuals just doing one thing at a time; but it does matter to Inference-as-a-Service providers, as they can arbitrarily \"pack\" many concurrent inference requests from many users, onto the nodes of their GPU cluster, to optimize OpEx-per-inference-call. This is the whole reason Inference-aaS providers have high valuations: these economies of scale make Inference-aaS a good business model. The same query, run in some inference cloud rather than on your device, will always achieve a higher-quality result for the same marginal cost [in watts per FLOP, and in wall-clock time]; and/or a same-quality result for a lower marginal cost.) Further, one major difference between CPU processes and model inference on a GPU, is that each inference step of a model is always computing an entirely-new state; and so compute (which you can think of as \"number of compute cores reserved\" x \"amount of time they're reserved\") scales in proportion to the state size. And, in fact, with current Transformer-architecture models, compute scales quadratically with state size. For both of these reasons, you want to design models to minimize 1. absolute state size overhead, and 2. state size growth in proportion to input size. The desire to minimize absolute state-size overhead, is why you see Inference-as-a-Service providers training such large versions of their models (OpenAI's 405b models, etc.) The hosted Inference-aaS providers aren't just attempting to make their models \"smarter\"; they're also attempting to trade off \"state size\" for \"model size.\" (If you're familiar with information theory: they're attempting to make a \"smart compressor\" that minimizes the message-length of the compressed message [i.e. the state] by increasing the information embedded in the compressor itself [i.e. the model.]) And this seems to work! These bigger models can do more with less state, thereby allowing many more \"cheap\" inferences to run on single nodes. The particular newly-released model under discussion in this comments section, also has much slower state-size (and so compute) growth in proportion to its input size. Which means that there's even more of an economy-of-scale in running nodes with the larger versions of this model; and therefore much less of a reason to care about smaller versions of this model. reply liuliu 32 minutes agorootparent> they're attempting to make a \"smart compressor\" that minimizes the message-length of the compressed message [i.e. the state] by increasing the information embedded in the compressor itself [i.e. the model.]) And this seems to work! These bigger models can do more with less state, thereby allowing many more \"cheap\" inferences to run on single nodes. Not sure I follow. CoT and go over length of the states is a relatively new phenomenon and I doubt when training the model, minimize the length of CoT is an explicit goal. The only thing probably relevant to this comment is the use of grouped-query attention? That reduces the size of KV cache by factor of 4 to 8 depending on your group strategy. But I am unsure there is a clear trade-off between model size / grouped-query size given smaller KV cache == smaller model size naively. reply echelon 1 hour agorootparentprevThese aren't the \"small\" models I'm thinking of. I want an LLM, STT, or TTS model to run efficiently on a Raspberry Pi with no GPU and no network. There is huge opportunity for LLM-based toys, tools, sensors, and the like. But they need to work sans internet. reply thebiss 28 minutes agorootparentYou may be interested in this tread regarding whisper.cpp on an Rpi4: https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/discussions/166 reply zozbot234 1 hour agorootparentprevThere are small proprietary models such as Claude Haiku and GPT 4o-mini. reply GaggiX 1 hour agorootparentThey are way bigger than 1B or 3B. reply zozbot234 2 hours agoprev> How many r's in \"strawberry\"? Think step by step! What a nice question! Well, let's just count: 1. S 2. T 3. R! So, we have our answer: there are 3 R's in \"strawberry\". Totally checks out! reply alach11 1 hour agoparentThis is one of the least interesting questions to ask LLMs. I wish it wasn't so popular. reply roywiggins 46 minutes agorootparentI also think it's kind of a silly example- smart people can be functionally illiterate, after all. It doesn't tell you that much. My favorite LLM stumper is asking them to solve the farmer/wolf/chicken/grain river-crossing puzzle but with only a chicken. They usually either insist on pointless extra trips or hallucinate a wolf or grain. Liquid somehow does both and also loses track of what's where. > The farmer can take the chicken across the river first. Then, he can go back to the original side and bring the boat back. He can then take the chicken back to the original side and leave it there. Next, he can take a bag of grain across the river. He can then go back to the original side and bring the chicken across the river. Finally, he can go back to the original side one last time and bring the chicken across the river. One generation ended like this: > the farmer and the chicken are both on the other side of the river, and the chicken is safe from the grain. reply WhitneyLand 1 hour agorootparentprevI find it fascinating. To me it grounds expectations and motivates discussions about the jagged boundaries of LLM capabilities. reply hn_throwaway_99 50 minutes agorootparentWhy do you find it fascinating? I have the most rudimentary understanding of LLMs and it seems to me the least fascinating thing about LLM limitations. That is, all LLMs look at language as a series of opaque, independent tokens, e.g. strawberry might be a single token (say ), or probably two (e.g. straw and berry, say ). But in no way will it represent it like we will, with letters. So if you ask it \"how many R's are in strawberry\", it fundamentally can't do any \"counting\", it just basically has to rely on whether that question (or similar questions about related words) has been asked before so it can predict the next token in its output correctly. I suppose with enough data and LLM could learn to associate character counts with tokens (e.g. with the right training set it could learn metadata about the tokens). My point being that with only the most basic understanding of how LLMs function, this \"character counting\" limitation seems blatantly obvious. reply WhitneyLand 24 minutes agorootparentI don’t think we’ve yet come to the point where, how an LLM end to end goes from prompt to output is blatantly obvious. LLMs operate with language at multiple levels of abstraction and tokens are not the only way to have character level knowledge. For example, nothing excludes pre-training data from directly or indirectly encoding such knowledge. And of course LLMs famously have emergent properties, for which there’s not yet a precise mechanism to illuminate the results. We’re dealing with very complex systems that are still relatively poorly understood, and I believe the pool of concepts understood to the point of being blatantly obvious is still small. reply NoCoooode 1 hour agorootparentprevThat they can't do this sort of simple question speaks volumes to the entire approach. I don't think generative AI will ever be able to reach AGI, and most people selling LLM today pretend it is AGI reply alach11 1 hour agorootparentAll it speaks to is that tokenization is weird and introduces artifacts to LLM performance. Counting letters is a trivial task when you're staring at words on a screen. It's much harder when you're perceiving vectors based on parts of words. The fact that LLMs find certain things easier/harder than humans is completely unsurprising, and there are much more interesting benchmarks to use to compare one LLM to another. reply doctorpangloss 1 hour agorootparentCounting shit, like cells, peaks in signals, people, inventory, fingers, and votes, is hard, tedious and important to business and life, so I don’t know dude, it seems like a great benchmark to me. Countless posts wasted on denying this simple and obvious fact. reply hn_throwaway_99 40 minutes agorootparentNot being able to \"do math\" is an obvious, IMO uninteresting limitation of how LLMs inherently work, and the more advanced models have already figured out good solutions. E.g. while an LLM may stumble on \"How many R's are in Strawberry\", at this point any code model can easily correctly implement \"write me a program in Python that counts the number of R's in strawberry\". GPT 3 would essentially always fail on higher math problems/arithmetic, but whenever I've used it for math GPT 4 has always delegated out to executing code where necessary. reply Scarblac 43 minutes agorootparentprevSo how many 1 bits are in strawberry? Thats about the same kind of question, given that LLMs see tokens instead of characters, and we see characters instead of bits. reply BoorishBears 44 minutes agorootparentprevIt's like using a hammer to turn a screw and calling it useless. To envision what a next generation model bound by the same constraints should do, it'd be to recognize that it can't count tokens and use code access to write code that solves the strawberry problem without prompting. Asked to count cells it'd be a model that could write and execute OpenCV tasks. Or to go a step further, be a multimodal model that can synthesize 10000 varations of the target cell, and finetune a model like YOLO on it autonomously. I find arguments that reduce LLMs to \"It can't do the simple thing!!!!\" come from people unable to apply lateral thinking to how a task can be solved. reply jrflowers 1 hour agorootparentprevThis is a good point. While LLMs being incapable of reliably doing a simple task that’s been doable by computers since the punch card days is an important consideration for anyone that might be thinking about using them for anything other than as a toy, this fact is uninteresting because of Reasons reply Nevermark 1 hour agorootparentTry counting the number of your red retina cells that are firing while you look at a painting. Don’t need to be exact as firing is statistical, just give us a good average. Hard? You can’t count? Computers count pixels no problem. So weird you can’t. Dementia? Not an AGI? /h —- This is what is happening. Here are the “Reasons”. In your vision system, the raw information from individual retina signals is munged into a different representation before reaching a level where you have flexible processing. Likewise, in LLMs, letters are munged into tokens before LLMs “see” them. When they sometimes get that “simple” question right, it’s actually a bit of an amazing feat. Given how they are constructed. —- Now try counting R’s as you read at a normal rate, or listen to someone speak. You can’t do that either, during normal processing. When we add spelling to LLMs training examples, they will do it easily. Just as you learned to do it, only after special lessons, after you had already learned to listen and speak. Spelling is its own special practiced skill, in humans and LLMs. reply jrflowers 1 hour agorootparent> Try counting the number of your red retina cells that are firing during while you look at a painting. This analogy makes sense because everybody could count their red retina cells until a couple years ago when the new painting paradigm arose, and also counting red retinal cells is a good analogy for being able to see simple objects that have always been distinguishable. It is fascinating how tapping the “Do Not Use LLMs For Computation If The Results Need To Be Reliably Better Than A Random Output” sign invites explanations of why that fact is actually Cool and Good reply Nevermark 37 minutes agorootparentAsk anyone who has not specifically learned to spell, to count R’s while you speak. You learned to listen and speak words before you could spell. Imagine if nobody had actually shown you written words? Or they were speaking another dialect but expecting you to count R’s in standard English? LLMs are not trained on words in the form of letters. They process and generate the words in the form of tokens. Pre- and post-processing systems converts letters to tokens and the reverse, without their ability to access that processing. Spelling, for both us and LLMs, requires specific training/lessons. > It is fascinating how tapping the “Do Not Use LLMs For Computation If The Results Need To Be Reliably Better Than A Random Output” sign invites explanations of why that fact is actually Cool and Good Also fascinating: People who hallucinate/confabulate ridiculous straw man rationales for people they disagree with, unaware they are filling in gaps in their knowledge regarding other people’s actual reasoning and the actual subject at hand. So LLM! Such unreliable processing! Perhaps, start posting a reliability disclaimer? reply space_fountain 1 hour agorootparentprevLLMs can clearly solve problems that computers up to now couldn't. They can't solve all problems and this should definitely be a cautionary note to anyone who wants to use them as an artificial general intelligence, but this take seems no different to someone looking at a punchcard computer and going, it can't even recognize typos or categorize images, what good is this? We've already had human computers who can do everything these can do, and can recognize images and notice typos reply evilduck 1 hour agorootparentAlso humans would revert to explicitly using an algorithm and external storage like a sheet of paper with tally marks or a spreadsheet or even a computer program if you scale the question up to a full sheet of text or a whole book or a collection of books (we probably do it at a single word size too, but it's more intuitive than explicit behavior for most folks when the count sum is around 8 or less). LLMs can't effectively execute algorithms similarly in their context, nor can they memorize new data or facts it was given without providing it tools like function calling or embeddings. If you give LLMs tool calling and storage mechanisms then counting letters in words becomes pretty damn reliable. reply bondarchuk 1 hour agorootparentprevFor all I care we will have superhuman AGI that still can't count the Rs in strawberry. Some humans are dyslexic and all are subject to weird perceptual illusions; doesn't make them any less human-level intelligent. reply InsideOutSanta 1 hour agorootparentprevIn my opinion, the problem with the strawberry question is that it is both a bad example because you don't need an LLM to count the number of r's in a word, and it's a bad measure of an LLM's capabilities because it's a type of question that all LLMs are currently bad at. Having said that, the 40b model wasn't able to answer any of my real-world example questions correctly. Some of these (e.g. \"how do I add a sequential number after my titles in an HTML page using just CSS, without changing the page\") are questions that even some of the better small local models can answer correctly. It gave very authoritatively sounding wrong answers. reply throw101010 1 hour agorootparentprev> most people selling LLM today pretend it is AGI Who exactly does this in this space? Would be good to be able to call them out on it right now. reply jimbokun 1 hour agorootparentprevIn isolation, probably not. But it's likely to be an important component in an AGI system. I suppose the interesting question is how to integrate LLMs with more traditional logic and planning systems. reply GaggiX 1 hour agorootparentprevThe fact that LLMs are usually trained on tokens and not on characters, doesn't really speak about what generative AI is going to reach or not. >most people selling LLM today pretend it is AGI Who are these \"most people\"? reply smokedetector1 1 hour agorootparentELI5 why are tokens not a single letter? reply WhitneyLand 1 hour agorootparentSuch an architecture could be implemented, it could use one token per letter, or one token per word, instead of the typical 0.75 per word we see. The choice just comes with trade-offs in memory usage, compute, and effectiveness of the model in various scenarios. So what we ended up with was a pragmatic/engineering decision rather than a theoretical or fundamental constraint. reply swyx 1 hour agorootparentprevimagine being so confidently wrong about AI reply anonzzzies 1 hour agorootparentprevYep, people find this interesting, but many (many) people get this wrong as well; it has something to do with how many letters it is and how many you can keep in your head I think. We are not very good counters or calculators or computers and, even though I am not saying llms are the same or close to humans, we tried to model their substrates after biology and are surprised we get something that cannot count or calculate very well. I find it a dumb test that proves nothing imho. However, not very impressed with this model. reply marcosdumay 36 minutes agorootparentIt's a magician-like trick.

The confusing thing about LLMs is that they speak tokens, not written text, so it's a lot more like interrogating someone who is functionally illiterate- of course they're going to be a terrible speller. You can find much weirder things that LLMs are absurdly bad at, like \"A farmer needs to get himself and a chicken across a river. His boat can hold the farmer and one piece of cargo. How does he do this?\" 9 times out of 10 LLMs will pattern match this to the classic puzzle (there's usually also a sack of grain and a wolf) and start insisting on extra trips and inventing wolves. Even if a human makes the same mistake, they almost certainly would realize it after being reminded that there is no wolf, but LLMs often insist there is. o1-preview (but not -mini) seems to have cracked it, though. reply nateglims 36 minutes agorootparentprevBeing openly annoyed by it will just lead to it being used more. That's sort of a fundamental behavior of the internet. reply cynicalpeace 53 minutes agorootparentprevSomething I like to tell it to do is actually to respond using only a certain number of words.

How many R's do you think are in \"strawberry\"? I get 3, and it got 3. I'm with the LLM. ...oh, you disagree with its intermediate reasoning? You think it should follow a series of logical steps that are each individually correct, rather than pulling wildly incorrect intermediate steps out of its butt and synthesizing them together in the end into a coherent answer that happens to be correct? But that's what an LLM is! Why complain about an LLM being an (unusually transparent) LLM? I think this example serves as a beautiful illustration of how LLMs work, and are supposed to work—even if the correspondence is inexact between (1) incorrect and irrelevant-to-us intermediate steps and (2) internal matrix multiplications that represent incorrect or invalid logic. The correspondence is inexact and probably mostly figurative, but it's still a great example of how internal nonsense can still lead to externally \"correct\" answers. (\"Nonsense\" is underselling the complex and highly sophisticated internal state that leads to \"correct\" answers a stunningly high percentage of the time; I'm just trying to distinguish it from formal logic or the type of reasoning that we think we do and sometimes actually do. And would do, in this example problem.) reply moralestapia 1 hour agorootparentThat's why I used the word properly, to imply that the whole answer should make sense. reply qeternity 1 hour agorootparentprevTraining on the test set is all you need. reply d_burfoot 36 minutes agoparentprevWell... they at least admit that their model is bad at this [0] > What are Language LFMs not good at today: - Zero-shot code tasks - Precise numerical calculations - Time-sensitive information - Counting r's in the word \"Strawberry\"!

Context length is the next frontier for models in this range - getting to a true 128-200k token length in a small model would be very very useful. Hallucinations are less of an issue because you can just dump all the source data in, whole codebases can go in for stuff ranging from a refactor to ‘write documentation of the API’. Claude and gpto-preview are the only games in town for these long context tasks right now, and they are slow. Some of the tasks need the extra intelligence, but a lot don’t. In those cases a lightweight or local model will be greatly appreciated. Not to mention context length that long will more easily enable multimodal parsing. reply jadbox 2 hours agoparentLooking at 3B, the performance is roughly on par with phi 3.5.. not sure where how they gauge on their graph that it is better.

Because today we need to double check when we ask AI to transform some data or transform some code, there is the risk of it messing something up but if it is not something that would crash immediately you risk introducing a ton of new bugs by asking an AI to refactor instead of using some good tools. reply vessenes 30 minutes agorootparentThere's always risk! But when you ask a model to rely on just the input data, you are (mostly) trying to tap into its reasoning, not knowledge side. Obviously what's kind of magical is that some knowledge will be needed for reasoning, and you have it. But LLMs small and large are pretty good at doing the in-context stuff. It is precisely what they're trained on, and in fact it was kind of a surprise how well they seemed to generalize outside of this task in the first place. reply mg 2 hours agoprevI tried my standard testprompt: Two cars have a 100 mile race. Car A drives 10 miles per hour. Car B drives 5 miles per hour, but gets a 10 hour headstart. Who wins? And the Liquid-40B model failed with a long explanation why car B wins the race. Amusingly, the explanation is quite convincing and very similar to how Zeno explains in one of his paradoxes that a fast runner can never overtake a slower runner with a headstart. Because every time the fast runner gets to the point where he saw the slow runner, the slow runner is already a bit further along the track. reply leetharris 2 hours agoparentTo be fair, this article does say: >What are Language LFMs not good at today: >Zero-shot code tasks >Precise numerical calculations >Time-sensitive information >Counting r's in the word \"Strawberry\"! >Human preference optimization techniques have not been applied extensively to our models yet.

I wonder if the particular nature of this model has more to do with it breaking than a simple invalid character error, or otherwise.

Meaning that it will intentionally select \"less optimal\" next tokens at some random rate in order to make it sound less like a robot answering the same thing over and over. If this is the case, isn't it pretty much guaranteed to get knowledge based questions wrong a decent amount of the time? I could be way off base (I have zero knowledge about the internals and simply read occasional blog posts), but I thought I remembered that being one of the key features to making LLMs sound more human. reply hn_throwaway_99 33 minutes agoparentWhat you are referring to is called \"temperature\" with respect to LLMs, and it is a parameter that can be tweaked at inference time. Google's AI Overview gives a pretty good summary IMO: > The temperature parameter in a large language model (LLM) controls the amount of randomness in the model's output. It's a numerical value that influences the model's choices, and is often set between 0 and 1. > The temperature setting affects the quality of the output by balancing exploration and exploitation: > Low temperature > The model is more likely to exploit patterns it's already learned, resulting in more deterministic and conservative outputs. This is ideal for tasks that require accuracy, such as data analysis, technical writing, and summarizing research papers. > High temperature > The model is encouraged to explore, resulting in more varied and creative outputs. This is ideal for creative tasks, such as brainstorming, artistic content, and storytelling. However, adjusting the temperature too high can result in non-sensical outputs. reply tsumnia 39 minutes agoparentprevDon't think of it as \"less optimal\", but rather other next tokens that have smaller, but still high, probabilties of being selected. If your largest next token has a probability of (arbitrarily) 25% of being selected, this doesn't make it optimal - just highest probable answer. If the second most probable has a 24% chance, that would now account for 49% of probable responses. Rather than picking the highest probable word, let's generate a random number and whatever that value hits is then compared against the various probability bands (randomIsn't one of the defining features of modern NPL (and therefore LLMs) that it is designed to be non-deterministic? Not of all NPL, but it is absolutely a property of LLMs. But I doubt this even enters into the total figure if you go search for the causes of LLMs giving wrong answers. reply paradite 38 minutes agoprevIf you look at the main image of the MMLU-Pro benchmark comparisons, and compare it to the tables below, you can see how they cherry picked one single benchmark where the models better than all the others.

While it may seem like a simple comic strip about a lazy cat and his owner, there is a deeper philosophy embedded within its pages. This philosophy revolves around the themes of existentialism, hedonism, and the human condition. Existentialism is a philosophical movement that emphasizes individual freedom, choice, and existence. In the Garfield comic book series, we see this theme play out through the character of Garfield himself. Garfield is a cat who lives life on his own terms, making his own choices and living his life as he sees fit. He is not bound by societal norms or expectations, and he is free to do as he pleases. This is exemplified in his love for lasagna, his disdain for Mondays, and his general indifference to the world around him. Hedonism, on the other hand, is a philosophy that advocates for the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain. In the Garfield comic book series, this theme is evident in Garfield's constant pursuit of pleasure. Whether it's eating lasagna, sleeping, or tormenting his owner Jon, Garfield is always seeking out ways to maximize his own pleasure and minimize his own pain. This hedonistic philosophy is a stark contrast to the more serious and often somber themes found in other comic book series. reply hassleblad23 34 minutes agoprevI mean.. it works? reply smoghat 41 minutes agoprevIt uncovered a conspiracy nobody is talking about in my conversation with it.

    "originBody": "Goals Syncthing is a continuous file synchronization program. It synchronizes files between two or more computers. We strive to fulfill the goals below. The goals are listed in order of importance, the most important ones first. This is the summary version of the goal list - for more commentary, see the full Goals document. Syncthing should be: Safe From Data Loss Protecting the user's data is paramount. We take every reasonable precaution to avoid corrupting the user's files. Secure Against Attackers Again, protecting the user's data is paramount. Regardless of our other goals, we must never allow the user's data to be susceptible to eavesdropping or modification by unauthorized parties. Easy to Use Syncthing should be approachable, understandable, and inclusive. Automatic User interaction should be required only when absolutely necessary. Universally Available Syncthing should run on every common computer. We are mindful that the latest technology is not always available to every individual. For Individuals Syncthing is primarily about empowering the individual user with safe, secure, and easy to use file synchronization. Everything Else There are many things we care about that don't make it on to the list. It is fine to optimize for these values, as long as they are not in conflict with the stated goals above. Getting Started Take a look at the getting started guide. There are a few examples for keeping Syncthing running in the background on your system in the etc directory. There are also several GUI implementations for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Docker To run Syncthing in Docker, see the Docker README. Getting in Touch The first and best point of contact is the Forum. If you've found something that is clearly a bug, feel free to report it in the GitHub issue tracker. If you believe that you’ve found a Syncthing-related security vulnerability, please report it by emailing security@syncthing.net. Do not report it in the Forum or issue tracker. Building Building Syncthing from source is easy. After extracting the source bundle from a release or checking out git, you just need to run go run build.go and the binaries are created in ./bin. There's a guide with more details on the build process. Signed Releases As of v0.10.15 and onwards, release binaries are GPG signed with the key D26E6ED000654A3E, available from https://syncthing.net/security/ and most key servers. There is also a built-in automatic upgrade mechanism (disabled in some distribution channels) which uses a compiled in ECDSA signature. macOS binaries are also properly code signed.

There doesn't seem to be a good way to resolve conflicts; at least, none that reliably works. reply generalizations 21 hours agorootparentYou have to ensure there's continuity - at least something online and connected at all times, to ensure that the system can know and have distributed the latest version of the files. I just have it running on my desktop, and at this point, the system's been running for nearly 6 years, and the file conflicts are rare. They only happen when I e.g. do edits on my laptop offline, then go home and do more edits on my desktop before letting my laptop sync. reply zelphirkalt 21 hours agoprevSince I started using Syncthing, I have found many cases of \"just make a new folder and share it with selection of other devices\" and now, that I am running it on a server, it is also always online, ready to share with any device that comes online.

There's some weirdness where files I've specified should be always available somehow aren't, but luckily the keepass client keeps an internal/backup copy and is smart enough to open that. iCloud is just...a rolling dumpster fire.

And ChatGPT often throw lots of unnecessary options (sometimes even do harm), so do actually investigate what each switch is supposed to do (ChatGPT can help with that too) if you're going to use the generated command for something semi-serious. If possible, try to keep the switches as few as possible and avoid exotic flags. But do pay attention to pixel format and colorspace options to make your video as compatible as possible. It's very easy to mess things up for doing even seemingly simple tasks (like converting static images to slideshow etc.) reply OptionOfT 32 minutes agorootparentI think this also is a great case to not use the short names of parameters. It allows for much easier searching of parameters. reply Kinrany 7 hours agorootparentprevI have the experience of reading an ffmpeg one-liner (that really took more like five lines with wraparound) and trying to understand it.

I'm not sure I understand reply jbk 8 hours agorootparentNo, no, it's done on GPU. reply IntelMiner 8 hours agorootparentIsn't Nvenc (and its equivalents) based on using a specific ASIC on the GPU, rather than Vulkan which (as I understand it?) is just \"regular\" GPU compute? reply kuschku 8 hours agorootparentMost GPU encoders are part ASIC, part regular GPGPU compute. That's what allowed AMD to increase the quality of their encoders via a driver update, but also why you can't add easily add entirely new codecs. That said, outside of GPUs there are both FPGA-based and pure-ASIC hardware encoders that beat not just NVENC but even software encoding in terms of quality AND performance, such as AMD's Alveo lineup. https://www.amd.com/en/products/accelerators/alveo/ma35d.htm... reply magicalhippo 8 hours agorootparentprevNo, Vulkan has released a standard API for video encoding/decoding[1].

[1]: https://www.khronos.org/assets/uploads/apis/Vulkan-Video-Dee... reply dagmx 3 hours agorootparentprevThe Vulkan APi calls out to the same hardware. The benefit of using it via Vulkan is that you (in theory) don’t need to have multiple APIs for different GPU vendors. reply amaranth 2 hours agorootparentIt's also meant to make it (somewhat) easier to apply various GPGPU filters and scalers before encode or after decode, like HDR tonemapping. The OS usually has some method to do this while keeping the data in the GPU VRAM by passing a handle from one API subsystem to another but if it never leaves Vulkan you don't have to worry about getting that right. reply lostmsu 1 hour agorootparentprevThe Vulkan API is just a common way to access NVENC and its AMD and Intel alternatives. Which is very nifty. Part of the reason for me still being on Windows is that it gives you a common API to hardware encoders. reply EraYaN 8 hours agoparentprevFor your Bluray collection HEVC is still advisable at reasonable bit rates.

There are numerous use cases that can be built on top of this layer. To simplify life for other developers, we decided to solve this non-trivial problem. It's still in its early stages, but it works end-to-end. We're working on this full-time and would love to hear your feedback and suggestions. Get started There are multiple ways to install screenpipe: as a CLI for technical users as a paid desktop app with 1 year updates, priority support, and priority features as a free forever desktop app (but you need to build it yourself).

However, I find it very frustrating that all of the tools that just record your mic or sell a pin or whatever never think about privacy. They seem to take the Google approach that the person who owns the device is allows to consent for everyone else around them (or any data they share with certain people) when that is not ok. That is before talking about the major concern of people doing this at work without their company knowing, bringing it into a meeting and potentially leaking sensitive information. I realize that unfortunately there is nothing that can be done at this point to stop this technology from being used by people, but I just wish the people that were making these tools thought about the fact that you are not asking for the consent of people around you. reply the_snooze 4 hours agoparent>They seem to take the Google approach that the person who owns the device is allows to consent for everyone else around them (or any data they share with certain people) when that is not ok. This is what's often overlooked (intentionally so?) in discussions about privacy. Too much of privacy is framed as \"I am OK with sharing this data.\" But too often the data you hold is actually about other people: contact lists, conversations, associations. When you let a third party sift through your information, you're also making that decision for everyone else you interact with. I think the right way to think about privacy is: even if I have nothing to hide, I respect the agency of those I communicate with, so I won't make that decision to disclose unilaterally. reply nerdjon 4 hours agorootparentI flat out refuse to let an app go through my contacts, there is just no reason for it. Photos is always what I select and never full access. etc. So when one of the social media sites recommends someone I may know, have no other contacts with this person and I recently shared my number with them. I get angry. I will never understand how we got to the point that someone else can consent to a company gathering up my data just because it happens to be on their phone. I don't think it's overlooked, some people talk about it. But a lot of companies try to push it away because they take \"privacy\" seriously while ignoring the consent problem. reply caseyy 2 hours agorootparentWhen I lived in a shared house, Facebook learned about my relation to my housemates without my consent. I didn’t use a single Facebook product at the time and used a VPN on my devices. A few years later, when I signed up to Facebook, my ex-housemates were all “people I may know”. I was wondering for a long time how it knew. I think it was because some of my ex-housemates shared their contacts with FB and it discovered us as a social group. It is really an eye-opening experience to sign up to Facebook for the first time in recent years. It already knows so much about you and your interests. It’s as if there was already a profile with your name on it that they were building, without even approaching to ask for consent. reply techjamie 2 hours agorootparentFacebook has done this for a long time.

I can't use my tech to its fullest extend, like augmenting my own personal recording keeping) or just society to learn how to behave in this new environment - where anyone anywhere can be recording? Remember when cameras started appearing on phones and supposedly phones had to make noises when photos were taken, or when special phone models were made WITHOUT cameras? what happened to those conservative restrictions? Obviously, some personal responsibility on how this personally recorded data is handled, stored and shared must be upheld but I'm skeptical of attempts at banning these new capabilities - specially, as you say, organizations have long been able to do this, just not individuals (not easily at least) reply dbspin 3 hours agorootparentI share your skepticism that rules can contain these technologies. But \"society to learn how to behave in this new environment\" underplays how continuous souveillance [1] limits our individual liberty. So much of our freedom in public (which has declined enormously in my lifetime) comes from our relative anonymity in public spaces. Sure we are being monitored by CCTV and so on, but until very recently we had a basic assurance of freedom to speak and act without being individually identified and monitored. The normalisation of AI + continual recording from audio or video recording devices (say future smart glasses) would create an entirely different order of self consciousness. The chilling effect of a subconscious awareness of being continually observed and recorded precludes many kinds of practical freedom. Political protest, 'controversial' speech, spontaneous performance etc. Just as paradoxically, being able to share our thoughts at any time reduces their value and their capacity to amuse entertain or instate change. Have you ever tried to have a conversation with someone who's filming you with their phone? Or tried to completely forget the 'hot' mic in an interview? There's a basic disingenuousness to performance, and if we're all forced to perform all the time - the healthy space for self is diminished to the interior.

In my case I make it very hard sharing (accessing) pictures of my kids with relatives. Knowing how the big tech hijacking the communication that is used by average folk and how ignorant most are towards privacy implications on others I rather not share pictures except with those few being able to handle secure channel and private thing the way supposed to.

I know that some things that people share with me are more or less sensitive, and I use my knowledge and empathy to decide what I should and shouldn't repeat. I would tell my friend \"Oh yeah, Carl said he can't make it to the party tonight,\" but I wouldn't tell them \"Carl is absent from the party due to an IBS flare-up.\" A well-meaning friend or coworker might never consider telling another person these personal details, but not think twice about it when enabling a service like this. reply drdaeman 52 minutes agorootparentBut service like this doesn't have agency to disclose anything to anyone, does it? As I get it, it's meant for personal use, not for automatically sharing with anyone - although those Notion plugins are a potentially gray area, simply because Notion is a third party. The idea is that if you forgot if Carl can make it or not, you can look in up on your private computer (which is assumed to be reasonably secure against unauthorized access), not that it should somehow act as a virtual secretary and automatically respond to others if Carl can make to a party or not. Doing the former does not create any issues wrt privacy (privacy is about not sharing sensitive data - and there is no data sharing), doing the latter is questionable at best. Recordings increase risks, and it's concerning that I don't see a single word about even the existence of retention policies (and whenever Screenpipe can \"realize\" and go off the record when it detects something sensitive, pausing recording until it notices the topic changes), but besides that I'm not sure how it harms any reasonable privacy. IMHO, trying to prohibit making notes is not really reasonable, but not sharing such notes with anyone without consent is very reasonable (YMMV, of course). reply ImPostingOnHN 2 hours agorootparentprevNeither I nor you would tell people about Carl's IBS if he told us. How would writing down what we are told change things, versus remembering it, considering what we write down wouldn't be shared with anyone but ourselves? How about recording, considering what we record wouldn't be shared with anyone but ourselves? How would somebody suffering from a disability such as hearing loss, vision loss, memory loss, or IBS change that? Should people with disabilities be forced to disclose them whenever they have a conversation? Does that include Carl with IBS? Or would some people with disabilities have to disclose while others are allowed to keep theirs private? reply CaptainFever 1 hour agorootparentprevPlease don't use words like \"hoover\" in relation to data, it makes no sense. This reasoning goes against the Right to Delegate [1]. It doesn't matter if you're remembering it using your brain, a notebook, an assistive tool, or Screenpipe. You're just remembering it. Whether or not you would tell another person these details is another matter altogether, and has no relation to Screenpipe, which does not, from my knowledge, republish your information anywhere else automatically. In summary: we're talking about an auto-remembering tool here. Your example talks about repeating certain sensitive details. There is no relation between your example and the topic on hand. \"But isn't it the same? You're repeating the information to Screenpipe!\" In the context of your example, I consider \"repeating\" to be \"repeating to a person\". See: > A well-meaning friend or coworker might never consider telling another person these personal details, but not think twice about it when enabling a service like this. \"Another person\". Just as you would not think twice about repeating such data to a notebook (e.g. maybe you have bad memory), you also would not think twice about repeating such data to Screenpipe. There are some exceptions, such as confidential information, where you would not be allowed to write things down on a notebook. In those cases, yes, you should not use Screenpipe. But the IBS example does not cover that; a friend, in my experience, generally does not expect such levels of secrecy unless they explicitly request so (e.g. \"Hey, turn off your computer for a while/Hey, don't bring any phones to my house. We need to talk.\"). \"What about phone recording laws?\" Yeah, you're right. That throws a wrench in my argument that automated remembering has no difference to manual remembering. I could say that there ought to be no difference, but you're right that this isn't necessarily the case. I could then argue that this only applies to phone calls, and perhaps video calls. For example, there's no need to get the consent of the people around you in public when you record or take photos, as long as you're not harassing someone. But then this just becomes a legal question (what is) rather than a moral one (what ought to be). [1] https://anewdigitalmanifesto.com/#right-to-delegate reply bbqfog 2 hours agorootparentprevIt is inevitable that this is the direction we're headed. It's already been happening, Google, browser plug-ins... can all read both sides of an email conversation. Your phone can (if it wants) listen to you and those around you.

You still can have a private conversation to which no third parties are privy, you just have to use the right tools and avoid using the tools that don't match your requirements. Even the big tech seem to respect this to some extent, because there is a genuine demand for explicitly end-to-end private conversations, and because it allows companies to avoid liability and keep certain cans of worms closed. I'd say the trends aren't looking strictly antiutopian in this regard, and it's still uncertain how everything is going to turn out. reply goldfeld 2 hours agoparentprevPotentially..

My impression was that it was basically a glorified AIM Chatbot with some hooks into Office to get some context. reply neilv 3 hours agoprevBefore things like this become widespread, can we get some etiquette (and legal awareness)? On one recent videoconf with a startup founder, it turned out that they were using some random AI product with access to video and audio on the call, without my knowledge or consent. (Thanks a lot; now some AI gold rush company has video and audio recording of me, as well as ingested the non-public information on the call.) Their response to me asking about that made me sure I wanted nothing to do with that startup. But some AI company probably still has that private data, and if so, presumably will go on to leak it various ways. And it seems the only way to get an AI goldrush company to actually remove all trace of data it's obtained sketchily/illegally, might be to go legal scorched-earth on the company and its executives, as well as to any affiliates to whom they've leaked. We shouldn't need random people undertaking filing lawsuits and criminal complaints, just because some random other person was oblivious/indifferent about \"consenting\" on their behalf. Which \"consent\" I don't think is legal consent (especially not in \"two-party\" states), but AI goldrush companies don't care, yet. reply cj 2 hours agoparent> Before things like this become widespread, can we get some etiquette (and legal awareness)? I was watching CNBC interview last week with the founder of https://mercor.com/ (backed by Benchmark, $250m valuation). The founder was pitching that their company would take every employee's employment and payroll history (even from prior roles) and use that to make AI recommendations to employers on things like compensation, employee retention, employee performance, etc. The majority of what the founder was describing would clearly be illegal if any human did it by hand. But somehow because a LLM is doing it, it becomes legal. Specific example: In most states it's illegal for a company to ask job candidates what their salary was in prior roles. But suddenly it's no longer illegal if a big company like ADP feeds all the data into a LLM and query against the LLM instead of the raw dataset. Copyright issues wasn't enough to regulate LLMs. But I suspect once we start seeing LLMs used in HR, performance reviews, pay raise decisions, hiring decisions, etc, people will start to care.

I also wish they'd bundled more functionality in the service, so the app could be a simple web front end that uses its API. At a greater level, I've always wanted something like this, but we shouldn't be able to collect info on other people without their permission. The dangers of breaches or abuse are too great. Since corporations are holding back the greatest benefits, we should be able to remember commercial works we've accessed, and collect and organize info on corporations, and some info on governments, but by their nature corporations will be better at getting the upper hand and the resulting attacks on government might not be for the better for society at large. Yes, some parts of some governments conduct abuses which should be called out, but that is specific departments, other departments work to other principles, sometimes pushing back against the abuse.

All OSes are equipped with permissions models that can restrict a SQLite file to use by a single application. reply g_p 1 hour agorootparentThe issue so far seems to be that most OSs don't really have an effective way to restrict that file to a single application. User-oriented filesystem permissions don't work, as all software runs \"as\" the user. If you assume there's a way to restrict permissions by application (a bit like TCC on Mac for certain folders), you need to then go down a rabbit-hole of what matcher you use to decide what is a \"single application\" - Mac OS can use developer Team ID (i.e. app signature identity), or similar. You wouldn't want to rely on path or binary name, as those could be spoofed or modified by a rogue app. So in short, in a multi-user OS, generally the filesystem (asides from Mac OS, under certain circumstances) is fairly widely readable by other software running as the current user.

It is the homogenization of thought and note taking of everyone using AI to record their lives that is the potential problem. reply bondarchuk 5 hours agoparentprev>the pure pursuit of knowledge is becoming a more and more seductive path to destruction. How so? reply vouaobrasil 5 hours agorootparentAs knowledge becomes more powerful in the sense of enabling us to do more things, it becomes more tempting to use it to gain short-term advantages that typically have long-term detrimental consequences. Such as AI for example, which is too quick at disrupting employment or cheap energy to generate bitcoin but is problematic for local energy grids. The more powerful the knowledge, the easier it is for people to ignore the downsides at the expense of fellow human beings. That is especially true because we have an economic system that rewards short-term improvements in the efficiency of the system, regardless of the long-term costs. Fossil fuel use, cutting down local forests (has relatively litle short-term impact, but adds up). And, as we pursue knowledge and technology more vigorously, we slowly lose other forms of gaining knowledge such as a relationship with nature. Human society is advanced with regard to its knowledge capability, but exceptionally primitive with regard to basic wisdom about community, love, nature, and friendship. We continually donwgrade these things to make way for new technology, and the prisoner's dilemma (tech gives some people advantages, so everyone is pressured to use it), makes it hard to make decisions for the long-run like the Amish do. reply CaptainFever 1 hour agoparentprev> we are becoming less and less like human beings and more like technological beings augmented with a biological base I would actually love to be a technological being.

Most researchers favor classical models, based on classical physics, while a minority have argued that consciousness must be quantum in nature, and that its brain basis is a collective quantum vibration of \"microtubule\" proteins inside neurons.New research by Wellesley College professor Mike Wiest and a group of Wellesley College undergraduate students has yielded important experimental results relevant to this debate, by examining how anesthesia affects the brain. Wiest and his research team found that when they gave rats a drug that binds to microtubules, it took the rats significantly longer to fall unconscious under an anesthetic gas. The research team's microtubule-binding drug interfered with the anesthetic action, thus supporting the idea that the anesthetic acts on microtubules to cause unconsciousness. \"Since we don't know of another (i.e,. classical) way that anesthetic binding to microtubules would generally reduce brain activity and cause unconsciousness,\" Wiest says, \"this finding supports the quantum model of consciousness.\" It's hard to overstate the significance of the classical/quantum debate about consciousness, says Wiest, an associate professor of neuroscience at Wellesley. \"When it becomes accepted that the mind is a quantum phenomenon, we will have entered a new era in our understanding of what we are,\" he says. The new approach \"would lead to improved understanding of how anesthesia works, and it would shape our thinking about a wide variety of related questions, such as whether coma patients or non-human animals are conscious, how mysterious drugs like lithium modulate conscious experience to stabilize mood, how diseases like Alzheimer's or schizophrenia affect perception and memory, and so on.\" More broadly, a quantum understanding of consciousness \"gives us a world picture in which we can be connected to the universe in a more natural and holistic way,\" Wiest says. Wiest plans to pursue future research in this field, and hopes to explain and explore the quantum consciousness theory in a book for a general audience. Wellesley students who co-authored the paper with Wiest are Sana Khan '25, Yixiang Huang '25, Derin Timucin '27, Shantelle Bailey '24, Sophia Lee '23, Jessica Lopes '26, Emeline Gaunce '26, Jasmine Mosberger '25, Michelle Zhan '24, Bothina Abdelrahman '26 and Xiran Zeng '27. Published September 1 in eNeuro, the Wellesley study demonstrates that anesthesia works by binding to microtubules inside neurons, thus providing important evidence for a quantum theory of consciousness while reviving a focus on microtubules in anesthesia.

There is an incredible amount of context missing from the article, the quote, and of course discussion in this thread. But my main issue is that you jump from phrasing in the quote, 'supports the model,' to 'must be' which is an underhanded way to make the researcher seem ridiculous. \"We can't come up with anything better, and have ruled out everything we reasonably can at this point in our inquiry, so therefore the findings support the only remaining plausible mechanism\" is literally how science works a lot of the time. It's why the researcher specifically said 'supports the model' not 'must be quantum consciousness,' because this researcher knows and is implicitly acknolwedging there is a whole lot more work to be done. reply Sakos 2 hours agorootparentAgree. It's incredibly frustrating seeing takes on science by engineers on HN. It's as bad as, if not worse than, the takes I see about politics around here. For context, this is what the paper itself says: > In order to experimentally assess the contribution of MTs as functionally relevant targets of volatile anesthetics, we measured latencies to loss of righting reflex (LORR) under 4% isoflurane in male rats injected subcutaneously with vehicle or 0.75 mg/kg of the brain- penetrant MT–stabilizing drug epothilone B (epoB). EpoB-treated rats took an average of 69 s longer to become unconscious as measured by latency to LORR. This was a statistically significant difference corresponding to a standardized mean difference (Cohen’s d) of 1.9, indicating a “large” normalized effect size. The effect could not be accounted for by tolerance from repeated exposure to isoflurane. Our results suggest that binding of the anesthetic gas isoflurane to MTs causes unconsciousness and loss of purpose-ful behavior in rats (and presumably humans and other animals). This finding is predicted by models that posit consciousness as a property of a quantum physical state of neural MTs. > Our study establishes that action on intracellular microtubules (MTs) is the mechanism, or one of the mechanisms, by which the inhalational anesthetic gas isoflurane induces unconsciousness in rats. This finding has potential clinical implications for understanding how taxane chemotherapy interferes with anesthesia in humans and more broadly for avoiding anesthesia failures during surgery. Our results are also theoretically important because they provide support for MT-based theories of anesthetic action and consciousness. Let me emphasize: > This finding is predicted by models that posit consciousness as a property of a quantum physical state of neural MTs. If people here want to criticize the paper, I want to see some citations of passages from the fucking paper, and not some hur-dur quote from a popular science article meant to convey the paper to a lay audience. But you know, 99% of the paper would be indecipherable to most people here, so all we get is these surface level takes that wastes everybody's time. The intellectual laziness in these comments is galling. reply kurthr 1 hour agorootparentI'm all for a rant on how computer science isn't, but this attack on only the comments seems a bit over the top. Why not attack the posting of the pop-sci article with quotes so bad in the first place? My issue with the ScienceDaily and even the original eNeuro article isn't with individual quotes, but with the apparent motivated reasoning of the papers. I'm generally aware of the field quantum-consciousness, Orch OR, and with Penrose's theories. I'm also aware of the funding/publishing methods in science and this looks a bit weak. The evidence is, we didn't find another mechanism. That there had to be corrections on supporting research, which included the names of additional funders (Templeton Foundation) is also not a wonderful sign (if you know you know). The actual article research covers the effect of epoB on tolerance and latency of anesthesia in rats, which support the action of isoflurane on microtubules (MT) as at least one mechanism. There is a bunch of other stuff about quantum consciousness that reads like a review paper. Quantum is mentioned 58 times and plays no role in their actual measurement or results. https://www.eneuro.org/content/11/8/ENEURO.0291-24.2024 I actually didn't find the paper that hard to read, it's mostly basic science and huge review of Orch OR. I don't consider it a big prestigious journal, and I don't recognize names on it, but the actual results (limited as they are) don't seem outrageous or unsupported. I'm also not sure they're that interesting unless you already have a fringe theory to support. reply pulvinar 1 hour agorootparentprevI'll bite. This paper doesn't show anything beyond an anesthetic's possible effect on microtubules, assuming it's reproducible. I see nothing about ruling out other pathways that may also affect consciousness. That big leap from MT to consciousness is still there, for which there are plenty of solid criticisms [0] by other respected scientists. [0]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestrated_objective_reducti... reply astrobe_ 1 hour agorootparentprevOP's criticism was useful, because there is indeed a gap that needed to be filled and you did just that, thanks. Conversely it would have been bad to take what the article says at face value - that's how you end up believing in astrology. Even Nobel prize winners can go terribly wrong, after all [1]. But as you said, not everyone has the knowledge or time to dig the connection between the two statements out of the paper. I can only suggest to ask questions when one does not understand something; sarcasm in particular can backfire hard when you're wrong.

Just that it 'lends support' for that explanation. reply mewpmewp2 4 minutes agorootparentHow does it \"support\" or \"lend support\", wouldn't it be more correct to say \"it doesn't rule out\" and which likely seems a bit pointless statement so why bring it in, in the first place?

After 30 years it continues to have very serious problems and is generally rejected by physicists, mathematicians, computer scientists, and philosophers. [0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestrated_objective_reducti... reply halifaxbeard 5 hours agoparentI recently explained my personal beliefs around how you square free-will and determinism (and subsequently consciousness) to GPT-4 and it told me this was the more formal name for it. I posited that if you can observe and reconstruct the entire state of a complex system then you can predict future states- score one for determinism and no free will. But, we know there exists places that we cannot directly observe or perceive, aka quantum uncertainty, represented by σxσp ≥ ℏ/2 [1]. So based completely in theory, I figure the only way we square FW & determinism, is that free will exists somewhere/in a form we cannot directly observe, and it manifests as tiny influences that add up, in the complex system that is a brain. This is the way more speculative part and it's more fun than anything to think about- it doesn't change the way I live my life buuuut- Folded brains dramatically increase the influence a given region in space-time can have, simply due to the increased number of neurons. So our brains double as an antenna for some unseen influence that manifests through quantum uncertainty. So when I explained this to ChatGPT it told me that OORT was very similar to this, but even the mechanism they use for it seems to be a stretch for me. edit: But I do think that in order for neural networks to become anything other than outwardly really really good approximations of human minds, there needs to be a way to introduce a small amount of genuine randomness into their calculations, without utterly breaking them. I could see early attempts at doing this causing a form of LLM schizophrenia because the neural network wasn't resilient enough to the induced error. [1] the standard deviation of position σx and the standard deviation of momentum σp is greater than or equal to half the reduced planck's constant reply ted_dunning 5 hours agorootparentYou can get to this conclusion more directly by noting that computational complexity of any Turing simulator of anything more than a trivial system increases very fast as the precision of the initial conditions for the simulation increases. Even the shift map exhibits this phenomenon. This can be an even more severe boundary for prediction than the actual measurement accuracy. In the discussion about determinism vs free will, this leaves us with the situation that we can predict what somebody will do even if we assume perfect measurements, but will only be able to produce this prediction after the fact except for very short term predictions. reply dist-epoch 4 hours agorootparentStephen Wolfram calls this computational irreducibility. reply n4r9 4 hours agorootparentprevYou've outlined what I reckon is the appeal of \"quantum consciousness\". I personally feel that randomness doesn't help to explain free will any more than determinism. I'm more inclined to believe that free will (in the strictest sense) is an illusion. reply carlmr 4 hours agorootparentThe problem with this approach is that even if you say that our thinking is non-deterministic because of true random effects on the quantum level, you still have to explain how deterministic calculations on random values make for free will. You still have no influence on it, even if there is randomness involved. reply cogman10 2 hours agorootparentYou also have to explain why will is changed when the brain is damaged. Really hard to justify free will (IMO) when a person's entire personality can be fundamentally altered by a bash to the head. What does \"free will\" mean if everything that makes you you can be changed with, say, a lobotomy. It is, at best, an illusion and nothing more. reply The_Colonel 4 hours agorootparentprev> free will (in the strictest sense) In what sense? Can you produce a strict definition, what is \"free will\", what is \"illusion\"? This is a battle of definitions. Pick the definitions you like, and you can prove what you set out to prove. reply n4r9 4 hours agorootparentThe \"strictest sense\" is something like: 1. We have control over our decisions 2. Our decisions are independent of past events I agree that this is pretty hand-wavey and open to semantics. But I don't think that there is any realistic, coherent way to interpret and reconcile the above two statements [edit - without resorting to some kind of non-physicalism e.g. God, spirit planes... ]. reply Filligree 2 hours agorootparentNot even a six-year-old would believe #2. It’s endlessly fascinating that there are people who do, but most people realise their past affects their future decisions. reply Spacecosmonaut 4 hours agorootparentprevRandomness just introduces branch points into the linear flow of deterministic states. Since you do not control the branch points or create them, this does not give you free will. reply jmcqk6 1 hour agorootparentprevThis is possibly one way to solve it, but I think there is a simpler way, following causal chains and the laws of thermodynamics. We clearly have systems that can absorb energy for later use - creating a natural \"pause\" in the causal chain. Each of these pauses create a possible future that is not yet realized. The longer this energy is held, the larger this possibility space becomes. Free will becomes that ability to hold the pause with intention, and then select from the different possible futures that have been created. Determinism does not interfere with this in any way. The causal chains all follow the basic deterministic laws of physics. There is space for choice created by holding energy instead of immediately dissipating it. No quantum mechanics required at all. reply MattPalmer1086 3 hours agorootparentprevRandomness does not give you free will, any more than determinism does. What do you mean by free will? reply lupusreal 2 hours agorootparentExactly. If determinism is incompatible with somebody's personal meaning of free will, quantum dice rolls are hardly a solution. What they really need is to either find a religion or just shrug off philosophy and get on with their life, behaving as if they have free will even if they can't rationally justify it. reply IWeldMelons 2 hours agorootparentQuantum dice roll is _the free will_ in this context. So your free will is what sets the dice; as it is extraphysical, it will look like randomness in the physical world. reply lupusreal 58 minutes agorootparentThat's not quantum physics, that's just some sort of new-age religion. A new variation on the \"brains are antenna for the soul\" idea. reply bbor 5 hours agorootparentprevWhy would “my decisions are determined by sub-nuclear divine dice rolls” be any closer to free will than “my decisions are determined by algorithms operating on my sensory inputs and memories”? What’s more “free” about introducing that factor? reply samatman 45 minutes agorootparentprev> free will exists somewhere/in a form we cannot directly observe John Conway has a rather neat explanation of this in the Strong Free Will Theorem. https://www.ams.org/notices/200902/rtx090200226p.pdf Being neat doesn't necessarily mean it's correct, but it's compatible with what we know about physical reality, and solves some otherwise rather tough and paradoxical facts about experienced reality, so I'm a fan. reply im3w1l 5 hours agorootparentprevWe don't actually know if quantum physics has real randomness or not. Quantum collapse is an unsolved problem. > I could see early attempts at [introducing randomness] causing a form of LLM schizophrenia because the neural network wasn't resilient enough to the induced error. 1. This is actually already done. Temperature parameter controls amount of randomness. 2. Neural networks are quite noise resistant. reply Filligree 5 hours agorootparentThe temperature parameter doesn’t introduce any noise into the network evaluation. Typically, what happens is that the network outputs a set of possible tokens with different probabilities, and a sampler picks from the top possibilities. Temperature determines how spiky its pick is; at zero it’ll always pick the top option. reply tsimionescu 5 hours agorootparentprev> But, we know there exists places that we cannot directly observe or perceive, aka quantum uncertainty, represented by σxσp ≥ ℏ/2 [1]. > So based completely in theory, I figure the only way we square FW & determinism, is that free will exists somewhere/in a form we cannot directly observe, and it manifests as tiny influences that add up, in the complex system that is a brain. These two things not only don't follow from each other, the first one actually all but refutes the second. First of all, Heisenberg uncertainty affects all physical systems, but clearly not all physical systems are conscious. Second of all, there is no pattern allowed to exist below Heisenberg uncertainty. That is, if you could determine exactly the momentum of a particle, the particle could literally be anywhere in the universe, with equal probability: there is no bias, it wouldn't be more likely to be here or there. So this is pure randomness, there is no \"consciousness signal\" you could extract from it. Or, to put it another way, if our consciousness was a result of Heisenberg uncertainty, that would mean it's a purely random phenomenon, and every human at every time would be exactly as likely to type the next word in this comment, start running in a random direction, gouge out one eye, or any other thing they are capable of doing. There is, in a very fundamental sense, no way to get patterns or intention out of Heisenberg uncertainty. Besides, the best way to square \"free will\" with determinism is Compatibilism. Every human is an automaton whose behavior is fully determined by genetic and epigenetic make-up and by everything they've ever learned and otherwise experienced. In a fundamental sense, my whole life's course was determined the moment I was conceived; but still, in any given situation, what I will do is different from someone else might do, because they have a different history and thus different values and biases. There is no magic that allows some \"fundamental me\" to \"choose\" how some electro-chemical processes will fire in my brain, any more than I could \"choose\" to emit electrons from the tips of my fingers. But that doesn't mean that I (the adult I am today) would do the same things Hitler did if I were somehow catapulted into his shoes today. reply maxerickson 5 hours agorootparentprevWhat does it matter why you can't predict the future state of a brain? reply Bloedcoins 4 hours agorootparentIf you can't, we have free will.

(No it isn't) reply Bloedcoins 4 hours agorootparentprevIf why means because there is a real randomness: we have free will. If its just because of current complexlity, we don't have free will. It also implies that we might life this life over and over forever. reply jerf 4 hours agorootparentprevThis is a very common error people make when considering \"free will\". They mix in \"predictability\" to the concept. But predictability is not \"free will\". If I give you a choice between a million dollars or a painful lingering tortuous death, you will with for-the-sake-of-argument 100% choose the million dollars, of your own free will. It is no less what you will for the fact that anybody can predict it; it is certainly what you will. Will you deny that is what you will? Predictability also brings in a lot of contingency that people do not generally realize they are bringing in. If the universe is entirely material and there is no external reality, then good news! Your actions are already unpredictable. No conceivable machine built within the real physical universe could possibly fully predict your actions; you can prove this with some information theory considerations (the amount of information your actions leak about your internal state is not sufficient to nail down that internal state fully). So you have free will! Yet... if the universe is entirely material and there is no external reality, the universe may still be fully deterministic. Contrary to somewhat popular opinion, quantum mechanics is not intrinsically nondeterministic. It means you can't determine the outcome of certain events with any process we know from the inside, but the entire universe can absolutely have some sort of PRNG or something to determine everything that is going on and it could all be deterministic in ways that still work for QM. In which case, oops, no free will for you. So by this definition, the question is unanswerable from the inside. Unpredictability is not free will either. If by some amazing, but physically possible, set of circumstances, the decision about whether to turn left or right came down to one 50/50 outcome decided by a quantum waveform collapse, that still doesn't give you \"free will\" about the outcome. You don't get to pick the outcome. It was undecided and unpredictable, but it wasn't decided by your \"will\" either. If you're still not having enough fun yet, suppose \"quantum\" does \"solve\" free will. Which quantum outcomes make the difference? Suppose I build a perfectly-feasible quantum device[1] to flip a random coin, quantumly. Compare to a supposed quantum decision made \"in\" my \"brain\". How exactly is it that the latter is my \"quantum free will\" whereas the former is just a random decision made out in the universe? Just labeling a process \"quantum\" doesn't do anything. It's just wordplay in the end, substituting one undefinable term for another and calling it progress. There's still a crapton of work to show that the \"quantum\" provides the mechanism for \"something else\" to meaningfully interact with the world[2]. My \"will\" is not \"randomness\". And boy-oh-boy is that \"something else\" a can of worms of its own.

Yes but AFAIK, reality is \"quantum\" in the sense that something like the scale of Avogadro's number (N=10^23) quantum processes interact and average out to typical classical behavior. It's only in limited situations where the actual quantum mechanical nature pops up in the macro world, right? (eg Bose-Einstein condensate, the ultraviolet catastrophe, energy bands of semiconductors, emission spectra, etc). The idea that Penrose posited is intrinsically HARD to measure. Moreover, consciousness itself is not well defined to begin with. If anything, it appears that neural networks are far further along than any quantum mechanism for approximating whatever \"consciousness\" actually is?

If one could create consciousness with classical physics it wouldn't prove anything about how the human brain works. In fact if it was wildly less power efficient it might even suggest non-classical physics in the brain. reply danhau 2 hours agorootparentprev> If anything, it appears that neural networks are far further along than any quantum mechanism for approximating whatever \"consciousness\" actually is? And neural networks are absolutely not quantum mechanical. I know next to nothing about either, but I wanna try to disagree with that. LLMs fool people into believing they‘re conscious, because they‘ve been trained on extraordinary amounts of thoughts and data outputted by the world‘s top conscious creature. They appear conscious because consciousness is in the training data. To me, neural networks more closely mimic the brain in what I would (poorly) call „bodily functions“. I include language processing and speech in this definition. There are people that don‘t have an inner monologue - which is totally fascinating to me - who are perfectly conscious like everyone else. Simon Roper, who doesn‘t, has fascinating YouTube videos on these topics. reply tsimionescu 4 hours agorootparentprev> Yes but AFAIK, reality is \"quantum\" in the sense that something like the scale of Avogadro's number (N=10^23) quantum processes interact and average out to typical classical behavior. It's only in limited situations where the actual quantum mechanical nature pops up in the macro world, right? (eg Bose-Einstein condensate, the ultraviolet catastrophe, energy bands of semiconductors, emission spectra, etc). This is not very clear at the moment. Of course, observations make it obvious that classical objects don't behave like quantum objects, and all quantum objects we know of are small, and all classical objects are big. We even know of one mechanism that prevents certain quantum effects from influencing large systems - decoherence. Decoherence explains why, when a quantum system that is all in the same phase interacts with a large system where everything is out of phase, the various parts of the quantum system also quickly go out of phase, and thus can't constructively or destructively interfere with each other any more. This explains for example why, if you repeat the double-slit experiment with ping pong balls instead of atoms, or if you repeat it in a dense gas at high temperature, you won't see the interference patterns form. However, we don't understand at a high level why it is that quantum experiments only have \"a single result\". Basically the schrodinger equation applied for the double slit experiment, even taking decoherence into account, still predicts that the particle-wave will move through both slits to some extent. And yet, with or without decoherence, we only ever see a single photon or tennis ball hit the screen, with some probability that can be deduced from the square of the amplitude of the Schrodinger function. And even worse, this single measurement outcome only happens if the quantum particle has hit a classical screen. If instead at the same distance we only have other quantum particles, then it can actually hit several of them, and change all of their positions and momenta. This despite the fact that, of course, even the classical wall itself is made of particles which should obey the same laws of quantum mechanics. reply tasty_freeze 4 hours agorootparent> all quantum objects we know of are small There are quantum effects that manifest at macroscopic scale.

Using the Schrodinger formulation it is invalid to talk about two particles having separate wavefunctions like ψ(x₁) and ψ(x₂) but rather you have a single wavefunction written ψ(x₁,x₂) and in the case of Fermions you have ψ(x₁,x₂) = -ψ(x₂,x₁) and for Bosons you have ψ(x₁,x₂) = ψ(x₂,x₁). People get confused about EPR because they think the world is ψ(x₁) and ψ(x₂) when it is really ψ(x₁,x₂). reply adrian_b 2 hours agorootparentHaving a single wavefunction just corresponds to the normal rule for the probabilities of events that are not independent. I still do not see any connection with \"quantum entanglement\". Quantum entanglement is a very special case of the single wavefunction, not frequently encountered at large scales. In the general case that is valid for almost everything around us that single wavefunction differs only slightly from the product of many simpler wavefunctions that correspond to parts of the environment between which the interactions are non-existent or minimal. reply PaulHoule 2 hours agorootparentIt would be just a probability of the wavefunction were real valued.

There have been theories about the quantum nature of of consciousness for a while but the microtubule theory is pretty new. reply vixen99 2 hours agoparentprevAs suggested in another comment: Shadows of the Mind\" by Roger Penrose in his chapter Quantum theory and the brain*. reply adrian_b 3 hours agoprevThe actual research paper: https://www.eneuro.org/content/11/8/ENEURO.0291-24.2024 The language of the research paper is much better than that of the parent article, but it still uses the word \"quantum\" spuriously, without defining what they mean by that. As others posters have also noticed, the only experimental result is a confirmation of the older hypothesis that the microtubules must have some role in the normal operation of a neuron and when that role is impaired consciousness is lost. The mechanism of how the microtubules work is determined by quantum physics as for anything else of molecular sizes and it is neither more quantum nor less quantum than how other cellular organelles work. The research paper appears to use \"quantum\" with a special meaning, which however is not explained clearly. The protein molecules that compose a microtubule have various vibrational states, like any other molecules. Normally, the vibrational state of a certain molecule is one of the possible vibrational states, chosen at random with a probability distribution that is a function of temperature. What the authors appear to believe is that the vibrational states of the microtubules are not random, but many microtubules, including from different neurons, might be in the same vibrational state. However any such theory needs to be described with a great amount of detail, in order to be falsifiable. A microtubule is composed from many molecules of proteins, of several different kinds of proteins. The different protein molecules have different kinds of vibrational states. They do not say if in their theory all the protein molecules of a microtubule must be in the same state and which will be the correspondence between the vibrational states of different protein molecules, which cannot be the same. Normally, any molecule remains in a given vibrational state only for an extremely short duration, because at normal temperatures it interacts with the neighboring molecules, exchanging energy with them and transitioning to a different vibrational state, chosen at random. The paper does not give any explanation about what would prevent a microtubule to transition to another vibrational state, or if the transitions are acknowledged to happen, what would make any other microtubule to transition in the same way. Even supposing that the vibrational states of distant microtubules would somehow be synchronized at a given time moment, the paper does not mention any mechanism by which such a synchronization could affect in any way the functions of the neurons. So all the references to \"quantum\" in the paper are just some kind of mumbo-jumbo that does not provide any information about what they mean by it. What remains is that the microtubules must indeed have a crucial role inside a neuron, which is not yet understood. The paper itself mentions the most plausible role of the microtubules. The microtubules, which are molecular motors capable of contraction, are normally used for the transport inside a cell of various cell components. They might be involved in the transport towards the synapses of the neurotransmitters. reply NotYourLawyer 2 hours agoprevInteresting result, but it seems doubtful that we’ll ever understand consciousness without some huge new theoretical framework. https://dynomight.net/consciousness/ reply Aqueous 4 hours agoprevWhat's odd about the current moment is that in the very same era in which it seems there is conclusive evidence (LLMs) that quantum explanations are not necessary to explain at the very least linguistic intelligence as advanced linguistic intelligence is possible in a purely classical computing domain, there is at the same time an insistence elsewhere that consciousness must be a quantum phenemonon. Frankly I am increasingly skeptical that this is the case. LLMs show that intelligence is at least mostly algorithmic, and the brain is far too warm and wet for quantum effects to dominate. Why should intelligence be purely classical but consciousness (another brain phenemenon) be quantum?

LLMs can complete almost any code I write with high accuracy given sufficient context. I can have a naturalistic dialog with an LLM that goes on for hours in multiple languages. Frankly (and humblingly, and frighteningly) they have already surpassed my own knowledge and intelligence in many, probably most, domains.

Each and every LLM (by design) is uncapable of having arbitrary long conversation as it has finite context window, and hallucinate left and right. But that is all irrelevant, as Penroses point is not about that. In fact what Penrose saying is that LLMs are Searles Chinese rooms, as they lack qualia, and he offers quantum processes as basis for the qualia, however vagues it sounds. So the point is not intelligence, not consciosness; cats arguably has less intelligence than LLM, but they clearly have emotions and are conscious. reply Aqueous 2 hours agorootparentAnyone who thinks LLMs have not come a long way in approximating human linguistic capabilities (and associated thinking) are in fact, engaging in (delusional) wishful thinking regarding human exceptionalism. With respect to consciousness, you are doing nothing more than asserting a special domain inside the brain that, unlike the rest of the mechanisms of the brain, has special \"magic\" that creates qualia where classical mechanisms cannot. You are saying that there is possibly a different explanation for intelligence as consciousness, when it would be much simpler to say the same mechanisms explain both. Furthermore, you have no explanation for why this quantum \"magic\", even if it was there, would solve the hard problem of consciousness - you are just saying that it does. Why should quanta lend themselves anymore to the possibility of subjective experience/qualia than classical systems? Finally, a brain operates at 98.6° and we can't even create verifiable quantum computing effects at near absolute zero, the only place where theory and experiment both agree is the place quantum effects start to dominate. The burden of proof is on you and Penrose as what you are both saying is wildly at odds with both physics, experimental and theoretical, and recent advancements in computing.

His \"I can do math because I am a thetan\" shtick is based on a ridiculous misunderstanding of Godel since Godel's theorems don't apply to a piece of wetware which is by no means consistent or complete. (e.g. if he does math by being a thetan why can't he solve Collatz?) Wolfram is something else. A New Kind of Science isn't really wrong yet it's not really right. It's sad to see him spend decades looking for more systems like Rule 30 and finding systems that are similar but not so simple, not so pretty, and he never gets an insight out of it that really applies to anything else. He's like a crackpot in that he works tirelessly on a research program that's unconnected to anything else anyone else is working on, however. Maybe that comes out of being rich and not having to apply for grants. On the other hand, there are major fields of physics, such as string theory, which very well be based on a delusion, yet in that case it is a shared delusion. In the pandemic he went on a vainglorious and grandiose quest for a \"theory of everything\" yet he has the good judgement to base it on causal networks which I think is one of the best grounded approaches to quantum gravity (e.g. given two points in space-time aren't they spacelike or timelike or lightlike and in the last two cases isn't one of them in the future or past of the other?) reply teekert 2 hours agorootparentYou're downvoted but Penrose has really deteriorated indeed, he's way out of his field of expertise nowadays.

Surprise! reply PaulHoule 3 hours agorootparentYeah, but talking about grand unification of any kind in 2024 seems to be besides the point. Newton postulated a relationship between physics on Earth and the cosmos, specifically that a single theory of gravity explains objects falling here and the moon orbiting around the Earth, planets going around the Sun, etc. Astronomical measurements show quite clearly that there either (1) there is a sector of hidden particles and fields responsible for most of the mass of the universe or (2) gravity and/or inertia (two sides of the same coin?) don't behave the same way at the galaxy scale as the solar system scale. Either way Newton's connection has broken down, so the physics we know is not the physics of the real world. The microphysics of MOND are baffling; it's not hard to imagine some particles and fields that explain dark matter but impossible to prove that any of them are for real unless we get a breakthrough in experiment that can rule some of them out. reply tucnak 2 hours agorootparentThank you, it's always interesting to hear physicists talk about this stuff :-) reply vixen99 2 hours agoparentprevSo it's a case of 'Take it from me, I'm an expert and it's nonsense' is it? Presumably no one needs to read any further on this topic. A relief to many no doubt. reply teekert 2 hours agorootparentBasically… yes. I mean I have an internal model in the making since I started my biochemistry bachelor in 1999, I moved through a molecular biology master into a biophysics PhD (where I also disrupted microtubules to investigate molecular processes of GPCRs), then into a professional career as a bioinformatician in the genomics field. And when I read this: “Wiest and his research team found that when they gave rats a drug that binds to microtubules, it took the rats significantly longer to fall unconscious under an anesthetic gas. The research team's microtubule-binding drug interfered with the anesthetic action, thus supporting the idea that the anesthetic acts on microtubules to cause unconsciousness.” It certainly sounds probable microtubule disruption would do that but there are so insanely many ways that this could be explained using classical, non-quantum hypotheses (that need testing!), and microtubules serve so many different functions in cells, that the quantum theory falls completely outside of the possibilities of my internal models. I have no need of such an outlandish hypothesis. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and this paper is not it. Sure there is a small chance I’m going to be wrong but Bayes would agree with me it’s an exceedingly small chance given all priors. Just the scale difference between microtubules and whatever gives our brain that sense of consciousness is so unimaginably vast and complex that simple statements such as in TFA are really hinting at (feigned for attention?) ignorance.

Wow, that’s absurdly biased. Talk about jumping to conclusions! Here’s the actual paper: https://www.eneuro.org/content/11/8/ENEURO.0291-24.2024 Take this summary, for example: Cytoskeletal microtubules (MTs) have been considered as a candidate target of anesthetic action for over 50 years (Allison and Nunn, 1968; S. Hameroff, 1998). Other membrane receptor and ion channel proteins were ruled out as possible unitary targets by exhaustive studies culminating in Eger et al. (2008). However, MTs (composed of tubulin subunits) were not ruled out and remain a candidate for a unitary site of anesthetic action. But if you actually click the paper: The essay continues with an examination of the potential contributions of specific ligand-gated channels, concluding that one or two such channels (e.g., glycine) might play a role, but that present evidence suggests that no one channel can explain more than a portion of anesthetic-induced immobility. Voltage-gated potassium channels seem unable to explain the production of immobility, but the voltage-gated sodium channels remain a plausible candidate. How inhaled anesthetics act to block this and other sites remains a mystery, but some new concepts are proposed. Sure, it could be microtubules, it’s not ruled out by that paper - they also don’t rule out witchcraft or god or little tiny ratmen that run the brain. I don’t understand how that absurdly misleading citation usage got through peer review; it makes it seem like MTs are one of the few remaining answers, which is very far from the truth. The other big paper in the intro is this one from Hammerhoff n co: We found that these gases alter collective terahertz dipole oscillations in a manner that is correlated with their anesthetic potency. It doesn’t take a neuroscientist to see that “anesthetics impede one kind of electrical (atom? Quantum?) activity in the brain” is far from proving “that activity is essential for consciousness”. To adapt the old SMBC joke: a bullet would impede terahertz dipole oscillations in the brain, too! I would consider this study — and today’s, really - as confirming that we can’t say for sure that it’s not related to microtubules. Which, hey, that’s useful science! But the way they described it to this science journalist is just intellectually disrespectful, and incredibly misleading. IMO, as someone with a PhD in DoingMyOwnResearch ;) They casually drop this then move on never to mention it again, which I feel like is a fantastical example of scientific bias via burying the lede: Isoflurane directly activates sleep-promoting neurons of the hypothalamic ventrolateral preoptic nucleus, and this contributes to causing unconsciousness. And this: It is conceivable that binding to MTs by volatile anesthetics could impair intracellular transport, which might disrupt synaptic transmission, which might reduce neural activity generally. Yeah… yeah that does sound conceivable. “Anesthetics inhibit neurons” seems a LOT more likely than “anesthetics inhibit the unimaginably tiny + completely unexplained quantum entanglements that control neurons”. They then, briefly, repeat my exact criticism from above. Somehow this didnt seem important enough for the journalist to quote, tho? Namely: Our results are potentially consistent with classical models of consciousness, but they represent a more stringent test of these MT-based models Where “test” means “doesn’t yet rule out”. Overall the Orch OR theory, in which MTs mediate anesthetic action, has more explanatory power, biological connection, and experimental validation than the classical theories. That is an absurd summary of the available evidence. Just absurd. Even if you restrict it just to the papers they cite here. And then, wow, it ends. I really really want to support these folks as a fellow brain/consciousness crank, but they make it hard. If you’re on the fence on whether they’re fairly framing the results of this (n=8!!) study or not, just read the last sentence: These recent technical developments support the hope that “some who are standing here will not taste death before they see” conclusive experimental tests of the quantum consciousness hypothesis. reply dekhn 2 hours agoparentYou're absolutely right to point out all the methological errors their chain of thought shows.

Quantum woo was such a way, a least he believes, so he decided that must be what's going on. Later, microtubules were determined to be the most plausible quantum woo found in brains so far.
