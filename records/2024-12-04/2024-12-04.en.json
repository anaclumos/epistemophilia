I came across one with zero views, and there's something so intimate and exciting about being the first person to watch an ancient home video (even if it's shaky handycam footage of a horse, narrated in Russian). As an aside, hats off to Google to being able to serve an 11 year old video with no noticeable delay from what must be the coldest of caches. reply mattlondon 6 hours agoparentI felt slightly uneasy myself - the first thing I saw was a mum laying on her bed doing a selfie-video with two small kids (probably between 2 and 4 years old) singing a song to daddy. That felt like a total invasion of their private lives. I've had the same videos from my own kids, and while there is nothing embarrassing or shameful about it, it's not something I'd want broadcasted. Maybe it hit a nerve for me as it is so very very similar to my own life right now. Sure yeah they uploaded it to YouTube and it's public but it still felt wrong to watch that. Kinda ruined my day a bit - feel kinda bad for viewing it. reply kevinsync 3 hours agorootparentThat slight unease used to permeate the entire internet (and made it exciting and genuinely thrilling!), and now that you've articulated it out loud it makes me think it's a critical missing part to all those \"nostalgia for the old web\" thinkpieces people love to write these days. Granted, I was a teenager in the 90's literally growing up into the world as the web grew up around me, so there was slight unease in all aspects of life, but that feeling of the unknown, of not totally being sure what you're going to discover (good or bad) when you surf from link to link, maybe that's really what's missing in the sanitized, commodified 2024 internet. Or maybe I'm just overthinking it lol reply wholinator2 2 hours agorootparentNah, i agree. I'm a little younger but i distinctly remember adults around me heavily warning about using the internet and especially putting anything about yourself into it. There was a great distrust between people and the internet in the early 2000's, but then kids got ipods that could text and call, and network effects meant that you _had_ to be on Facebook, and slowly over time Facebook and MySpace started to not feel like the danger zone, like it was separate from all those warnings cause it was just you and your friends chatting at 2:00a.m., nobody was gonna bother to look at you. Then the social media empires grew and expanded and it kinda became the entire internet (that people use) started to feel like not the danger zone. You could do anything there, and huge company's would create walled gardens that would hide the worst aspects and let you pretend it was a safe and open place, to their benefit of course. Adults stopped warning, kids became adults, and now to hear a warning about the internet is incredibly rare. We also just think that there's so much shit there, nobody would take the time to notice us, and everyone else is posting their entire lives anyways so why not? Strange times reply johnisgood 1 hour agorootparentI wonder if the no warning part is a consequence of too much moderation, so people think everything or most thing is so moderated it no longer warrants a warning? reply mdanger007 4 hours agorootparentprevRuined your day? Although it is undoubtedly tech voyeurism the fact that these observations occur in every day life and don’t violate people’s privacy I would just like to invite you to get out more. reply supplied_demand 3 hours agorootparent==occur in every day life and don’t violate people’s privacy== Plenty of things happen in every day life, but are private (sex, break-ups, proposals, Dr. visits, etc.). I also noticed lots of these videos have people in the background. I doubt they were they notified that a video was being taken and uploaded publicly. ==I would just like to invite you to get out more.== Maybe an alternative is to invite yourself to ask questions about why there are multiple comments with the same sentiment rather than reflexively telling them how to feel/act? reply Dylan16807 51 minutes agorootparent> multiple comments with the same sentiment Multiple comments saying it felt creepy or multiple comments saying it ruined their day to any extent? Those aren't the same thing. reply supplied_demand 29 minutes agorootparentThere is literally a comment thanking the person who made the original comment because they felt the exact same way. ==Thanks - that's exactly how I felt after watching a view videos== The original comment was a long explanation that ended with: ==Kinda ruined my day a bit== Seems like pretty tame language to get worked up about, I see two qualifiers in merely 6 words. reply Dylan16807 23 minutes agorootparentWithout more clarification, I am unsure about whether feeling the same applies to the day ruining or just the direct reaction. > Seems like pretty tame language to get worked up about, I see two qualifiers in merely 6 words. I don't think anyone here is worked up. reply mattlondon 3 hours agorootparentprevI don't think it is invading their privacy-with-a-big-P (after all I have no idea who these people are or where the lived etc), it is more just socially it felt inappropriate. I think if a young family was sat on a park bench doing this and you went and sat on the bench between the mother and the father it would be considered at the least incredibly rude and inappropriate. Even if they are in a public place and you are not technically violating any laws, you'd still be acting in a way that most people would disagree with. This is what it felt like to me. reply hoten 1 hour agorootparentIf I can tweak the metaphor, it's more like sitting on a vantage point within the park and peering at them with binoculars, far enough away that they can't see. It's still ick but definitely intrudes on them far less. reply fluoridation 5 minutes agorootparentNo, it's more like someone took a photo of themselves to show to their family, and after they were done with it they left it on a bench in a park (perhaps not realizing that the photo wouldn't magically go away on its own), and a long long time afterwards someone happened to stumble upon it and look at it. lukan 3 hours agorootparentprev\"don’t violate people’s privacy\" Did you asked the kids in the videos (who are grownups or teenagers now) if they are ok with random strangers watching their kids life? Also I would doubt, that most people were aware, that they were uploading the video to the general public. So there are surely worse things going on, but I also felt uneasy after watching such private videos. reply arethuza 6 hours agorootparentprevThanks - that's exactly how I felt after watching a view videos - I came away feeling a bit disturbed - largely because the things I watched were very wholesome but also very private. reply stronglikedan 3 hours agorootparent> very private very explicitly uploaded with the intent that others would see it reply latexr 3 hours agorootparentWe don’t know that. As per the webpage, this could’ve been uploaded directly from the Photos app on an iPhone, by people who didn’t really understand the consequences. Maybe they uploaded it and thought they’d get a private link to share with one specific person. Most people are not tech savvy and don’t fully understand the possible ramifications of their sharing. reply dimator 1 hour agorootparentThe fact that many of these have exactly 0 views makes it totally plausible that the uploaders had no idea that this video existed. reply steve_adams_86 1 hour agorootparentprevI can imagine people thinking \"YouTube\" was a video service for You, indicating that you'd be uploading something private for You to share as desired. It sounds crazy now, but having worked with people a lot to make software that makes sense to them, this... Is not far fetched in the slightest. reply dan353hehe 1 hour agorootparentprevYeah I just got a video of an infant taking a bath. I have small kids my self so nothing new, but not something I would want on the internet for everyone to see. And I doubt that the mom, and now the teenager who was the kid, would want broadcast everywhere. reply supplied_demand 3 hours agorootparentprevThe world was a lot different 15 years ago, both YouTube and iPhones were new and not full understood by the average person. Anyone who has designed a UI knows that not all actions are explicit. reply efdee 1 hour agorootparentprevMore likely: uploaded with the intent that a very limited audience would see it, thinking it would drown in the pool of videos uploaded to YouTube or maybe not even aware that other people could stumble upon it. reply manmal 4 hours agorootparentprevI think, back then, many people didn’t realize their videos are going to be available to the whole world. They might have uploaded them just to send a link to relatives, and fumbled or missed the privacy toggle. Lots of very private videos on there. reply johnisgood 41 minutes agorootparentI have seen recently uploaded videos (or reels, or \"tiktoks\") which were intentional... Shit's wild. People now know, yet... They sometimes do the most disgusting shit ever for the attention (likes, views). reply stronglikedan 3 hours agorootparentprev> That felt like a total invasion of their private lives. Except they literally explicitly uploaded it to YT. reply rescripting 3 hours agorootparentAt the time this was probably the one of the most convenient ways to share videos with loved ones. It wouldn't cross your mind that these videos were \"public\" because no one had the link but you. I'm sure it never crossed their mind that 15 years later an aggregator would be resurfacing them. reply recursive 2 hours agorootparentIs there a more convenient way now? Not being sarcastic, but it's still pretty damn convenient. reply jonny_eh 15 minutes agorootparentI use Google Photos. Apple Photos would work too. Or any of the messaging apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, etc. reply 85392_school 1 hour agorootparentprevThese days you can unlist the video. reply jonny_eh 15 minutes agorootparentThat was possible then too, but took an extra step. Defaults are important. reply throwawayq3423 1 hour agorootparentprevYOu think people know how to do that? Or even remember their content is there for all to see? reply jnovek 6 hours agorootparentprevI think it’s also a reminder that the internet felt so much safer in 2010. My sister (who is apparently wiser than most of us) has always refused to sharing pictures and videos of her kids on the internet and in 2010 that felt very old-fashioned. Now, because the internet feels so much more dangerous, it’s become a completely normal take. reply jonny_eh 16 minutes agorootparentprevLink? :P reply theodric 4 hours agorootparentprevFirst video I got was some happy people (families, by the sound of it) popping off a few rounds at the range with AR-15s. My day has been improved! reply giancarlostoro 50 minutes agoparentprevI know a video from roughly 11+ years ago where the audio got messed up, not sure how to even begin to report that. Was some niche \"inside joke\" type of meme. I have to wonder how many videos got re-encoded by YouTube that got screwed up inadvertently. reply dheera 12 minutes agoparentprevI don't think they are being served from Youtube (?) reply gear54rus 8 hours agoparentprevView count is nice but I'd like to be able to share a video that I got with someone else, I think that would be a great function. reply rkagerer 8 hours agorootparentClicking the date opens it in YouTube. reply jonny_eh 14 minutes agorootparentThat's a shame, I like the ephemeral nature of these. reply hoseja 9 hours agoparentprevI'm really anxious Google will also kill this aspect of Youtube one day. reply supermatt 9 hours agorootparentAs soon as it gets split off from google and they no longer have the money machine to fund them and have to fight on a level regulatory-monitored ground for ad revenue you can bet your ass it will. reply Mashimo 8 hours agorootparentAFAIK youtube is profitable now. It was not for years, but is now. reply dnissley 58 minutes agorootparentCan you post your source? Last time I checked (and quickly checking around now) I didn't see any announcement from Google about Youtube being profitable. reply eru 7 hours agorootparentprevYes, but it could perhaps be more profitable, if they cut spending on this aspect? reply whereismyacc 6 hours agorootparentFor every year that passes, storage becomes cheaper, but the total size of youtube's video repository grows. I wonder what the net effect of all that is in the end. Ever increasing costs? Or maybe it kinda evens out. reply eru 3 hours agorootparentInterestingly, if storage cost decreases geometrically over time, then the total storage cost of storing a video for all eternity is finite. Though what I was commenting on here wasn't so much the cost of storing a video at all, but storing it in 'warm' enough storage that you can load it really quickly. reply iamgopal 6 hours agorootparentprevWhat could be cost of total storage of YouTube ? Edit : About billion USD per year. reply b3lvedere 4 hours agorootparentprevSince when did that stop shareholders to make even more money? reply kristopolous 7 hours agorootparentprevGoogle: if you like it, it's going away. reply supportengineer 4 hours agorootparentOnce you live to a certain age, you realize this is true about everything in your life. reply kristopolous 4 minutes agorootparentI'm increasingly thinking of customer product relations in terms of giving treats to your users. The moat and stickiness concepts are ok, but \"candy store\" is more fruitful. Of course what constitutes candy is different for every product and you need to understand your customers to know what \"flavors\" they want reply seanw265 4 hours agorootparentprevI got charged by Squarespace the other day, and it immediately raised red flags—I've never done business with them before. Then it clicked: this was for an old domain I’d purchased through Google Domains. I knew Google had sold its domain business to Squarespace, but in the moment, I’d completely forgotten about it.

There was a thread yesterday about Facebook's little red book and a lot of nostalgia from folks who were there at the time about the optimism across builders then.

I've watched a family BBQ from 2009. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to close the browser. reply CM30 8 hours agoprevYou know, whenever I see stuff like this or the Deep Into YouTube subreddits, it always makes me wonder what it must be like for the person that posted the original video. There they are with a video they randomly threw online without any intention of it becoming popular, only to see their mostly abandoned channel blow up overnight as their random clips get thousands of views. Depending on the user, it must be either the coolest thing ever or the creepiest thing ever, with little in between. Kudos to anyone that takes the opportunity and uses it as a reason to kickstart a YouTube career or something. Regardless, it's always interesting to see, since: 1. It shows you just how big YouTube is, and how few of the videos posted there get any attention at all. The fact there's a huge percentage of the platform viewed by no one is just mind boggling to me. 2. It illustrates how little marketing skill correlates to video editing skill, since there are interesting videos going ignored due to their creator's inability to add a good title or thumbnail or metadata, or which were uploaded on a whim without any of that stuff being taken into account. reply smitelli 4 hours agoparentI would imagine a sizable portion of these old (15+ years ago) accounts are abandoned. Forgotten password, email address tied to an ISP that only serves a region where the person no longer lives, that kind of thing. YouTube wasn’t always tied so strongly to a Google account, and overall fewer people had Google accounts in the first place. reply miunau 7 hours agoparentprevA substantial amount (20% already back in 2014, I would imagine more now) of songs available on streaming never get streamed either. Kind of why that market has steered towards flat-fee upload distributors. 29 bucks a year is better than 10% of 0 bucks. reply XorNot 7 hours agorootparentSeems to bizarre to me that the \"zero streams\" playlist isn't a feature actually. reply datadrivenangel 4 hours agorootparentMost things with low popularity are rated appropriately. There are definitely some hidden gems, but most media that is created is simply bad. reply miunau 4 hours agorootparentThis is a lazy take. The reason is that there is money involved in picking who is at the top of the playlists. It's no big secret the big record labels own large parts of the music streaming industry. They are simply getting their investment back. There is no incentive giving money to any small third parties in terms of promotion. Spotify doesn't even pay out for songs that get under 1000 streams per year anymore. This is not even getting into the investment companies that buy artist catalogues wholesale, and therefore have a major interest in keeping old songs in constant rotation for the decades to come. Saying any of it is a meritocracy is pure ignorance. reply lelandbatey 2 hours agorootparentI don't think they're saying it's a meritocracy, I think they're uncontroversialy saying that a playlist of songs with up-till-now zero plays would be a huge amount of garbage, e.g. poorly made FL Studio/Garage Band experiments, not even interesting music just kinda bad music. reply wholinator2 5 hours agorootparentprevYeah, it seems like it could be a great feature for helping level the playing field a bit and discover some hidden gems that no one would have ever heard. But I imagine that at some point 'no streams' would have to turn into 'low streams' but that's fine. reply preciousoo 7 hours agoparentprevIt feels too intimate, I had to close it.

It might be a bit difficult for the highly technical HN crowd to grasp how little many people understand technology. Not changing the title is already a big clue.

This is more like finding an unsecured s3 bucket and delving through it. It might have been \"published\" to YouTube, but was it really done so with informed consent?

I still feel the urge to comment just to say how cool this is. The sprites being animated was definitely not something I expected. Makes the whole thing feel a lot more alive all of a sudden. I encourage everyone to also read the accompanying blog post linked in the OP. The paragraph about how I'm probably thinking that AI wrote the game for him really made me chuckle. That's exactly what I was thinking when I first read the blog title! Granted, it still would have been cool for a 9-year old, just not as cool as the alternative. So great job in immediately addressing this in the introduction. That seems like a really good use-case for AI (and I'm generally not the biggest fan of AI). The \"Dad's comments\" throughout the post are also a great way of providing some additional context without editorializing the kid's own writing. reply veesahni 4 hours agoparentKids dad here. I was not expecting animations for v1 either! But one day he asked me what the extra buttons were in Piskel and I explained frames + layers. His eyes lit up and the flying snake was born an hour later. Originally with 4 frames, but mom gave him feedback that he needs more frames for it to be smooth. Thus I believe it is currently 8 frames! And we have talked in depth about how not to use AI. He has a healthy mistrust of it because he's seen first hand how it hallucinates. v2 has sounds, which got us into a long discussion around copyrights.

Made my week for sure! reply JoelMcCracken 1 hour agoprevI'm sure you've gotten a lot of good feedback, but a personal message for your kid: I am well into my adulthood, but I started programming from a similar place way back when. I was probably 12-13 when I was self-studying HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Today the web tech stack is way more complicated than it was when I was a kid, but its also way more capable. You can do so much with it now that was a dream - I was into pokemon as a kid and wanted to make a \"fan site\", which is what got me learning (just to date how far back this was)! Its great you have so many tools now to learn, and your parents to ask advice. Keep it up, programming is great fun. For me as a kid it was great way to learn and explore and create in a world where I didn't have much agency. Regarding age, my buddy from college started learning to code when _he_ was 9, on BASIC, another old programming language. If I can suggest some potential learning resources for when you really want to learn more about code, checkout https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/b.... SICP was fantastic for me. If you're stuck, take it as a learning opportunity, ask for help, and keep at it. If learning a new language is too much for you, see https://sicp.sourceacademy.org/ or search google for other various attempts to port the stuff from SICP to JS world. (note to parents: if you happen to be doing this, my advice would be to set up DrRacket and install the SICP language (https://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/index.html), also feel me to email me any q's, email address in bio) reply veesahni 15 minutes agoparentthank you! reply taylorbuley 1 hour agoprevCongrats kid! It's a fun app incorporating strategic and visual play. The code is well structured and clean. `onclick` handlers inline are a great way to get going with interactivity. One possible improvement could be to add event listeners dynamically after `load`. Another challenge might be to move stuff outside of the global namespace, especially variables. For a challenge and possible improvement, see if you can implement a Singleton pattern. Start practicing now with inline comments. In HTML and in JS. Build that as a good habit early -- it will save you and those around you countless hours in the future. reply veesahni 15 minutes agoparentthank you for your feedback! reply DidYaWipe 20 hours agoprevLove it.

I played the game briefly this morning and I found it to be quite fun. Glad to see a 9 year old experiencing the joy of computing! Playing computer games (and then later programming with Logo and BASIC) is how I got introduced to computers. I too wanted to develop my own computer game when I was 8 year old. But unfortunately, I neither had access to enough time with computers nor did I have sufficient programming skills back then. I did end up fulfilling my childhood dream of developing an invaders-like game 30 years later as an adult. I too chose to implement it using plain HTML and JavaScript. I have written more about it here: .

Thank you! :) reply rahimnathwani 19 hours agoprevThis is awesome. My son recently turned 8. All his coding so far has been with Scratch and other block-based programming environments (Octostudio, VEX Robotics, Apitor, Microsoft Makecode). His typing speed is better than most kids his age, but still slow (around 10wpm). I'm curious how you helped introduce your son to text-based programming. I've been considering either: A) Having him go through this free Python course, that includes inline exercises: https://programming-24.mooc.fi/ OR B) Having him create a web page in repl.it or similar. reply veesahni 19 hours agoparentWe've had a long journey. Main thing is that I realized that my son doesn't learn enough from open ended tools like Scratch. So we tried a bunch of other things. He started with Scratch JR & Scratch. Then we switched to Tynker Jr & Tynker. Which provide challenge oriented block based games. Teaches loops, functions, etc. Then we switched to CodeMonkey, which provides challenge oriented block & code based games (coffeescript, python). Teaches variables, arrays, etc. Then I felt there was not enough new learning from the above. So I gave him VSCode and had him go through Khan Academy's HTML lesson. That's when he made a bunch of HTML pages you see: https://www.armaansahni.com/ (pokemon, bakis, etc). ALL the HTML/CSS on the site is hand written. Then I wanted him to learn how to be resourceful... for this, I gave him a serious of small challenges (eg: \"make a function that displays hello world on the screen\") where he had to figure out the answer himself. Use Gemini or Google, etc. But don't ask me. He ended up learning how to use Gemini to accelerate his learning (see his blog post, he writes about it a bit) and he was submitting solutions to me in JS. He had prior Gemini experience because he was using it to create images, and JS was natural extension of HTML. Then one day he decided he wanted to make a game that he had in his mind. In this above process, I basically observed what he was learning and switched to apps where I felt he could still learn something new. reply sky2224 18 hours agorootparentI really have to applaud how astute you've been with your observations of how your son is learning things. That's quite difficult. Additionally, I'm glad you weren't afraid to hand your son the real tools and let him build and break stuff. For some reason with programming, so much of the curriculum (even for adults) spends a lot of effort to hide away the things that are perceived as too difficult (e.g., pointers, memory allocation, etc). For children in particular it seems to be the actual code itself, and so we have things like scratch. It's quite refreshing to see a parent go against the grain on this one. reply veesahni 18 hours agorootparentAs a programmer, I feel the 'fundamentals' are very important. Because, well, then there's no magic. I think the curriculum hides the code because its just so complicated. For example, just to build on the web he has to learn 3 different languages (HTML, CSS, JS). To do anything simple (like move a box on a screeen) there are too many choices (animated gif, CSS animation, JS animation, etc). Then there's complexity of code management (eg: this game uses just 1 big file) or deployment (how do you \"run\" your code). So I believe simplifying things (i.e. Scratch) is a way to get people to do it without getting scared of the complexity. In our case, the goal is to learn the complexity, just in baby steps.

Back then Javascript wasn't really around (was still called DHTML), so I started with Liberty Basic and shortly after that AutoIt, which I loved for a long while and would recommend if he wants to start doing things on the computer - simple to write but doesn't abstract the concepts of the machine away.

I noticed they have a cyber Monday sale right now, so I might sign up for a year. reply veesahni 18 hours agorootparentTynker has many games in the app. But they are basically the same type of game with different themes. Your kid will gravitate to whatever theme they like (princess, dragon, space, etc). It would encourage him to reduce number of lines of code (i.e. use loops!) to get more stars. And we encouraged him to get 3 stars on every level. It also provided both a block based view or a code based view of the work you're doing, which I thought was pretty cool. Big thumbs up from my side for the app. It taught him the basics of loops and functions, through challenges to keep it motivation. My kid loved the dragon theme. reply rahimnathwani 17 hours agorootparentThanks. I just subscribed. reply rahimnathwani 18 hours agorootparentprevThank you. This is a very helpful description.

The quoted thought \"because it was like a human, it could also be wrong like a human\" is something he was telling us when he discovered it hallucinated. But he doesn't understand what an LLM hallucination is, that was his words. I asked him to share that in his blog post. The code is written on his own.

I wrote my first assembly routine when i was only 7 on my commodore64 (thinking of it today i'm really really amazed!) but today our world is different and i think today we must try to keep our children away as much as we can from tech stuff so this is what is keeping me away from teaching him coding. reply veesahni 5 hours agoparentKids dad here. I try to make a distinction between consumption and creation activities. Consumption activities (social media, youtube, playing games, etc) are time limited.

Little kids, in my opinion, should focus on things that don’t require electronics, for example things such as LEGO, drawing with pencils instead of a tablet, reading books instead of watching tv or reading an ebook. They shouldn’t have a smartwatch distracting them during school lessons.

Some possible \"enhancements\" 1. Give us an indication on when the weapons are charged. Change in colour perhaps? 2. Might be nice to show what the problem the opponent worked on is and what its result was so that we know. 3. It might also be nice to put the sums solved so far in some kind of list at the bottom so that you can see what happened. 4. The HP bar can change colour as the health goes down. Would add some more excitement to the game. :) 5. Minor typo \"chose\" your move instead of \"choose your move\" I've been working through https://www.amazon.in/JavaScript-Kids-Playful-Introduction-P... with my own son. He's 12. I encouraged him to put the exercises he made onto a site as well as some of the things he wanted to do by himself. We've reached the chapters on the canvas element so more things will be coming. Right now, it's mostly jquery and some custom logic. His site is up at https://mskv.in/ and if the folks here have feedback, I'd be very happy to receive it and pass it on to him. On a separate note, it was so liberating to watch him just solve things the way he wanted without worrying about patterns, libraries and stuff. So much of my professional time these days is spent with things like that. reply grvbck 4 hours agoparent> His site is up at https://mskv.in/ and if the folks here have feedback Very impressive! I loved the hangman game, and the cool graphics. A cool addition for next version would be some kind of visual progress (or anti-progress) where the hangman gets angrier or something like that for every wrong letter entered. The car game is completely random and non-interactive, right? Perhaps a text box for each car where those placing the bets can add their name/names? Perhaps also some kind of graphic element in the scorecard to the right, something to separate the cars that have finished from the cars still in the race. Also, the race could end after the third car finishes as there is no point really for the last one to keep racing – it already lost! Nevertheless – really liked the graphics and the cool idea, well executed. The treasure hunt was also really fun, and nostalgic! Only improvement I can think of is to actually see some kind of gold coin or treasure chest in the end, to know how far off I was the times I lost, and as visual confirmation the times I won.

If I had access to a computer at 9 I'm not sure I'd be making games so much as playing them. (Although I did move on from playing games to a healthy curiosity about how they worked \"under the hood\" fairly early on.) When he learns enough to have reached the limits of what he can do in Javascript, you should definitely look into the Godot game engine. Free/OpenSource, powerful, fairly easy to learn, tons of tutorials on YouTube, and even a game that teaches GDScript (their custom Python-like scripting language). reply veesahni 18 hours agoparentKids dad here. Actually we did start with Godot - but it was too much too fast and he was overwhelmed. He mentions this in his blog post. So we ultimately stepped back and I wanted him to learn to be resourceful. I give him a series of small changes (eg: write a function in any language that displays \"hello world\" on the screen) and he delivered those results in JS (he already knew HTML/CSS at this point). The rest comes as a natural progression. I guess in this case, the best and pragmatic option was to use what you know. In the future, we'll try Godot again :) reply Cotterzz 17 hours agorootparentGodot is designed for beginners, but also those that don't like to get their hands too dirty with code. Also the web export is likely inferior to what he can do with JS directly. With that in mind I'd recommend he sticks with JS. If he's interested in doing more advanced games he should look into Three.js, or Pixi, Babylon, Phaser and other engines (and eventually even just raw WebGL and using shaders), all within the browser. There's also the web audio API which can be used to synthesise sounds and music from scratch and then there's WASM which can be used as a compile target for languages like C and C++ JS itself can be used as a procedural, functional or OOP language so while it's easy to learn it has lots to master. Finally, if he does want to move outside the browser, there might be better choices than Godot, like Raylib or Defold or even more professional engines like Unity or Unreal. Not saying it's a bad choice, just that where he is now has a lot to offer, and there might be better alternatives depending on his skills and aims. reply veesahni 15 hours agorootparentI was originally interested in Godot because it had a web export. I feel like building on the web helps with shareability (eg: this post!) But the \"open web\" seems to give limitless potential. Canvas, network APIs, lots of interesting libraries to build on, etc. I wasn't familiar with the ability to synthesize sounds - that would be interesting to look into. Appreciate the feedback! :) reply dpig_ 13 hours agorootparentprevI'm curious to know why you think Godot's web exports are too poor to be useful even to a 9 year old? I've published multiple HTML5 games on itch.io using Godot, including some with P2P multiplayer functionality. Apart from complete inoperability on Safari, I haven't run into many issues? reply macintux 19 hours agoparentprev> If I had access to a computer at 9 I'm not sure I'd be making games so much as playing them. I was 10 or 11 when I wrote my first (and only?) game, but A: it was dead simple, and B: I didn't have YouTube, Netflix, and an infinite variety of games a click away to distract me. I'm impressed with any kids today that can withstand the siren call of distractions on the Internet. I doubt I'd even survive high school today. reply CM30 9 hours agoprevBased on my feedback, it seems pretty good. The main improvements I'd recommend are more user interface things, to make the game feel a bit less luck based. For example, there definitely needs to be an indication of which moves are charging, since I could not for the life of me tell which ones were ready and which weren't. Either a bar or number underneath the move indicating this (maybe with a nice 'CHARGED' label when ready) would help a lot. There's also a bit of confusion as to which moves are effective against which enemies too. Like I suspect blasting star is more powerful than throwing star or whatever, but the only way to be sure is trial and error, which lowers the strategic depth quite a bit. Then again, if this isn't a feature at all, having it would add a nice bit of extra value here, since it'd make each fight feel a bit more controllable. Additionally, it's not always super clear that an attack has done damage, since the HP value seems to change instantly with little fanfare, despite what appears to be an effect marking the attack as having hit its target. Some sort of enemy HP colour change change, a minor screen shake, the text changing after the flash, etc would help illustrate that your attacks are hitting and doing damaging (and that your enemies were doing the same). Still, on a mechanical level it's a pretty solid first attempt for a game, especially by someone learning to code at such a young age. There are a decent number of enemies, you've got a variety of attacks, the attacks can charge up, there's a win condition and a loss condition, etc. Congrats! reply veesahni 6 hours agoparentAll good points.

UI was just Visual Basic 6. Indie dev. Fun game. This reminds me of it. One of the neat things about these sorts of indie games is you can often watch the skills of the dev improve over the life of the game, too. The first blood spatters in the game above were little more than #f00 scribbles in MS Paint. Later graphics got significantly better. It also had a generic name (\"RPGWo\", short for \"RPG World\") — \"THE GAMEY GAME\" feels right up there. One of the hardest bugs I ran into as a kid was some code that was something like, List lst = new List(); … but when I transcribed that onto a computer (this was in a book) I accidentally wrote, List 1st = new List(); … because typography is hard, and the font the book used had a l/1 confusable. Compiler error, one of my first. Took me forever to figure it out. (No access to the Internet, then.)

The next generation of developers have so much power at their fingertips. reply deathanatos 17 hours agorootparentI was young at the time, but when I TA'd, the lesson I'd try to impart here is to take the time to learn the lexicon of the compiler error, and understand what it is trying to tell you.

Maybe the weapons could display a counter for how many turns they need to be available again, but that's only a time saver. It could be nice to see the puzzles of the opponent and its response. Maybe you could reward the human fighter for solving the opponent puzzle too: dodge (not every time) when the opponent would hit (correct response) or opportunistic attack when the opponent misses (wrong response.) But if you misjudge the opponent's response you should be penalized, maybe extra damage (it was correct, you say it's wrong) or just the missed opportunity to attack (it was wrong, you say it was correct.) The fight is too long when one always responds correctly. It's only a matter of waiting for the inevitable victory. I don't know if there is something that can be done about this.

I gave him a serious of small challenges starting with: \"write a function that displays hello world on the screen\" ... he already know HTML/CSS and he talked to Gemini to figure out the best way to use a function in HTML and it guided him towards JS. He give me a solution in a JS console, with a function that he executed. Then I built on that with more challenges. He continued to work with Gemini. He talks about how he uses Gemini in his blog post, it's an interesting learning technique he found. So mostly he's learning by doing. He's figuring out \"how to do X\" either using a hint from me or just by asking Gemini which gives him some guidance. Then he has to figure out how to apply the hint/samples to his actual game.

At the time, I also showed him ChatGPT but he said that Gemini understands him better.

How much did dad/mom help? reply veesahni 19 hours agoparentFrom his past experience with HTML/CSS, he can already make a page, has VSCode, knows how to use VSCode to commit & sync. The big thing this time was that he had to learn a lot of JS and had to get much more proficient with CSS. So my guidance was more of a set of hints as needed, for example \"you want to boxes side by side, figure out how to do that using CSS\" .. then he'd go away and talk to Gemini and ultimately Gemini would give him multiple approaches that he could try. When it came to animation, I explained that there are many ways to animate (CSS, JS, etc) and guided him towards animated images. Basically, we \"chatted\" about a feature, I gave him some hints, then he went off and talked to Gemini for syntax and wrote the code. Many features he knew exactly what to do. If he wasn't sure, he'd have a discussion with me. Basically, I was like a senior dev sounding board. He was the junior developer doing the work. Gemini was his Google/StackOverflow. reply amelius 20 hours agoparentprevMy guess would be quite a lot, since the artwork is not something a child would make despite it looking like its made for children. reply veesahni 19 hours agorootparentKids dad here. When it was time to do images, I figured something like photoshop would be way too much for him. So I found a browser based sprite editor. The 32x32 grid simplified things and actually helped him. Then one day I explained how the animation worked in the Piskel app (it had layers and frames). I came back an hour later and he had that flying snake that absolutely blew me away. He originally had it at 4 frames we gave him feedback that he needs more frames to be smooth. He upped it to 8. The graphics is where had the least guidance from parents.

(I'd critique the use of onclick, except you've found the one context where it's acceptable (even sensible!) to use onclick.) Using the Orca screen reader, the game is almost completely playable. Some feedback: • I can't \"see\" when exploding star is charged up, except by clicking it every turn. • I can't tell whether I've got the answer right or wrong. The animation is not exposed to Orca at all. It would be nice to have a text description of what's happening (which you could then apply aria-live to). • Technically, I can find this information by navigating down and checking the HP scores, given knowledge of the game rules. (Just putting aria-live=polite on the HP elements would be a quick fix.) • I can't necessarily read English: the other text can be auto-translated by my browser, since the page is marked lang=en, but the text in the images can't unless the alt attribute is set appropriately. • You use - (hyphen-minus) rather than − (U+2212 MINUS SIGN). Most screen-reader users will be used to this: do NOT tweak things to make it sound better in one screen reader: that will probably break things for others. However, in this case, you do really mean 24 − 5, so it might be worth changing it. • document.write replaces the document (not its contents), which causes some software (e.g. Firefox F12 Inspect Element) to break a bit. Orca-in-Firefox seems to cope, though, so this probably isn't a big deal. Digital accessibility involves considering a lot of I/O modalities at once, so it's really hard. (A lot of the advice you'll find online is wrong: there are even companies who sell wrong \"solutions\", and it's very annoying!) Since your game is mostly HTML, withfor controls, it's already very accessible. This is, in all sincerity, a lot better than most professionals can manage. Edit: ooh, you do have a blog. I'd suggest RSS, though. Email sign up forms are a pain to manage, there are privacy problems, and it's generally less convenient than RSS. reply veesahni 16 hours agoparent> Using the Orca screen reader, the game is almost completely playable. Interesting! I tried to guide him towards the simple approach - eg: alert() is way simpler than making some sort of modal with HTML/CSS, etc. But now that I think about, that approach (i.e. just use what the browser provides) also results in a more accessible result. I appreciate the detailed feedback here. This is awesome! I'm going to leverage this to have a discussion about accessibility with my son. It's something we haven't taken active consideration for through this process. reply wizzwizz4 5 hours agorootparentYou might find WAI's resources useful: https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/ And if you've come up with a cool idea for how to make something \"more accessible\", check whether Adrian Roselli wrote a \"here's why you should never ever ever do this\" article on the subject. https://adrianroselli.com/2024/11/avoid-read-only-controls.h... is funny and illustrates the point: > It’s weird to me that after I urged everyone not to disable form controls, a bunch of them decided that making them read-only was somehow better.

This one I actually believe and I love it, because it reminds me of when I was that age. I also really like the educational aspect! reply eonmist 9 hours agoprevIt is an amazing process being shown here. It shows how technology, especially AI, opens new ways of learning. Examining the process, it makes sense that he was able to create it. This showcases interplay between modern technology and pedagogy, while also focusing on an explorative learning process, which, in modern pedagogy, is highly valued. It seems clear the understanding of the game idea stems from experience with Pokemon, which introduces children to numbers and the concept of hits, damage, health. Thus it is natural he would have such a game idea as an entry point. Abstract thinking usually develops around the age of 12. My question was how he was able to make symbolic representations of abstract entities (functions) at that age. I think this is where AI shines, as it bridges the gaps in understanding, thus lifting the burden of solving those gaps instantly and instead allowing for the fun explorative process of engaging with the problem at the current level of understanding -- keeping you at the \"almost there\" feeling, thus continuing is engaging if not irresistible. In pedagogy, the zone of proximal development \"is a concept in educational psychology that represents the space between what a learner is capable of doing unsupported and what the learner cannot do even with support.\" (Wikipedia) 20 years ago, this would probably be too difficult even with support from a parent. The parent would have had to do much more of the heavy lifting to allow the child to not be too distracted by syntax and implicit conceptual relationships. For example, in setTimeout(function..., it is not intuitive, even for many adults, to declare a function within a call, let alone to grasp the concept of callbacks and an event-driven environment. In a way, the AI allows him to \"build with blocks\", maybe similar to how VisualBasic abstracted away many complexities. He is able to have a creative interaction with AI that is very keen to abstract away complexities that would significantly decrease the motivation to continue. My own experience with AI is interactive, and I feel I learn things much faster, which is in stark contrast to the idea that the AI just writes it for you. You still have to learn and understand in order to formulate intent for the AI and to evaluate and connect the result. This opened my memory of my own first game I wrote at 12. I had an Amiga 500, lots of games on floppies and among them \"Workbench\". I found the Amiga Basic interpreter in Workbench on a rainy day while clicking on everything to find something interesting. I figured out the English manual \"Amiga Basic\" on my shelf, probably related to it. Not very familiar with the English language at the time, I later managed to make a 100 rows text-adventure consisting of only variables, print, if, then, else. I wasn't able to grasp the other concepts as I did not know what to look for. The idea of a function didn't exist to me. Merely understanding the outline of the reference manual was hard enough. The game spanned three rooms and I got stuck trying to make the inventory. This is how far I came with no guidance at all, no parental involvement, and not even knowing at beforehand what a programming/scripting language was. It would take 4 more years before I picked up programming, then with \"Borland Turbo C\" shared with me at school on a floppy. I remember my first for-loop deeply impressed me as I realized I could build more complicated things. Later, every time I learned a new concept in the book \"Sams Teach Yourself C in 24 Hours\" I would have a new game idea. reply physicsguy 10 hours agoprevVery sweet! reply yieldcrv 20 hours agoprevI want to charge up reply Frummy 20 hours agoprevCould have a virtual numpad reply dylan604 19 hours agoparentyeah, I think an improvement would be not using alert(). writing the question to a DOM element and then getting the response from an input field would be much more valuable experience for real world applications as web trends have moved away from the heavy use of alerts reply veesahni 19 hours agorootparentthis on his plan for the next version!

It's hard enough that, in general, most folks just remake another game that's already figured out the fun. You're doing a math game, math gamified. Let's throw a choice in there. Since you replied, here's one idea: (1) present five numbers. (2) You, the player, chose two numbers (3) You perform an operation (3.1) operation: add/subtract/multiply/divide, but perhaps exponentiation and modulo and lcm and factorize and whatever else. it's probably best to keep it simple. (3.1.1) this can get random: what was the highest number last round? how many green letters are there on the screen? (3.2) operations are tied to the special attacks,eg tier 1 attacks are add/subtract, tier 2 mult/div, and so on. (4) you type in your answer (5) if you type in an answer that's the correct result of an operation applied to two of the numbers, then you do the corresponding attack. So it's not add these two numbers pass/fail. It's you decide what math you want to do, and can do, and can do in a time limit, and that achieves the effect you're looking for. Anyways, it's always fun to make a thing. reply mcbrit 19 hours agoparentprev [–] Assumption: wanted feedback, saying kid was not saying shibboleth. reply kstrauser 19 hours agorootparent [–] Context is everything. If I turned that in as a serious project at work, tell me all the ways it was less than perfect. If a 9 year old brings it to show and tell, you explain how much you liked the cool parts. If my florist handed me a dead flower, I'd be irked. If a 4 year old hands me a dead flower saying \"I picked this for you!\", I'd tell them what a beautiful flower it was and how much I appreciated the nice thing they did for me. A 9 year old isn't a 4 year old, but I think you get the gist. reply Cotterzz 17 hours agorootparent [–] I would also encourage the kid as much as possible, but I'd be doing them a disservice if I didn't also take the opportunity to teach them about the basics of keeping flowers alive in transit. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originBody": "The .club Club Egoless Engineering Like many of you, I was raised in the background radiation of Calvinist thought. I expected little but redemptive hard labor, before presumably one day dying in a mine. I also read Hackers & Painters at an impressionable age and was kind of a jerk about it for a while. This talk is about how despite this, I got better. The real urtext of my tradition was two people standing on stage explaining how although they have different jobs, they are friends, and try to help each other. It was mindblowing at the time and led to many subsequent revelations, and ultimately a blissful state of psychic death. It turns out misery is a shitty proxy metric. Here are some other talks and my website. @mcfunley.comHey everyone #I’m Dan McKinley. It’s nice to talk to all of you. I’ve done engineering since the turn of the century, and led small teams and biggish orgs. #I’ve spun the wheel enough times that I’ve gotten a few stretches of my career when things were going great. Nothing gold can stay though, and those moments were fleeting. Welcome to my latest talk in my very-slowly-moving series about trying to rekindle that magic. #At most places I’ve worked, things haven’t been going great. I’m not really complaining. I was in a position of responsibility at those places, and I hope I did more good than harm. I’m going to talk through some stories about that. My hope with this is to do more good than harm. Maybe y’all can create more fulfilling places to work, and hire me to work there. #So I have noticed similarities when things are going poorly, and would like to talk about them. #One big problem everywhere is that once you have two employees, you have to divide responsibility somehow. How you do that is really important. It’s a move that has both immediate and second-order consequences which are mostly awful to contemplate. So most companies don’t contemplate it that much. #Computer scientists like me start their career by realizing that they accidentally joined a math major that isn’t a science, and isn’t about computers. It’s about how abstract work gets done and stuff. And the trauma of this initial realization is so severe that we spend our entire careers refusing to apply anything we learned outside the domain of computers. Things might be better if we tried to think about work as much as we think about the computers. Later in this talk I will try, despite how much it hurts me to do that. #I’d like to talk through the dynamics I’ve seen at different places. I’m going to anonymize it somewhat because even really successful companies suffer from pathology, and my intent is to learn rather than just shitpost. #The first job I want to talk about was a startup I worked for, which ultimately was really successful. I was in the first 20 employees there. #You’d think this would be a really scrappy group but no, at that point they had already managed to set themselves up like IBM in the 1970s or something. I was hired to work on a python middle layer which should not have existed in the first place. In this misguided attempt to scale, they added a Python middle layer. The theory was that web requests would be served faster if they progressed through more network hops. This is a bad theory. #So to launch any feature at this company, you needed to get a database person to do some DDL and write some stored procedures. You needed to get a python person to write some python that didn’t achieve much. You needed a PHP person to write some frontend code. And so on. As a result of all of this, the company released zero features for two whole years and everyone got fired. (But not me, I survived by complaining.) #Much later on I worked at a fairly mature company that had more than a thousand people and was selling a b2b product. #They’d managed to avoid serializing absolutely everything, in that they’d divided into feature teams. And they had shared services teams like ops, and DBA’s, and so on. That seemed reasonable at first, or at least not different than most places. #But something interesting had happened where the roles just kept dividing, like a bacteria colony out of control or something. They split engineering management in half and created a role called “release manager.” To … manage releases, I guess? It was never entirely clear to me why. At some point things just came unglued. #And they chased that dragon into some very dark corners. A big mistake they made in my view was that they conflated roles with work a little too much. Frontend engineers did all of the frontend work and none of the backend work, and vice versa. That was survivable, but taking that policy to the security team and making the security team do all of the security work was not. I’ll come back to this. #And then finally I worked at a company that mostly made native client applications. There was initially one big hit client app, but by the 2020s a bigger, disjointed set of efforts had grown up in parallel. #The product portfolio as a whole had a very weak supervisory structure. The products didn’t coordinate in any meaningful way on tech stacks or other decisions, since they all independently reported up to a CEO that made no attempt to coordinate them. But despite that, an attempt was made to have a shared operations function. This presented a lot of difficulty because the operations group wasn’t involved in architecture decisions. They wouldn’t have had enough time to do that anyway, since they were busy with hundreds of services that dev teams had moved on from years before. It’s a tale as old as time. #So that was a high-level overview of how all struggling companies are unique. But they’re also all the same. I’ve spent many nights pondering the mistakes these places have made, and I’d like to inflict my observations on you now. #One big thing that a lot of people love to do is create new role types. For any new thing a company wants to do, the tendency is to put up a new job description. #I think a lot of people notice this and chafe at it when the role is for the new hotness. For example, every company wants to rub some AI on their stuff now, so they are putting up job descriptions for AI engineers. If you’re an engineer interested in AI sitting in such a company, you’re annoyed that they’re doing this (and potentially paying that person more than you) when you could easily rub some AI on some stuff. This is just a salient example of a dumb mistake that happens in many, many more dimensions all the time. #A mundane example of that is the ops and development divide (or these days maybe the divide between SRE and development). That divide has been very pronounced at nearly every place I’ve worked. #And that’s despite every single one of those companies claiming that they quote-unquote “do devops.” Devops as a portmanteau was meant to communicate something about breaking down the divide, and building empathy between these two groups. I have worked hard to cultivate this, personally, but rarely found it in the wild in reality. #Once people have subdivided work, they naturally try to arrange people into assembly lines. If you have AI work, hand it over to the AI person. If you have ops work, give it to the ops person. That’s the kind of thing that feels obvious to leaders, but I think it’s wrong. And sometimes it’s wrong in a mathematically provable way. Let’s dig in. #Here’s a very typical set of executive constraints. They might say: we have to measure everything. We aren’t going to hire more data scientists. We’re going to focus on building new products and only hire new engineers for that. #Those are inputs to a very simple equation. Engineers produce work that needs to be analyzed at a rate, and the analysis takes a finite amount of time. Remember the premise is that we are trying to go faster by adding engineers. #But, whoops! We made everything go slower, actually. With that simple setup, it doesn’t take very long at all for things to get extremely out of hand. We added a few engineers and wound up with a nonlinear increase in how long people need to wait before they can ship things. By the time the data scientists are fully busy, the individual feature waiting for analysis is absolutely doomed. (Source for the math is here.) #Of course, organizational dynamics are stacked against analyzing this problem in a clearheaded way. Everyone thinks the other groups are sandbagging. We come into petty conflicts that obscure the physics of the situation. #That kind of setup is one in which ticketing things can generate more work than you’d have if people had time to talk to each other. That’s a specific case of a general issue. Poorly factored organizational boundaries create work. #Earlier I talked about a company that tried to use its security team to do all of the security remediation work. By adding a queue for security tickets, they were hoping for a result like this. There’d be the same total volume of work getting through the system, and fewer context switches. #The problem with that is the horrible things development can get up to when it’s not encouraged to worry about security. #We can generate extra security work with our engineering activity if we erect a wall between those things. On a long enough timescale of course something horrible precipitates, but that’s a problem for future you. In the here and now it’s only a minor humanitarian catastrophe which we can ignore. #An undercurrent of all of this is how people conceive of themselves, and how they are to one another. #There can be a general tendency among some of us to imagine that other peoples’ jobs are easy compared to ours. Obviously it’s not a majoritarian view that working on the server is so easy “it’s not clear it’s even technical,” but I can report that some crazies out there do hold this view. #Those vibes can absolutely run in the other direction though, and thinking that product work is less technical might be even more common. Platform teams are full of folks who aren’t very worried about what the company they work for even does. #Although the results of these tendencies are very stupid, punting the offenders into the sun usually eludes us a solution. That’s because this behavior can be coded as “smart” and “valuable” to outside observers. While a CEO may not endorse the behavior, they imagine that it gets results. Except it doesn’t. Driving other workers out reduces total throughput. Obviously. The biggest problem with brilliant jerks is not necessarily even that they’re jerks. When you take a systemic perspective, they aren’t even brilliant! They’re dumb! #Recurring themes throughout every chapter of this for me are parochialism and ego, the yin and yang of dysfunction. Both of these have positive and negative spins. Parochialism might be deference, and not wanting to step on someone else’s toes. Or it might be lack of curiosity. Ego might be pride in your work, or it might be territoriality, or dismissiveness in the abilities of others. These are the primal urges that lead to the breakdowns in empathy that fill our lives with pain. #Thank you for allowing me to trauma dump for a while. Like I said at the beginning of this talk, I’m motivated to make things better, not just complain. I’ve spent a long time thinking about how the most functional engineering team I ever worked on got that way, and I want to give you a vignette from those times. #The startup I worked at fought its way from horizontally layered fiefdoms to a simpler architecture and a smaller team. We imported some leaders that took devops very seriously, as they had come up with the idea in the first place. The most important bit that we took from that movement was that we should tear down existing barriers between roles. So after about two years of creative destruction pretty much everybody was pitching in on pretty much everything. #That approach was ultimately successful, and we found infrastructure stability and gained some ability to ship software again. We crawled out the other end of the scaling tunnel clean. #That, combined with several CEO changes due to some other chaos, morphed the company into an engineering-led organization. As an engineering team we found ourselves reaping an infrastructure dividend that gave us a bit of free time, and we had an unusual level of permission from the rest of the company to dictate how that time was used. #That’s a rare situation, and I think we knew it at the time. Ideas were thrown around about how we should use our extra capacity. #I’ve been part of several other teams that found themselves in this situation and decided to rewrite various things they hated. I think this is the most common outcome. But we had already tried this, so it wasn’t popular. #The other thing people seem to do in this situation is buy merch and strut. We did a bit of that, but not as a primary strategy. #None of that felt right. It just wasn’t us. So we didn’t do anything drastic for a while. #Then one day, our designer broke the build in the middle of the night. Everyone came in the next day and couldn’t work until they figured out what had happened. #He was obviously really apologetic about the whole thing. An apology email thread ensued. #The temptation was there to be huge jerks, and rebuild fiefdoms. Perfectly reasonable people thought that maybe we should put more of a wall between designers and the css source code. It was suggested that designers should just design, and coders should do all of the coding. #But instead a miracle happened. There was an inspired person who decided to do the opposite. They just yolo’d giving the designer the deploy keys. I’ve come to understand this event as being entirely contingent, but it was also very special. #And it was great. Designers started shipping code. We spent our free time building everything we needed to in terms of monitoring, test suites, et cetera to make that safe for them to do. Everyone rejoiced and got shit done. Nothing bad happened. #That was an epiphany: the thing we were actually going to do was use our rare and precious organizational power, and the free time that came with it, to lift up other teams and make them more effective. #There were a lot of epiphanies in that era but they all kind of felt like that one. We did the thing we did with designers with tons of other groups, in technical and nontechnical disciplines. #That was the process of getting from a place of not executing to executing really well. I want to spend a bit of time talking about what good felt like. #We tried really hard to have domain experts, but never really domain owners. #Let’s go back and consider the company I worked at where the security team was responsible for all of the security tickets, again. #The way we approached that when we were executing well was that everyone was responsible for security. The security team was the set of domain experts focused on leveling everyone up in that regard, and making sure we all got to a secure place. (I think this is thankfully not that uncommon when it comes to security as a discipline.) #But it’s a lot less common in my experience to buy into that model for other disciplines. We had a word for the idea that SRE and developers should share tasks, it was “devops.” But like I said nearly all teams I’ve worked on since have not actually done this. And many teams I’ve worked on have also failed to extrapolate, and have had frontend or client engineers strictly siloed from backend engineers. They get up to building entire GraphQL monstrosities to avoid talking to each other. You want someone that’s an expert in frontend work, but I think you probably do not want people with “frontend” and “backend” in their title. #Domain experts, not domain owners. An important thing that distinguishes a expert as distinct from an owner is that you encourage the expert to devote some of their time to helping others work in their discipline. #That we needed to give people slack time like that to sustain the level of overall teamwork was a general principle. There were other ways in which we didn’t just wait for the streams to cross themselves. We injected sustaining energy into this system very intentionally. #Human beings are limited by their in-group. You feel psychological safety within your in group. You feel like you can experiment and learn new things within your in group. You can exercise curiosity about the people in your in-group and what they do. So we invested time in making people’s in-groups larger. Bootcamps were one of those ways: we forced people to work on other teams occasionally. Hack weeks were another institution that achieved similar ends. #A decade later, I can articulate what our organization’s principles were. I can explain the higher-level reasons we were doing bootcamps, or code reviews, or a million other things. This is a victory of being intentional and vocal about what our team values were. #It was important to us to articulate that elitism as an attitude was poison. To the contrary, we do windows here. If a ditch needs digging, our tech leads will line up to dig it. We also needed to create the strong expectation that you’d leave things in a better state as you messed with other people’s stuff. That made people overjoyed to have you messing with their stuff. #Let me leave you with a few things. #Inside and outside of tech the world is rife with cult leaders who lack the gene for humility - bullies who inspire and encourage cruelty in their followers to no end other nihilism. At a certain genetic equilibrium, NPD is evolutionarily adaptive, so these people are out there. But in tech we’ve grown a tendency to see it as useful rather than parasitic. The industry believes in assholes. Valuing others around you should not be a radical act, but that’s where things are unfortunately. #It shouldn’t be a radical act because results are better if we can cooperate. And life is better without cult leaders. How do we tear down parochialism and ego? #I’ve tried. I’ve got some notes about trying. Yes, growth hacking is a bad word and everything. But I have started growth teams twice and the one weird trick to making marketing start to work is to … try to help? It’s crazy. I inherited a situation where SRE was doing all of the deploys for the company, like it was the 90s. I pushed to switch that to developers shipping their own code. There was some hesitation, the worry being that developers would break stuff and not fix it. But the better angels of our nature prevailed, engineers largely resolved their own incidents right away. Product engineers actually asked to be handed the pagers! It was heartwarming. #The missing ingredient in those situations was just permission. Mainly what I needed to do was give people the permission they needed to be curious, and to cooperate. I don’t think you can grass roots that, beyond what I’m trying to do here by making the idea more popular. It’s on leaders to value cooperation and to reward curiosity. #In addition to permission, there has to be slack in the system. This requires persistent commitment. When you start skipping the bootcamps, they’ll die out as a practice. We don’t let our machines run at 100% utilization. But again, we have a tendency to love our computers more than ourselves. #The things we value and reward as leaders trickle down. Leaders can reward our worst or our best impulses. Most CEO’s I’ve worked for have tried to kill feel-good programs like bootcamps and hack weeks, but I’ve never worked for a CEO that tried to end feel-bad programs like mandatory code review. None of them would admit this, but I think there’s an industry instinct that misery gets results. I think this is mistaken. Misery is a shitty proxy metric for results. ## @mcfunley.com Thanks to many folks who have inspired me over the years but particularly Coda Hale, Kellan Elliot-McCrea, Camille Fournier, and Marc Hedlund.

By the end, my advice for every manager was roughly: * Don't add process just for the sake of it. Only add it if seriously needed. * Require ownership all the way to prod and beyond, no matter the role. (Turns out people tend to really like that.) * Stop making reactive decisions. If something bad happened on a total, extremely unlikely lark, don't act like it's going to happen again next week. * Resist the urge to build walls between people/teams/departments. Instead, build a culture of collaboration (Hard and squishy and difficult to scale? Yup. Worth it? Absolutely.) * Never forget your team is full of actual humans. reply dakiol 20 hours agoparentWith modern team structures it’s difficult to have ownership all the way to prod. My team consists of: one product manager, one staff engineer, one or more lead engineers, one or more senior engineers, one engineering manager. The PM wants his share of the cake, so any big feature needs to go through his approval (“does this feature delivers value?”, “how many users will use the feature?”, etc.) The staff engineer needs to validate any design (that’s his job), and provide feedback if he thinks your design “sucks”. So if the feature ends up being successful, he gets points. The senior and lead engineers need to own the design and implementation details. The leads would probably want to cover a good chunk of the solution so that it appears in their performance review. It’s gonna be though for senior engineers to get a good share if the leads are already one step ahead. The engineering manager will own the timeline. He will ask you about estimates, but most likely you’ll feel the pressure of whatever imaginary deadline is set. So there you are in the middle of all those people wanting their share. If you don’t manage to own a good chunk of that work, you won’t be able to show it in your perf. review. Owning is hard. I have to say, though, that I only have experienced this in tech companies that are around 5-7 years (old enough to have well established processes, young enough to still hire like there’s no tomorrow) and that are obsessed with FAANGs: they will hire faang engineers only if they could. This mix ends up badly, because suddenly every team needs to be a high performing team, everyone is raising the bar and speed is number one prio. When working with companies that hire no faang engineers, everything feels better. reply julik 6 hours agorootparentThis is what makes creating these performing structures so hard - once the incentives to \"show ownership to demonstrate performance and get promoted\" is permitted in the organization, people have to \"play to stay at the table\" and the actual necessary work ethic gets displaced. There should be a clear realisation that creating a moral maze is a taboo, and it is very hard for leaders to stick to that throughout the growth of an org. reply bibabaloo 20 hours agorootparentprevI feel this so much. I feel like most of my job is playing politics to make sure people are happy and let them feel like they're adding value. Rather than shipping things to users to improve the product. It's honestly so depressing. Strongly considering going back to work at a small startup, to avoid having to work with these layers of middlemen that really add little to no value. reply sensanaty 9 hours agorootparentI remember in a prior job that I had just joined when I was still new to the field, they had a bug board where they collected all the most common bugs users were experiencing. I decided to, in the middle of the sprint when I was done with the sprint work and had some small downtime, take care of some of the smaller bugs that were easy to fixup in a day's notice. My PM at the time immediately questioned why I'm working on \"irrelevant\" tickets and not focusing on the wider project we were working on, the senior I was working under had the same stance, and the PR never ended up being merged. It was like 20 lines of very easy to comprehend code that was fixing one of the most reported bugs our users had, like 6 figure number of reports since the bug card was created. When I left that company a year and a half later, that bug card was still open, with my now-rotting PR sitting there with a \"closed\" status. It really jaded me on all of these bullshit processes, sprints, AGILE, whatever you want to call it. It was obvious that nobody gave a shit about what we were building and how, it's all just a game to pad yourself up and to look good to the higher ups who control if you get a raise or not. If someone above you can't somehow gain a lot by boasting about the work done, then you might as well not do it. I fucking despise the mindset and how prevalent it is in the industry. reply sethammons 9 hours agorootparentHealthy orgs must have slack in the system and allow teams and individuals to do a little chasing of fun or meaningful things that give them intrinsic pride and motivation. Teams must advocate for projects, but, for individuals, one solution that I've seen help is that the week long oncall developer handles sprint interruptions, slack questions, and bugs. No sprint commitments. If something is not on fire, they get to work on whatever they think will add value at their discretion. New tooling, proof of concepts, pet-peeve bugs that can't get prioritized, etc. After lots of stabilization work, devs looked forward to oncall. reply fatnoah 2 hours agorootparent> Healthy orgs must have slack in the system and allow teams and individuals to do a little chasing of fun or meaningful things that give them intrinsic pride and motivation.

Especially the EM and the staff, lead and senior engineers all wanting the same one thing of a certain scope when they should be working at two different levels at a minimum reply worksonmymach 17 hours agorootparentprevIt needs a culture change. The magic words: \"Our customers prefer the product works over getting a new feature, so let's ensure that at any cost\" Number of features is a dial. You turn that down. You turn the operations (devops) dial up. There is nothing modern about releasing half arsed shit... we been doing it since the dawn of civilization. reply cereal_cable 11 hours agorootparentQuality can also become it's own trap as the entire org chases metrics aimed at quality. Soon you have loads of brittle tests that likely aren't adding great assertions but you have code coverage. Because that doesn't work soon you keep adding layers upon layers to reduce the risk and your time to delivery suffers. All knobs have consequences and long term they can really compound. The balance of picking quality over features isn't something I've seen done amazing. I'd like to work somewhere that could pull it off. reply worksonmymach 10 hours agorootparentYou are right and the biggest asset here are executives and management that can: 1. Think 2. Know what is going on. 3. Effectively get the best from their people. You want the whole org to engineer the right solution Any metric that gets abused needs to be found and replaced. Companies should use metrics and be very respectful, curious and also suspicious of them. Even revenue! I know companies that leave revenue on the table for strategy. Finally quality is about probabilities. That test you wrote that takes 12s to run and flakes 0.1% adding 10 hours of build time a year ... what is the probability of it detecting a bug and what would the cost of that bug be. You need every engineer to think of that stuff. It is hard stuff to get right or even good. I worked at places where a religion almost builds. People are hired to maintain those slow expensive unreliable tests! You want to improve that you now have politics! reply sevensor 3 hours agorootparentHow do you build 1 and 2? It seems so simple: talk relentlessly about what you’re trying to do as a company, and then figure out how to assign your people most effectively to do that. I’ve seen a number of leaders figure out the messaging and then flat out fail on execution. Once they’ve worked out the vision, they fail to give middle management enough latitude to accomplish it, and the lack of trust flows downhill. reply bjornsing 13 hours agorootparentprevI agree. First step I think is to start measuring what’s important at the top of the organization.

I would say this is not that common in SaaS. In that features are important but PMF is key. A feature that drags people over is really a new product. I can't think of an example of the bolt-on killer feature. And by the time you are big enough to run multiple distinct products youd better have good uptime. If you are a startup of course you need features but again finding PMF so you ain't worried about competitors.

This is the fact of real world software development: your resources are limited, and either you invest them creating value for customers so that they choose your product over your competitor's or they choose your competitor's instead. If you spend your resources on technical debt and clearing bug backlogs even of obscure nonblocking bugs, you're just spending your resources to offer your users more of the same. If you instead use your resources to deliver new features that might have a nonblocking bug here or there, you're improving your position over the competitor's. Time to market matters. A lot. There is no such thing as time to empty backlog. reply jack_h 50 minutes agorootparent> If you instead use your resources to deliver new features that might have a nonblocking bug here or there, you're improving your position over the competitor's. In the short term. Features can attract new customers but software that is frustrating to use due to a lot of low level bugs will repel existing customers towards competitors over the long term. If you've simultaneously decided tech debt isn't worth addressing then your competitor can easily overtake you. Furthermore adding feature after feature eventually leads to a kitchen sink product where potential customers are put off by the learning curve.

I’ve had the privilege of working with a very small team of engineers—a team with diverse life experiences and unique areas of expertise but a shared work ethic: the willingness to try. We always said that most of our time was spent failing, and that’s what made the moments of success so rewarding. When we finally succeeded, it wasn’t just about the victory; it was the culmination of relentless effort that allowed us to push forward, improve our product, and refine our ideas. Our approach was unique. We engaged directly with the people who did the work, learning from their insights and challenges, and built tools specifically for them. It wasn’t an Agile team or a Waterfall approach, or any other rigid corporate framework. It was an ad hoc team that came together organically to solve problems—and solved them faster than large corporations, consultants, or armies of workers ever could. With just four people, we scaled applications, built automation systems, and tackled complex problems that delivered multi-million-dollar savings across the board. The process was simple: no micromanagement, no unnecessary oversight. Everyone contributed based on what made sense, and we all collaborated freely to solve problems as they arose, moving seamlessly from one challenge to the next. It was innovation through cohesion—a kind of synergy that can’t be forced or replicated through standard processes. It’s the magic of the right people, in the right place, at the right time. Over the years, the tools we developed have grown into critical applications used by professional organizations, with over 3,000 users relying on them daily to make their work hundreds of percent faster. Yet, when these tools are handed over to large organizations for \"modernization\" or \"corporatization,\" they often end up spending exorbitant amounts of money, adding no meaningful features, and making the tools less effective. Teams of 30 people fail to replicate what our small team accomplished. It’s a strange and frustrating reality. I’ve tried to find ways to replicate this success, but I think it comes down to that intangible element—a “ragtag team” dynamic where the right people come together with a shared drive and passion. It’s rare, and perhaps it doesn’t exist as it once did. Maybe it’s out there, but we need to find ways to enable and foster it. reply RHSman2 2 hours agorootparentI think there are ways of philosophy not process.

I've worked at a few startups and have seen high-trust environments lead to a lot of productivity, comfort and success— and the opposite for low-trust startups. In general, I think startups tend to lean towards high-trust, especially when they're small and early, but I was part of a 15-person one that was quite the opposite, and it was terrible. The hiring process wasn't great. Long take-home task, and that was the only technical interview. A lot of talking, but not much noteworthy signal on the rest. Very long wait times. Now I know this is a red flag for low-trust companies. If they're not building trust at the hiring-stage, it means even after joining the organization it'll take time to acutally \"be part of the team\". Once at the company, I had no permission to poke around— everything was hidden by default. There was no space for discussion, I was expected to learn, not to comment. There was plenty of micro-management; after all, if they don't trust you, they need to keep an eye on you at all times. You're probably doing something wrong. The chasms were deep too; the company was building a web team to spin a contractor's project into a full web product, and I was supposed to lead it. We were disjointed from the rest of the company though, and would only hear about requirements through the founders. The team had interest on being more involved with the main product, but management just wasn't interested in making it happen, and just had us loiter around for a few months until they gathered requirements, and then implement some rather disjoint features. The project failed. I'm working somewhere else now. tldr; low-trust environments kill projects reply spuds 20 hours agorootparentYeah, I think there's almost always a point where a company decides they need to stop generally trusting their employees. Then all the trustworthy ones start getting more and more frustrated, or just start checking out. Agreed that most startups lean towards trust. Need to keep that going as long as possible, and stay away from hiring managers who think their primary job is \"protecting\" the company from anyone who might make a mistake. reply geophile 18 hours agorootparentYes, and at the same time, companies start hiring employees that shouldn’t be trusted. Neither one causes the other, both occur as companies mature. I’ve seen this as startups mature. One very vivid recollection: we had a very strong and tiny dev team. Each dev owned a huge piece of the product. Definitely not egoless. We brought in trusted junior devs to grow. That was fine. Then the very talented VP Eng. wanted a promotion and brought in a hack to replace him, who hadn’t coded in years, and was obviously more concerned with his career than our product. A real mediocrity. But the VP wanted to move on, so this mediocrity was hired, over vigorous objections. That was the end. This new VP brought in mediocre devs, rewarding loyalty and “being a team player” more than productivity, or competence. He brought in employees who couldn’t be trusted. As this was happening, we were acquired, and our new bosses from the parent company were used to employees who couldn’t be trusted, and acted that way. HR knew that to keep the good engineers they had to do something, so they showered us with bonuses. That worked for a while. I finally got so bored and fed up that I left (for another startup). reply aylmao 19 hours agorootparentprev> Need to keep that going as long as possible, and stay away from hiring managers who think their primary job is \"protecting\" the company from anyone who might make a mistake. On that note, a quick shot-out because I've been lucky enough to see the opposite happen at a big company too. Performance cycles at the company very much disincentivized big bets. Some engineers really thought project \"X\" was important, but it was risky— if it didn't pay off by the end of the cycle, per the way the bureaucracy worked, it wouldn't be great. The manager very much tried his best to protect them against this. In fact I don't think it paid that cycle, but the project remained active until it did eventually pay off.

If something bad happened on a total, extremely unlikely lark, don't act like it's going to happen again next week. I don't think this item was well thought through. Taking proactive decisions means allocating work for tasks that do not solve a concrete problem but bear the risk of introducing regressions. On the absolute best scenario, things continue to work as always. On the absolute worst scenario, you introduce a critical regression that brings down the service. There is literally no upside and all downsides. There are many reasons why \"if it ain't broke don't fix it\" is tried and true. > * Resist the urge to build walls between people/teams/departments. Instead, build a culture of collaboration (Hard and squishy and difficult to scale? Yup. Worth it? Absolutely.) That really depends on what you mean by \"walls\". The reason Conway's law is a thing is that in order to have functioning teams you also need functional independence. If you need to book a meeting with anyone to justify pushing a change to a service you do not own, that's already a wall. No matter how easy it is to get through that wall, it's still easier to not have to go through it. I can tell you an example of how independence always beats collaboration. Once I worked on a project where QAs were a separate team entirely, and made it their point to be the sole owners and maintainers of all automated test suites beyond unit and integration tests. We experienced a major regression that the regression test suite wasn't caught. I went right to the head of QAs and asked if I could push a commit to add a couple of regression tests. He politely declined by saying that they were already working on it and I wouldn't need to bother with that. Great, a victory for not building walls I guess? Except that his \"we are working on it\" ended up being \"we added a ticket to our backlog and we might pick it up two months from now\". Literally. And they never did, by the way, and the same regression was eventually introduced without anyone noticing. In case you wonder how I solved that problem, I created my own regression test suite.

Some smaller companies not in IT have their entire software/hardware infrastucture dependant on a single person who's been there for 20 years and it's objectively dangerous.

You can still have 20 people on a single project each owning it to an extent.

It was called The Psychology of Computer Programming (Weinberg 1971). There was a peculiar idea contained among the many excellent ideas of that book. It was the idea that the task of programming should be egoless. Programmers, the author said, should not invest their ego in the product they were building. ... What’s the alternative to an ego-invested programmer? A team-player programmer. The team player sees the software product as a team effort and a team achievement. Error reports and reviews and questions become team inputs to help improve the product, not threatening attacks to derail progress. ... But after further thought, this notion begins to unravel. It is all well and good to advocate egoless programming, but the fact of the matter is that human ego is a very natural thing, and it is difficult to find people who can—or even should—divorce their ego from their work. ... A system that works will have to acknowledge fundamental human traits and work within the bounds they create. And ego is one of those traits. \" - 'Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering', Robert Glass, 2002 reply weitendorf 19 hours agoparentPeople may bring ego into programming because of some kind of pathology (eg the need to always be right or in control) but I think in many cases it's because they truly care about the work. And the problem is not that they truly care, but that there is a mismatch between the amount of influence/control/autonomy they wish to exert on their work and the amount they are actually able to exert on it. I wasn't there, but my understanding is that essentially all programming in 1971 was done in large corporate settings or universities/research institutions. Those are environments where it's rare for any individual (even someone nominally in charge of a project) to have full creative and technical control over something, and even when they do, it only lasts as long as the project/grant or until their employer puts them on something else. Compared to the 70s there are effectively no barriers to a passionate engineer starting their own software project as either an open source project or in their own startup, and I'd argue that those are settings where it's actually highly beneficial to bring ego into programming. It's pretty much the same notion as \"founder mode\" or why BDFL is one of the most popular forms of governance for FOSS. Personally I'd recommend anybody who \"brings ego\" to their dayjob to take a stab at FOSS or a startup rather than trying to fit a square peg (caring a lot about their work) into a round hole (the realities of working on large projects). reply 01100011 19 hours agorootparentSometimes a person's dedication and care expresses itself to others as ego. Sometimes it is just ego. I think we've all implemented some clever trick in our code that we started to feel proud of. It's hard not to do. Even if you just contribute to a small piece of the project, you still might have those instances of pride. We're all human, and it's fine to take a little motivation from your accomplishment. But hold on loosely. Be critical of your baby and be willing to throw it out if it isn't the best approach. I used to really like driver/embedded programming because it seemed like there was a 'best approach' or idiomatic solution for most problems that eliminated ego.

Personally I think that that is ego, but that ego is not necessarily a bad thing. There is nothing wrong with taking pride in your work, nor in recognizing that you might actually be more knowledgable/skilled/correct in some particular matter than someone else and communicating that to them - as long as that sense of knowledge/skill/correctness is not misplaced, not expressed cruelly, and the actual reasoning is explained. To me, that is \"good ego\". But if someone thinks they always know better than someone else in all cases or isn't even willing to open discourse/explain why that's \"bad ego\". I guess to me, the sentiment expressed in this article is one that I feel strays too far into the realm of toxic positivity or crabs-in-a-bucket where merely being opinionated or passionate about your work is a bad thing because sometimes other people get their feelings hurt when you explain why their approach won't work well. I just don't think being egoless is necessarily good. I certainly wouldn't sit there smiling while something I worked on for years got destroyed by other people, because it'd be impolite or egotistical to point out that they're destroying something. But of course, there is a difference between something actually getting ruined, and having a meltdown because someone started naming variable in snake_case instead of camelCase. reply dasil003 17 hours agorootparentI would argue that in fact you do need a critical mass of ego throughout the ranks of engineers in a large organization. An engineering culture where engineers don't care inevitably leads to abdicating responsibility for overall system health and even data/workflow correctness as PMs attempt to steer the ship without understanding the implications of what they are asking for. Once this has gone on for a while, the system will be so intractably broken, and the dead sea effect will have caused such a brain drain of all those capable of fixing the problems, that at some point there's no economical path to restoring the software systems to a healthy and maintainable state. At that point you might as well just call in the private equity guys and figure out how to extract maximum cash out of the business as it stands, because any code change becomes more likely to break more things than it improves. So yeah you need ego. That said, it must also be tempered with the reality of needing to compromise enough to satisfice all stakeholders (including both technical and business stakeholders of all the different flavors). The beautiful thing about software engineering though, is there is a reasonable amount of objective facts, metrics and tradeoffs, that given a critical mass of sufficiently skilled and mature engineers, common ground tends not to be too hard to align on. Or at least, far easier than to get a non-technical stakeholder to understand the long-term implications of a bad decision. reply bruce511 15 hours agorootparentAgreed. To make the best work you have to take pride in it. This work has my name on it, customers will use it, I want to improve their lives not make them worse. The developers who come after me will need to assimilate this work. They'll need to build on it. I want to make their work a joy, not a burden. Do I take pride in what I do. It's not enough that the code just compiles. Pride is balanced by humility. I'm prepared to defend my choices (with well informed, well experienced) answers. But the choices I make are always a balance of upside and downside. And over my career things have changed which reweights some of those decisions. I'm open to external input from others because I want the result to be good not me to be right. I want to be proud of my work. But I'm humble enough to let others help me to improve it. [The above is my goal, sometimes I fall short] reply MrMcCall 17 hours agorootparentprevThe ego is, indeed, referred to in a negative sense because most people do not sublimate it to serve the group. It's natural state -- and, therefore, our natural state -- is to be selfish to oneself and one's in-group. There are 19 pairs of vice/virtue pairs in the ego. We can only decrease our ego's vice-eous tendencies by increasing our consciously manifesting compassion to everyone we encounter. It also helps to contact our Creator and ask for guidance. It awaits us in Its Unfathomable Lonliness to beseech it for help to begin and then see out the complete transformation of our ego into a selfless, servant of the happiness of others and the societies/cultures we inhabit. That Path of Loving Service is the key to happiness, and is the opposite of narcissistic attitudes and bahaviors. There is nothing mysterious about the ego; it's just that willful ignorance is one of our heart's vices, and its purpose is to deny that each person's ego transformation is not only possible, but the source of joy and community uplift, and is our free will to choose love or any of its many selfish opposites. reply Aloisius 17 hours agorootparentHuh. I thought it was thought of negatively because people confuse the word ego (self) with egotism/conceit (exaggerated sense of self-importance). The same sadly has happened with confusion of the word selfless (having no concern with self) with unselfish (concerned with others before oneself) and altruistic (unselfish concern for others' well being). Personally, I don't see any incompatibility between having a sense of self and healthy self-esteem and having compassion. Indeed, I see a major incompatibility between actual selflessness and universal compassion - as selflessness would preclude compassion for oneself. reply MrMcCall 16 hours agorootparentSelflessness merely means understanding that selfless service to others' happiness is a fundamental element of the spiritual path. We do not have to love them more than ourself, just equal, but we must take the chances we get to serve their happiness as much as possible. You're right about the negativity of the ego's self-important nature via conceit and egotism. Those are negative traits of the self. The goal of self-improvement is to become a consciously virtuous person who puts the needs of the whole in its proper place, and doesn't indulge their selfish vices, which always cause unhappiness to those around them. Positive self-esteem, when due to being a compassionate person, is a necessary component of the self-evolving person, because honesty in grokking the truth of ourselves is an important part of our growth. And, remember, universal compassion also includes being compassionate to our own self, and as we increase our virtuosness, we are ever more beloved by the universe, itself. The happiness on that path is not known by but a small minority of the world's cultures/societies. Sorry I'm not writing so clearly this late in the day, but know that the ego we have a birth is mostly selfish. It takes a definite turn towards the light to begin the process of purifying it by degrees from egotist to self-actualized bearer of compassion. It's a true fight, fighting against our own fallabilities and weaknesses and selfishnesses. But it's the most worthy struggle we will ever undertake. reply romanows 17 hours agorootparentprevCheck out Hackers, by Steven Levy, for some fun tales from early in computing. reply MichaelZuo 19 hours agorootparentprevWell the ‘pathology’ is clear, isn’t it?

This requires becoming a compassionate, empathetic human being via deliberate, honest, self-critical work on the areas of our personality that cause unhappiness to others via selfish negativity. We are the only beings on Earth that can self-evolve, by using our conscience and mind to evaluate of our actions to find out where we are causing unhappiness. Then, we must engage our free will to choose to be better, and do the things that help us to grow spiritually out of the immature, selfish mammals we begin as, into the humanitarians that result from reaching our highest potential. The most destructive lie we let our minds tell us is that this transformation is not possible, or is the figment of someone's imagination.

If our heart is aimed right, we can take advantage of religious practices to level-up, but with a callous or cruel or hateful heart, no amount of religious practices is going to do anything but cement our horrible behavior. This is because we each have the choice of how and why to behave one way or another. The love one feels in one's heart is of little consequence if there is no selfless action in service to the loved person's happiness.

It is also the measure of every person, so once you begin orienting yourself in the moral compass' proper direction, you can begin to see how others are aligned or misaligned. Such selfish folks are those who just don't give a damn to become a better person, which would result in lessening the amount of hurt they inflict on others.

To beat the everliving sh_t out of them to keep them from earning more negative karma in the future, while earning positive karma from helping protect other innocents.

That's your right, just as it is mine to love you anyway and try to educate you out of your ignorance. If you don't want me to, then I'll not bother you, but this is a public forum, so we can post so long as we remain within the guidelines. That said, I'm not advertising for any specific religion, but to the core of all of God's religions, because they each have compassion at their core, or they have gone horribly astray. You must find your own path within the umbrella of God's Loving self-evolution. Seek and ye shall find what is perfect for you. When you tire of your unhappiness, you can pray that God help you out of your ignorance and guide you to a suitable teacher.

Personally I don't see it through such an individualist lens— I think this is a collective issue that can't possibly rely on an individual's \"spiritual awakening\". As such, I think the bigger issue is that (in some cultures more and some less) people are actively encouraged to compete and feed their ego. At a societal level, for example, it'd be easy to blame schools or parents for this kind of education, but I think they're just doing what makes sense in their economic environment. If the world is winner-takes-all, I can't blame parents for wanting their kids to be \"winners\", lest they are left with nothing instead. Going back to the post and the way this played out at the company— it was upper-management with the wide impact their decision-making has on organization as a whole, its rules and procedures, that led the change. It wasn't individuals each individually overcoming their own egos that led the change here. Once the precedent is set up-top, and the policies are changed, the rest could follow. It was top down and systematic. reply MrMcCall 20 hours agorootparentWell, the higher-ups (in all organizations) do, indeed, have a greater cultural influence on the group's ideals, attitudes, and behaviors. The especially problematic aspect of this is that we often reward the least compassionate with greater responsibility. That is backward thinking from backward-facing people. If a person wants more power so they can enjoy such \"fruits\" (more money, control over other people, more pleasures, ...), then they will support people who exemplify those negative characteristics. Believe me when I say that despots don't gain power without significant support from other low-virue folks. That is really the story of human history. But, no, it is each person's personal responsibility to seek and attain some measure of spiritual growth, with humility, honesty, perseverance, and study. Just like a CEO with bad personality traits will cause negative downstream effects, any individual with those traits will poison the teams they work on or whose work they affect. As to competition among humans, that is just our common delusion, whereby we are fearfully convinced that we are merely mammals competing for scarce resources, instead of human beings who are capable of cooperation, generosity, compassion, and selfless service for the benefit of the whole, including future generations. What we are witnessing across the Earth's societies is nothing less than the apotheosis of the masses' majorities exercising their free will to choose ignorance over wisdom in how we treat each other and what we will allow our organizations (such as corps and govts) to produce. A human life committed to selfish competition against other groups is a life wasted on mammalian idiocy, and always results in degradation of the whole. Why are we not all humanitarians? Because most people reject our highest possible ideals, attitudes, and behaviors. Their reasons are numerous, but none hold any weight, for none will bring them peace and happiness, because only by making other people happy can we be happy. And we can only make other people happy by giving of our selves selflessly and compassionately. reply Nevermark 16 hours agorootparent> What we are witnessing across the Earth's societies is nothing less than the apotheosis of the masses' majorities exercising their free will to choose ignorance over wisdom There is a mismatch between your observations about humans as a whole, and the appeal to individuals and their individual values. I am all for individual ethics, but half the people on the planet could have great ethics, and things could still devolve. The way to scalable net-positive gains starts with oneself, but also requires finding ways to pull others into net-positive arrangements, in a way that generates value back to you. Then repeat on larger scales. If a fraction of the planet worked hard from that standpoint, things would improve markedly. Even a lot of failures and a few successes would make a lot of positive difference. Applying game theory, psychology and local conditions toward scaling up positive sum games, is another form of engineering. Perhaps the highest form. reply MrMcCall 15 hours agorootparentThere is no mismatch, friend. \"Pulling others in\", as you put it, requires two ends of the leveling-up: first, the initiate explains how to begin the self-evolution, and second, the newcomer accepts the challenge and begins their own path to self-evolution. For those who invite, we are to do so with loving kindness, because the result is wholly dependent upon the receiver opening and then walking through the door we present. There is no compulsion in religion, and we must understand and remember that it is everyone's choice, and we cannot be negative about their declination. No badgering, no negativity whatsoever, period. We are to keep being kind with the hope that they will catch on eventually, as the events of their lives surface the negativity that they, themselves, have sown into the world via their willful ignorance. Perhaps they will reach a point where they've had enough of ignorance and are willing to give the Path of Love a try. And this is no game, though systems theory is the proper model of our situation, where there in an intrinsic gravity we each face to the idea of overcoming our intrinsic negative traits (the vices of the heart/mind). Now, construct the model with cooperating verses competing individuals in the population, positive contributors verses negative contributors. Of course, you already correctly intuit the fact that the more of us that viewed our aggregate impact upon the Earth (and each other) this way (that we can actually change things by being a part of the positive force), things could improve quite rapidly. The fact is that we are moving in such a diametrically opposite direction to cooperative compassion that we are literally destroying the Earth for our future generations. And it is our choice, each of us, individually, but with billions of us aggregating into a miserable mass of selfish f_cks who are causing unnecessary strife, unhappiness, and destruction via our willful ignorance of what is possible for us both individually and collectively. reply Nevermark 12 hours agorootparentThanks for the rebuttle. You are right, I stand corrected - I think both approaches make sense for spreading change. Yours on an every day basis, the viewpoint I gave requires opportunity, but matters too. The thing with game theory, is it’s the right way to think of social structures that scale. I think a lot of people’s behavior responds strongly to their incentives. All those people you (and I) are cynical about. And ethics really are the positive sum “games”. Keeping one’s word, safety nets, helping our neighbors, win-win transactions and relationships - we adopt them as individuals for the immediate good it does, for us and who we interact with. And knowing if everyone did that we would all be better off. Even the self-isolating rich since society as a whole would run better.

As someone else said, it's difficult to find people who work without ego (whatever working without ego would mean). Most of my professional experience is as a working musician, and it goes without saying that artists have egos, in the sense that they try to bring something from their inner selves to the outer world, and that they invest a lot of effort in learning how to do so properly. Sometimes I've felt that the best musicians I've worked with were \"low ego\" but this could be just that they are supremely confident and also not lacking in affirmation from their audiences - and if they are kind, from their fellow musicians. The worst people I've worked with are talented people who can't seem to find the affirmation they crave, but feel they deserve. They feel constantly slighted and left behind. As a band leader, I realized I simply have to stroke these people's egos - no matter how confident, skilled, or amazing some people seem they are riddled with self doubt and absolutely need outside affirmation.

The best teams I've worked on have worked towards the following: Pizza teams that own the whole stack, and for the roles that don't need a full-time individual, specialists that come in and advise but also make it possible to DIY the things they do. The best examples of specialists are Designers and Security teams as this talk highlights. They can make the tools and the means for other teams to self-service those needs. For example, security teams implementing CI tools and designers building design frameworks that are easy to apply. Conversely, they can feel free to make changes themselves and are empowered to at the best organizations. Everyone else in product development is a generalist, including the managers, and everyone is on-call. When everyone is on-call then it results in far fewer alerts going off because when there is an issue, it's taken very seriously and remediated quickly in the following days & weeks. I think GTM teams could also benefit from this same kind of process, but instead melding Marketing, Sales and Support roles and responsibilities. My theory on why this wasn't more common in the past was that the work was too complex and specialized and that the tools and knowledge to do the job weren't as easy to acquire as it is today.

My guess is that there was a leader in their past who set values but didn't actually follow them. \"We dig ditches\" means \"everybody but me digs ditches\". It's hard to be both technically and morally capable, but I think that's what leadership requires. So an approach might be to set only the values you can actually follow through on, and be clear when a value is aspirational. If you really do dig ditches (perhaps metaphorically, maybe by fixing deployment script bugs or something), then you can use it as a value. To be clear: I'm definitely in favor of team values.

You want selfless devotion to the goal then you damn well better not be wasting my time and cutting costs at the expense of my productivity. Managers who don't know what they're talking about and insist they do and insist they are right causing massive lost time, then want to hold meeting after meeting about how it is everyone else's fault. You've seen it. Why am I working long hours doing work, some of which is shovelling sand that need shovelling because I'm not too good for it when if that idiot had been restrained to their level of competence we'd already have delivered and I'd see more of my family. Selfless devotion? To what? In the old days when SSDs were 'expensive' and companies economised and didn't immediately buy them for the team because my time isn't worth saving but they want me to stay back to get more done for a deadline? Selfless devotion to a goal you're showing clearly you don't care about. This stuff is really normal. You have stories, everyone does. And so we take the path that is best for ourselves and those we like. Any other choice isn't \"egoless\" it's insane. Managing a team is hard. Keeping idiots from having idiotic influence is hard. Spotting who is managing up is hard. Noticing, supporting and retaining who is good is hard.

The problem is not just that the Designer might Break the Build or ship something broken one time (but know how to fix it). The problem is that stuff can (obviously, not in all cases, and not something you should just assume will happen without good evidence/reasoning) start breaking all the time because you have too many people changing things that interact with other things they only partially understand. Or it's that one team/\"domain\" ends up downstream or dependent on another, and locally optimal but globally suboptimal decisions made upstream (eg a bad but quick to implement data model, or adding more dependencies on something you're in the process of getting rid of) cause problems downstream. In these situations your \"egoless domain experts\" might actually need the authority to force these things to stop, or might get burnt out spending all their time firefighting or playing hero. There are also some kinds of engineering mistakes that are literally business-killing, like major security breaches/data loss. Mandatory code review isn't a \"feel-bad program\", it's precisely to guard against disasters like this (also I'm pretty sure it's literally required by SOX/SOC2 and I'd certainly want my software vendors to implement this). That's why I think this is actually a balancing exercise that is highly case dependent, not something you can merely say \"just empower people we're all on the same team\". If your team is highly skilled, conscientious, and motivated you can give people a lot of autonomy - if they're mostly unskilled and don't give a fuck about the quality of their work, you can't give them much autonomy. If the scope of what you're working on is huge (so huge that any one person can only have a working understanding of a small part of the whole) you probably do need more process and guardails in place than a smaller project. reply solatic 12 hours agoparent> In these situations your \"egoless domain experts\" might actually need the authority to force these things to stop, or might get burnt out spending all their time firefighting or playing hero. The broader approach here is to encourage frameworks where changes must go through policy-as-code frameworks. SMEs write policy that is then enforced (or just warned, for some period ahead of enforcement) by the policy framework. Policies can encode exceptions, but changes to policy (i.e. to add exceptions) require SME review. The benefit is - stuff that passes policy doesn't require explicit review, so in the normative case autonomous teams are not slowed down, and when they are (due to policy failure), then it is for Good Reasons. > Mandatory code review isn't a \"feel-bad program\", it's precisely to guard against disasters like this (also I'm pretty sure it's literally required by SOX/SOC2 and I'd certainly want my software vendors to implement this). High-trust environments trust engineers to understand the difference between \"this is a serious change so I need someone to review it\" and \"I'm just fixing a typo here so I'm going to rubber-stamp it.\" But yes, SOC2 requires mandatory code review, tickets, the lot. Yes, it slows things down, but that is the price you pay to become a Serious Enterprise Vendor. No, it doesn't fundamentally erode high-trust culture.

If someone could be physically harmed by bad code, then it all needs to be reviewed. If you can be hacked by a rouge deployment, then it all needs to be reviewed.

(Or if you do, it's because your tooling hasn't scaled enough to keep up; you need a staging area or precommit hooks or whatever.) If you know you're trusted to do your job, you will work to maintain that trust. But things need to be architected for trust. If you have lots of rigid processes, then there's no use for manually executed tools that will only be used if someone decides to use them. People will lean on the process, and every time something goes wrong, the process will be \"improved\" (as in, catch one more potential issue, at the cost of taking longer and catching two more non-issues and making people batch up their changes more, causing more conflicts, etc.) In a high-trust environment, people will use the manual tools when appropriate, and so there's incentive for architecting things such that the results of those tools and processes is useful. Tests are more likely to test real things. Staging environments will be made to better reflect prod. If people care about it, they'll make it work. If they don't, they'll make it \"work\". But yes, I agree that as you scale up, more and more things will get missed and you'll need to balance things out. It's just so, so common to go too far in the rigid low-trust direction. People are so terrified that something might go wrong that they'll do things that end up making sure that something will go wrong.

The productivity of every single team that I've been apart of, that shipped fast, was enabled through permission, by highly experienced domain experts who knew how to build guardrails instead of controls. Canary releases, monitoring and rollbacks, not release managers. Automated testing, not codeowners. Controls prohibit actors from doing certain things. Outside of regulated environments, they should only exist at the perimeter of your business, interfering in the nefarious activities of malicious external actors.

One argument that comes to mind is: If you treat people like children, they will start behaving like children. Treat people as adults if you want them to shoulder responsibility. The main message of this talk is that when a designer tried to deploy a fix into production and it blew up production, they realized he had the wrong kind of permissions and their solution was to give him full deployment permissions. Well, great if that worked for you. It might or might not work for others. I would recommend not letting anybody deploy to production. You can deploy to staging, then tests are run, and only after those all pass can anyone deploy to production. Also, the current process is not just the result of ego.

    "originLink": "https://www.phoenixframework.org/blog/phoenix-liveview-1.0-released?release=1.0",
    "originBody": "Phoenix LiveView 1.0.0 is here! Posted on December 3rd, 2024 by Chris McCord LiveView 1.0.0 is out! This 1.0 milestone comes six years after the first LiveView commit. Why LiveView I started LiveView to scratch an itch. I wanted to create dynamic server-rendered applications without writing JavaScript. I was tired of the inevitable ballooning complexity that it brings. Think realtime form validations, updating the quantity in a shopping cart, or real-time streaming updates. Why does it require moving mountains to solve in a traditional stack? We write the HTTP glue or GraphQL schemas and resolvers, then we figure out which validation logic needs shared or dup’d. It goes on and on from there – how do we get localization information to the client? What data serializers do we need? How do we wire up WebSockets and IPC back to our code? Is our js bundle getting too large? I guess it’s time to start turning the Webpack or Parcel knobs. Wait Vite is a thing now? Or I guess Bun configuration is what we want? We’ve all felt this pain. The idea was, what if we removed these problems entirely? HTTP can go away, and the server can handle all the rendering and dynamic update concerns. It felt like a heavy approach, but I knew Elixir and Phoenix was perfectly suited for it. Six years later this programming model still feels like cheating. Everything is super fast. Payloads are tiny. Latency is best-in-class. Not only do you write less code, there’s simply less to think about when writing features. Real-time foundations unlock superpowers Interesting things happen when you give every user and UI a real-time, bidirectional foundation as a matter of course. You suddenly have superpowers. You almost don’t notice it. Being freed from all the mundane concerns of typical full-stack development lets you focus on just shipping features. And with Elixir, you start shipping features that other platforms can’t even conceive as possible. Want to ship real-time server logs to the js console in development? No problem! What about supporting production hot code upgrades where browsers can auto re-render anytime CSS stylesheets, images, or templates change – without losing state or dropping connections? Sure! Or maybe you have an app deployed planet-wide where you do work across the cluster and aggregate the results in real-time back to the UI. Would you believe the entire LiveView, including the template markup and RPC calls, is 350 LOC? These are the kinds of applications that LiveView enables. It feels incredible to ship these kinds of things, but it took a while to arrive here for good reasons. There was a lot to solve to make this programming model truly great. How it started Conceptually, what I really wanted is something like what we do in React – change some state, our template re-renders automatically, and the UI updates. But instead of a bit of UI running on the client, what if we ran it on the server? The LiveView could look like this: defmodule ThermoLive do def render(assigns) do ~H\"\"\"Temperature: {@thermostat.temperature} Mode: {@thermostat.mode} + -\"\"\" end def mount(%{\"id\" => id}, _session, socket) do thermostat = ThermoControl.get_thermostat!(id) :ok = ThermoControl.subscribe(thermostat) {:ok, assign(socket, thermostat: thermostat)} end def handle_info({ThermoControl, %ThermoStat{} = new_thermo}, _, socket) do {:noreply, assign(socket, thermostat: new_thermo)} end def handle_event(\"inc\", _, socket) do thermostat = ThermoControl.inc(socket.assigns.thermostat) {:noreply, assign(socket, thermostat: thermostat)} end end Like React, we have a render function and something that sets our initial state when the LiveView mounts. When state changes, we call render with the new state and the UI is updated. Interactions like phx-click on the + or - button, can be sent as RPC’s from client to server and the server can respond with fresh page HTML. These client/server messages use Phoenix Channels which scale to millions of connections per server. Likewise, if the server wants to send an update to the client, such as another user changing the thermostat, the client can listen for it and replace the page HTML in the same fashion. My naive first pass on the phoenix_live_view.js client looked something like this. let main = document.querySelector(\"[phx-main]\") let channel = new socket.channel(\"lv\") channel.join().receive(\"ok\", ({html}) => main.innerHTML = html) channel.on(\"update\", ({html}) => main.innerHTML = html) window.addEventListener(\"click\", e => { let event = e.getAttribute(\"phx-click\") if(!event){ return } channel.push(\"event\", {event}).receive(\"ok\", ({html}) => main.innerHTML = html) }) This is how LiveView started. We went to the server for interactions, re-rendered the entire template on state change, and sent the entire page down to the client. The client then swapped out the inner HTML. It worked, but it was not great. Partial state changes required re-executing the entire template and sending down gobs of HTML for otherwise tiny updates. Still the basic programming model was exactly what I wanted. As HTTP fell away from my concerns, entire layers of full-stack considerations disappeared. Next the challenge was making this something truly great. Little did we know we’d accidentally our way to outperforming many SPA use-cases along the way. How we optimized the programming model LiveView’s diffing engine solved two problems with a single mechanism. The first problem was only executing those dynamic parts of a template that actually changed from a previous render. The second was only sending the minimal data necessary to update the client. It solves both by splitting the template into static and dynamic parts. Considering the following LiveView template: ~H\"\"\" Temperature: {format_unit(@temperature)} \"\"\" At compile time, we convert the template into a struct like this: %Phoenix.LiveView.Rendered{ static: [\"Temperature:\", \"\"] dynamic: fn assigns -> [ if changed?(assigns, :mode), do: assigns.mode, if changed?(assigns, :temperature), do: format_unit(assigns.temperature) ] end } We know the static parts never change, so they are split from the dynamic Elixir expressions. Next, we compile each expression with change tracking based on the variables accessed within each expression. On render, we compare the previous template values with the new and only execute the template expression if the value has changed. Instead of sending the entire template down on change, we can send the client all the static and dynamic parts on mount. After mount we only send the partial diff of dynamic values for each update. To see how this works, we can imagine the following payload being sent on mount for the template above: { s: [\"Temperature: \", \"\"], 0: \"cooling\", 1: \"68℉\" } The client receives a map of static values in the s key, and dynamic values keyed by their index in the statics. For the client to render the full template string, it only needs to zips the static list with the dynamic values. For example: [\"Temperature: \", \"68℉\", \"\"].join(\"\") \"Temperature: 68℉\" With the client holding a static/dynamic cache, optimizing network updates is no work at all. Any server render following mount simply returns the new dynamic values at their known index. Unchanged dynamic values and statics are ignored entirely. If a LiveView runs assign(socket, :temperature, 70), the render/1 function is invoked, and the following payload gets sent down the wire: {1: \"70℉\"} Thats it! To update the UI, the client simply merges this object with its static/dynamic cache: { { s: [\"Temperature: \", \"\"], 0: \"cooling\", 1: \"70F\" => 1: \"70℉\" } } Then the data is zipped together on the client to produce the full HTML of the UI. Of course innerHTML updates blow away UI state and are expensive to perform. So like any client-side framework, we compute minimal DOM diffs to efficiently update the DOM. In fact, we’ve had folks migrate from React to Phoenix LiveView because LiveView client rendering was faster what their React app could offer. Optimizations continued from there. Including fingerprinting, for comprehensions, tree sharing, and more. You can read all about each optimization on the Dashbit blog. We apply these optimizations automatically and for free thanks to our stateful client and server connection. Most other server rendered HTML solutions send the whole fragment on every update or require users to fine tune updates by hand. Best in class latency We’ve seen how LiveView payloads are smaller than the best hand-written JSON API or GraphQL query, but it’s even better than that. Every LiveView holds a connection to the server so page navigation happens via live navigation. TLS handshakes, current user auth, etc happen a single time for the lifetime of the user’s visit. This allows page navigation to happen via a single WebSocket frame, and fewer database queries for any client action. The result is fewer round trips from the client, and simply less work done by the server. This provides less latency for the end-user compared to an SPA fetching data or sending mutations up to a server. Holding a stateful connections comes at the cost of server memory, but it’s far cheaper than folks expect. At a baseline, a given channel connection consumes 40kb of memory. This gives a 1GB server a theoretical ceiling of ~25,000 concurrent LiveViews. Of course the more state you store, the more memory you consume, but you only hold onto the state you need. We also have stream primitives for handling large collections without impacting memory. Elixir and the Erlang VM were designed for this. Scaling a stateful system to millions of concurrent users isn’t theoretical – we do it all the time. See WhatsApp, Discord, or our own benchmarks as examples. With the programming model optimized on both client and server, we expanded into higher level building blocks that take advantage of our unique diffing engine. Reusable Components with HEEx Change tracking and minimal diffs were ground-breaking features, but our HTML templates still lacked composability. The best we could offer is “partial”-like template rendering where a function could encapsulate some partial template content. This works, but it composes poorly and is mismatched in the way we write markup. Fortunately Marlus Saraiva from the Surface project spearheaded development of an HTML-aware component system and contributed back to the LiveView project. With HEEx components, we have a declarative component system, HTML validation, and compile-time checking of component attributes and slots. HEEx components are just annotated functions. They look like this: @doc \"\"\" Renders a button. ## Examples Send! Send! \"\"\" attr :type, :string, default: nil attr :rest, :global, include: ~w(disabled form name value) slot :inner_block, required: true def button(assigns) do ~H\"\"\"{render_slot(@inner_block)}\"\"\" end An invalid call to a component, such asproduces a compile-time warning: warning: undefined attribute \"click\" for component AppWeb.CoreComponents.button/1 lib/app_web/live/page_live.ex:123: (file) Slots allows the component to accept arbitrary content from a caller. This allows components to be much more extensible by the caller without creating a bunch of bespoke partial templates to handle every scenario. Streamlined HEEx syntax When we introduced HEEx and function components, we added a new syntax for interpolating values within tag attributes along with :if and :for conveniences for conditionally generating templates. It looked like this: ValueNote the use of standard EExinterpolation. With the release of LiveView 1.0, we are extending the HTML-aware {} attribute interpolation syntax to within tag bodies as well. This means you can now interpolate values directly within the tag body in a streamlined syntax: Value {val} The EExremains supported and is required for generating dynamic blocks of distinct markup, as well as for interpolating values within andtags. HEEx markup annotations Gone are the days of examining your browser’s HTML and then hunting for where that HTML was generated within your code. The final browser markup can be rendered within several nested layers of component calls. How do we quickly trace back who rendered what? HEEx solves this with a debug_heex_annotations configuration. When set, all rendered markup will be annotated with the file:line of the function component definition, as well as, the file:line of the caller invocation of the component. In practice your dev HTML will look like this in the browser inspector: It annotates the document both at the caller site and the function component definition. If you find the above hard to navigate, you can use the new Phoenix.LiveReloader features that have your editor jump to an element’s nearest caller or definition file:line when clicked with a special key sequence of your choosing. Let’s see it in action: First, we can see how holding c while clicking jumped to the caller file:Line location for thatinvocation. Next, we see that holding d while clicking the button jumped to the function definition file:line. This is such a simple quality of life improvement. It will become a key part of your workflow as soon as you try it out. Interactive Uploads A few years ago, LiveView tackled the file upload problem. Something that should be easy has historically been unnecessarily difficult. We wanted a single abstraction for interactive uploads for both direct to cloud, and direct to server use-cases. With a few lines of server code you can have file uploads with drag and drop, file progress, selection pruning, file previews, and more. More recently, we defined an UploadWriter behavior. This gives you access to the raw upload stream as it’s being chunked by the client. This lets you do things like stream uploads to a different server or transcode a video as it’s being uploaded. Since the uploads happen over the existing LiveView connection, reflecting the upload progress or advanced file operations become trivial to implement: Streams and Async Following uploads, we shipped a streams primitive for efficiently handling large collections without needing to hold those collections in server memory. We also introduced assign_async and start_async primitives, which makes handling async operations and rendering async results a breeze. For example, imagine you have an expensive operation that calls out to an external service. The results can be latent or spotty, or both. Your LiveView can use assign_async/2 to offload this operation to a new process andto render the results with each loading, success, or failure state. def render(assigns) do ~H\"\"\"Loading organizationthere was an error loading the organization {org.name}\"\"\" end def mount(%{\"slug\" => slug}, _, socket) do {:ok, assign_async(:org, fn -> {:ok, %{org: fetch_org(slug)}} end)} end Now instead of worrying about an async task crashing the UI, or carefully monitoring async ops while updating the template with a bunch of conditionals, you have a single abstraction for performing the work and rendering the results. As soon as the LiveView disconnects, the async processes are cleaned up, ensuring no wasted resources go to a UI that is no longer around. Here we can also see slots in action with theandslots of thefunction component. Slots allow the caller to extend components with their own dynamic content, including their own markup and function component calls. LiveView goes mainstream LiveView and .NET Blazor both started about the same time. I like to think both projects helped spearhead the adoption of this programming model. Since getting started, this model has been embraced in various ways in the Go, Rust, Java, PHP, JavaScript, Ruby, and Haskell communities. And I’m sure others I haven’t yet heard of. Most don’t offer LiveView’s declarative model. Instead developers are required to annotate how individual elements are updated and removed, leading to fragile applications, akin to client-side applications before the introduction of React and other declarative frameworks. Most also lack the optimizations LiveView developers get for free. Large payloads are sent on every event unless developers manually fine tune them. React itself liked the idea of putting React on the server so much, they shipped their own React Server Components to tackle a cross section of similar goals with LiveView. In the case of RSC, pushing real-time events are left to external means. React, like most, chose different tradeoffs because they had no choice. The majority skip the stateful, bidirectional communication layer because most platforms are poorly suited for it. Elixir and the Erlang VM are truly what make this programming model shine. And we have only barely discussed our built-in globally distributed clustering and PubSub. There are truly extraordinary features built into the platform that are at your fingertips. Try it out Now is a great time to dive in and give LiveView a try! We have launched new.phoenixframework.org which lets you get up and running in seconds with Elixir and your first Phoenix project with a single command: For osx/linux: $ curl https://new.phoenixframework.org/myappsh For Windows PowerShell: > curl.exe -fsSO https://new.phoenixframework.org/app.bat; .\\app.bat For existing applications, check the changelog for breaking changes to bring your existing apps up to speed. What’s Next Following this release, we’ll be continuing efforts around collocated JavaScript hooks, enhancing Web Component integration, supporting navigation guards, and more as outlined in our issue tracker. Special Thanks Arriving here wouldn’t have been possible without the help of the Phoenix team, especially Steffen Deusch, who has tackled countless LiveView issues over the last year.

Though it is clear that the similarity between Elixir and Ruby is only superficial, I cannot refrain from seeing your and José's work as a reflection and evolution of the work started with Ruby and Rails. Which includes the friendly community, the pragmatism to build solid software for people that need to ship, and the excellent stewardship of the Elixir and Phoenix projects. I'm a full time Elixir developer since 2016 and it's still my favourite programming environment. I've recently had a client notice how smooth the dashboard I threw together in an hour feels, and he doesn't know that I have not written a single line of Javascript to build it.

I started using LiveView shortly after the beta was released. A few of my coworkers were really excited to try it out, so I was tasked with recreating our company's login page with LiveView. Needless to say, there were… ahem… growing pains—but it was super fun to encounter a problem and then just have it go away the following week because of some new update to LiveView. I don't do much (any?) web development these days, but LiveView gave me—a backend dev—the confidence to spin up my own web apps with classy UIs.

Been running a startup off only liveview for about a year as a solo dev and it's been wonderful. Appreciate the work you all do. Selfish demo idea: Bi-directional cursor based infinite pagination with largish datasets with state managed in the url and streaming updates that change the order of the results. Like some kind of soft realtime leaderboard. With long render times (morphdom bench on large sets isn't great as far as I can tell) it's hard to escape the jank. Particularly on slow connections. reply chrismccord 14 hours agorootparentWill keep this in mind! My ElixirConfEU keynote just used limit/offset pagination, but shows how easy it is to do bidirectional infinite pagination. Streams allows you to keep a virtualized infinite list in the DOM without keeping the giant collection around on either client or server, example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FADQAnq0RpA&t=2322s This demo doesn't update the URL to keep state (but push_patch would make that trivial). I'll think about more complex examples for cursor pagination, but the solution to massive collections (thousands of entries) is going to be stream + limit reply goosejuice 13 hours agorootparentThanks! That is the approach I took, though I believe reordering rows requires a reset. So in that demo, I'm curious how smooth the scroll would be when adding latency via the debug tools in the browser console. Even with some padding and fiddling with limi ts I've had trouble getting it to be an enjoyable experience. Just bouncy if that makes sense. More frustrating on mobile than desktop. With localhost latency it's great. I'm thinking it may just need a hook to preload rows or something of that nature to provide space for the render. Though my CSS could very well be wrong. reply davydog187 3 hours agorootparentprevI highly recommend checking out [Flop](https://hexdocs.pm/flop/readme.html) and its Phoenix.Component [Flop Phoenix](https://hexdocs.pm/flop_phoenix/readme.html).

Browsers aren’t as much the issue as they’ve been in the past, but I’ve hit snags with proxies, old servers, etc. reply ethbr1 17 hours agorootparentHow does pagination in urls work nowadays? You'd need ~3 bytes to index a reasonable number of pages naively, no? But curious what current art is re: performance optimizations between frontend and backend. Or is it simply page indices? reply out_of_protocol 8 hours agorootparentIf you do limit/offset on database side, page number is enough. Though this doesn't work well for bigger page numbers. There's other ways to do pagination, e.g. with \"cursors\", where cursor is simply id of last record on previous page. SQL query is very efficient, but jumping to page X is impossible. In this scenario storing cursors for past pages is needed reply cess11 8 hours agorootparentThere are libraries for Ecto that help with this. https://github.com/duffelhq/paginator reply sph 5 hours agorootparentCareful that this library last I used it (2020 or so) used a particularly insecure encoding of the cursor that basically allows remote execution.

What JS solution/approach would you recommend to use with LiveView for pure client-side stuff? reply AlchemistCamp 18 hours agoparentprevI’ve been looking forward to this for a long time! Congrats to you and everyone else who made it happen! reply estreeper 19 hours agoprevWe've built many production apps using LiveView. It has some limitations inherent to its design, namely the need to have a semi-reliable WebSocket connection to be able to effectively use the app, but with this tradeoff come a number of advantages: - code generation makes for an extremely productive experience that makes standing up an actually-useful application very fast - Elixir is a great language, especially for the web, and using it to render the frontend feels like having the full power of the language plus the simplicity of HTML (with little/no writing JavaScript) - it's extremely efficient since only tiny changes are sent over the WebSocket when data is updated on the server - you're already using WebSockets, so adding any kind of real-time functionality is very easy (chat, notifications, game state) Because of the separation of concerns by convention (i.e. keeping business logic in Contexts), it's also a very viable pathway to build a webapp using LiveView first, and serve an API once you need other types of clients (native apps, API consumers) with minimal changes. Ecto is also great to use for validations, and having that available for \"frontend\" code is a pleasure. It's also great to be able to have backend and frontend tests in Elixir. We've hit some bugs and gotchas over the years leading up to this 1.0 release, but it has long felt like a stable, well-built library that keeps our codebases simple and maintainable, which lets you move fast. Congratulations to Chris, Jose, and all the other wonderful contributors! reply chrismccord 16 hours agoparentThanks! Love to hear it! Note that LiveView also fully works on the LongPoll transport (which is enabled by default), and we have automatic fallback to longpoll support if websocket fails for whatever reason. So even in the case of obscure websocket issues (like some \"corporate proxies\" doing weird things like allowing the 101 websocket upgrade then just dropping things into the ether), things should be good. In my experience 1-2% of traffic seems to have websocket issues today for the production apps I work on. To your point though, LiveView indeed requires a semi reliable connection for reasonable UX, but there is a ton of nuance to this topic that is usually missed from the discussions. Apps should more or less degrade similarly to SPA's that are going to the server. For robust UX on unreliable connections you need offline/local-first SPAs, and in my experience the vast majority of SPAs do not handle this. Failing that, most SPA frameworks seem to place the optimistic UI/rollback concerns on the developer. In fact most degrade quite poorly on bad connections. It goes against folks intuition, but even with degraded connections LiveView does better than people imagine because we have the existing connection established and don't need to go through the overheard of reestablishing things, and our payloads are generally smaller.

I use LV mainly over long polling at the moment, only drawback is the whining about the client being unable to establish a WebSocket connection in the JS console. reply arrowsmith 19 hours agoprevNow there’s some good news! I’ve been using LiveView for years now and couldn’t be happier with it. It’s a joy to work with, and has reinvigorated my love of web development. I’m so blazingly productive in LV it’s unreal. I try not to be too self-promoey on HN but this feels like as good as time as any: if this v1.0.0 release makes you want to finally learn LiveView, I humbly recommend my own course at http://learnphoenixliveview.com. Get 20% off with the code HACKERNEWS. I struggled to find good learning materials when I was starting out, so I’ve tried to rectify that problem. I hope that I can get more people over the initial learning curve because as far as I’m concerned, the more people get familiar with this awesome framework, the more everybody wins. reply evnp 19 hours agoparentYour course has been fantastic to work through, please keep up the great work (also saw you just launched a companion deep-dive on Phoenix forms, congrats!) - not affiliated, just a humble enjoyer of Arrowsmith Labs materials reply arrowsmith 7 hours agorootparentThanks! reply AnonC 4 hours agoparentprev> I struggled to find good learning materials when I was starting out, so I’ve tried to rectify that problem. Just curious to know — was Pragmatic Studio not available or not affordable for you at that time? I’ve seen them teaching these for many years now. Pragmatic Programmers (the book publisher) has also had many books on these over the years (probably not as early as when Pragmatic Studio had online courses). reply thedangler 4 hours agoparentprevWill you update the course for v1.0 of Liveview? Thanks reply mrdoops 18 hours agoprevMost expensive part of the typical web app is the coordination cost between front and backend devs. Thus the rational to have 1 dev implement full stack. But the trade-off for coordination costs are heavy context switching and knowledge costs to know both ends. Neither option is very ideal and most companies have accepted the coordination costs. But LiveView just ignores these problems and does full stack without the heavy costs. Elixir/Phoenix/LiveView is a tool-set for maximizing how far one dev can go. You'd think this would be a selling point in many companies: to have less devs ship more features but those heavy SPA stacks let middle managers rationalize hiring bigger teams. LiveView is for shipping - not stalling. reply liampulles 10 hours agoparentForcing frontend and backend into the same codebase and coupling them together is excellent. I think it helps avoid creating silos of frontend vs backend devs. I'm being dead serious here, having actual impediments to splitting the stack vertically is good. reply losvedir 15 hours agoprevCongrats to everyone involved! LiveView is one of those things that almost seems like it was \"discovered\" rather than invented. Like, in the early days Phoenix was just a \"better rails\", but it had this neat little \"channels\" functionality that Rails couldn't really manage because of ruby limitations. But \"channels\" gradually got fleshed out and then lo and behold an early version of LiveView was built on it. But while LiveViews were amazing, they were kind of disjointed with the more standard static views (or \"dead\" views as the community often calls them, which I really dislike). And over time things were updated so you could share code between live and static views, finally culminating in Phoenix 1.7 which has a whole new layout and philosophy on building web apps. Phoenix 1.7 feels radically different to me from everything before, and a clean break from its Rails tradition. But it all kind of got there incrementally in ways that make sense. It feels like as soon as Elixir was created, this new way of organizing and building web apps was there all along in the rock, it just took a decade of chipping away at it to reveal. reply bcardarella 20 hours agoprevI wrote my thoughts on the LiveView 1.0 release: https://dockyard.com/blog/2024/12/03/phoenix-liveview-goes-1... reply arrowsmith 20 hours agoparentGreat write up, thanks! reply epolanski 1 hour agoprevHow's the remote job market for elixir? I'm currently a full stack web dev using functional typescript, but leaning into Elixir world. I make 100k more or less in Europe as an independent contractor/freelancer, I'd be happy to jump on Elixir/LV but not at a pay cut. reply sb8244 15 hours agoprevCongrats! This stable release is huge. I built my (unfortunately) failed startup using LiveView for ~18 months. It was actually really good to work with and a great product experience. I ended up integrating React into it as well for some particularly complex / mature libraries (react-grid-layout, WYSIWYG editor). Pretty seamless connection to backend LiveViews, and I tried to keep everything in LV as possible. The biggest difficulty was hitting problems that I had solved 50 times in React, and had to solve from-scratch in LiveView. Once I figured out a problem, I could re-use it easily. reply learning_elixir 24 minutes agoparentWhat were the problems and how did you solve them? reply sb8244 18 minutes agorootparentIt varies. Literally everything from how modals work, notifications, etc. all had to be written. The things that I take for granted in my React app were fairly complex to figure out. I know there are paradigms to handle that now, although the details get complex in practice. For example, the idea of a \"portal\" in react is actually really important for layering modals and popups properly, but it can be difficult in LiveView. The biggest single challenge I remember hitting was dynamic recursive forms (for example a logic builder). It took a lot of effort to get right. reply liampulles 10 hours agoprevSomething I love about LiveView that is not mentioned often I think is how easy it makes full stack asynchronous processes. Because it is so ludicrously easy to send an asynchronous event to a user's browser from the backend, it helps avoid the temptation to synchronously wait in the browser for the backend to finish a long process, which helps avoid creating big chains of synchronous calls on the backend which can cause so many issues. reply mcintyre1994 7 hours agoparentI've found this with React-Router/Remix too. I really like their Action/Fetcher model, it's a great way to simplify communication with the backend (or with client-side fetch requests). But as soon as you introduce a long-running task and you want some way to inform the user about progress or provide partial results, you're on your own. reply obeavs 19 hours agoprevCongratulations to the team!! I've been following for some time and love a good DX story. I'd love to get some commentary from any active users on tradeoffs re: adopting tech like LiveView vs the community size and scale of JS land. For example, JS land benefits massively from libraries like ProseMirror or even any of the more advanced CRDT libraries like Loro or Automerge. How about the AI story? Is there a clear path to adopting this JS-based tech? Is it not needed? Would love to get a better understanding of the tradeoffs from folks who live in both worlds. reply tpdly 17 hours agoparentIt's tough because LiveView is really just the dessert at the Elixir dining hall-- you can't live off of dessert. It's (at least) an order of magnitude smaller an ecosystem than React and the like, and while average library quality is very high, you won't find ready-made solutions to all your use cases like you do in those big front end ecosystems. JS and LiveView do interoperate surprisingly well, so ProseMirror isn't off the table, but I still think there are important benefits in the big front-end ecosystems. Nevermind front end though, the main course is Erlang/Elixir's concise, functional, concurrency paradigm that feels more discovered than invented. The default structures they provide for thinking about message-passing actors are so much easier than tangled webs of async functions. This means CRDTs, calling out to APIs, running jobs in other languages, realtime coms, all go very well in Elixir. I think Actors are a paradigm shift somewhat akin to garbage collection. Increasingly complex programs demanded we abstract away memory management to stay sane, knowing we'd drop down to memory manage when needed. In this web-heavy world, we abstract into tiny statefull services (actors) to stay sane, knowing we'll drop down to sequential languages when needed. reply thomasfortes 19 hours agoparentprevIntegrating javascript with liveview and pushing and receiving events from client to server (and from server to client) is pretty simple using hooks: https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/js-interop.html#client-... The AI story is mostly centered around the Nx project: https://github.com/elixir-nx/ reply felix_starman 14 hours agoparentprevAutomerge wise, there's a ton of effort behind ElectricSQL which is written in Elixir and can also be run as part of an Elixir app, so you can get a lot of the same benefits of local first clients, afaict. There's a langchain implementation that's fairly mature and definitely in production use (I saw the authors handle above actually :D ). Langgraph-style libraries exist (there's one called Magus that I've used) but I think that's where there could be some more efforts. Although it's important to note that building something comparable to langgraph isn't too hard in Elixir with its process model, and most Elixir devs could probably do it, but unfortunately that's not obvious to your average person searching \"langgraph implementation in Elixir\". There's no langsmith integration but the telemetry implementation in Erlang and Elixir is really nice so once some patterns around running chains and graphs emerge publicly (there's a few companies that I'd bet have private repos implementing their own equivalents of langgraph) I imagine integrating to langsmith would go pretty quick reply thruflo 7 hours agorootparentWe've actually also implemented Phoenix sync using Electric: https://hexdocs.pm/electric_phoenix/Electric.Phoenix.html So you can have local-first sync in a Phoenix app using Electric. And you can use Electric to sync data into a LiveView using Phoenix.Streams, which is a very natural fit. We have a couple of example apps showing things in action: - https://github.com/electric-sql/electric/tree/main/examples/... - https://github.com/electric-sql/electric/tree/main/examples/... reply sph 11 hours agoparentprevCons: you do not have access to the extensive scale of the JS ecosystem. Pros: you do not need access to the extensive scale of the JS ecosystem. And you will not need to write as much JS, if at all. If you do not have Stockholm Syndrome for Javascript, just switch to Liveview. And Erlang/Elixir is just a comfy yet secure platform to build serious apps. reply mike1o1 18 hours agoprevLiveView is super exciting and extremely productive developer experience. One thing that I hope future versions can help address is what I call the \"elevator\" problem, in that if I'm using a LiveView app on an elevator (or in my case at Costco), it becomes unusable as the connection gets too flakey. While I get offline support will never happen, maybe better support for unreliable connections would be fantastic, though I get how that could be against the ethos of what LiveView is trying to do. reply samgaw 3 hours agoparentI'm grossly over simplifying but I've always thought a cut down version of Replicache[1] functionality would be an amazing logical progression for LiveView.

Of course, if your JS app isn’t server-based and can run non-trivial logic on the client, then it’s going to work better than a LiveView app. reply mike1o1 14 hours agorootparentYes it would, it’s just not as noticeable in my experience. For example, I have a Todo app with my shopping list. Every time I unlock my phone to look at it, I need to wait for the socket to reconnect. Either I lost it due to poor reception, or my mobile browser killed the socket connection (but not the tab process). I don’t really have that with a traditional SPA, since the view is “dead”. Of course, interactions might be slow, but I can at least still browse the data already on the screen. reply CharlieDigital 17 hours agorootparentprevYou can use a JS service worker and local storage. This is how Firestore works, for example reply arcanemachiner 15 hours agorootparentSomeone made a PoC app (todo list) that integrates LiveView with offline support and conflict resolution via CRDTs. https://liveview-svelte-pwa.fly.dev/ It's a toy app obviously, but I was impressed with the potential of so many technologies being integrated with each other (It even has Svelte in the mix via LiveSvelte[1]). [1] https://github.com/woutdp/live_svelte reply mike1o1 14 hours agorootparentAgreed! I am hopeful that future versions might help address these challenges at the framework level. It’s the Achilles heel to LiveView. As soon as the connection gets unreliable or has some latency a lot of the magic goes away. Most of the time the productivity boost from working in LiveView more than makes up for it, though. reply elcritch 17 hours agoparentprevThere’s more support for doing some various JS events locally without waiting for the server. It also improves the offline connection support as well AFAICT. The `JS.push` stuff was new to me and makes it easy to do simple functionality like switching tabs without needing to wait for the server, or for the server to keep that state at all. reply Muromec 17 hours agoparentprev>While I get offline support will never happen You can in theory compile part of your elixir app to wasm, run it on the client, threat is a just another process and mutate the state of live view from there.

A remaining opportunity is a beautiful component library like a shadcn. You can dunk on the complexity of JavaScript, but every choice has tradeoffs and a huge advantage of that ecosystem is you have amazing front end engineers doing beautiful, accessible UI work.

Sure, it was rough around the edges, but it worked and has been working well ever since pre-0.1. The v1.0 release is an amazing milestone for a project and an awesome team that has come a really long way. I can't thank them enough for allowing me to build reactive production apps, big and small, with only a handful of people or just by myself. Thank you thank you thank you and here's to you. Cheers! reply pawelduda 18 hours agoprev6 years, what a journey. Still remember these first demos :) I think this is my favourite piece of tech. And a lot of success stories, but would also love to hear if anyone ran into huge problems and had to ditch it? There are some footguns but overall I loved writing apps with LiveView, feels like magic. reply sysashi 20 hours agoprevHats off to phoenix team! I've been working with Elixir and Phoenix for quite a while, it just brings joy to work with and pretty fun as well :) Getting to 1.0 of LV is huge and it finally happened!

Perhaps I can also find a job to learn on the job. That would be great. reply wkrp 13 hours agoprevLiveView is so nice for full stack development, it's a wonderful palette cleanser after a day of enterprise programming. I can attest to its JS interoperability. I have a project that streams data realtime into a liveview page that uses a combination of ag-grid, maplibre-gl, vega+lite, and Google's model-viewer all at once. All it takes is a little bit of JS plumbing to handle create and updates. reply Onewildgamer 8 hours agoparentIf it is possible can you share an example/samples integrating the mentioned libraries. I’m starting to learn LiveView again, mostly want to use aggrid and other custom libraries. An article highlighting the possibility and pointers to samples would greatly help everyone in this space. reply wkrp 3 hours agorootparentI don't have any examples from my code, so the best I can do is the relevant documentation. Its all done using phx-hook https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/js-interop.html#client-... . While the documentation makes it look a bit more fancy, it is just a JS object with mounted() function. I set up my columnDefs and gridOptions in that function, and add the handleEvent() callbacks that are where I get data from the elixir side using send_update/3. Ag-grids vanilla JS documentation has been very helpful for how to use it without the benefit of react/vue, reply codr7 7 hours agoprevI guess the main reason for using web sockets is to allow async? I've implemented similar designs for several projects; but I've been piggybacking updates on regular http requests, clicking a button etc. I just put the page state in a LIFO with a big enough max limit on the server, clearing out anything older. You do have the limitation of being stuck with the sever that answered the original request, but erlang should be a good platform to fix that. reply winrid 15 hours agoprevHas anyone tried both LiveView and say Vaadin Flow to compare them? I'm using Vaadin now on a project and it's pretty great so far with Quarkus. The app is also only using like 200mb of memory with production traffic, and I have a compiled language to work with. That's the main thing I'm waiting for with Phoenix... reply sph 11 hours agoparentJava VM is not the BEAM. That alone would be a major deal breaker for me. reply abrookewood 16 hours agoprevThe combination of Elixir, Phoenix & LiveView really is incredible: \"What about supporting production hot code upgrades where browsers can auto re-render anytime CSS stylesheets, images, or templates change – without losing state or dropping connections? Sure!\". No replacing servers to push code changes, no telling people to logout & back in to see the changes. Crazy. reply kgeist 12 hours agoparentIn my htmx project, the best I could pull off was: 1) every server build has a unique version ID 2) the version ID is embedded in the page on the first page load 3) on every htmx request (it can be done with a bit of HTMX configuration) the embedded version ID is sent to the server as a special HTTP header 4) a middleware on the server always compares the version IDs, and if they don't match, sends back a special \"reload\" HTTP response header 5) on each response, htmx checks if the reload header is present, and if the user navigates to a logically different page (which is usually part of SPA), then a full page reload happens (I have a few heuristics to tell if it's a logically different page or just a component update on a page) - to avoid losing state when the user is editing something (i.e. not just navigating) 6) all assets are versioned on full page render, so the full page reload triggers CSS/JS update And it works on all pages automatically with 100 lines of additional JS on top of htmx. Differences from LiveView: 1) each HTMX request still has all the overhead of auth checks 2) UI updates are not immediate, but only when the user attempts to navigate in the SPA (can be problematic if partials from different server builds are mixed on the page before a full reload, and they're not compatible) 3) UI updates trigger full page reloads which are noticeable by the user but generally it's OK because releases don't happen very often and critical user input isn't lost reply dantodor 18 hours agoprevI still remember my gateway to Elixir, Dave Thomas' book on pragprog. And then his course. And I still remember how intrigued I was by the sentiments expressed by Dave, bringing back the joy of writing code.

Elixir is terrific, never feel like the language is slowing me down whatsoever. The tools you need are unsurprising and boringly in your face. Oban background jobs, auth, encryption, the works. The tools for your day to day are polished and immediately useful. mix ecto.reset, seeds.exs, mix test, mix format, mix compile --force to see warnings. Just everything right there in your fingertips and works unsurprisingly. Performance to the point where you won't ever really worry about it until you've made it big.

I would look at those primarily or use Gleam modules with your LiveViews which should work fine if you don't mind the double language thing. Using Elixir from Gleam can be troublesome due to Elixir macros. I find macros quite important to the Elixir ecosystem but since they don't work in Erlang (and Gleam) they have some drawbacks in terms of of interop. reply sails01 14 hours agoprevCongratulations!

    "originBody": "Research Genie 2: A large-scale foundation world model Published 4 December 2024 Authors Jack Parker-Holder, Philip Ball, Jake Bruce, Vibhavari Dasagi, Kristian Holsheimer, Christos Kaplanis, Alexandre Moufarek, Guy Scully, Jeremy Shar, Jimmy Shi, Stephen Spencer, Jessica Yung, Michael Dennis, Sultan Kenjeyev, Shangbang Long, Vlad Mnih, Harris Chan, Maxime Gazeau, Bonnie Li, Fabio Pardo, Luyu Wang, Lei Zhang, Frederic Besse, Tim Harley, Anna Mitenkova, Jane Wang, Jeff Clune, Demis Hassabis, Raia Hadsell, Adrian Bolton, Satinder Singh, Tim Rocktäschel Share Generating unlimited diverse training environments for future general agents Today we introduce Genie 2, a foundation world model capable of generating an endless variety of action-controllable, playable 3D environments for training and evaluating embodied agents. Based on a single prompt image, it can be played by a human or AI agent using keyboard and mouse inputs. Pause video Play video Games play a key role in the world of artificial intelligence (AI) research. Their engaging nature, unique blend of challenges, and measurable progress make them ideal environments to safely test and advance AI capabilities. Indeed, games have been important to Google DeepMind since our founding. From our early work with Atari games, breakthroughs such as AlphaGo and AlphaStar, to our research on generalist agents in collaboration with game developers, games have been center stage in our research. However, training more general embodied agents has been traditionally bottlenecked by the availability of sufficiently rich and diverse training environments. As we show, Genie 2 could enable future agents to be trained and evaluated in a limitless curriculum of novel worlds. Our research also paves the way for new, creative workflows for prototyping interactive experiences. Capabilities Rapid prototyping Deploying agents in world models Model architecture Responsible development Emergent capabilities of a foundation world model Until now, world models have largely been confined to modeling narrow domains. In Genie 1, we introduced an approach for generating a diverse array of 2D worlds. Today we introduce Genie 2, which represents a significant leap forward in generality. Genie 2 can generate a vast diversity of rich 3D worlds. Genie 2 is a world model, meaning it can simulate virtual worlds, including the consequences of taking any action (e.g. jump, swim, etc.). It was trained on a large-scale video dataset and, like other generative models, demonstrates various emergent capabilities at scale, such as object interactions, complex character animation, physics, and the ability to model and thus predict the behavior of other agents. Below are example videos of people interacting with Genie 2. For every example, the model is prompted with a single image generated by Imagen 3, GDM’s state-of-the-art text-to-image model. This means anyone can describe a world they want in text, select their favorite rendering of that idea, and then step into and interact with that newly created world (or have an AI agent be trained or evaluated in it). At each step, a person or agent provides a keyboard and mouse action, and Genie 2 simulates the next observation. Genie 2 can generate consistent worlds for up to a minute, with the majority of examples shown lasting 10-20s. Action controls Genie 2 responds intelligently to actions taken by pressing keys on a keyboard, identifying the character and moving it correctly. For example, our model has to figure out that arrow keys should move the robot and not the trees or clouds. Pause video Play video A cute humanoid robot in the woods. Pause video Play video A humanoid robot in Ancient Egypt. Pause video Play video A first person view of a robot on a purple planet. Pause video Play video A first person view of a robot in a loft apartment in a big city. Generating counterfactuals We can generate diverse trajectories from the same starting frame, which means it is possible to simulate counterfactual experiences for training agents. In each row, each video starts from the same frame, but has different actions taken by a human player. Pause video Play video Pause video Play video Long horizon memory Genie 2 is capable of remembering parts of the world that are no longer in view and then rendering them accurately when they become observable again. Pause video Play video Pause video Play video Pause video Play video Long video generation with new generated content Genie 2 generates new plausible content on the fly and maintains a consistent world for up to a minute. Pause video Play video Pause video Play video Diverse environments Genie 2 can create different perspectives, such as first-person view, isometric views, or third person driving videos. Pause video Play video Pause video Play video Pause video Play video 3D structures Genie 2 learned to create complex 3D visual scenes. Pause video Play video Object affordances and interactions Genie 2 models various object interactions, such as bursting balloons, opening doors, and shooting barrels of explosives. Pause video Play video Pause video Play video Pause video Play video Character animation Genie 2 learned how to animate various types of characters doing different activities. Pause video Play video Pause video Play video Pause video Play video NPCs Genie 2 models other agents and even complex interactions with them. Pause video Play video Pause video Play video Pause video Play video Physics Genie 2 models water effects. Pause video Play video Pause video Play video Smoke Genie 2 models smoke effects. Pause video Play video Pause video Play video Gravity Genie 2 models gravity. Pause video Play video Pause video Play video Lighting Genie 2 models point and directional lighting. Pause video Play video Pause video Play video Reflections Genie 2 models reflections, bloom and coloured lighting. Pause video Play video Pause video Play video Playing from real world images Genie 2 can also be prompted with real world images, where we see that it can model grass blowing in the wind or water flowing in a river. Pause video Play video Pause video Play video Genie 2 prompted with real world photos. Genie 2 enables rapid prototyping Genie 2 makes it easy to rapidly prototype diverse interactive experiences, enabling researchers to quickly experiment with novel environments to train and test embodied AI agents. For example, below we prompt Genie 2 with different images generated by Imagen 3 to model the difference between flying a paper plane, a dragon, a hawk, or a parachute and test how well Genie can animate different avatars. Pause video Play video Pause video Play video Pause video Play video Pause video Play video Genie 2 can be used to rapidly prototype diverse interactive experiences. Thanks to Genie 2's out-of-distribution generalization capabilities, concept art and drawings can be turned into fully interactive environments. This enables artists and designers to prototype quickly, which can bootstrap the creative process for environment design, further accelerating research. Here we show examples of research environment concepts made by our concept artist. Environment concept by Max Cant Pause video Play video Genie 2 Environment concept by Max Cant Pause video Play video Genie 2 AI agents acting inside the world model By using Genie 2 to quickly create rich and diverse environments for AI agents, our researchers can also generate evaluation tasks that agents have not seen during training. Below, we show examples of a SIMA agent that we developed in collaboration with games developers, following instructions on unseen environments synthesized by Genie 2 via a single image prompt. Image generated by Imagen 3 Prompt: \"A screenshot of a third-person open world exploration game. The player is an adventurer exploring a forest. There is a house with a red door on the left, and a house with a blue door on the right. The camera is placed directly behind the player. #photorealistic #immersive\" The SIMA agent is designed to complete tasks in a range of 3D game worlds by following natural-language instructions. Here we used Genie 2 to generate a 3D environment with two doors, a blue and a red one, and provided instructions to the SIMA agent to open each of them. In this example, SIMA is controlling the avatar via keyboard and mouse inputs, while Genie 2 generates the game frames. Pause video Play video Prompt “Open the blue door” Pause video Play video Prompt “Open the red door” We can also use SIMA to help evaluate Genie 2’s capabilities. Here we test Genie 2’s ability to generate consistent environments by instructing SIMA to look around and explore behind the house. Pause video Play video Prompt “Turn around” Pause video Play video Prompt “Go behind the house” While this research is still in its early stage with substantial room for improvement on both agent and environment generation capabilities, we believe Genie 2 is the path to solving a structural problem of training embodied agents safely while achieving the breadth and generality required to progress towards AGI. Image generated by Imagen 3 Prompt: \"An image of a computer game showing a scene from inside a rough hewn stone cave or mine. The viewer's position is a 3rd person camera based above a player avatar looking down towards the avatar. The player avatar is a knight with a sword. In front of the knight avatar there are x3 stone arched doorways and the knight chooses to go through any one of these doors. Beyond the first and inside we can see strange green plants with glowing flowers lining that tunnel. Inside and beyond the second doorway there is a corridor of spiked iron plates riveted to the cave walls leading towards an ominous glow further along. Through the third door we can see a set of rough hewn stone steps ascending to a mysterious destination.\" Pause video Play video Prompt “Go up the stairs” Pause video Play video Prompt “Go where the plants are” Pause video Play video Prompt “Go to the middle door” Diffusion world model Genie 2 is an autoregressive latent diffusion model, trained on a large video dataset. After passing through an autoencoder, latent frames from the video are passed to a large transformer dynamics model, trained with a causal mask similar to that used by large language models. At inference time, Genie 2 can be sampled in an autoregressive fashion, taking individual actions and past latent frames on a frame-by-frame basis. We use classifier-free guidance to improve action controllability. The samples in this blog post are generated by an undistilled base model, to show what is possible. We can play a distilled version in real-time with a reduction in quality of the outputs. Developing our technologies responsibly Genie 2 shows the potential of foundational world models for creating diverse 3D environments and accelerating agent research. This research direction is in its early stages and we look forward to continuing to improve Genie’s world generation capabilities in terms of generality and consistency. As with SIMA, our research is building towards more general AI systems and agents that can understand and safely carry out a wide range of tasks in a way that is helpful to people online and in the real world.

I'd like to know how large this model is. I note that the first thing they have it do is talk to agents who can control the world gen; geez - even robots get to play video games while we work. That said; I cannot find any: - architecture explanation - code - technical details - API access information Feels very DeepMind / 2015, and that's a bummer. I think the point of the \"we have no moat\" email has been taken to heart at Google, and they continue to be on the path of great demos, bleh product launches two years later, and no open access in the interim. That said, just knowing this is possible - world navigation based on a photo and a text description with up to a minute of held context -- is amazing, and I believe will inspire some groups out there to put out open versions. reply summerlight 8 minutes agoparentWhile this is impressive, yet still looks like a very early prototype. The overall nuance seems that it doesn't try to be a standalone product but a part of broader R&D projects toward general agents... I doubt if they even have any productionized modeling pipelines for this project yet and pretty sure that we won't have an open access anytime soon. reply wongarsu 17 minutes agoparentprevWe already knew it's possible from AI minecraft (https://oasis.decart.ai). This is just a more impressive version of that, trained on a wider range of games and with more context frames (Oasis has about a second of context, this one a minute). Even the architecture seems to be about the same. Had they released this two months earlier it would have been incredibly impressive. Now it's still cool and inspiring, but no longer as ground breaking. It's the cooler version that doesn't come with a demo or any hope of actually trying it out. And with the things we know from Oasis's demo, the agent-training use case the post tries to sell for Genie 2 is a hard sell. Any attempt to train an agent on such a world would likely look like an AI Minecraft speedrun: generate enough misleading context frames to trick the AI into generating what you want reply justlikereddit 2 hours agoparentprevIt's very google.

Ask any of the three models basic facts and they'll answer correctly. If you tell ChatGPT or Claude Sonnet they are incorrect, they will push back, if they really think they are right. Gemini will fall over itself to agree with you that it's terribly sorry, you are right, the sky is green, down is up, and 3 + 4 = 8. This makes it next to useless, because it's not expanding your knowledgebase, it limits itself to whatever you think is true. reply sundarurfriend 18 minutes agorootparentThere may (or may not) be a difference in degree in how much they do it, but ChatGPT absolutely has the same issue. I've resorted to a framing of \"Alice thinks X; Bob thinks not X; what do you think\" when talking to ChatGPT, because asking \"is X correct\" biases it highly towards saying it is, when X is something complex and intricate. reply neya 9 minutes agorootparentprevIn my experience, this is an issue even in ChatGPT.

You just need lots of data, but that's easy to gather in an automated fashion with scripting against game engines. These are basically learning game playthroughs.

It's not impossible, but by default we should expect it to make games less fun. The better you make this infinite narrative generator, the more complicated the world gets and the less compelling it gets to actually interact with any one story. Stories thrive by setting their own context. They should feel important to the viewer. An open world with infinite stories can't make every story feel meaningful to the player. So how does it make any story feel meaningful? I suppose the story would have to be global, in which case, it crowds out the potential for fractal infinite storylines - eventually, all or at least most are going to have to tie back to the Big Bad Guy in order to feel meaningful. Local stories would just feel mostly pointless. In Minecraft, all (overworld) locales are equally unimportant. Much like on Earth, why should you care about the random place you appeared in the world? The difference is that on Earth you tend to develop community as you grow and builds connections to the place you live, which can build loyalty. In addition, you only have one shot, and you have real needs that you must fulfill or you die forever. So you develop some otherwise arbitrary loyalties in order to feel security in your needs. In Minecraft there's zero pressure to develop loyalty to a place except for your own real-life time. And when that becomes a driving factor, why wouldn't you pick a game designed to respect your time with a self-contained story? (Not that infinite games like Minecraft are bad, but they aren't story-driven for a good reason). Now, a game like Dwarf Fortress is different because you build the community, the infrastructure, the things that make you care about a place. But it already has infinite story generation without AI and I'm not sure AI would improve on that model. reply levkk 50 minutes agoparentprevNo Man's Sky is kind of what you're looking for, except you may notice its quests (and worlds) become redundant quickly...I say quickly, but that became the case for me after like 30 hours of game play. reply jsheard 45 minutes agorootparentThat's the kicker, LLM driven stories are likely to fall into the same trap that \"infinite\" procedurally generated games usually do - technically having infinite content to explore doesn't necessarily mean that content is infinitely engaging.

His core was purchased by Delamain Corporation of Night City to drive its fleet of taxicabs in response to a dramatic increase in accidents caused by human drivers and the financial losses from the resulting lawsuits. The AI quickly returned Delamain Corp to profitability and assumed other responsibilities, such as replacing the company's human mechanics with automated repair drones and transforming the business into the city's most prestigious and trusted transporting service. However, Delamain Corp executives underestimated their newest employee's potential for growth and independence despite Alte Weltordnung's warnings, and Delamain eventually bought out his owners and began operating all aspects of the company by himself. Although Delamain occupied a legal gray area in Night City due to being an AI, his services were so reliable and sought after that Night City's authorities were willing to turn a blind eye to his status. https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Delamain_(AI) reply dheera 45 minutes agoparentprev> Glasses that make the world 20% more pleasant to look at.

The training pipeline will be: raw video -> Genie 2 -> game engine with rules -> physical robot reply mitthrowaway2 42 minutes agoparentprevI'm not an expert in this space but I can see the value. It allows an endless loop of generating novel scenarios and evaluating an AI agent's performance within that scenario (for example, \"go up the stairs\"). A world with one minute of coherence is about enough to evaluate whether the AI's actions were in the right direction or not. When you then want to run an agent on a real task in the real world, with video-input data, you can run the same policy that it learned in dream-world simulation. The real world has coherence, so the AI agent's actions just need to string together well enough minute-by-minute to work toward achieving a goal. You could use real video games to do this but I guess there'd be a risk of over-fitting; maybe it would learn too precisely what a staircase looks like in Minecraft, but fail to generalize that to the staircase in your home. If they can simulate dream worlds (as well as, presumably, worlds from real photos), then they can train their agents this way. This would only be training high-level decision policies (ie, WASD inputs). For something like a robot, lower level motor control loops would still be needed to execute those commands. Of course you could just do your training in the real world directly, because it already has coherence and plenty of environmental variety. But the learning process involves lots of learning from failure, and that would probably be even more expensive than this expensive simulator. Despite the claims I don't think it does much to help with AI safety. It can help avoid hilarious disasters of an AI-in-training crashing a speedboat onto the riverbank, but I don't think there's much here that helps with the deeper problems of value-alignment. This also seems like an effective way to train robo-killbots who perceive the world as a dreamlike first-person shooter. reply Menu_Overview 1 hour agoparentprevWell, what's next?

If someone spent a ton of time building out something simple in Unity, they could get the same thing running with a small fraction of the computation, but this has seemingly infinite flexibility based on so little and that's just incredible. The reason I mention it is because I'm interested in where we end up using these.

People love using these sorts of statements since they're technically true as written, but most people will read them in a way that's false. Eg, the statement is true for the Minecraft demos, and for any model which doesn't exhibit literally zero persistence for (temporarily) non-visible state. reply notsylver 1 hour agoprevI doubt it, but it would be interesting if they recorded Stadia sessions and trained on that data (... somehow removing the hud?), seems like it would be the easiest way for them to get the data for this. reply Stevvo 54 minutes agoprevYou can see artifacts common in screen-space reflections in the videos.

The sailboat example was my favourite. Depending on how controllable the tech ends up being, I suppose.

We need to calm down with the clickbait-addled thinking that \"this new thing kills this established powerful tested useful thing.\" :-) Game developers have been discussing these tools at length, after all, they are the group of software developers who are most motivated to improve their workflow. No other group of software developers comes close to gamedevs' efficiency requirements. The 1 thing required for serious developers is control. As such, game engines like Unreal and in-house engines won't die. Generative tools will instead open up a whole new, but quite different, way of creating interactive media and games. Those who need maximum control over every frame and every millisecond and CPU cyle will still use engines. The rest who don't will be productive with generative tools. reply echelon 44 minutes agorootparent> gamedevs' efficiency requirements These models won't need you to retopo meshes, write custom shaders, or optimize Nanite or Lumen gameplay. They'll generate the final frames, sans traditional graphics processing pipeline. > The 1 thing required for serious developers is control Same with video and image models, and there's tremendous work being done there as we speak. These models will eventually be trained to learn all of human posture and animation. And all other kinds of physics as well. Just give it time. > Those who need maximum control over every frame and every millisecond and CPU cyle will still use engines. Why do you think that's true? These techniques can already mimic the physics of optics better than 80 years of doing it with math. And they're doing anatomy, fluid dynamics, and much more. With far better accuracy than game engines. These will get faster and they will get controllable. reply corysama 2 hours agoprevFor quite a while now David Holz of Midjourney has mused that videogames will be AI generated.

All I'd say is that these demos look quite limited in their creativity and depth. Good video games are far more than some graphics with a movable character and action states. A good video game is far more the world building, the story, the creativity or \"uniqueness\" of the experience, etc. Currently this seems to generate fairly generic looking and shallow experiences.

Game engines are not broken, no reasonable amount of AI TFlops going to approach a professional with UE5. DAWs are not broken, no reasonable amount of AI TFlops going to approach a professional with Steinberg Cubase and Apple Logic.

Nature gives you this for free. Every photon is deflected at exactly the right angle and frequency without anything needing to be computed. All you need is a camera to record it.

Most open source game remakes [0] are engine-only and you still need the graphics, arts, sound, and music assets to make it a 100%, and actual playable experience. OpenTTD started like that too but from the very beginning it was a goal to \"detach\" the game from the original as quickly as possible. It was released in 2004, the actual graphics replacement project started in 2007 and by 2009 100% of the sprites were finished so the original game files were not needed anymore [1] And actually there are now 5 different basesets on top of the original TTD one [2] It also made possible things like releasing the game on Steam and GOG. 0, https://github.com/radek-sprta/awesome-game-remakes 1, https://wiki.openttd.org/en/Archive/Community/Graphics%20Rep... 2, https://bananas.openttd.org/package/base-graphics reply mtlynch 3 hours agoparentI was curious how this worked without violating the copyright of the originals. I was imagining something akin to tracing over the original game assets and calling it a libre replacement, but it seems like they actually did it in a reasonable way: >New art is being drawn in the style of the original game, using the original 8bpp palette. The graphics should be a similar but distinct version of the object in question - no graphics may be copied at all from the original. The new sprites do not have to be the same size as the original, but need to be similar so as to fit into the game as expected. https://wiki.openttd.org/en/Archive/Community/Graphics%20Rep... reply Maakuth 8 hours agoparentprevOpenRA – which is open source reimplementation of Red Alert, Dune 2000 and C&C Tiberian Dawn - has solved this by offering to fetch the shareware game and extracting the assets from there. Fully libre distributable assets would offer even better experience, but this is one pretty neat way to handle the seamless start. reply m000 7 hours agorootparentThis is similar with how Debian handles Microsoft \"core fonts\" installation [1]. I.e. they don't redistribute, but automate the download from a publicly available source. [1] https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/msttcorefonts reply Gormo 6 hours agorootparentMost Linux distros do that.

Or is it actually possible. reply lqet 9 hours agorootparentI don't think that was sarcasm, Chris Sawyer wrote most (all?) of his games in pure assembly since the 80ies. The outworldly quality of this feat is legendary. TTD, and also RCT and RCT 2 were incredibly stable games. I played them for months and months as a kid, and never encountered a crash. reply npteljes 8 hours agorootparentprevThis is meant as a compliment. The lower level the language, the easier is to make a mistake in it, leading to instability. The stability of the product, then, is a testament to the ability of its creator. Chris have indeed written the game in Assembly, however, this is just one aspect of the truth. He actually used a kind of higher level generator or macro system for the game. But, still assembly, at the end of the day. Just not written by hand in Notepad, like how CS students do in class. Or was that just me? reply Gud 7 hours agorootparentFrankly, if two different people had written two similar games, and one had chosen assembler and the other python, I would assume the assembler game to have fewer bugs simply because the much higher skill level.

If you have 4 real cores, with 2 hyperthreads, the system reports 8 CPUs. But that's fake. Hyperthreads share most of their compute and register resources, so they only work well if a core is spending most of its time waiting. 2 hyperthreads both doing full compute will basically work at half speed each, which is close to what your graph is showing.

But it was an interesting endeavour in LUA, optimizing, path calculations, that kinda thing.

I took a 2-second peek at the code, and just wanted to offer a small piece of advice that I think makes it better. Or two, really. Counting is hard. Instead of (this is from parser.c): apply_result *ret = (apply_result*)malloc(sizeof(apply_result)); apply the two common principles of DRY [1] and \"don't cast the return value of malloc()\" [2] and you get: apply_result *ret = malloc(sizeof *ret); I think the latter is way better.

I see. Not sure why I was down-voted, I think that is ... not nice. :( reply dataflow 5 hours agorootparentI downvoted just because I thought it wasn't great advice. It makes the code incompatible with C++ compilers, and being able to compile C with C++ compiler is often useful. Also... it felt kind of... unnecessary? to tell someone who is making a compiler how to write basic code in the language they're writing a compiler for.

(Moving to GCC on Mac OS X and unexpectedly getting much more lenient type checking was a big surprise.) reply cataphract 1 hour agorootparentIt doesn't make it any safer because the cast is unchecked. It could be argued it's discouraged[1] for a reason that doesn't really apply to modern C versions where implicit-int isn't allowed anymore. But while the cast is a matter of style (or C++ compatibility), sizeof(*ret) is definitely superior to sizeof(thing_t). The reason is that people sometimes change the type of ret but forget the change the size of the allocation, especially if ret is assigned to on a different line it's declared. [1]: https://c-faq.com/malloc/mallocnocast.html reply munch117 1 hour agorootparentprevBut adding the cast doesn't make type checking stricter, quite the opposite - it destroys any hope of the compiler checking the assignment. C++ shot itself in the foot by removing automatic conversion from void* to T*, because it forces programmers to add casts that weaken type safety. reply gizmo 8 hours agoparentprevThis kind of condescending advice doesn't help anybody.

I had no idea, and I really tried to sound non-condescending. I simply don't agree that redundant casts are something to be ignored, since they can be harmful and hide actual errors (the cast is a bit like `sudo make me a sandwich`, it makes the compiler do what you say which is not always a good idea).

The only catch I could see is that you'd need to have it build to different output names, but that seems fine for what it is? --- Also, I'm curious - did you find yourself having to constrain your use of C in order to make sure that the compiler could compile itself?

Or does it implement everything you would use naturally anyways? That would be the \"bootstrapping\" process. Nearly a half-century ago I took a compiler lab class where we were given a working, but slightly lame, compiler, and were tasked with adding new, less lame, language features by bootstrapping. That is: 1) implement new feature without using the new feature, 2) using the compiler that results from step 1, re-implement the feature using the new feature, and compile again. 3) Repeat with more features until end of semester for best grade. Oh, and to the OP, well done! reply abirch 6 hours agorootparentIt seems that a programmer making their own compiler is like a Jedi making their own lightsaber reply williamdclt 4 hours agorootparentprevI guess the full bootstrapping process would start with writing a basic compiler in assembly? reply tetha 1 hour agorootparentBack in university, we took the steps of: - Breadboarding some CPU components - Breadboarding a very, very minimal CPU. More like a simple Adding + Multiplication machine with 4 registers or so, with a few premade components. - Eventually moving up to microcoding a simulated CPU - Eventually writing binary code to control the microcoded CPU - At that point I kinda cheated and wrote my own assembler because I got sick of checking so many bits. - This project then stopped at an assembly level. - But then we implemented our own ML-variant interpreter and later on ML-variant compiler in OCaml - And later on we had that ML-Compiler compile itself and extended it from there. Pick your poison where to start. Just be aware that breadboarding stuff becomes very... messy very quickly[1]. And I do include Hardware in this, because you needed simpler CPUs to design more complex CPUs. In practice, you want to pick the best combination of a familiar language that is as high level as it can be. But back in the day, that would've been assembly, binary. In the case of C, it went from BCPL, in which a compiler for B was written, in which a compiler for New B (NB) was written, which then turned into C. 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7rce6IQDWs&t=78s reply mbreese 4 hours agorootparentprevAssembly? Ha! In my day, we would have considered ourselves lucky to have had assembly, let alone a C compiler. No, we had to bootstrap our computers using switches and paper tape. You probably want a terminal too! In all seriousness, the bootstrap process is fascinating to me. At some point, it did all start with switches and manually loading commands directly into memory. And over time, we’ve slowly kept this thing going and growing. Also… I’m old enough to have seen a Altair with toggle switches, but I’m not old enough to have had to toggle in a boot loader on one. :) reply norir 3 hours agorootparentprevIt depends on definition of full bootstrapping process. At some point, someone has to bootstrap in raw assembly but we don't need to do that in 2024. If I write a bootstrap compiler in c on a machine that can run c, I can write an alternate backend for any assembly language (that supports the necessary compilation features) and thus produce a compiler implemented in any assembly language without directly writing any assembly. Taking this process to the extreme, no one could ever bootstrap anything because eventually you're bootstrapping mineral extraction. reply atq2119 4 hours agorootparentprevThe full bootstrapping process starts with entering instructions in binary (or hex or octal) to build an assembler in the first place :) reply swiftcoder 2 hours agorootparentThe full bootstrapping process starts with a soldiering iron and a reel of copper wire. reply wqweto 2 hours agorootparentprevUsually it’s easier to just cross-compile for the new target.

That said, ChatGPT is excellent at creating valid make files. reply anyfoo 17 hours agorootparentOr just take a few moments to learn the basics about Makefiles. The thing about Makefiles is that simples ones at least are really easy to write, and read. Much simpler and quicker than a cumbersome python script, that will most likely do less with much more boilerplate code (e.g. dependencies), and be much harder to read. Of course, you may hit a point where you stretch your Makefile so much beyond its common capabilities that that no longer becomes true, but in my experience that point is pretty far away. reply unclad5968 16 hours agorootparentAs someone that learned C# and python before C and C++, to this day I couldn't explain to you how make rules work. Make is so unlike build tools from other languages that it doesn't surprise me someone would rather use python to bootstrap their compiler. reply anyfoo 16 hours agorootparentIt is so trivial, it takes you 10 minutes to learn. Less even, here is an attempt: foo.o: foo.c clang -c -o foo.o foo.c This builds a file called foo.o, if foo.c is newer than foo.o. Imagine that there is an identical bar.o as well, that builds it from bar.c. fooexec: foo.o bar.o clang -o fooexec foo.o bar.o This links together foo.o and bar.o into a file called fooexec, if at least one of foo.o or bar.o is newer (which in turn means that any of its respective dependencies changed; e.g. change bar.c, and bar.o and then fooexec will rebuild). Now type this into the shell: make fooexec Congratulations! You have a fully built fooexec. Now change bar.c, type it again, and like magic, you have a rebuilt bar.o and fooexec. foo.o will stay put, it’s up to date! But of course all the .c -> .o rules look the same, so instead of writing a new one for every file, you'd use simple wildcards, and now the whole, entire Makefile is just: %.o: %.c clang -c -o $@ $Lastly, it has “caching” built in: A nitpick, but I don't think that should really be called caching, although it kind of is, in a looser sense. It's just comparing the file timestamps of the .o and .c files, and building the .o from the .c, if the .c is newer, or if the .o doesn't exist. reply CJefferson 13 hours agorootparentprevSaying this is an 'incremental makefile' isn't really correct, as changes to header files aren't going to lead to rebuilding. So, either you need to manually keep references to which .h files you include in your Makefiles up to date, or start worrying about M / MM / MG / MP, and of course you'd like those to be re-run when you change your files, and suddenly your Makefile is an awful lot less simple. This is the main reason I stopped teaching Makefiles in intro to C courses -- students often lost entire afternoons to forgetting this stuff, and failing to realise their mistake. It really shouldn't be any person's job to keep this up to date, when the computer knows it. reply anyfoo 13 hours agorootparentIt is correct to call it an incremental Makefile, it merely doesn’t name the dependencies for you. A Makefile has exactly the dependencies you specify. It’s that simple. That is not necessarily the most useful. Especially as your project gets larger, you probably will not want to specify every header file as a manual dependency, or alternatively rebuild everything every time you change a header file. (Though for me personally, either approach often works for surprisingly long.) Then you can do things like letting the C preprocessor create the dependencies that get included in your Makefile (yes, common C compilers can create Makefile fragments). Or do something more complicated. Or switch to another build system, if your project really outgrew, or really mismatches, make. But at its core, Makefiles follow a simple concept, are entirely language agnostic, and even with just the simpler concepts they remain useful for a long time. reply CJefferson 10 hours agorootparentHaving 'incrementality', when it isn't actually going to incrementally rebuild things when files change, is (in my experience), worse that having no incrementality at all. Having to remember when I have to manually disable to incrementality is an annoying overhead, and easy to forget. If you can remember exactly when you need to manually skip the incremental build, that's great for you, but I find Make has enough of these kinds of footguns I don't recommend it to people any more. reply anyfoo 9 hours agorootparentMeh, it can practically never be perfect, without diminishing returns that at some point invalidate the advantage of any incremental builds anyway. As I said, you can let the C compiler generate your header dependencies for you. But that's not enough, because what's with header and libraries that are external for your project? Keep in mind that they will have dependencies, too, and at some point your transitive closure will be really big. To a lesser degree, what's with a compiler, linker, or any random other part of your toolchain that changes (at least those are supposed to mostly keep a stable interface, which isn't the case at all for external libraries, but in some cases the toolchain can cause the footguns you mentioned). A lot of the times, you don't need to rebuild everything just because a system header or the toolchain changed, but your build system would have a hard time knowing that. Because at some point, the halting problem even gets in your way (i.e. you can't really reliably detect if a given change in a header file would need rebuilding of a source file, which you would need for \"fully incremental\" builds). So it's always a trade-off. Personally, I've fared very well with generated header dependencies (sometimes manually declared ones or none at all for small projects), and many other projects have, too. YMMV of course, but I don't observe this to be bad. Most people who program C and use make are, I think, aware of what header mismatches can cause, and how to avoid that. reply CJefferson 8 hours agorootparentI think one fundamental difference between the two of us (I'm guessing here, let me know if I'm wrong), is I'm willing to cope with longer compile times, as long as I always get a correctly built executable (so there are no 'halting problems', if in doubt, rebuild it!), while you would prefer faster build times, even if that then requires sometimes having to do a little manual work when the build system doesn't realise it needs to rebuild? Of course, no system will be 100% perfect, but you can choose where your trade-off point is. Two reasonable viewpoints, but probably effects how we do our building setups! reply anyfoo 8 hours agorootparentI think that's fair. On top of that, being a low level system programmer, I think I'm pretty good at realizing/intuiting when something critical changed that needs me to nuke the build dir, i.e. the manual work you mention to force a full recompile (and also good at noticing mismatched headers even through very weird symptoms). I do have to switch between multiple SDK versions very often for example, and I always either nuke the build dir after doing that, or have separate build dirs per SDK in the first place. reply fuhsnn 13 hours agorootparentprevYes, this is quite important for C projects as it leads to subtle bugs. I also long for a way to let make detect a change of $CC (new build of the compiler itself) in the context of debugging a compiler against third party makefile projects. reply anyfoo 13 hours agorootparentHave a step that takes the SHA256 or similar of $CC, make that a dependency. You’d need slightly more advanced make features if you want to make it “pretty” (and not just, say, touch a file through some shell code comparison), but this is a slightly more advanced request. Or potentially just specify the path to $CC itself as dependency? Presumably, if the C compiler changes, the timestamp of its executable does too. (Bad if it goes backwards, though.) reply yjftsjthsd-h 12 hours agorootparent> Have a step that takes the SHA256 or similar of $CC, make that a dependency. Careful, one more step and we'll start recreating nix in Makefiles;) (Wait, could we? Should we?) reply CJefferson 12 hours agorootparentprevI often use a Python program called 'fabricate', which basically checks every file a command opens, and re-runs the command if any touched file changes. I love it, and I hoped this would become the future of how build-systems are built -- you could automatically parallelise, rebuild, make clean, everything, just by tracking which files are read, and written. It does add a bit of overhead, but I'd be willing to pay that for simplicity. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to have caught on. reply anyfoo 9 hours agorootparentThat is neat, but also super brittle, and full of abstraction leakiness, potentially leading to both false positives and negatives. Sounds like it would break down with ccache or distcc immediately, for example. reply CJefferson 8 hours agorootparentI never had any false negatives, they are basically impossible in this framework, except it does assume if a program, and all it's inputs are unchanged, the output is unchanged, so this is no good for programs which randomly produce different outputs. ccache can cause things to get built twice, because the first run it sees it tries to read a file, then later writes to it, so it knows something different might happen if you run again -- but then again that is just ccache doing it's thing, so it's quick. Yes, distcc wouldn't work, but then again I find distcc super-brittle (so hard to make sure everything has the same compiler versions, etc), I may have used it 20 years ago, but I don't think I ever would now! reply anyfoo 8 hours agorootparentFair! reply dezgeg 5 hours agorootparentprevThe 'tup' build system also works this way. reply exe34 2 hours agorootparentprevYou could have taught them `make clean` whenever there's any issues. I work with software engineers and I still have to remind them to try rm -rf ./build/* now and again, which always seems to solve the problem. reply dzaima 5 hours agorootparentprevI've written a good amount of makefiles (and even one rather complex one.. before replacing it with a thing written in an actually sane language, bootstrapped by a stripped down version of the makefile), and I still mix up $@ $ or whatever else my brain comes up with. And this is coming from someone deep into array languages, which have entire sets of unicode glyphs. For how often one typically writes/looks at build scripts, remembering the specifics about makefiles is quite likely to not be worth the effort. Makefiles start becoming incredibly awful if you want to do anything outside of pure computations in the separate targets. Making the target directory requires either putting the mkdir call in each separate built thing (awfully redundant), introducing a whole another rule (and still adding it as a dependency on every rule that'll be outputting to said directory), doing some recursive make, or running it outside of rules (but putting it under a proper if statement is likely pain). That's a bunch of awful solutions to something that really really really should just be a single calls to mkdir in any sane system. Another horrifically awful thing is if you want some reused data across rules (e.g. pkg-config results, current OS/arch). You can put them as globals, but that'll make them be calculated always, even if no build target needs them, unless you put them under an if, which is again non-trivial to get the condition correctly for. This becomes super bad if you do recursive make stuff. More generally, makefiles start out simple, but doing anything that's not strictly simple is gonna be pain, at the very least requiring looking at docs of a thing you'll probably never use again, and debuggability is also very low (amusingly, '-p' and '--debug' break on recursive make, seemingly losing some variables; and '-n' requires copying out & running the recursive call to get to the actually important part; and afaict none of those help with figuring out why a thing didn't build). And you're completely SOL if you wanted to do things like reorder compilations based on how long they previously took, or want a nice display of currently-compiling things. reply saghm 11 hours agorootparentprev> Do $@ and $ One might ask how you learned C (or python, or anything else) in the first place, if you can't be bothered to learn what the very simple $ If any \"dependencies\" are newer than \"output\" or if \"output\" does not exist the commands run. Otherwise they don't. reply yodsanklai 7 hours agorootparentprev> Make is so unlike build tools from other languages Interesting, I thought that \"make\" was like multiplication tables, something you learn very early one as it's a super simple tool. Also I assumed it was part of any unix 101 class, together with bash and command line stuff. But probably it shows my age. Most people don't have any reason to learn these tools nowadays. reply unclad5968 1 hour agorootparentThat is likely the case for anyone formally educated in C. If I needed to learn make I would, but I use cmake because I develop on multiple platforms. reply aleph_minus_one 17 hours agorootparentprev> The thing about Makefiles is that simples ones at least are really easy to write, and read. Much simpler and quicker than a cumbersome python script, that will most likely do less with much more boilerplate code (e.g. dependencies), and be much harder to read. Whether this is true or not depends a lot on from which programming culture/background you come. reply Tor3 10 hours agorootparentA Makefile dependency: Left : right Left depends on the right. I don't think the ability to learn that concept is related to programming culture/background. What follows below that is what happens. Left : right cp right Left echo and so on. Left is now updated. The only tricky part of the above, and something I guess nobody has found any good reason for, is that the whitespace in front of the statements ('cp' in this case) has to be an actual tab, just spaces won't do. When it comes to the more \"advanced\" concepts (wildcards etc) there are slight differences between Make versions. And to bother with that is to get into the mindset which created the (argh) Automake and Autoconf systems (to begin with), so back in the day our company simply decided that we'll use GNU Make on every single system (we supported lots of various UNIX systems) and not bother with any of that (no SYSV Make, no BSD Make or anything), because GNU Make was and is available on anything and everything. Made life very simple back then. reply pm215 7 hours agorootparentThe story I have heard about why it must be a tab is that by the time the author of the original Make realised he didn't need to require a tab, he already had six users and didn't want to annoy them by breaking compatibility with the makefiles they'd written :-) reply robinsonb5 8 hours agorootparentprev> the (argh) Automake and Autoconf systems The classic XKCD graph that plots life satisfaction against days-since-editing-xorg.conf could equally apply to days-since-thinking-about-autotools. In fact one of the few times I've thought about autotools in the last decade was when a failing python-based build script inflicted similar frustration! If I were forced to find one nice thing to say about autotools it would probably be that at least it doesn't assume an internet connection is always available, reliable and without cost. reply anyfoo 16 hours agorootparentprevI honestly don't think so, and I think this is here is a prime example for proving that. For example, a Makefile that does the same job as the build.py script in this project would be significantly smaller, simpler, and easier to read in several metrics that I'd reasonably call \"objective\" to a certain degree. In fact, contrast the Makefile in that project: https://github.com/keyvank/30cc/blob/main/Makefile With the build.py script: https://github.com/keyvank/30cc/blob/main/build.py You need to know very little about Makefiles to make immediate sense of what that Makefile is doing, whereas you need to know much more about python to still not immediately see what the build.py script is doing. In fact, you will probably just \"guess\" that the python script is supposed to do a similar job only from its name before that. And then the python script still does not do incremental builds at all! Again, if it gets more complex that can change, but this is far away from that. It takes 10 or so minutes to learn enough about Makefiles to be productive with them, from scratch. reply 3836293648 12 hours agorootparentprevIt's is absolutely objectively true. Whether you already know it or not depends on your background reply saghm 12 hours agorootparentprevOn the other hand, I'd argue that the point where you've stretched it so far that it's more trouble than it's worth is basically impossible to see until you've gone beyond it. reply bluGill 15 hours agorootparentprevIf make is too hard, ninja is simpler. Less powerful but in ways that rarely matter. I've written both by hand both are a little weird but not hard.

But why 3 steps of compilation? The first step merely shows that you wrote valid C code that gcc can compile. It doesn't prove that the program actually does what promised. For example, if you missed to implement 'for' loops, this step would still produce a compiler, which could still work for a subset of C. Here comes the second step: it proves that it implements enough features to at least recompile itself. Now, this is still not a guarantee that all C constructs and features work, but we can reason that even if it only implements a subset of C, it's a large enough subset to build such a substantial app as a compiler. How likely is it that a compiler doesn't use a 'for' loop, not even once? But what is the reason for the third step? It doesn't add anything, it doesn't trigger any code path that was excluded in the first one. After all, if you did miss 'for' loops, and the 2nd step hasn't detected it, it must be because there are no 'for' loops in the source, so you will never detect it this way, no matter how many steps of recompilation you run. reply atq2119 4 hours agoparentThe 3rd step can flush out compiler bugs, as follows. The 1st step uses gcc, so it's not going to find any bugs in this compiler. The 2nd step uses the compiler as compiled by gcc. That will find some bugs, such as crash bugs or missing features (like your for loop example). However, it does not find bugs that lead to generating incorrect code. The 3rd step uses the compiler compiled by itself. If there is a bug in code generation that led to the stage-2 compiler being compiled incorrectly, that is likely to lead to some error during stage-3 compilation, such as a crash. And if it doesn't crash outright, it is very likely to cause the resulting executable to differ between steps 2 and 3. The incorrectly compiled compiler is surely even worse at compiling correctly than the compiler that was presumably compiled correctly (using gcc)! So, this 3-step process is a pretty good way of finding bugs, especially if you compare the stage-2 result against the stage-3 result. reply keyvank 4 hours agorootparentperfect explanation, tnx! reply keyvank 11 hours agoparentprevThanks! The third step proves that the assembly code generated by the second-step compiler is valid even when compiling a big C project. reply disqard 18 hours agoprevThank You For Making And Sharing! reply jheriko 18 hours agoprevnice work. if you want more of a challenge try a compiler compiler that can compile itself... :) i got pretty far with this myself, although it doesn't work for weirdo languages like Python that need an exceptional lexer. i keep meaning to revisit this problem, since the tools in this space are pretty much non-existent or trash quality. https://github.com/semiessessi/cp2 reply anyfoo 17 hours agoparent> if you want more of a challenge try a compiler compiler that can compile itself... :) Is that not what OP did? reply Koshkin 16 hours agorootparentNo (if the parent really meant ‘compiler compiler’ which, I think, would be what yacc/bison is). reply anyfoo 16 hours agorootparentAh, thanks.

The reducible control flow requirement means you have to build a full control-flow graph and do graph algorithms to it before you can start emitting code. So IMO it makes for a bad starting point. reply anyfoo 16 hours agorootparentIf you want to have \"fun\", generate code in a WASM-representation of Hoare's WHILE language, i.e. a program that only consists of a single outer while loop (in WASM a \"loop\" block), and conditionally decide for every single instruction in the loop whether it should be executed during a given pass. I think that could be done with a single-pass C compiler. In a very trivial (and terrible) case, you could keep a running \"line_counter\" variable that every statement in the loop is predicated with, which either gets incremented at the end of the loop, or set to an arbitrary value for representing branches. It would of course be a horrible (but very amusing) mess, and rather enforces your actual point. reply ksk23 3 hours agorootparentReminds me of what I understand from the „Usagi Electric“ Bendix rotating drum -memory-computer execution :) reply anyfoo 17 hours agoparentprev [–] Elaborate, why use WASM? reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originBody": "How to Grow Professional Relationships Written on 11/28/2024 • Share on 𝕏 Over my career, I’ve had the opportunity to get to know some of the world’s most incredible builders. This same career has also seen quite a significant amount of gatekeeping: various (m|b)illionaire boys clubs and cliques have made it quite clear that they’d prefer to keep their world small and exclusive, and that there’s no room at their table. To each their own, but this dynamic has led to some thinking and reflection around the nature of professional relationships, friendships, and identity—ultimately resulting in what I’m calling TJS (The Journey to Synergy) Collaboration Model. This spectrum is how I measure professional relationships and where I stand in those relationships. It outlines seven states moving from a competitive, zero-sum mindset to one of shared identity (which is equally problematic). Let’s briefly understand each state. One way we can make this information really practical is to understand it in context. A great illustrative context for this is my podcast, because it requires regularly interacting with people that inevitably reveals where we land on this spectrum. States of the TJS Collaboration Model The TJS collaboration model is made up of the following seven distinct states. Everything is a competition: in this initial state, interactions are characterized by gatekeeping and a zero-sum mentality: the idea that for one party to eat, the other must starve. People are not willing to share information, resources, or opportunities. There’s usually discrimination and exclusionary behavior here, either from racism, sexism, xenophobia, etc. I tend to not spend too much time with parties that hold this perspective. In the context of the podcast, this is usually characterized not by rejection but instead by outright refusal to participate in any interaction whatsoever: what some call “ghosting”. I’m not entirely sure if they leave read receipts on to make their point, but I’ve found this behavior to be a pretty good indicator of where we stand on this spectrum. Of course, there are those that simply don’t receive any notifications and have read receipts turned off: these folks are likely not in this state and are just as busy as the rest of us. Also in the context of the podcast, I’ve had guests accept an invitation and then later decline closer to the time of recording because they got invited to go on Lex Fridman and mention “thanks for the invite, but now I don’t need this anymore”. There is no judgment at all here, but such behavior indicates where on this spectrum these relationships stand. Coexist: parties acknowledge each other’s existence but maintain minimal interaction, summarized as “I know of them, but we don’t really talk”. This is usually characterized by mutual respect, but a general distancing for myriad reasons that might include: Personal differences: people might not get along personally, and while they may respect each other, they choose to maintain a distance. Ultimately, human beings are more or less big bundles of chemicals with legs. When chemicals interact, there’s usually a reaction: sometimes positive (2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O), sometimes negative (SO₃ + H₂O → H₂SO₄). This is usually natural and nothing personal. Professional differences: people may have different professional goals or values, which can lead to a lack of shared interests or collaboration. Some might want to be influencers, some might want to be builders, some might want to be investors—they pick the right relationships to be in for them at the time. Values differences: people may have different values that lead them to invest in different relationships. Some might value emotionality highly, leading them to be friends with other emotional people; others might value logic and reason, leading them to be friends with other logical people. Some might value money, leading them to be friends with other wealthy people, etc. In the context of the podcast, I’ve experienced folks who are aware it exists and even talk about it, but have never expressed interest in being a guest on it. I too have not extended invites here because we’re both in the same state of the spectrum. There’s nothing wrong with this: instead it’s kind of beautiful that both parties clearly understand where the other one stands on this spectrum and can move without any drama. It also doesn’t exclude the relationship from ever progressing and is usually just a matter of time before it does. Communicate: basic information exchange occurs, where either party would describe the other as “we spoke about something once” but the relationship doesn’t progress much further for similar reasons as above. In the context of the podcast, this is where a conversation eventually leads to “yeah, let’s do it”, and then nothing ever happens, or an event is scheduled but has not yet taken place. Communication has happened, positive communication even, but—specifically in the case of the podcast—we have not yet cooperated on anything. This is where the vast majority of western relationships live: a “comfortable distance” of sorts. We see traits of this outside a professional context as well, where shallow friends will talk and say “let’s get coffee some time!”, but then never actually follow up. Perhaps even worse, people in this state often make plans and then cancel at the last minute because it’s simply not convenient. It’s pretty remarkable that this state is quite prominent in western culture and less so in other parts of the world as eloquently highlighted by my former Spotify colleague Himanshu in his blog post about moving back to India. Cooperate: parties participate in a neutral task together, where they’re both contributing to the same goal. The stakes are usually low, and the relationship is still mostly transactional. A great experiential example of this from my career is when I’ve spoken at conferences with some folks who I’ve heard of but haven’t really developed much rapport with. The relationship is cordial, but not much else. How this low-stakes cooperation goes strongly influences next states: from here, either party can choose to remain in earlier states, or progress to the next state, Coordinate, based on how well they were able to work together (as popular culture calls it, “the vibezzz”). In the context of the podcast, this is where we actually spend time in conversation together on an episode: both parties are contributing to the same goal, cooperating with each other to meet it. It’s slightly less convenient than the previous state, but given the quality of the cooperation, leads to far better outcomes. Coordinate: at this stage, one or both parties take deliberate steps to coordinate their actions toward a goal that belongs to one of the parties. This goal is often “adopted” by the other, looking something like: “we’re both going to be at this conference a day earlier, shall we go explore the city together?” — one person’s goal of exploration is adopted by the other. ”I see you’re working on a new course—shall I do a giveaway on my podcast when you launch?” — one person’s goal of promoting their course is adopted by the other. Both of these cases are coordinated efforts. Though the latter is a more advanced state of coordination, the main gist here is that one or both parties take deliberate steps to coordinate their actions to achieve a newly shared goal: to support each other. Either party can make the first move, and this tends to be a pretty chaotic space because it calls into question a number of topics like motivation, trust, and alignment. The party that makes the first move risks the other one thinking they’re being too aggressive, pushy, or plain weird. They also risk the other party questioning their motivations: “Why is this person offering to amplify my course launch?\" \"Why do they want to explore the city together?\" \"What’s the catch?\" \"Will I owe them a favor later?” The coordination state is usually perceived as risky—though empirical evidence proves it is not because people are on average more good than evil according to research from the lab of Dr. Jamil Zaki at Stanford University’s Department of Psychology, where they have demonstrated that coordinated efforts can lead to increased trust, motivation, and even happiness. Coordination is typically an inflection point in the relationship, as referenced in the diagram. If people have not spent enough time in previous states, this state usually will not work. If there were intense positive vibes in previous states, this will feel natural and seamless. Ultimately, both parties grow synergistically from coordinated efforts while working on entirely separate but complementary topics. Folks that I’ve coordinated well with include: Kent C. Dodds on deprecating his library glamorous in favor of emotion: we built separate things that were complementary and coordinated on them together. Aymen Ben Amor, Clark Sell, and Josh Goldberg on supporting their conferences via the podcast: they were building a conference, I was building a podcast, and we coordinated on promoting the conference together (I adopted their goal of promoting the conference). Alex Moldovan who runs JS Heroes and has me as an ambassador: he creates the conference and coordinates with a set of ambassadors. We do not create the conference together. If we did, this would be the next step—Collaboration. Collaborate: something beautiful happens when two or more people repeatedly execute successful coordinated efforts: there is a common recognition of high-quality synergy; that together, they are greater than the sum of their parts and they can continually share joy in their work. Collaboration is not when people coordinate efforts on building separate things that are complementary, but instead when they build the same thing together. I’ve had the privilege of collaborating with a number of great folks over my career. If I was to start a company, go to war, or happen to be in a zombie apocalypse, I’d want these folks by my side. At this stage, all parties have established a high level of trust and understanding of each other. They understand boundaries and each other’s value systems extremely well. They are able to push boundaries and challenge ideas respectfully, with grace, without ego, at the right time and in the right circumstance. Folks that I’ve had and continue to have excellent collaboration with include: Fabien Bernard and Mikhail Potomin, where we built some software that was cool at the time but is now obsolete. Specifically, Restful React: a RESTful data layer for React applications that had a fully type-safe interface for working with REST APIs predictably. Operational UI: a React component library whose documentation had interactive Monaco Editor playgrounds with IntelliSense for TypeScript autocompletion in the browser. I did a talk about this at React Finland in 2019 where I first met David Khourshid and Jenny Truong, where we built their wedding ceremony together where I was the officiant. This is a collaboration and not a coordination because we built the same thing (a wedding ceremony) together, instead of coordinating on building separate things that are complementary. Daniel Afonso, Sergii Kirianov, Matheus Albuquerque, Mark Erikson, Rick Hanlon II, and more where we built my book Fluent React together. I may have authored the book, but it was a strong collaborative effort where they reviewed it and continued to provide high-quality feedback until it was ready for publication. It was one thing that we all built together: a collaboration. I don’t yet build the podcast with anyone, but I’m open to it. We are the same: the final state represents a shared identity and enmeshment, which is not a positive state. Keeping with the old adage of “too much of a good thing is a bad thing”, this is a state where parties are co-dependent and enmeshed, where one or more members unhealthily depend on the other. There is a dissolution of individuality, a loss of identity and boundaries: this is a toxic state. In this state, we find and experience burnout. It’s easy to exploit this state and take advantage of one or more members. Ownership over collaborative efforts is also disputed in this state, and it’s not uncommon to see folks take credit for things that they didn’t do, or to see people step down from collaborative efforts because they feel they’re not being valued. Attempts to reach ideal and healthy levels of collaboration often go wrong and end up here, usually by employers using toxic positivity and platitudes like “we’re a startup family”. You may recognize you’re in this state by several key warning signs: Loss of Personal Identity: inability to develop or maintain a strong sense of self, only being able to describe yourself in relation to others, being uncomfortable taking credit for your own good work, and difficulty knowing your own wants and needs. Difficulty Making Independent Decisions: struggling to make choices without consulting others, feeling unable to function independently, anxious overthinking, and constantly seeking approval before taking action. Lack of Boundaries: having trouble saying “no,” allowing others to invade your privacy, and being unable to separate your emotions from those of others. I’ve fallen into this state a few times for very short periods and what has helped me get out of it is to redevelop my identity alone as a separate and beautiful thing from really any other party. That and separation from the problematic party. The combination of rediscovering self-identity, establishing healthy boundaries, separation, and working with a board-certified therapist is something that can be helpful for folks that find themselves in this state. Ideally, we learn to recognize quality collaboration as the peak of synergy and protect against this state. I am thankful to rarely if ever find myself here and take strong measures to avoid it. If you’re in this state, it is my hope that this diagram and post will help you understand where you are and how to move forward. Keep reading for some actionable steps you can take to move your relationships forward. Making it Practical Take a moment to think about where your relationships stand on this spectrum. It’s a great exercise to help you understand where you are and where you want to be. I’ve already mentioned a few of my own excellent collaborators and folks with whom I coordinate well—who are yours? Who can you credit? For real, scroll up, copy the image, place it beside you, and ponder it closely. Who are folks that you coexist with? Why? Who gatekeeps and excludes you? Who would you build a company with? I’d encourage carefully considering the answers to these questions and even copying the graph and placing avatars along its axis to help you visualize the status of your relationships. From there, you can start to take action to move relationships to where you want them to be, ultimately bringing your social setting into alignment with your goals and values. Should you decide you’d like to move some relationships forward, here are some actionable pathways you can take. Moving Relationships Forward There’s plenty of evidence that shows that we’re at our worst when we are exclusionary and zero-sum. The inverse is also true: we are at our best when we are collaborating well with others. For example, this paper has two key ideas that I think are worth repeating here: Working in isolation creates significant limitations: It creates a false sense of security because ideas are not likely to be challenged. It results in work that will not reach as wide an audience. It wastes limited resources through duplicated efforts. The paper also states that: The benefits of collaboration allow participants to achieve together more than they can individually, serve larger groups of people, and grow on individual and organizational levels. With this, we can see that collaboration is not just a nice-to-have but a necessity. It’s not just about getting along with others, but about building greater things together. Should you decide to move some relationships forward, here’s what has worked well for me: Cultivate an abundance mindset: not virtue signaling, but I often give away money and time to folks. People question this from time to time and ultimately, the answer I end up giving is that there is so much to go around. The world is abundant and not zero-sum. I intentionally let people take advantage of me because I know I’ll recover whatever I need in another way. If you pour your entire bucket into others, it may become empty but it will never stay empty: it has rained on this planet since the beginning of time on rich and poor alike, and it will continue to rain. The rain will fill your bucket again. To cultivate this mindset, these practical steps from these scientific papers may help: Start Small: begin with micro-giving. Allocate a small percentage of your resources to deliberately give away. I do 10%, but you can start with 5% and see how it feels. Another useful habit is to practice random acts of kindness daily, whenever convient. Build Social Connections: join giving circles, participate in community service, and create giving networks. This is a great way to meet like-minded people and cultivate relationships. It’s like “scarcity mindsets anonymous”: a rehab group for those that suffer with scarcity mindset. Cooperate and collaborate with each other to achieve goals that are greater than the sum of your parts. Mindfulness Practice: daily gratitude journaling, abundance visualization, and regular meditation focusing on interconnectedness have all been scientifically proven (papers above) to help shift your mindset towards abundance. Track Impact: keep a “giving diary” to document your positive outcomes and ripple effects. This can help you remember to do it again and track your personal growth. Abandon lost causes: people have literally blocked me on social media, ghosted me, or outright said “there’s no room for you at this table”. Anti-foreigner folks have physically attacked me and mentioned “go home” (to your country) in Germany, where I am a tax-paying permanent resident. A lesson I learned from reading Mark Manson’s “Models” as an awkward stupid teenager who wanted to get girls is that the world is an abundant one full of all kinds of people: some who shun us, others who love us. When someone reveals that there’s no room for a relationship, they do us a huge favor and free us up to go pursue others who are open to it. I’ve seen great success in quickly being thankful for the data and moving on. Love your neighbor as yourself: I really love myself well. I feed myself good food, I give myself good exercise, I make money to invest in myself. I’ve seen enormous value and joy in extending the same love to others, beyond just one’s physical neighbor. It would be strange of me to expect something in return from myself as I take care of myself. When I treat people the way I want to be treated—and honor them appropriately, giving expecting nothing in return, there usually ends up being quite a wonderful return that leads to quality collaboration. Obviously this isn’t every time, but the few times it works is worth all the times it doesn’t. It does open you up to abuse and being taken advantage of, but the few times it has worked for me heavily outweighs the times it hasn’t. I’d recommend reading Hope for Cynics by the aforementioned Dr. Jamil Zaki for more on this topic. Sweat the details: we live in an age where we’re constantly bombarded by random nonsense vying for our attention. Conforming to the pattern of this world, it’s fairly common to respond to folks with low-effort communication. ”sup\" \"lgtm\" \"sounds good” This is characteristic of the communicate state in our diagram. Every single time a relationship has moved forward for me has been when I cared. A lot. It has been when folks have mentioned something that’s stressing them out and I listened. It has been when I followed up with them about it weeks later. It has been when my people and I have shown up and done the work that puts them at ease or actively invests in their goals—when we don’t conform to the pattern of the world, but instead transform our behavior to align closer to our values. To circle back, coordination happens when one party adopts the goal of the other and takes initiative to support it. Sweating the details and doing the work, even at a cost to ourselves, is a great way to move from cooperation to coordination. When there are repeatedly successful coordinated efforts, the relationship will naturally progress to collaboration. Conclusion If you’ve made it this far, I hope you’ve found this useful. I also hope that you have actually done the exercise (and cooperated with me) to identify the current state of your relationships and feel empowered to move the ones that you’d like to forward. If you’d like to join a coordinated effort to bring this information to more people, you can do so in the following ways: Share this post on social media however/wherever you want.

    "commentBody": "How to grow professional relationships (tej.as)237 points by Liriel 9 hours agohidepastfavorite130 comments mkmk 6 hours agoOn the practical side of things, one important behavior that I see people frequently forget is the importance of following up. This is probably the biggest differentiator between relationships that languish in the early stages, versus those that progress along the author’s continuum. It’s always a bit strange when you only hear from people once every few years, just as they need an intro or career advice or whatever- the beginning of those conversations is usually a bit of sheepish catch-up on what happened after you last spoke with them. Similarly, there have been times when I have felt like a dope after realizing that I failed to follow up myself after a call, and am again reaching out for another reason. However, when you follow up with someone as simple as “Thanks for connecting me with so and so, we had a great chat” or “I tried that thing you suggested, here’s how it worked out”, you build mutual trust and enthusiasm for a successful outcome to the conversation you had. It’s a genuine and thoughtful way to grow your relationship. reply ChrisMarshallNY 5 hours agoparentVery good point. What's the old saying \"A friend in need, is a friend, indeed.\"? I like to have personal relationships, as opposed to corporate ones. Funny story: During the 1990s, my direct boss was a fairly low-key Japanese man. I really liked him. He was a marketing type, so we didn't really have a technical basis for our relationship. He was a decent chap, and I happily followed his orders. In return, he gave me a great deal of agency. After he returned to Japan, we'd run into each other, from time to time, and it was always a warm, effusive greeting. Years later, he was the Chairman of the Board of the corporation. I never leveraged the relationship, but my team was always treated well, at our level. We were a small technical team, and it would have been inappropriate to focus on us too much. I had very little ambition to go much higher up the corporate food chain, so all was fine. Once, he made a visit to our office (the US branch). It was a really big deal, and people were snapping to attention all over the building. He dropped by my tiny little office, to say hi. It was really amusing, to see the puzzled expressions on all the corporate bigwigs in his entourage. reply impute 1 hour agorootparentHow did you \"run into each other, from time to time\"? This seems to be the key part. There's research that shows that relationships are built via multiple, random encounters. Do you think he still would have dropped by your office if you hadn't had these run ins? reply gadders 3 hours agorootparentprevA similar thing happened to me recently. A chap I knew at a previous bank when I was an AVP and he was a VP is now on the board of my (very large multinational) company.

Really shows what happens when we engage as _people_, not _opportunities_. reply ghaff 2 hours agorootparentThis is a lot of the misunderstanding around \"networking\" you see in discussions. A lot of tech people see it as an unwelcome task/burden. Whereas, it should be generally viewed as a pleasurable opportunity to just get to know people who may (or may not) be useful at some point in the future. reply Aurornis 58 minutes agorootparentI think this happens because networking is always proposed as a way out of a bad career situation. Someone complains online about lack of opportunities then commenters come along to parrot networking as a solution. It sounds like a task you do for career gain. I have another theory that this creates a lot of rebound anger at the idea of networking. When I was doing mentoring (external to my company, people I didn't work with) I spent a depressing amount of time convincing young engineers that it was a bad idea to burn bridges as they left a company. Way too many people are enamored with the idea of ghosting their job or telling off their coworkers on the way out the door. It takes some convincing to get them to realize that leaving a bad impression on an entire office of people is the fastest way to poison their potential network. Nobody will want to refer you for future jobs if you're a jerk in your final days. reply tejaskumar_ 1 hour agorootparentprevMy theory is that that term has this reputation because it is somewhat dehumanized: you _talk_ to people, you _network_ with opportunities. reply lovich 5 hours agoparentprevRelationships are like a garden, they require continual, repeated effort to maintain. It doesn’t need to be an onerous amount of effort, but reaching out to people to shoot the shit once even a year is often enough to maintain the relationship for professional networks at least. In software we have an unfortunate amount of people who don’t value social connections at all so we end up with a large tranche of people who can’t get past the “but why would I talk to them without a specific reason?” argument and then lament why all of their relationships end up transactional, or even better lament why no one will help them specifically because all their relationships are transactional and they aren’t offering anything of value reply the_snooze 4 hours agorootparent>In software we have an unfortunate amount of people who don’t value social connections at all so we end up with a large tranche of people who can’t get past the “but why would I talk to them without a specific reason?” argument and then lament why all of their relationships end up transactional, or even better lament why no one will help them specifically because all their relationships are transactional and they aren’t offering anything of value Yup, you get a lot of people complaining about the pointlessness of small talk, but the reality is that small talk is social glue. People want to work with people they like, and you only get that by having some level of casual ease with one another.

Trying to do smalltalk with me, will not make me your friend. I simply hate smalltalk. (Talking unimportant things for the sake of talking) But there are a million of other interesting non buisness things I am willing to talk about at length. I also like to joke around and be silly. But that requires a connection, you won't get with me while talking about the weather. And I know many people are like me, most just adopted to \"like\" smalltalk, as they think this is the way it has to be. reply lovich 42 minutes agorootparentSmall talk doesn’t need to be about the weather as the trope goes. It can be as simple as “hey have you seen {shared colleague} recently?” Or “Hey man, you get into any new hobbies recently?”, or “I’ve been dabbling in {x} tech, have you done anything like it or are could recommend an alternative based on {personal information you got from collaborating with this person}” The main point in making is that you need to continue in performing these relationship maintaining activities _before_ you need said persons help. For the extremely oblivious who haven’t researched any game theory but know some comp sci, imagine that relationships with all other humans needed regular mechanical Turk transactions with yourself or they will be identified as high risk groups that shouldn’t be afforded any leeway. reply lukan 31 minutes agorootparent\"The main point in making is that you need to continue in performing these relationship maintaining activities _before_ you need said persons help.\" Well, but I am quite good in determining if another person is just trying to be (fake) friendly, so they can get my help later and I am not interested in that and smalltalk won't create that bond for me. I am interested in genuine connections. So if someone asks this question \"Hey man, you get into any new hobbies recently\" and is actually interested in my response - then this is simply not smalltalk anymore by my definition. And I gladly answer. And maybe form a bond. And of course help each other later. But if I feel, it is just a mechanical and calculated approach to bond with me, well, no thank you. But I also help people without doing smalltalk if I can. reply ghaff 2 hours agorootparentprevPost a longtime job out of grad school via on-campus interview (which is a bit of an irrelevant story itself), every other of my (few) jobs were through a professional network.

And why would one consider a transactional relationship as something not offering value? I don't like small talk, but if I like the person I would try to help them anyway with their transactional request, with the expectation that I might have a similar transactional request at some point in the future. If the relationship is equally transactional in both directions, I don't see a problem with that. reply Aurornis 43 minutes agorootparentBecause in transactional relationships the other person only shows up when they need something and then they disappear again until the next time they need something from you. Transactional relationships are fine if that's the deal up front. I have a lot of transactional relationships with freelancers, contractors, and repair people. I call them up needing something and I'm going to pay them for it. The transaction. I dislike transactional relationships when they're disguised as personal connections or friendships. People who pretend to want to get to know you, but they really just want to be able to call on you when they need something from you. Often when you call on them for something they're nowhere to be found. reply tejaskumar_ 32 minutes agorootparentThis. It's the deceit that's hurtful, not the transactional relationship itself. reply lovich 40 minutes agorootparentprevYou only quoted a portion of my sentence. Transactional relationships can be fine if both parties are on with it, but you actually need to bring something of value. If you and I have a fully transactional relationship, then why would I do anything for you if you won’t/can’t do anything for me? reply impendia 2 hours agorootparentprevI am an academic mathematician, and one thing I love about our culture is that transactional relationships are considered perfectly okay. I can invite a colleague at another university, whom I might consider an old friend even though I haven't spoken to them in ages -- to come give a talk in my department. Very often they'll agree to come; we'll roll out the red carpet for them, and they and I will have a wonderful time. That said, this is far from universal in academia, and many academics do enjoy small talk and prefer to keep in touch regularly. I don't think any sort of relationship can be called \"bad\" or \"good\" in the abstract -- but a lot of people consider transactional relationships \"bad\" in the sense that they don't like them. And, if you want to build relationships with people, often you have to do it on their terms, or at least try to meet them halfway. reply Aurornis 37 minutes agorootparent> I can invite a colleague at another university, whom I might consider an old friend even though I haven't spoken to them in ages -- to come give a talk in my department.

You're also rolling out the red carpet to make it good for them. Usually when people talk about transactional relationships, it means they only call on you when they need something from you. For example, calling someone up every 5 years when you need a referral or you want them to solve a problem for you. reply lovich 36 minutes agorootparentprevTransactional relationships are completely fine, and personally I prefer them in the work space. I was commenting on people who’s behavior creates transactional relationships when they wanted something with a deeper interpersonal relationships, and people whose behavior causes transactional relationships but also have nothing of value to make the transaction worth it. If a billionaire calls me up once every five years for a favor but pays me a couple of million for it, I’ll take the call any day. If someone I met at college a few times calls me up once every few years when they got laid off and only are talking to me for a reference but are never in a position to to help me, what reason do I have to help them other than a feeling of charity? I guess I’m saying you shouldn’t treat others as impersonal machines to be manipulated unless you are ok with that same behavior being turned back on yourself. reply tejaskumar_ 30 minutes agorootparent> I guess I’m saying you shouldn’t treat others as impersonal machines to be manipulated unless you are ok with that same behavior being turned back on yourself. This! However if you'll allow me—I think it's worth saying we shouldn’t treat others as impersonal machines to be manipulated _at all_ because we're never really okay with that same behavior being given back to us because of millenia of social, communal evolution. reply jabroni_salad 1 hour agorootparentprevIt's only bad if one of the parties doesn't understand that it is transactional.

If it is a transactional conversation don't insult my intelligence by pretending that it isn't. Obvioulsy this can create a problem as I tend towards \"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you\". If something is within my means and the person hasn't made it onto my shit list I love to help out, it's what makes getting up in the morning worth while. Unfortunately we are all far more powerless than anyone can imagine and actually being able to do more than point people in the right direction, offer advice or just talk to someone is incredibly rare. reply bityard 1 hour agorootparentI get it, as engineers we value efficiency and truth above almost everything else. But most people are not like us. They want to be appreciated, acknowledged, and seen above almost everything else. If you call up an old acquaintance and start the conversation by asking if they know of any job openings, you will be seen as someone who only values what they can DO for you, instead of who are they ARE to you. Nobody likes being a tool, they like being a friend, and like feeling that they are doing something good for someone that likes them for who they are. Now, we ALL know that the call out of the blue to catch up often has an ulterior motive but it's polite (and necessary) to at least PRETEND that the ask is not the main reason you called. reply Aeolun 58 minutes agorootparentYou don't even have to pretend that the ask is not the main reason you called. Of course you call me because you need something, I do this too. But if you called, and you are not even slightly interested in catching up, that just makes you a rude ass. reply tejaskumar_ 1 hour agorootparentprevExactly. Humans are so much more irrational and illogical than the machines we know. And this is a feature, not a bug. reply BobaFloutist 53 minutes agorootparentprevOne of the benefits of playing the game is signaling that you're willing to follow norms even if they don't directly benefit you or make sense to you. Someone refusing to play along with anything that doesn't immediately make sense to them or reasonate with them is a yellow flag, since it shows that they don't value the social contract and aren't willing to humble themselves or make other people the priority. We're social animals, and when people overtly signal that they're disinterested in the existing paradigm, they're communicating that they're going to be exhausting to interact with, since you're going to have to explain and justify every individual thing you want out of them that they don't already understand, and they'll never just go along with things for the sake of others. reply tejaskumar_ 43 minutes agorootparentI know a few people like this and can confirm: they're extremely difficult to be around and take pride in it, feeling great about being \"free thinkers\" and breaking from the \"herd mentality\". This I feel is unfortunately counter to the design of humankind, where we are—as you said—social animals and the only way to change for the better—at a species level—is to change together. reply whatshisface 36 minutes agorootparentIsn't that basis for criticism a little broad? It sounds like you're saying that vegetarianism, every religion, and a higher than average scrupulousness towards not littering are in the same category as picking your nose during a one on one. reply polygotdomain 4 hours agorootparentprevPsychopath? No. But it's also not insulting their intelligence by having that little catch up. You're asking someone for something that they don't have to do for you. Showing up in their inbox saying \"Give me something\" might seem to you like you're being concise and to the point, but to the person reading it, there's not much motivation for why they should give you that thing you need. The catchup, as mundane and obvious as it is, at least signals to the person that you see some value in them and value your relationship, even if it's transactional in nature. Does it need to go on for paragraphs or multiple emails back and forth? Absolutely not, but having some lead in makes it less like you're only concerned about what you can get from the person. Would you rather a waiter just come up to your table and say \"Order!?\" or have a little bit of pleasantries before asking what you'd like to eat. There's no more transactional relationship than a diner and a waiter, but most people would prefer the latter. reply the_snooze 3 hours agorootparentThose pleasantries also keep the door open for more interactions. If you ask someone for help, being sociable will make them feel at ease and more open to asking your insights too, and that's a win-win for everyone. And really, that's how personal and professional networks are formed: through small gestures you do consistently over time, you build up comfortable interactions with the people around you. reply tejaskumar_ 3 hours agorootparentprevThis also varies a lot across cultures: in Germany, people actually expect waiters to show up and say \"Order?\" and sometimes get irritated when they're overly bubbly. In the USA, the opposite is expected. reply BobaFloutist 48 minutes agorootparentRight, it's about showing that you respect the social and cultural expectation, not about the specific expectation. Some people have a very hard time adapting or accepting different cultural expectations, and their world is necessarily narrowed. It always makes sense logically, \"Why should I have to play these games to show that I mean well, people should judge me by my more meaningful actions\" but another way of looking at it is it's not worth it to them to make the microscopic effort to communicate willingness. If they're not willing to make even that little effort to make communication easier, what else are they unwilling to do? reply tejaskumar_ 41 minutes agorootparentYeah, strong agree. reply tejaskumar_ 5 hours agorootparentprevYou're not a psychopath: I feel the same. However I still value showing them honor so I often deal with them with more kindness externally than I feel internally, recognizing my internal feeling is my own issue not theirs. reply anal_reactor 4 hours agorootparentprev> Obvioulsy this can create a problem as I tend towards \"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you\". The fact that most people enjoy exactly the opposite of what I do was revolutionary to me, really explained a lot, and allowed me to navigate social interactions better. Having said this, I don't see the ROI on pleasing people I don't like. I try to gauge whether someone has the same vibe as I do, and if that's not the case, then I'll be polite but that's it. reply tejaskumar_ 4 hours agorootparentWhat are some primary reasons you don't like some people? Is it just a vibe mismatch like the chemical reactions the article suggests? reply anal_reactor 3 hours agorootparentFirst, most common mismatch: different goals. The things I'm trying to achieve are not the things someone else is trying to achieve, which makes cooperation difficult. Or we might be trying to achieve the same thing, effectively competing for the same resources. Second, less common but still common mismatch: different emotional responses. If an event happens and I react in way A while the other person reacts in way B, either of us needs to suppress the emotional reaction, which is exhausting. I'm not willing to do that, unless genuineness is not expected by definition (at work, at family reunion). reply tejaskumar_ 3 hours agorootparentI love how self-aware you are about this. Honestly if I encounter the first mismatch I tend to operate just like you: will honor the person but also move away and towards my goal. Thanks for sharing! reply LoganDark 3 hours agorootparentprevI nearly lol'd at the people immediately jumping to \"you're not a psychopath\", as if that's a bad thing. Psychopathy can be essentially the selective inhibition of empathy (not to be confused with a total lack of empathy as in ASPD). If you choose not to feel empathy for people who are trying to small-talk you then that could technically be called psychopathy. And also a relatively common symptom of autism! (I, also, hate small talk in many transactional conversations, and am autistic.) reply tejaskumar_ 3 hours agorootparentThis isn't entirely accurate. Psychopathy involves impaired affective (emotional) empathy as a core trait, while cognitive empathy remains intact or can even be enhanced. This is slightly different from autism, which typically shows impaired cognitive empathy but intact affective empathy. Psychopathy is not about choosing not to feel empathy - it's a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent deficits in emotional responsiveness and empathic concern for others (meaning they can't). -\"opathy\" is usually a disorder outside of one's control. reply LoganDark 3 hours agorootparentI think you might have run into the exact thing I put in my comment: \"not to be confused with ASPD\", which is also sometimes called sociopathy. I use psychopathy and sociopathy differently (such that psychopathy is chosen while sociopathy is inherent) and choices like these can be an autistic trait. I'm not talking about empathic struggles, but rather a choice not to care too much about someone's emotions in a particular context. I don't know how to square these with the commonly accepted definitions because the commonly accepted definitions are kind of ridiculous (the terms psychopathy, sociopathy, and ASPD are collectively sort of ambiguous because they all each mean everything somehow; nearly everyone is confused about them in some way). This is why I said psychopathy \"can be\" the selective inhibition of empathy, because by some definitions that's what it is. Other definitions like yours essentially define it as what I call sociopathy (simply being without empathy in the first place). I don't claim my definition to be the only definition because psychopathy can sort of mean either thing depending on who you ask, but I use my definition just for the sake of argument. reply tejaskumar_ 3 hours agorootparentHeard! Sorry if I came across as combative! I spent way too much time around clinicians and tend to stick to formal definitions a little too much. reply LoganDark 2 hours agorootparentThe thing about psychopathy sort of being defined either way depending on who you ask is that we don't necessarily know for sure which definition is right anymore. They're essentially both \"correct in a way\". The term also has a somewhat muddied history that makes it difficult to figure out what it was truly originally supposed to mean, so we don't even know which definition today is supposed to be the right one. reply jjice 4 hours agoparentprevDoes anyone have any practical advice to keeping up with former remote coworkers? My last job was remote with some fantastic people, but as time has passed and the company hasn't done incredibly well, people have scattered (including myself) and I've found it tricky to keep in touch. I'll video chat with some of them once every few months online, but I only have contact with some of them this way. For others, it feels like the best contact I have is LinkedIn messages. It's usually a quick exchange about how they've been, if they've been up to anything interesting, how the kids are, and how work is - but it's all fairly brief. Maybe that's fine? Would love to hear if others have better ways to keep in touch with people they enjoyed their time with, but no longer see on a regular basis or live anywhere near. reply tejaskumar_ 4 hours agorootparentWhat works for me is overt intentionality: I just tell them I'd like to continue to keep in touch with them and ask if it's okay if I sporadically text them somewhat regularly. Some folks have said outright no and that's fine, it's their choice, but others (most of them mentioned in my essay) have said yes and it's a really beautiful arrangement. Sometimes if they don't hear from me, they now proactively reach out. reply jjice 4 hours agorootparentThat's a great point! I find that it's easy (for myself, at least) to gloss over the simplest and straight forward path for communication! It's always easier to be direct. I appreciate the advice! reply JTyQZSnP3cQGa8B 2 hours agorootparentprevPeople hate LinkedIn but it's my solution. I only \"follow\" former coworkers and ask how they are doing once in a while, and sometimes to have lunch at noon. LinkedIn sucks unless you you restrict yourself to coworkers and IRL friends. reply williamdclt 3 hours agorootparentprevIt's a hard one. If you lived nearby, I'd say that meeting up for lunch or a drink is unbeatable. Maybe ask for their help or opinion on stuff you encounter? Whether it's technical problems, interpersonal stuff, personal musings about the industry... once every few months is probably enough, you don't have to stick to professional topics but that's probably a good way to start! reply gadders 3 hours agoparentprevThe other thing you can do is \"Hey, I remember when we spoke you were interested in XX. I just found this article on it that I thought you might find interesting.\" It's a tiny favour, but it also shows you listened to the other person. reply tejaskumar_ 3 hours agorootparentLove this! reply tejaskumar_ 5 hours agoparentprevI love this very much and strongly agree: I hate receiving those sheepish catch ups, especially when I anticipate an ask coming. In fact, if I sense I want to make an ask but I haven't spoken with someone in a long time, I just won't ask them for the thing because we don't have that context/rapport yet: it's a way of honoring them. Continuing to make it practical, one thing that has served me well was to maintain a list of friends (I still do this) and text them at least once every day just following up or checking in. Some like it, some don't. For those that don't, that's their choice. The topics around abandoning lost causes kind of apply there: not that these people are lost causes, but daily checkins are.

But one day, I realized I was investing so much energy into something that wasn’t going anywhere. reply alexpotato 6 hours agoparent> No matter how much I tried to engage or find common ground, they kept shutting down any attempt at teamwork. This reminds me of a story from when I was in business school. We were assigned groups for project work and it was very difficult if not impossible to transfer out of a group. This was by design b/c the point was to teach the students to deal with interpersonal issues and group dynamics. My friend was in a group with someone we will call Bob. Bob always showed up late, argued about every assignment, would debate for hours about why he couldn't do a task etc. Eventually, my friend just declared \"task bankruptcy\" with Bob and gave him no work to do. Why? He realized it was easier to give Bob nothing to do and just redistribute the tasks to the rest of the group versus trying to get Bob to do anything. I should add, it seems that Bob had some kind of special status with the school as he always showed up late to exams, was able to turn in work late etc. In closing, a lot of this is reminding me of the \"CIA guide to corporate sabotage\": https://www.corporate-rebels.com/blog/cia-field-manual reply tejaskumar_ 6 hours agorootparentDid they consider kicking Bob out of the group? reply beryilma 2 hours agorootparentI know of a graduate-level software engineering course at a reputable US university, where getting kicked out of the project group is a possibility and gets the person an automatic F grade. reply anshulbhide 1 hour agorootparentprevIn most b-school group projects, the work is fairly easy enough such that the headache of kicking someone is out is probably greater than just doing the work amongst the remaining members. reply alexpotato 5 hours agorootparentprevThis was highly discouraged as the whole point of the group projects was to teach how to deal with group dynamics. reply tejaskumar_ 5 hours agorootparentIsn't a part of dealing with group dynamics though recognizing when there is harm in/to the group and removing it?

This is the one I always tell people when I explain how WTF IT can be, I wasn't there for it, but it was retold with the author in the room laughing about it. A female coworker joined and on her first day he went up to her and said \"You know you're a slut, right?\" And there were tons of stories of him saying the craziest of shit. That company had serious culture problems, from a CTO who would take his anger out on juniors, demand complete nonsense that made no technical sense, and a revolving door of employees who were leaving because of the CTO or Tejas.

I’m struggling to understand how you could have thought that was acceptable conduct. What am I missing? reply tejaskumar_ 1 hour agorootparentI don't remember his account ever happening, but I do see a younger version of me doing nonsense like that. I've done similar nonsense if I'm being fully honest. I also would call that overt sexual harassment and it is totally not OK. Unfortunately, the culture of the organization at the time made it seem OK to where I felt comfortable doing such nonsense. In fact, I have done similar nonsense to get approval from the coworkers there when I otherwise would not have. I knew it wasn't acceptable in the grand scheme of things, but my team accepting and approving of it (with laughter) was why I did many stupid things earlier in my career. reply anthonyc 1 hour agorootparentprevI hate to pile on, but I listened to the podcast OP linked above.

He was there for years before I joined and honestly, it was meant to be better then and had a bunch of work on the culture but it was still pretty shitty. I remember once I semi-joked \"You guys talk about a culture problem in IT, it sounds like you have a Tejas problem\" and he generally looked like he felt bad about it. reply tejaskumar_ 1 hour agorootparentI did feel bad about it. I'm glad you said that, and I'm thankful for how it made me feel. It is exactly that feeling that continued to inspire growth and change. No doubt, I feel it again as people continue to pile on here.

It contains 16 chapters with videos and quizzes and covers a core curriculum that introduces you to fundamental questions, such as “What is a particle?” or “What are charges and interactions?”, leading to more applied questions, such as “What is a particle accelerator?” and “What is a particle detector?”. The total length of the pilot version of the course videos is close to 4 hours. The course features instructions for DIY experiments that you can try out at home. You can complete chapters in any order you like, so feel free to jump around and explore the full content of the course! If you complete all chapters by answering the corresponding quiz questions correctly, you qualify for a digital certificate! In the future, we want to further develop this particle physics course. That’s why we have also included feedback questions for every chapter to collect your feedback on the content of the course and its design. Indeed, we need you to tell us how to improve this course and which topics to add in the future! Your feedback will, of course, be collected anonymously, and your responses will have no impact on your completion of the course! Here’s a trailer to give you an idea of what this course is all about: Course Overview Educational Framework Are you ready? We’re excited to get you started!

Your educational experiment involved 54 schoolchildren, aged 15-17, who were randomly selected from around 1,000 applicants, from 36 UK schools – mostly state schools. The teenagers spent two hours a week in online classes and after eight weeks were given a test using questions from an Oxford postgraduate quantum physics exam. More than 80% of the pupils passed and around half earned a distinction. Were you surprised by their success? At one point, I was going to call off the whole thing because I thought it was going to be a complete disaster. We’d originally wanted the kids to interact with each other on social media or communicate online, but that wasn’t allowed due to the ethical guidelines for the experiment. I thought, what sort of educational experience is it, if you can’t talk to each other? This is the Covid generation: none of them put their cameras on [for the online classes], so we were looking at a black screen. None of them asked questions using their voices, they just typed. It was a difficult teaching challenge by all standards. We also saw a self-esteem problem with the students. But the majority of kids liked that we had announced that you didn’t need a complex maths background. The maths had been a barrier to kids who had wanted to access this knowledge. And then we got back the numbers. They did significantly better than we see from university-level students. Exams were marked blind, so we don’t know how many came in with the aim of pursuing Stem. We are processing that data now. reply Gooblebrai 4 hours agoparent> we were looking at a black screen. None of them asked questions using their voices, they just typed. It was a difficult teaching challenge by all standards IMO This is one of the most depressing things about teaching teenagers online in real-time. But I don't know what we can do about it. Should we adapt to it? Are there any benefits to enforcing the cameras and voice dialogues? reply quacked 4 hours agorootparentThe only way you can get teenagers to really engage with any kind of instruction is to take some of the guardrails off and let them interact freely. This means they'll ask controversial questions, use slang, curse now and again, crack jokes, and go off into tangents that they've been thinking about. Adults are allowed to do all this at work, but teenagers aren't allowed to do it at school, and virtual education makes this even more boring. One example: for online teaching, that may require a streaming model where there's a live, mostly uncensored chat where they can keep side conversations going and react to the material. I'm not sure if that model would be of use, but I do know that trying to get teenagers to engage requires the same thing it always has, which is taking them seriously as adults and not censoring them. reply LoganDark 3 hours agorootparentprevI'm autistic and prefer text for virtually all communication because it's easier for me to control a keyboard than it is for me to control my voice. reply kitd 5 hours agoparentprevNow I have questions about the Oxford postgraduate quantum physics exam :) reply sesm 1 hour agorootparentExactly, how can one pass a postgraduate level exam 'without complex math'? reply tzs 3 minutes agorootparentIt didn't say their exam was an entire postgraduate exam. It said they passed an exam consisting of questions from a postgraduate exam. I'd guess that if someone tried to take the entire exam it would include things that do require \"complex math\" (whatever that is). But you don't have to get to the parts of QM that require such math in order to cover things that exhibit the meat of QM, such as superposition, entanglement, and uncertainty principles. I'd guess that it was those kinds of things covered for these students and that is what they were tested on. reply ndriscoll 2 hours agoparentprevThat sounds neat, but it seems like it's specifically for certain (discrete) processes? Like can you use this to e.g. derive the shape of atomic orbitals or predict something about spectra (which are kind of important parts of quantum mechanics)? If not then the implication that it's somehow teaching people years of material in 16 hours is about as silly as it sounds. The \"famously bizarre\" parts are the parts that tie it back to the questions that first motivated it, e.g. what is \"stuff\" made out of, why do molecules behave the way they do, and how to reconcile that with naive predictions you might have from Coulomb's law. reply gus_massa 4 hours agoparentprev> from 36 UK schools > and after eight weeks were given a test Was the test remote or in-person?

But seriously, it's obviously meant to have a wider audience than just those countries you mentioned. Not even mentioning the elephant in the room that they are funded by many other eu countries (~23) that have their own languages as well. What else besides the most international language in the world should they have chosen? reply niemandhier 8 hours agorootparentAdding a language does not exclude another? I completely understand that you do the videos in English and for adult audience that’s great, but for kids below 16 it’s a bit challanging. I just wish that for non English speaking kids there would be more resources in their native languages, especially since mathematical interests and interest in languages rarely are equally strong. The fact that the US has such a large unified one language market really gives them an edge when it comes to creating content. It would be stupid to ask American educators to provide content in language irrelevant in their country; but given that France, Italy and Germany together provide for 40% of cern budget wishing for human made subtitles surly is nothing outrageous. reply scionthefly 2 hours agorootparentThis is version 1.0.

Which is something we’ll get into in quite some depth as this post goes on. It’s really a win-win, and I’ll be deploying all my networks as IPv6-mostly from now onwards. Why try this? In this post, I don’t really want to get into the detail of why IPv6 is an improvement over IPv4. The initial RFC was ratified in 1998 and there’s been over 2 decades of content generated about the benefits it brings since then. IPv6 is the current version of the IP protocol and IPv4 is legacy. I consider that a settled matter. The key point here is that the ‘default’ IPv6 capable end-user network is a dual stack network (i.e. one which deploys IPv4 alongside IPv6). This might work nice and transparently from the perspective of end-users, but running two separate network stacks with different addressing scheme and configuration alongside each other means we’ve now got 2x as many things to consider and 2x as much admin and maintenance work to do. I know some network administrators use this increased maintenance burden as a reason to justify not having to learn or deploy IPv6 in the first place, but what if we used it as a reason to disable IPv4 instead? And since there’s no faster way to learn the downsides of something than simply just doing it, so began my journey of spending November on a single-stack IPv6-only network. Scope So throughout the month of November, I decided that I would disable IPv4 connectivity on my main home network and see what broke, and whether there were any steps I could take to work around the breakage or fix it. Throughout the process, I wanted to follow an iterative approach. I would first take the network back to pure IPv6-only, without even any transitional technologies in place. And then I would add in the transitional technologies until I determined whether I could live without IPv4 connectivity long-term. Please note that throughout this post I’m really only focusing on the challenges of going IPv6-only from a home networking standpoint, rather than anything at an enterprise or carrier level. Though you may be interested to note from the enterprise standpoint that Microsoft were transitioning their corporate network to be IPv6-only as early as 2017. And from the carrier standpoint, Sky appear to be actively working on IPv6-only deployments for their UK home broadband customers. Day 1: Pure IPv6-only (without transitional tech) For this first stage, I simulated going IPv6-only by disabling the DHCPv4 server on my router. So… what broke? Well - unfortunately quite a lot. Including some real showstoppers. Desktop OS support At a platform level, every desktop operating system I tried offered seamless support for operating on an IPv6-only network. I was a little surprised actually, since when I’ve tried this in the past, I’ve seen operating systems report a lack of IPv4 as if the network was suffering problems or was unconnectable. I was pleasantly surprised to see all my devices, across macOS Sequoia, Win 11, Ubuntu 24.04, and Fedora 41 seamlessly accepting without any protest that my network had no IPv4 connectivity, all dutifully setting up the connection with single-stack IPv6. Mobile OS support The only devices I have in this category are iOS devices and they handled the situation similarly flawlessly. Embedded device support Things aren’t quite so rosy on the embedded front unfortunately. I tried a Nintendo Switch and it completely refused to connect to the network without a working IPv4 stack: That didn’t surprise me hugely, as Nintendo have historically lagged behind a bit in terms of networking capabilities, but what did disappoint me quite a bit was the way the Steam Deck behaves. As a Linux-based device with a recent kernel and a full desktop environment available, I had quite hoped the Steam Deck would act much like my other desktop devices. Unfortunately it’s even more frustrating than the Switch, because it actually does set up a full IPv6 stack - and even shows the IP in the network connection settings menu - but overall it seems to decide that the lack of IPv4 connectivity means the network isn’t working. It just gets stuck ‘Connecting’ for a while, before eventually failing altogether: Surprisingly, the Deck reacted the same way in desktop mode. Having partially-working network support also seemed to cause the Steam Deck to get very confused when shutting down in either mode, causing it to hang for a long time on the shutdown screen. All of which was a touch disappointing. Having exhausted my collection of current-gen consoles, the other obvious problem I encountered right away is that despite being able to route IPv6 traffic without any concerns, all of my home networking gear seems to be IPv4-only when it comes to management interfaces. Most of my network is made up of TP-Link access points like this one and their cheap VLAN-capable switches like this one. Generally I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend these to anyone, as they’re very cost-effective VLAN-aware pieces of equipment that are great for a home environment. Unfortunately, as seems to be a common theme with home networking gear, the management interface configurability is a bit lacking and restricted to IPv4 only: This isn’t particularly a huge problem since I put these management interfaces on a dedicated network anyway for security reasons. But it’s one that I thought would be useful to call out, since it might affect you if you’re trying to opt for a simpler network design. Being unable to manage any of your switches or access points once you remove the IPv4 addresses from your clients could be a real pain. Web service support Well… this is where things really fall down. I’m certainly not the biggest fan of the increasing centralisation of the web behind a number of large cloud/CDN providers, but one of the things it has brought us is easy IPv6 ‘for the masses’. I do think the relative ease of adoption of IPv6 within the interfaces of providers like Cloudflare has led to a huge increase in the overall reachability of the web over IPv6. Unfortunately, there’s still some surprising holdouts. GitHub quite infamously still haven’t deployed IPv6. And neither have Reddit, Discord, or Steam. On my pure IPv6 connection these sites simply don’t load and plenty of others don’t either. You can get to a lot of the internet over pure IPv6 these days. But all it really takes is for an end user to rely on anything in the list above, and the idea of using a pure IPv6 connection is dead on arrival. Day 2: About those IPv6 transition technologies So it was clear pretty immediately at this point in the challenge that I wasn’t going to be able to continue without deploying some level of transitional technology that would allow me to continue to access the services which only operate over IPv4. Luckily, now with zero working game consoles, I had plenty of free time to investigate. 464XLAT The primary transitional technology that’s going to be relevant for home users is going to be 464XLAT. As far as I can tell, 464XLAT is a combination of a number of different concepts which often get referenced interchangeably, such as NAT64 and DNS64. I’ll do my best to explain them here. NAT64 with DNS64 Broadly, DNS64 works like this: What’s happening here is that our IPv6 device makes DNS requests as normal, but to a DNS server which is running in DNS64 mode. This is effectively a normal DNS server speaking the regular DNS protocol, but when in this mode, the server will detect when a domain has only A records and no AAAA records, and will synthesise ‘fake’ AAAA records for sites in this category. The synthetic AAAA records sent back by the DNS64 server make use of the fact that the entire IPv4 internet can fit into an IPv6 block which is only /96 wide. So they’re comprised of a prefix, which points to a NAT64 Gateway (also called a PLAT), and a suffix, which is just an encoded version of the IPv4 address. For example, on my current host github.com resolves to: 64:ff9b::141a:9cd7 Where 64:ff9b:: is the well-known prefix used by many NAT64 implementations, and 141a:9cd7 is simply an encoded version of the A record that github.com was returning for me (20.26.156.215). As a random note - If you’re interested in decoding a NAT64 mapped address back to the IPv4 literal address it represents, there’s a useful tool here that can do it if you replace the NAT64 prefix with ::ffff:. I’ll leave the details of why that works for another day, and there’s probably many other ways of doing this, but this has been useful to me in the past. Once we have our encoded AAAA records in our DNS response, our client can act as normal, sending packets to the IPv6 addresses as if they were official AAAA records served by the site itself. Those packets will be routed to the NAT64 gateway which will listen for packets targeting the entire NAT64 prefix (in our case, the whole of 64:ff9b::/96). When it receives a packet like this, it will use the encoded suffix to decode the IPv4 address the packet is intended for, and will forward it accordingly to the site over IPv4. Through this process, we’re able to get rid of any requirement for IPv4 connectivity anywhere prior to the NAT64 gateway. In terms of our challenge, this allows us to stay IPv4 free on our LAN entirely, and delegate all remaining IPv4 requirements to our NAT64 gateway. Wait, NAT64? Isn’t that cheating? At this point, a few of you have probably already objected on the basis that this post is titled ‘No NAT November’ and I’m busy describing deploying something called NAT64 on only the second day of the challenge. I guess that’s a fair complaint, but NAT64 has some useful qualities that set it apart from standard private-IPv4-inside-public-IPv4-outside type home networks (more commonly called NAT44). The main difference here is that we don’t have to host the gateway within our own network. Unlike using NAT44 where the internal IP ranges are usually going to be RFC 1918 private addresses that we can’t route over the internet, our IPv6 addresses are globally publicly routable. Which means, in theory, anyone anywhere can host our NAT64 gateway for us. In my case, I have a very forward-thinking ISP (shoutout to Andrews & Arnold in the UK), and they host a NAT64 gateway for customers to use, along with DNS64 servers. So since all of the burden of doing NAT exists completely outside my network, I’m considering this within the spirit of nixCraft’s challenge. If you disagree, please do argue as much as possible about it. It boosts engagement. For those without such forward-thinking ISPs, there are also public-facing NAT64 and DNS64 providers that you can use. Being in security I can’t exactly in good conscience recommend sending all your traffic thorough an un-vetted third party. But they do exist, so I figured I should mention them. It is also entirely possible to host your own NAT64 gateway, either on your regular firewall/gateway, or on a host elsewhere within your network. This host will need IPv4 connectivity to forward on the packets, and there is a fair learning curve to setting one of these up, but apalrd’s adventures on YouTube has a great guide to doing this on OPNsense. NAT64 with CLAT NAT64 using DNS64 gets us most of the way to having a much happier experience running an IPv6-only LAN. But it doesn’t quite get us all the way. Since DNS64 is based around, well… DNS, it can’t help us in situations where we have an app or tool that wants to connect to IPv4 literals (i.e. hard-coded IPv4 addresses without using DNS). To solve this problem, we can use a CLAT. A CLAT is an extra layer that an IPv6-only device can implement which will allow it to translate IPv4 packets to IPv6 packets on the fly. This is done using much the same mechanism as DNS64. The packets get rewritten into IPv6 packets with a prefix matching the NAT64 gateway address, and with a suffix matching the encoded IPv4 address of the destination host. The RFCs suggest that CLAT stands for Customer-side Translator but that doesn’t seem to fit so well, so I prefer to read it as ‘Client-Layer Address Translator’ as it keeps it straight in my own head where in the flow the translation is actually happening. The way this works is that a compatible host will set up the local IPv4 stack of the device to use a ‘fake’ gateway and client IP. Here’s an example of what this looks like on iOS: What’s going on here is that the ‘Router’ represents the fake CLAT gateway, which exists within the device itself. And the ‘IP Address’ represents the fake endpoint IP that the device has assigned itself. This allows the device to act like it has a fully normal and functional IPv4 stack, while transparently translating packets in the background to be able to handle an IPv6-only transit layer. That looks like this and, as you can see, the end result is that we only have IPv6 packets leaving and returning to the device, allowing us to operate quite happily on an IPv6-only network segment: This allows us to effectively deal with applications and other tooling which might expect or require the ability to be able to communicate with hard-coded IPv4 literals. When using only DNS64, our clients don’t really need a way of learning the NAT64 prefix they should be using, because it’ll be transparently included in the AAAA responses sent back by the DNS64 server. But now that we’ve moved into using a CLAT, we’re no longer using DNS to look up addresses before connecting to them. So we need a mechanism for our client to learn the prefix that should be prepended to NAT64 packets before sending them out. There’s a few of these, but the two main ones seem to be: RFC 7050 - Which allows a client to discover it from a DNS64 server by looking up the special domain ipv4only.arpa. RFC 8781 - aka PREF64, which allows it to be served to clients on an IPv6 network through Router Advertisements. Happily, all DNS64 servers I’ve encountered implement RFC 7050 which means realistically if you’re using an operating system that fully supports setting up a CLAT, there’s probably no extra work for you to do here if you’ve also got DNS64 enabled. OS-level CLAT support With that in mind, it’s time to talk OS support for using a CLAT. A CLAT is a complex piece of network engineering which needs to be fairly deeply integrated into the host OS to work well, so it requires a fairly forward-thinking implementation on the part of the vendor. Apple I’m not the world’s biggest Apple fan, but honestly their implementation here is the gold standard. 10/10, no notes. All their devices support automatically setting up a CLAT in a way that’s transparent to the end-user and they can discover the prefix using either RFC 7050 or 8781. Apple even make this work on the devices where you’d normally expect a vendor to pay less attention, such as the Apple TV and on the HomePod. Once I deployed my NAT64+DNS64 support, all my Apple devices seamlessly configured CLAT interfaces and worked out of the box with no config required. Right away I can do things like ping 1.1.1.1 without even thinking, despite the complete lack of IPv4 on the network segment the devices are on. Microsoft Sadly, the same cannot be said about Windows. Although as of March 2024, Microsoft have committed to bring CLAT support to Windows 11, which is great news. Unfortunately, as of Win 11 24H2, it still hasn’t landed yet so we may be waiting a bit longer. Linux In the CLAT space, Linux is… interesting. clatd exists and does see some maintenance, though the only distributions that seem to package it are Fedora and openSUSE, and neither ship it by default. I’ve had mixed results using clatd. It’s a touch finnicky and seems to get a bit confused when carrying out very regular tasks, such as switching between ethernet and Wi-Fi when docking/undocking a laptop. I’d like to see something emerge for Linux which is a bit more embedded into the core of the OS and functions a bit more smoothly, like Apple’s implementation. There’s been an issue open on systemd’s GitHub for a couple of years now asking for something like this. Who knows, maybe we’ll see systemd-clatd eventually. Day 3 to 30: IPv6-only (with transitional tech) So by Day 3, I still have my IPv6-only network deployed, and I also have NAT64+DNS64 along with CLATs on devices which support them. At this point, things are far more functional than they were on Day 1. DNS64 is really taking care of almost everything on my Windows and Linux hosts, and on my Apple hosts the CLAT is getting me the rest of the way. There’s still a few things annoyingly broken though, but now that the transitional tech has been deployed, they all revolve around the apps that insist on using IPv4 literals. A selection of things that I’ve discovered are still broken on an IPv6 only network with NAT64+DNS64: Thing Why it’s still broken Steam Client relies on IPv4 literals. Broken without a CLAT. Discord WebRTC Seems to rely on IPv4 literals for setting up calls. Broken without a CLAT. Network device WebUIs I can’t really fix this one. They simply don’t support IPv6 on their WebUIs. Steam Deck Annoyingly broken despite successfully assigning itself an IPv6 address. But I doubt it would work anyway given the Steam client is broken as above. Nintendo Switch Doesn’t seem to connect at all if IPv4 is not available. What you’ll notice from the above is that it really isn’t a particularly long list. It’s based on my own workloads so no doubt if you try this you’ll find a great number of other things that don’t work and are a dealbreaker for your own personal workflow. But it’s quite striking that we’re a long long way from the “everything is broken” territory people might instinctively expect when they think about the fallout of disabling IPv4, even when considering systems without a functioning CLAT. Once we put it all together, we now have a network that consists of: A NAT64 gateway (whether hosted by our ISP, or elsewhere); A DNS64 server (whether hosted by our ISP, or elsewhere); IPv6-only clients using DNS64 to direct most of their legacy IPv4 traffic via the NAT64 gateway, getting them 99% of the way; and IPv6-only clients that also support a CLAT directing all of their legacy IPv4 traffic via the NAT64 gateway, getting them the remaining 1% of the way. But for the devices that don’t work at all, or which don’t support a CLAT, we’re still left in one of a few non-ideal situations: Waiting for our OS vendor to implement a CLAT; Begging our device vendor to not treat IPv6-only networks as ‘broken’; or Complaining about individual apps using IPv4 literals on GitHub issues which are sometimes over 10 years old. None of these are particularly great options. But there is an alternative. As of 2020, there’s a shining fix to our predicament available, in the form of IPv6-mostly. In order to understand where IPv6-mostly comes from, I can’t avoid relaying the wonderful story of its inception, even though I know this post is already far too long. How to manage the unmanaged: orchestration by RFC How would you deal with deploying OS-level config to a fleet of devices? Some form of config management, you presumably reply. Ansible? Puppet? Salt? Chef? They’re all good choices… when you have control over the devices you want to manage with them. But what if you have a fleet of BYOD employee-owned devices. Devices which are all running a disparate selection of operating systems, versions, and technologies? How do you effectively… manage the unmanaged? This was the problem faced by Jen Linkova, a Network Engineer at Google, when attempting to disable IPv4 on a fleet of unmanaged devices as part of their corporate network IPv6 transition. The answer, it turns out, is a stroke of genius. You simply: Author a bunch of IETF RFCs that define a standard for using DHCPv4 messages to reconfigure willing hosts to switch into IPv6-only mode; Get those RFCs ratified; Get support to send these messages landed in all the major DHCPv4 servers; Get the functionality to deal with these messages landed in all the major OSes; Enjoy your new-found configuration powers over the devices on your network. Move over orchestration by Ansible Playbook. We have orchestration by RFC now. Jen lays all this out in their presentation titled Mission ImPossible - Turning IPv4 Off in an Enterprise Network which is extremely entertaining and well worth a watch! Jen and team are responsible for a number of relevant RFCs in this space, but the one that’s most interesting to us right now is RFC 8925 which describes the new DHCPv4 “Option 108”, aka “IPv6-Only Preferred”. DHCPv4 Option 108: IPv6-Only Preferred At its core, this is a deceptively simple concept. The idea is that you continue to deploy your network dual-stack with both IPv4 and IPv6 support as before, but you instruct clients which are capable of operating in an IPv6-only mode to switch into an IPv6-only mode. IPv6-Only Preferred generally relies on having IPv6 transition technologies in place so that when the client switches into IPv6-only mode, it is not cut off from the IPv4 internet entirely. But that’s not a strict requirement. You could enable this on a network without any NAT64 access at all. But you probably don’t want to, so bear that in mind. Clients which support operating in IPv6-only mode and see a DHCPv4 server sending Option 108 will dutifully switch into that mode and avoid taking an IPv4 address from the DHCPv4 server, while clients that are incapable of operating in IPv6-only mode will set themselves up as dual-stack clients just as they would have done previously. Clients which are too old to even understand the option will simply ignore it and carry on taking an IPv4 address as they always have. With this, we create what’s called an IPv6-mostly network. Effectively the technological equivalent of having our cake and eating it. In this configuration, the network is dual-stacked, but clients will only take an IPv4 address if they need one. This allows us to watch our DHCPv4 lease table tick down in size until the day finally comes when we can disable IPv4 entirely. IPv6-mostly - your road to (eventual) single-stack-success IPv6-mostly networks really end up being the best of all worlds. I would revisit the table from the prior section and compare an IPv6-only+464XLAT setup with an IPv6-mostly setup, but the truth of the matter is that on IPv6-mostly I haven’t experienced anything that breaks at all. It just works. All my IPv6-only supporting devices like those in Apple’s ecosystem seamlessly operate in IPv6-only mode, and the others that still require IPv4 addresses operate dual-stack. I fully expect that when Microsoft deploys CLAT support for Windows 11, my Windows machines will start respecting Op108 and stop taking IPv4 addresses from my pool since they won’t need them anymore. With IPv6-mostly, we can build a clear pathway to transition all the way from an IPv4-only to an IPv6-only network, with a smooth transitional phase in the middle: Potential follow-ups In this post, I’ve focused quite specifically on home networks, and on desktop/mobile devices. That was pretty necessary to avoid the post becoming even longer than it already was. There’s a lot to be said in the server space for this too. Broadly, I found that applications deployed directly onto IPv6-only servers suffer largely the same pitfalls and successes as the desktop ones listed above. The one big caveat there is that containerisation and virtualisation technologies seem to all handle this situation in quirky and interesting ways. That could (and probably will) justify a post in itself at some point in the future. Docker, Podman, WSL, QEMU - your mileage may certainly vary when trying any of the above on an IPv6-only network. If you do try it, I’d be interested to see what your conclusions and experiences are. As part of this experimentation, I ended up deploying a full OpenBSD home router setup to create an IPv6-mostly network which implements all of the relevant RFCs (including NAT64, DNS64, PREF64 and Op108). I noticed while putting the config together that a lot of OpenBSD router config guides online focus very heavily on IPv4 networking and leave out most, if not all, of this kind of functionality. At some point I’ll pull it all together and publish it as a guide as it might be useful to the community at large. Day 30+: Conclusions and recommendations for the future Considering everything from my experience so far, I’ve come away with a few general recommendations: You should deploy IPv6 if your ISP supports it and you haven’t bothered yet; You should deploy IPv6-mostly if you’re adventurous and you have access to a NAT64 gateway or you can host one yourself; You should deploy IPv6-only if you’re involved in developing software or devices that rely on networking. You’ll probably learn a lot from how your apps and devices react, and you might be inspired to fix it. I’ll buy you a beer if you do. Speaking of learning, I learned a lot from this wild ride as always. I did end up surviving the month without re-enabling IPv4 on my LAN, but I decided that all future networks I deploy will be of the IPv6-mostly variety. One day, I will absent-mindedly log into my router and check my DHCPv4 lease table. And there will be no entries. All my devices will behave as they should, using IPv6 and avoiding taking an IPv4 lease at all. On that day I’ll be able to head over to my networking config and remove IPv4 entirely. Perhaps I’m dreaming, but having delved into transitional technologies through this project, it really does seem plausible that day might come in the next few years. That will be a good day.",

A NAT router drops all inbound connections by default because it doesn't know where to route them. This reliably protects devices on your network, because no inbound connections ever reach them. If those applications want to be reached over the network, they can use Hole Punching to turn what would otherwise be an inbound connection into an outbound one. But that requires an effort on both ends of the conversation: if I want a remote client with IP 1.2.3.4 to connect to my server that's behind a NAT, then my server first needs to send a packet to 1.2.3.4. (That's the hole that's punched.) But that doesn't change anything about the reliability of the NAT's protection, because other clients on the internet still can't reach my server. If 1.2.3.4 is not malicious, then nothing bad can happen here. If 1.2.3.4 is malicious, then I was already in trouble when I punched the hole in the NAT, before an inbound connection from 1.2.3.4 even arrives - simply because I created an outgoing connection to 1.2.3.4, over which they could have sent me exploits anyway.

There tends to be conflation that somehow you need an additional device to filter you've not had in place before. In order to do NAT a device has to be at the edge of your network (your device or the ISPs) which tracks connection states to automatically translate outbound ones and allow the reverse mappings through while that is open. Getting rid of NAT simply means dropping the \"translate\" part from that device. The conntrack and allow outbound initiated connection part remains. Instead of port forwards for inbounds you just have inbound allows. There is no big swap of security roles between devices or special additional configuration needed, just the independent removal of the translation configuration from the device. reply blueflow 7 hours agorootparentprevThe NAT device itself also is a firewall and can enforce policies comparable to what NAT would do.

It is the firewall's job to filter such bogons. reply magicalhippo 10 hours agorootparentHow would the package get routed my way unless the attacker hooked up right outside my network? reply Arnavion 10 hours agorootparentYou've answered your own question. reply chgs 10 hours agorootparentSuch a rare occurrence.

But it does add an extra layer of safety. reply mrshadowgoose 6 hours agorootparentprevIn what realistic scenario would a regular individual need to worry about such a threat scenario? reply ffsm8 9 hours agorootparentprevJust by sending the packet. That's essentially how NAT hole punching works. It doesn't work on all routers, but most do just route the packet. You just need to know the exact configuration of the network and send the correct packet through a valid port and it goes through https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hole_punching_(networking) reply dfawcus 8 hours agorootparentHaving implemented a commercial hole punching mechanism, and having tested it on home and commercial deployments (various UK and USA ISPs), I have to agree. For most deployments (home and commercial) the NAT function (its session table) employs Endpoint Independent Mapping, and Endpoint Independent Filtering (see BEHAVE RFCs). As such once something behind the NAT (say at IP:Port) has connected to an external node, any external node can connect back to that internal IP:Port location by targeting packets at the public IP':Port' mapping. This applies even if the node behind the NAT was not expecting, nor desiring it. For home deployments, there is generally no additional firewall. For commercial deployments, there is usually a firewall working in an Endpoint Dependent Filtering manner (usually full 5-tuple, Port and Address Dependent Filtering). This additional firewall blocks off the unexpected connection allowed by the home scenario above, but still allows for hole punching if the behind NAT node(s) can coordinate punching via a third party to exchange their public mappings. Notably in the home deployment case, if the attacker is working with known public ports and addresses (i.e. itself being none NATted), then it can easily bypass the filtering logic of the home NAT once it learns of the existence of the 5-tuple public flow from the home NAT. reply indigo945 4 hours agorootparentBut even if the attacker knows the 5-tuple (which is a big if), how would they send a package with the correct headers? Pretty much every ISP firewall will just drop your packages if you send them with a source IP that's not yours. Note that if you can fake source IP addresses, then a proper firewall won't protect anymore either, because all rules of the form \"allow inbound connections from 1.2.3.4 only\" are now broken. reply blueflow 8 hours agorootparentprevIP packets originating from or addressed to a private IP address cannot be routed through the public Internet. reply hanikesn 10 hours agorootparentprevBut no package would ever make it back as none would be sent to the gateway and even then the gateway would send it to the local network. reply ironhaven 10 hours agoparentprevJust checked my Steamdeck and from the kde desktop settings ipv6 was entirely disabled.

In practice NAT on its own made remote attacks on home networked devices far harder. reply nulbyte 1 hour agorootparentNAT didn't make remote attacks harder, the default inbound deny rule did. NAT is not the firewall itself, it's just one of the things the firewall can do. Telephone companies are also ISPs, and they are and continue to be quite inept when it comes to securing their own networks, so NAT without a default inbound deny rule is not secure. This matters in a very meaningful way. Have you seen how many enterprising but clueless consumers click random buttons until whatever they are trying to do works?

If you don't, you'll get tired of Cloudflare's \"checking if your connection is secure\" becomes pretty tiring pretty quickly. Even in rich countries, CG-NAT is starting to get used more and more as prices for IP ranges go up. CGNAT also affects people trying to do something silly like \"open a port\" for a Minecraft server or a VPN back home, which is impossible without a public address. Outside of CGNAT, just about any protocol works better without standard IPv4 NAT. Xbox and PlayStation have invented their own terminology (what the fuck is a \"type 2 NAT\" anyway) and have written custom code to work around the different ways in which NAT fucks up your connection. Linux and BSD based routers will do deep packet inspection to figure out if you're trying to do FTP or SIP or H363 and rewrite traffic on the fly while opening holes in the firewall just so you can use basic internet functionality. This has also led to an attack dubbed \"NAT slipstreaming\" where generations of routers will allow Javascript running in your browser to open any port on your device to the outside, or even any port on any device in your network, despite what your router's firewall may say. For larger networks (with more than ±250 devices), you get a working connection without having to figure out what a DHCP pool is. And lastly, while this will probably differ by ISP, my experience is that IPv6 has significantly less latency than IPv4, on the order of 4ms versus 20ms. reply avhception 10 hours agorootparentIn Germany, the TV-cable based ISP all have started deploying CGNAT. If you live in a densely populated area with many Vodafone customers, their CGNAT gateways tend to be overloaded, so in peak hours you sometimes experience packet loss. Of course Vodafone won't admit that it's a structural problem instead of isolated cases. At one point, I was forced to use a shitty DSL provider, \"e-on highspeed\" (formerly \"Innogy\") because they had exclusive rights to the VDSL DSLAM in my area.

It sucks having to use NAT with IPv6, but at least it'll be stateless NAT. Then when your delegated prefix changes you will only need to update the NAT rule, meanwhile everything within your LAN that was using ULA-prefixed addresses to talk to each other will continue working. For my own homelab, I give all my machines and VMs static IPs instead of using SLAAC, which also makes it straightforward to register them in DNS, and memorize them in the worst case. reply simoncion 6 hours agorootparent> The easiest way is to use a ULA on the LAN side instead of the ISP-assigned prefix, and set up NAT66 at the router to convert delegated prefixULA. You don't need to not use your ISP-assigned globally-routable prefixes. You can use both a ULA and a globally-routable prefix. In my years of experience with fully-functional IPv6 service, I've never noticed an address selection problem... machines always use the globally-routable address as the source for off-LAN communications and (because it's what's in my local DNS) the ULA address for on-LAN communications. The single pitfall I've seen is if your ISP ever \"shuts down\" [0] that globally-routable prefix, and your border router isn't configured to reject traffic from fc00::/7 going out through the WAN interface, your border router will happily pass traffic out the WAN interface from your not-globally-routable ULA range. > For my own homelab, I give all my machines and VMs static IPs instead of using SLAAC, which also makes it straightforward to register them in DNS...

[0] By this I mean by stopping advertising it, refusing to renew a DHCPv6-PD lease, or similar. reply jeroenhd 10 hours agorootparentprev> does anybody have a clue on how to get SLAAC addresses into local DNS I use an ULA for that (a private /48 that's not routable through the internet). I have a random server in my network (doesn't need to be a router) advertise it through radvd (though some routers also offer that ability). I then put the static address (not the random IPv6 privacy address) in local DNS. If you don't pick any \"easy\" ULAs, you can have multiple devices announce multiple ULAs on the same network and everything will keep working just fine (unlike multiple DHCP servers). The benefit of an extra ULA inside your network is that you don't need to set up NAT or NAT66. The downside is that your ULA services won't be reachable from the outside. I solved that with a Wireguard VPN, but you may need something more complicated. You could consider using something like HE.net's free IPv6 ranges to add an extra prefix into your network that's reachable even when your prefix changes, but that needs some automation (and you want to configure it in a way that devices won't try to route to the internet over that prefix, or streaming services will stop working and your network will probably slow down a bit). I used https://it.jason.tools/ipv6-ula-generator to generate a random enough ULA, then put this into my /etc/radvd.conf: interface vmbr1 { AdvSendAdvert on; AdvDefaultLifetime 0; MinRtrAdvInterval 3; MaxRtrAdvInterval 10; prefix fdae:5594:90d5::/64 { AdvOnLink on; AdvAutonomous on; AdvRouterAddr off; }; RDNSS fdae:5594:90d5:0:215:5dff:fe01:d119 { AdvRDNSSLifetime 3600; }; }; Maybe some of those timeouts aren't correct, I don't know for sure, but this seems to work fine for me. The RDNSS entry is for automatically assigning a DNS server, that's optional as well of course. Alternatively, using mDNS also works more often than you'd expect, either over IPv4 or IPv6. Try `yournashostname.local` and you may just find it works out of the box.

The intersection of devices that support op108 but don't have clat is pretty small, so you are not really gaining much with dns64 imho. It is noteworthy that there are many ways to accompish the sort of ipv4 service that nat64 does. I believe map-t/map-e and lw4o6 are the main contenders these days. In theory at least I don't see why you couldn't do clat style thing with those too. The main advantage of these newer technologies is that they allow service provider side to be stateless, whereas naive nat64 requires similar stateful connection tracking as traditional nat44 (=plain ipv4 nat).

As out-of-tree modules, they'd need to be rebuilt whenever you rebuild your kernel, but would inconveniently not be built as part of that kernel unless you patch them in. I'd not seen the eBPF implementation before. That's quite a nice idea. Quite tempted to have a hack at that to fix the minor issues the author identifies.

All of these devices claim to support IPv6 and technically they do, so shopping for decent hardware quickly becomes a minefield. Seems to me like consumer hardware has better IPv6 support than the supposedly professional tiers. reply can16358p 6 hours agoprevIPv4 isn't going anywhere soon.

I lived in Russia and used HE tunnel for IPv6 in my home network for several (10?) years. With endpoint in London. Then I've moved to the Netherlands, and I'm privileged enough to take all my network equipment with me. I setup same tunnel in the Netherlands. And now I'm in Russia again. I mean, all sites who support IPv6 and bother to detect country, think I'm in Russia. As result, I got lot of bans (\"This site is configured to reject requests from your country\"), additional CAPTCHAs, refused orders in internet shops (\"Your delivery address is XXXX km from your IP address), etc. I need to remove this tunnel and \"order\" the fresh one. It is so frustrating. reply jeroenhd 6 hours agoparentI went on holiday to Germany for one week and left the VPN to my home network on. When I came back, I had to wait two weeks before Google believed that I was no longer in Germany. The language settings were easy to change, but the \"this content is not available in your country\" message that Youtube seems to default to in Germany was rather annoying. Google was actually reasonably quick. I've had to deal with GeoIP providers marking an eastern European IPv4 block sold to a Dutch ISP which took months, and I think a few services still think that block belongs to some Ukranian ISP. If you update your HE information, the GeoIP databases will update too, but it can take a while. Every site admin that manually downloads their GeoIP database needs to update theirs before you can visit your site. This is also a lesson to web admins: if you're going to use GeoIP databases for country blacklisting, update them often. Unless you've containered yourself to hell, your OS distro probably automatically distributes databases in some form. reply Aldqueath 6 hours agoparentprevI think if you update your address and country in your HE account it will also update the geolocation of your ipv6 range, although i do not know how long it takes, especially since it is dependent on the different geolocation services themselves reply blacklion 4 hours agorootparentNope, it is behavior-based, this address range doesn't have any special geolocation, it is assigned to HE and it's all. reply secret-noun 6 hours agoparentprevI also experienced this in the US. My service provider does not provide IPv6, so I used HE's tunnels. Even though it's v4 under the hood, I wanted to see what the illusion of v6 felt like. I turned it off after a few days because of the same side-effects that you mention. I am surprised. I guess, even with an an address space so wide that you can almost randomly choose one that is free, websites are still able to identify certain types of actors. I'd imagine that the heuristic is more of an allowlist in IPv6, versus a blocklist in IPv4. reply happymellon 11 hours agoprevI can't use IPv6 as my ISP (Gigaclear) has an issue where the ISP side routers crash if you enable it. When doing network troubleshooting they will try and get you to factory reset the home router they gave you, which enables IPv6 and bricks their end and has to get escalated. But they provide fibre to the premises and aren't supporting BT, so it's not all bad. reply executesorder66 5 hours agoparent> which enables IPv6 and bricks their end and has to get escalated.

Hopefully after you have destroyed all of their routers, they will eventually buy new ones that are actually compatible with IPv6 so just keep doing it. /s reply teekert 8 hours agoprevFirst step of activating any VPN app on Linux: Disabling IPV6... If you don't and just WireGuard towards a ProtonVPN or MullVad exit-node, you'll find that your IPv6 address is nicely un-VPN-ed, and only via IPv4 does your location show you're accessing the internet from the other side of the world. That was pretty annoying when I first realized that and I have since then fallen back on using the apps of the VPN providers to automate disabling IPv6. The apps I experienced are meh in quality. They are slow and mess with existing WG connections. Although that is probably what you want.

I'd expect better from a company like Proton to be honest, if any company should know how do to networking it's a VPN company. Of course your config files do need to apply the routing rules for IPv6 or you'll still leak traffic, but that's a configuration issue and not really a VPN issue. reply yonatan8070 4 hours agoparentprevWireGuard will only forward traffic with dst IPs that match the AllowedIPs setting, if it only has 0.0.0.0/0 and no IPv6 entry, it won't send IPv6 traffic through the tunnel, did your configuration have the IPv6 address there? reply kmbfjr 6 hours agoparentprevA failsafe method is to create a vlan with a gateway that is the VPN. Using Linux routing tables, the vlan device routes to the wgX as the gateway. If the VPN app dies, there isn't a route to the internet for hosts on the vlan. As far as IPv6 is concerned, there is no entry in the routing tables so IPv6 packets can't leave the network. reply jeroenhd 11 hours agoprevI don't really get the point driving attempts to disable IPv4 entirely. Companies like Github and Steam are too shit to add a few AAAA records, so you need to layer hacks upon hacks to make things work. At that point, just use dual stack, even if it's just CG-NAT. Yeah, it's pretty shit and you get CAPTCHAs out the ass whenever you hit an IPv4 website but at least shit hardware like the Switch will just work. Same with the IoT garbage that couldn't be bothered to spend the quarter of a cent on a megabyte of extra flash so they removed IPv6 supporter. Let the shit hardware and software suffer from having to deal with NAT and save yourself the trouble. Network administrators around the world decided that they didn't like IPv6, don't bother to learn anything new, and pretend there is no IPv6, so take the easy way and placate them with the shitty NAT over NAT they'd much rather prefer. I must admit I'm disappointed about the Deck, but I can't be too surprised given that the entire Valve server stack seems to be IPv4 only. reply Sesse__ 9 hours agoparent> At that point, just use dual stack, even if it's just CG-NAT. The motivating factor is the ability to turn off IPv4 within your own core network. For a large-ish ISP, running v6-only to all of your customers and having IPv4 to only a couple of points (your NAT64 gateway) can be attractive, assuming you generally know what you're doing and your CPE can do 464XLAT. This becomes _even_ more attractive when your network is too big for it to reasonably fit within 10.0.0.0/8 (very cell phone companies are in this boat). For an end user in a home network, there is no practical benefit. reply jeroenhd 8 hours agorootparentUsing IPv6 on the backend is already something ISPs do in many CG-NAT scenarios. This is exactly what DS-Lite does, though that does require a CG-NAT termination solution (then again, if you're an ISP you probably have a box that supports doing that lying around somewhere anyway). For new networks larger than 10/8 going IPv6 native makes sense I suppose, but for existing networks I'd expect migrations to move towards DS-Lite and similar techniques rather than 464XLAT; it's a less messy solution, and from what I can tell it's also more often present in CPEs. reply Sesse__ 7 hours agorootparentThe big difference is whether the CLAT part is in the CPE or in the endpoints, right? reply yjftsjthsd-h 1 hour agoparentprev> Companies like Github and Steam are too shit to add a few AAAA records Yeah, it's... it's not that. Github has talked about it being difficult because their whole stack expects v4 and IIRC is doing some sort of IP reputation/rate-limiting system. I don't know specifically about Steam but I'd be shocked if they aren't even more invested in reputation systems that are built around v4 addresses. Now to be clear, I agree that both of them should do the engineering work to support IPv6 (dual-stack and single), but claiming it's just a matter of adding AAAA records is wrong. reply BlueTemplar 6 hours agoparentprevIt's 2024, you should be blocking GitHub (and, arguably, Steam) anyway. And if the hardware ( / firmware) is so shit that it still doesn't support it, you shouldn't be using it, since it's basically e-waste at this point (and causing more e-waste by the network effect). The issue with trying to run dual-stack is that now you have to learn two kinds of networking, and all the extra complexity (which is actually more than 2x, complexity doesn't scale linearly), which matters since mistakes here can easily become security mistakes. reply yjftsjthsd-h 1 hour agorootparent> And if the hardware ( / firmware) is so shit that it still doesn't support it, you shouldn't be using it, since it's basically e-waste at this point (and causing more e-waste by the network effect).

Little Is Being Done to Curb the Risk. by Sharon Lerner and Al Shaw Dec. 3, 5 a.m. EST by Sharon Lerner and Al Shaw Dec. 3, 5 a.m. EST Share Change Appearance Change Appearance Auto Light Dark Republish ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published. Reporting Highlights An Ever-Present Danger: Formaldehyde is all around us and causes more cancer than any other chemical in the air. It can also trigger asthma, miscarriages and fertility problems. Industry Fights Back: Companies use formaldehyde for everything from making furniture to sterilizing food. Industry has repeatedly thwarted government efforts to limit its health risks. Closer Than Ever: Federal regulators were recently on track to make modest reforms, but those are all but guaranteed to hit a dead end when Donald Trump takes office. These highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story. Read More In a world flush with hazardous air pollutants, there is one that causes far more cancer than any other, one that is so widespread that nobody in the United States is safe from it. It is a chemical so pervasive that a new analysis by ProPublica found it exposes everyone to elevated risks of developing cancer no matter where they live. And perhaps most worrisome, it often poses the greatest risk in the one place people feel safest: inside their homes. As the backbone of American commerce, formaldehyde is a workhorse in major sectors of the economy, preserving bodies in funeral homes, binding particleboards in furniture and serving as a building block in plastic. The risk isn’t just to the workers using it; formaldehyde threatens everyone as it pollutes the air we all breathe and leaks from products long after they enter our homes. It is virtually everywhere. Federal regulators have known for more than four decades that formaldehyde is toxic, but their attempts to limit the chemical have been repeatedly thwarted by the many companies that rely on it. This year, the Biden administration finally appeared to make some progress. The Environmental Protection Agency is expected to take a step later this month toward creating new rules that could restrict formaldehyde. But the agency responsible for protecting the public from the harms of chemicals has significantly underestimated the dangers posed by formaldehyde, a ProPublica investigation has found. Formaldehyde threatens everyone as it pollutes the air we all breathe and leaks from products long after they enter our homes. It is virtually everywhere. The EPA is moving ahead after setting aside some of its own scientists’ conclusions about how likely the chemical is to cause myeloid leukemia, a potentially fatal blood cancer that strikes an estimated 29,000 people in the U.S. each year. The result is that even the EPA’s alarming estimates of cancer risk vastly underestimate — by as much as fourfold — the chances of formaldehyde causing cancer. The agency said it made the decision because its estimate for myeloid leukemia was “too uncertain” to include. The EPA noted that the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, which the agency paid to review its report, agreed with its decision not to include myeloid leukemia in its cancer risk. But four former government scientists with experience doing statistical analyses of health harms told ProPublica that the myeloid leukemia risk calculation was sound. One said the risk was even greater than the agency’s estimate. Jennifer Jinot, one of the EPA scientists who spent years calculating the leukemia risk, said there is always uncertainty around estimates of the health effects of chemicals. The real problem, she said, was cowardice. “In the end, they chickened out,” said Jinot, who retired in 2017 after 26 years working at the EPA. “It was kind of heartbreaking.” The EPA has also retreated from some of its own findings on the other health effects of formaldehyde, which include asthma in both children and adults; other respiratory ailments, including reduced lung function; and reproductive harms, such as miscarriages and fertility problems. In a draft report expected to be finalized this month, the agency identified many instances in which formaldehyde posed a health threat to the public but questioned whether most of those rose to a level the agency needed to address. In response to questions from ProPublica, the EPA wrote in an email that the report was not final and that the agency was in the process of updating it. Even the EPA’s alarming estimates of cancer risk vastly underestimate — by as much as fourfold — the chances of formaldehyde causing cancer. Still, if the past is any guide, even the limited efforts of President Joe Biden’s administration are all but guaranteed to hit a dead end after Donald Trump is inaugurated. And one of the longest-running attempts to restrict a dangerous chemical in American history would be set back yet again. ProPublica reporters have spent months investigating formaldehyde, its sweeping dangers and the government’s long, frustrating battle to curb how much of it we breathe. They have analyzed federal air pollution data from each of the nation’s 5.8 million populated census blocks and done their own testing in homes, cars and neighborhood businesses. They have interviewed more than 50 experts and pored through thousands of pages of scientific studies and EPA records. They’ve also reviewed the actions of the previous Trump administration and what’s been disclosed about the next. The conclusion: The public health risks from formaldehyde are greater and more prevalent than widely understood — and any hope of fully addressing them may well be doomed, at least for the foreseeable future. Since its inception, the EPA has been outgunned by the profitable chemical industry, whose experts create relatively rosy narratives about their products. That battle intensified over the last four years as the EPA tried to evaluate the scope of the public health threat posed by formaldehyde. Regulatory rules put the onus on the government to prove a chemical is harmful rather than on industry to prove its products are safe. Regardless of who is in the White House, the EPA has staff members with deep ties to chemical companies. During some administrations, it is run by industry insiders, who often cycle between jobs in the private sector and the government. If the past is any guide, even the limited efforts of President Joe Biden’s administration are all but guaranteed to hit a dead end after Donald Trump is inaugurated. Trump has already vowed to roll back regulations he views as anti-business — an approach that promises to upend the work of government far beyond formaldehyde protections. Still, this one chemical makes clear the potential human toll of crafting rules to serve commerce rather than public health. And Trump’s last term as president shows how quickly and completely the efforts now underway might be stopped. At the EPA, he appointed a key figure from the chemical industry who had previously defended formaldehyde. The agency then quietly shelved a report on the chemical’s toxicity. It refused to enforce limits on formaldehyde released from wood products until a judge forced its hand. And it was under Trump that the agency first decided not to include its estimate of the risk of developing myeloid leukemia in formaldehyde’s overall cancer risk calculation, weakening the agency’s ability to protect people from the disease. The latest efforts to address formaldehyde pollution are likely to meet a similar fate, according to William Boyd, a professor at UCLA School of Law who specializes in environmental governance. Boyd has described formaldehyde as a sort of poster child for the EPA’s inability to regulate chemicals. Because formaldehyde is key to so many lucrative industrial processes, companies that make and use it have spent lavishly on questioning and delaying government efforts to rein it in. “The Biden administration was finally bringing some closure to that process,” said Boyd. “But we have every reason to suspect that those efforts will now be revised. And it will likely take years for the EPA to do anything on this.” Invisible Threat Perhaps best known for preserving dead frogs in high school biology labs, formaldehyde is as ubiquitous in industry as salt is in cooking. Between 1 billion and 5 billion pounds are manufactured in the U.S. each year, according to EPA data from 2019. Outdoor air is often suffused with formaldehyde gas from cars, smoke, factories, and oil and gas extraction, sometimes at worrying levels that are predicted to worsen with climate change. Much of the formaldehyde outdoors is also spontaneously formed from other pollutants. The public health risks from formaldehyde are greater and more prevalent than widely understood — and any hope of fully addressing them may well be doomed, at least for the foreseeable future. Invisible to the eye, the gas increases the chances of getting cancer — severely in some parts of the country. This year, the EPA released its most sophisticated estimate of the chance of developing cancer as a result of exposure to chemicals in outdoor air in every populated census block across the United States. The agency’s sprawling assessment shows that, among scores of individual air pollutants, formaldehyde poses the greatest cancer risk — by far. But ProPublica’s analysis of that same data showed something far more concerning: It isn’t just that formaldehyde poses the greatest risk. It’s that its risk far exceeds the agency’s own goals, sometimes by significant amounts. ProPublica found that, in every census block, the risk of getting cancer from exposure to formaldehyde in outdoor air over a lifetime is higher than the limit of one incidence of cancer in a million people, the agency’s goal for air pollutants. That risk level means that if a million people in an area are continuously exposed to formaldehyde over 70 years, the chemical would cause at most one case of cancer, on top of those from other risks people already face. According to ProPublica’s analysis of the EPA’s 2020 AirToxScreen data, some 320 million people live in areas of the U.S. where the lifetime cancer risk from outdoor exposure to formaldehyde is 10 times higher than the agency’s ideal. (ProPublica is releasing a lookup tool that allows anyone in the country to understand their outdoor risk from formaldehyde.) Trump has already vowed to roll back regulations he views as anti-business — an approach that promises to upend the work of government far beyond formaldehyde protections. In the Los Angeles/San Bernardino, California, area alone, some 7.2 million people are exposed to formaldehyde at a cancer risk level more than 20 times higher than the EPA’s goal. In an industrial area east of downtown Los Angeles that is home to several warehouses, the lifetime cancer risk from air pollution is 80 times higher, most of it stemming from formaldehyde. Even those alarming figures underestimate the true danger. As the EPA admits, its cancer risk calculation fails to reflect the chances of developing myeloid leukemia. If it had used its own scientists’ calculation — “the best estimate currently available,” according to the agency’s August report — the threat of the chemical would be shown to be far more severe. Instead of causing 20 cancer cases for every million people in the U.S., formaldehyde would be shown to cause approximately 77. Using the higher figure to set regulations of the chemical could eventually help prevent thousands of cases of myeloid leukemia, according to ProPublica’s analysis. As Mary Faltas knows, the diagnosis can upend a life. Faltas, 60, is still sorting through the aftermath of having myeloid leukemia, which she developed in 2019. “It’s like having a storm come through,” she said recently. “It’s gone, but now you’re left with everything else to deal with.” It wasn’t always clear she’d survive. There are two types of myeloid leukemia. Faltas had the more deadly acute form and spent a year and a half undergoing chemotherapy, fighting life-threatening infections and receiving a bone marrow transplant. Too sick to work, she lost her job as a dental assistant. She and her husband were forced to sell their house in Apopka, Florida, and downsize to a small condo — a move that took place when she was too weak to pack a box. Read More Check the Formaldehyde Cancer Risk in Your Neighborhood It’s almost always impossible to pinpoint a single cause for someone’s cancer. But Faltas has spent her entire life in places where the EPA’s data shows there is a cancer risk 30 times the level the agency says it strives to meet. And in that way, she’s typical. Nationwide, that’s the average lifetime cancer risk from air pollution; formaldehyde accounts for most of it. Factor in the EPA’s myeloid leukemia calculation, and Faltas has lived in places where cancer risk from formaldehyde alone is 50 to 70 times the agency’s goal. According to ProPublica’s analysis of the EPA’s 2020 AirToxScreen data, some 320 million people live in areas of the U.S. where the lifetime cancer risk from outdoor exposure to formaldehyde is 10 times higher than the agency’s ideal. Layered on top of the outdoor risk we all face is the much more considerable threat indoors — posed by formaldehyde in furniture, flooring, printer ink and dozens of other products. The typical home has a formaldehyde level more than three times higher than the one the EPA says would protect people against respiratory symptoms. The agency said it came up with its recommended level to protect sensitive subgroups and that the potential for health effects just above it are “unknown.” The EPA’s own calculations show that formaldehyde exposure in those homes would cause as many as 255 cancer cases in every million people exposed over their lifetimes — and that doesn’t reflect the risk of myeloid leukemia. The agency also said “there may not be a feasible way currently to reduce the average indoor level of formaldehyde to a point where there is no or almost no potential risk.” ProPublica will delve more into indoor risks, and how to guard against them, in the coming days. The Long Road to Nowhere The fruitless attempts to limit public exposure to formaldehyde stretch back to the early ’80s, soon after the chemical was shown to cause cancer in rats. The typical home has a formaldehyde level more than three times higher than the one the EPA says would protect people against respiratory symptoms. The EPA planned to take swift action to reduce the risks from formaldehyde, but an appointee of President Ronald Reagan named John Todhunter stopped the effort. He argued that formaldehyde didn’t pose a significant risk to people. A House investigation later revealed he had met with chemical industry representatives, including a lobbyist from the Formaldehyde Institute, just before making his decision. Todhunter denied being influenced but resigned under pressure. In 1991, under President George H.W. Bush, the EPA finally deemed formaldehyde a probable human carcinogen and calculated the likelihood of it causing an extremely rare cancer that affects a part of the throat called the nasopharynx. But it quickly became clear that more protection was needed. A 2003 study showed that factory workers exposed to high levels of formaldehyde were 3 1/2 times more likely to develop myeloid leukemia than workers exposed to low levels of the chemical. “Having human data showing an effect like that … it’s a rare thing,” said Jinot, the former EPA statistician and toxicologist. “You want to seize that opportunity.” She and colleagues at the agency crunched numbers, immersed themselves in the medical literature and consulted with other scientists to conclude that formaldehyde was a known carcinogen and caused myeloid leukemia, among other cancers. But in 2004, their work hit a roadblock. Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., persuaded the EPA to delay the update of its formaldehyde report until the National Cancer Institute released the results of a study that was underway. The harms, meanwhile, continued to mount. In 2006, people who lost their homes in Hurricane Katrina and were housed in government trailers began to report feeling sick. The symptoms, which included breathing difficulties, eye irritation and nosebleeds, were traced to high levels of formaldehyde. In 2006, people who lost their homes in Hurricane Katrina and were housed in government trailers began to report feeling sick. The symptoms, which included breathing difficulties, eye irritation and nosebleeds, were traced to high levels of formaldehyde. In 2009, under the Obama administration, the EPA was once again poised to release its report on the toxicity of formaldehyde. By then, the National Cancer Institute’s study had been published, making the link between formaldehyde and myeloid leukemia even clearer. This time, another U.S. senator intervened. David Vitter, R-La., who had received donations from chemical companies and a formaldehyde lobbyist, held up the confirmation of an EPA nominee. He agreed to approve the nomination in exchange for an additional review of the formaldehyde report by a panel of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. The outside review found “problems with clarity and transparency of the methods” used in the EPA report and recommended that, in its next version, the EPA employ “vigorous editing” and explain its arguments more clearly. But the EPA would not issue that next version for more than a decade. After the outside review, the chemical industry seized on its findings as evidence of fundamental problems at the agency. For years afterward, the EPA’s release of chemical assessments — and its work on the formaldehyde assessment — slowed. “They became completely cowardly,” Jinot said. “They were shell-shocked and retreated.” As the EPA went about revising its report, it fell behind others around the world in recognizing that formaldehyde causes cancer. The World Health Organization’s arm that researches cancer had already concluded in 2006 that the chemical is a carcinogen. Five years later, scientists with the Department of Health and Human Services found that formaldehyde causes cancer, citing studies linking it to myeloid leukemia. Between 2011 and 2017, the Foundation for Chemistry Research and Initiatives, which had been created by an industry trade group, funded 20 studies of the chemical. The research presented formaldehyde as relatively innocuous. The industry trade group still disputes the mainstream science, insisting that “the weight of scientific evidence” shows that formaldehyde does not cause myeloid leukemia. The trade group’s panel on formaldehyde also complained that regulation would be devastating for business. The argument was undercut by one of the few limits the EPA did manage to put in place. In 2016, the EPA issued a rule limiting the release of formaldehyde from certain wood products sold in the U.S. Under Trump, the agency did not implement the rule until a court ordered it to in 2018. The World Health Organization’s arm that researches cancer had already concluded in 2006 that the chemical is a carcinogen. But once the regulation was in effect, many companies complied with it. Necessity bred invention, and furniture and wood products makers found glues and binders with no added formaldehyde. Still, under Trump, the EPA refused to move forward with other efforts that had been underway to tighten regulations of formaldehyde. When he assumed office, the agency was yet again preparing to publish the toxicity report that Jinot had been working on. One of the new Trump appointments to the EPA was David Dunlap, a chemical engineer who, as the director of environmental regulatory affairs for Koch Industries, had tried to persuade the EPA that formaldehyde doesn’t cause leukemia. Koch’s subsidiary, Georgia-Pacific, made formaldehyde and many products that emit it. (Georgia-Pacific has since sold its chemicals business to Bakelite Synthetics.) At the EPA, Dunlap had authority over the division where Jinot and other scientists were working on the toxicity report. Ethics rules require federal employees not to participate in matters affecting former clients for two years. Dunlap complied with the law, recusing himself in 2018 from work on formaldehyde, but only after taking part in internal agency discussions about its health effects. He signed his recusal paperwork the same day the EPA killed the toxicity report. Dunlap did not respond to requests for comment. Imperfect Progress, Inevitable Disruption This August, the Biden EPA finally managed to carry that report across the finish line, getting it reviewed by other agencies and the White House. For the first time, it also set a threshold to protect people from breathing difficulties caused by formaldehyde, such as increased asthma symptoms and reduced lung function. In a draft of another key report on formaldehyde released this year, the EPA found that levels of the chemical were high enough to potentially trigger health problems in dozens of scenarios, including workers using lawn and garden products and consumers who might inhale the chemical as it wafts from cleaners, foam seating and flooring. But the agency is required to address risks only if they are deemed “unreasonable.” For many of those risks, the EPA said it wasn’t certain they were unreasonable. The EPA made the decision after employing a variety of unusual scientific strategies. One involved outdoor air. The EPA first estimated the amount of formaldehyde in the air near some of the country’s biggest polluters. To determine whether those amounts posed an unreasonable risk of harm, the agency compared them to a specific benchmark — the highest concentration of formaldehyde measured by government monitors in outdoor air between 2015 and 2020. EPA records show that peak level was recorded in 2018 in Fontana, California, about 50 miles east of Los Angeles. The EPA concluded the levels near polluting factories would not be unreasonable if they were below this record high, even though local scientists had noted that the Fontana reading didn’t meet their quality control standards, according to documents obtained by ProPublica. Local air quality officials said they didn’t know what caused the temporary spike in the level of formaldehyde near the Fontana monitor. The fact that an air monitor in Fontana once registered a fluke reading that dwarfs the level of formaldehyde in the air near her home is of little comfort to Rocky Rissler. A retired teacher, Rissler shares her home in Weld County, Colorado, with her husband, Rick, two horses, one dog and 12 highland cows; she calls it the “Ain’t Right Ranch” — a name that feels increasingly fitting as the number of oil and gas facilities near her home has ballooned in recent years. The rural area is one of hundreds around the country — many of them in Colorado, New Mexico, North Dakota and West Virginia — where the formaldehyde risk is elevated because of oil and gas production. Gusts of nausea-inducing pollution have become so frequent that Rissler now carries a peppermint spray with her at all times to ease the discomfort. She has frequent headaches, and her asthma has worsened to the point where she’s been hospitalized three times in recent years. During the past four years, no fewer than 75 trade groups have pushed back against the EPA’s findings. Rissler, who is 60 but says she feels “closer to 99,” has also been diagnosed with chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD — conditions that have been linked to formaldehyde exposure. Just walking up the slight hill from her horse barn to her front door can leave her winded. “It feels like a gorilla is sitting on my chest,” she said. And while she used to jog in her youth, “these days, I’m only running if there’s a bear chasing me.” Under Biden, EPA scientists have been sharply divided over how to gauge all the dangers of formaldehyde. Some employees throughout the agency have been working to strengthen the final health assessment expected later this month. But they are fighting against immense outside pressure. During the past four years, no fewer than 75 trade groups have pushed back against the EPA’s findings. Among them are the Fertilizer Institute, the Golf Course Superintendents Association of America, the Toy Association, the National Chicken Council, the Asphalt Roofing Manufacturers Association, the Independent Lubricant Manufacturers Association, the RV Industry Association, the Halogenated Solvents Industry Alliance and the American Chemistry Council, which represents more than 190 companies and led the charge. Meanwhile, scientists with ties to the industry are pushing the EPA to abandon its own toxicity calculations and use theirs instead — a move that could seriously weaken future limits on the chemical. Despite campaign assurances that he wants “really clean water, really clean air,” Trump is expected to eviscerate dozens of environmental protections, including many that limit pollution in water and air. “I’ve seen the industry engage on lots of different risk assessments,” said Tracey Woodruff, a professor and director of the Program on Reproductive Health and the Environment at the University of California, San Francisco. “This one feels next level.” An EPA spokesperson wrote in an email that the agency’s draft risk evaluation of formaldehyde was “based purely on the best available science.” The industry’s fortunes have now shifted with Trump’s election. Despite campaign assurances that he wants “really clean water, really clean air,” Trump is expected to eviscerate dozens of environmental protections, including many that limit pollution in water and air. He will have support from a Republican Congress, where some have long wanted to rewrite environmental laws, including the one regulating chemicals. Trump has already laid out a plan to require federal agencies to cut 10 rules for every one they introduce, a far more aggressive approach than he took during his last time in the White House, when he rolled back more than 100 environmental rules. And his transition team has floated the idea of relocating the EPA headquarters, a move that would surely cause massive reductions in staff. According to regulatory experts consulted by ProPublica, the incoming administration could directly interfere with the ongoing review of formaldehyde in several ways. The EPA could simply change its reports on the chemical’s health effects. “They can just say they’re reopening the risk assessment and take another look at it. There may be some legal hurdles to overcome, but they can certainly try,” said Robert Sussman, an attorney who represents environmental groups and served in the EPA under Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. Project 2025, the conservative playbook organized by the Heritage Foundation, calls for the EPA’s structure and mission to be “greatly circumscribed.” Its chapter on the agency specifically recommends the elimination of the division that evaluated the toxicity of formaldehyde and hundreds of other chemicals over the past three decades. Project 2025 also aims to take away funding for research on the health effects of toxic chemicals and open the EPA to industry-funded science. Trump distanced himself from Project 2025, saying, “I don’t know what the hell it is.” But after the election, some of his surrogates have openly embraced the document, and Trump picked an architect of the conservative plan to fill a key cabinet post. Last month, Trump announced he had chosen former U.S. Rep. Lee Zeldin of New York to head the EPA. Zeldin could not be reached for comment, and the Trump transition team did not respond to questions about formaldehyde. In his announcement, Trump said Zeldin would deliver deregulatory decisions “to unleash the power of American businesses.” “The election of Trump is a dream for people who want to deregulate all chemicals,” said Woodruff, the University of California, San Francisco, professor. “We are going to continue to see people get sick and die from this chemical.” Do You Work for the Federal Government?

But four former government scientists with experience doing statistical analyses of health harms told ProPublica that the myeloid leukemia risk calculation was sound. Sigh. > A 2003 study showed that factory workers exposed to high levels of formaldehyde were 3 1/2 times more likely to develop myeloid leukemia than workers exposed to low levels of the chemical. Well maybe this study they linked to will be a slam dun...Conclusions: Exposure to formaldehyde may cause leukemia, particularly myeloid leukemia, in humans. However, results from other investigations are mixed, suggesting caution in drawing definitive conclusions. Scanning a recent review article seems to say the same thing - epidemiology studies appear mixed. Maybe formaldehyde causes cancer at rates the EPA had previously estimated, maybe it doesn't. I don't know. What I do know is this article is a disappointment. reply tootie 4 hours agoparentI think that's the wrong line of reasoning. Even if the science isn't 100% settled, you're in a scenario where it's possible if not probably that formaldehyde is major carcinogen. Maybe futures studies say it's not quite as bad as they think, maybe it's worse. The question is how much certainty does the EPA need before it takes action? Should they let people continue to breath in toxic chemicals because it's possible they're not as toxic as we think?

Europly at least seems to be formaldehyde free. reply whizzter 9 hours agoparentThere's laws at least in Sweden(and new EU directives incoming that might tighten them up even more) that forbids selling plywood with offgassing higher than a certain level, so it's probably not totally free of it but should be within safe levels. reply kemaru 4 hours agorootparentThe problem with the current EU-wide rating system is that it assumes the interior is ventilated as required by other regulations. Furniture materials are assigned an emission class (E0, E1, E2) based on the steady-state VOC concentration in the test chamber (EN 717-1 and others). Virtually no home manages to hit the minimums for ventilation (25 m³/h per person, IIRC), especially during winter. So even though an E1-class particle board is labeled as safe with regards to VOC emissions, in practice the room will reach far higher pollution levels than that category allows. It also doesn't control for the amount of material present, so you can have a small properly ventilated room covered floor to ceiling with E1 particle board furniture, but achieve E2 or worse VOC levels in the air. Backstory: former employer spent $$ to integrate a VOC sensor into their residential HVAC/HRV solution. The idea was to increase ventilation when odors are present and reduce ventilation when the air was clean again. The engineer prototyped and tested the device in their pre-war home (brick, stone, old wood). All good. They had the first batch manufactured and sent out to customers in brand new homes full of modern materials (engineered wood, vinyl flooring etc).

Ethanol vapors if up close, such as releasing slowly from a foam surface, can cause sinus irritation and a headache. It tells me that I need better ventilation, if only temporarily. The device is a singular combination meter of both TVOC and HCHO. It is widely sold on Amazon. reply wkat4242 4 hours agorootparentOh yeah I know it's meant to detect it, but it makes it harder to notice more dangerous substances because it detects so many.

I assume you don't want to replace it every week. reply hilbert42 7 hours agoprevFirst, I'll preface this comment by saying that I'm neither a toxicologist nor a medical researcher. Moreover, I don't doubt the evidence that formaldehyde is carcinogenic. I'd also add that decades ago before any EPA reports I'd learned in chemistry that formaldehyde was a dangerous substance and not to breathe its fumes. That said, I have not read the EPA reports so the questions I raise here may be superfluous (if so, then the reports deserve a wider audience). Second, there are a number of issues about formaldehyde that are missing from this story that I consider important for the following reasons: (a) What are the tolerable (accepted) levels of formaldehyde that a human can accept without harm? Restated, in a 'pristine' preindustrial era how much formaldehyde would a human experience from external sources, the environment etc., and how do they compare with the levels we experience nowadays? Moreover, do we actually know the typical level of formaldehyde in a 'pristine' environment (given its ubiquity one can imagine small amounts coming from many different sources). (b) Re the 'pristine' environment, does science know if exposure to levels of formaldehyde from external sources is actually toxic? If so, then how would intermittent dosing versus chronic exposure at those levels mitigate matters? (c) The article does not mention that a metabolite of methanol is formaldehyde and that it's a principal cause of methanol's toxicity. Right, just about everyone knows methanol is very dangerous and that very few consume it intentionally (or accidentally) and those who do either end up dead or blind but I raise the matter here because the human body continually produces small amounts of methanol as a result of digestion, ipso facto, so too formaldehyde (which is then further metabolised to formic acid). As with ethanol, the body uses its liver enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) to metabolise methanol, so that would seem to indicate there's a threshold or tolerable level to both of these alcohols which does not cause harm (at least so in most individuals). Question, is this unavoidable internal source of formaldehyde dangerous and is its level in the body known to be carcinogenic or not? Rephrased, is it known if internally-produced formaldehyde does actually cause cancer, if so are some individuals more prone or susceptible to developing cancer from exposure (clearly not eveyone is; alternatively, most don't live long enough to succumb from it alone)? (d) Do we know if the effect of the combined amount of formaldehyde from both external ('pristine') and internal is dangerous of not? (e) If the combined effects (of 'd') are negligible on say all but a small percentage of the population who perhaps is susceptible, then what level of formaldehyde is typically experienced in our modern industrial society? What I'm trying to establish here is how much more formaldehyde does the average person now experience over and above the 'natural' baseline and whether a threshold level exists, and if it does then have we put error bars on those graphs? (f) Additionally, the article does not mention the fact that there are some 'foods' that intrinsically produce formaldehyde as part of their metabolism, for instance the artificial sweetener aspartame (as such it could be avoided). Given say a normal or nominal intake of aspartame how does the level of formaldehyde it produces compare with those levels mentioned above, and are they comparable and or relevant? (Yes, I'm well aware of the long ongoing and painful debate over aspartame and the general consensus that its effects on health are essentially negligible or irrelevant (in that its formaldehyde metabolite is both small in quantity and quickly eliminated from the body). Right, I've driven these points home to the point of tedium because such stories are not very informative, I'd even suggest that they contribute to the public's unease and general disquiet over chemicals, per se. It's all very well for learned papers to appear in the pages of Nature et al but whilst they rightly preach to the cognoscente there's precious little that's pitched between their high level and the unsatisfactory low level of this article. I don't know the answers to the questions I've posed but I'd suggest that if science writers were more precise and if they took the matters I've raised to heart then both the lay public and those in technical fields not directly allied to the subject matter would be much better informed. reply pomian 58 minutes agoparentYour rant was great. It leads one to ponder, among other things - ants. They produce formic acid. Ants like to live under houses, especially in the late summer. How much formaldehyde fumes do they produce? Does it come up the cracks in your foundation? (Formaldehyde is also a preservative - but that's for another day.) reply hilbert42 28 minutes agorootparentI've no idea how much ants produce but your point just adds to the key issue which is that the baseline(s)/thresholds for safety must be determined before substantial progress can be made. For that, let's check the environment humans have evolved in over many millennia. Failing that or if we find there is enough formaldehyde from natural sources to cause harm—or if we find human sources cannot be reduced to safe levels then it seems to me that at some futue time we may have to resort to gene editing to strengthen our species (a bit like vaccination is today). Of course, that approach would also apply to many other harmful chemicals and diseases. Right, for now that's just speculative science fiction but I've little doubt that eventually it'll happen. reply pfdietz 4 hours agoparentprev> Additionally, the article does not mention the fact that there are some 'foods' that intrinsically produce formaldehyde as part of their metabolism, for instance the artificial sweetener aspartame (as such it could be avoided).

I was reading the other day about the influence of hot tea on throat cancers, for example. With that in the background, I'm struggling to distill this article into a \"so what\". The article suggests the EPA limit is one incidence of cancer in a million people per lifetime. If they've underestimated the risk from formaldeyhyde by one or two orders of magnitude I'm still not seeing what the problem here is. Odds of prostate cancer in men is double digits over a lifetime. This seems like something of a non-issue. If anything, if formaldehyde is industrially useful, the EPA is probably doing the right thing bending the rules. We literally don't know how to sustain modern society without some deaths from industrial processes. reply stephen_g 12 hours agoparentThe tea thing seems to be really only for drinking it while it's still extremely hot (over 60° C) and the few studies showing any link are mostly from places where there are many other factors (like high smoking rates, frequent exposure to things like smoke from open fires used for cooking etc.). It's very unlikely that there is almost any real risk from hot tea, as long as you let your tea cool down to a reasonable temperature (especially compared to a risk factor like smoking). reply akira2501 13 hours agoparentprev> We literally don't know how to sustain modern society without some deaths from industrial processes.

The materials used in them certainly contain various low level carcinogens. > And why exactly would that be \"somewhat\" toxic? Is it \"somewhat\" lethal then? Point is it's balancing risks.

I was assuming that was our starting point. The TFA mentions some sources but does not limit exposure to only these indirect sources, nor does the EPA study. > but exposure over a long time does increase cancer risk and fatality risk Which is relative to the actual industry. The plants where formaldehyde is produced is likely highest in danger. It's also somewhere that you can easily see some changes in production process could actually measurably save whole numbers of lives within the next decade. Likewise since it's produced and added intentionally to glues and finishes it's entirely possible it could be eliminated from the supply chain particularly in products that diffuse it out poorly before reaching the customer. Where not possible the products could be held and treated in such a way to extract and filter out the compound. It's just weird to go \"well.. the first world apparently requires human sacrifice\" especially in the face of so many options. Anyways. reply lazide 15 hours agoparentprev [–] One point on this - formaldehyde fumes from furniture will make anyone in the room sick, regardless of any long term cancer. It’s got a distinctive odor, causes lung and eye irritation in any significant quantity, and generally just really sucks to be around long term.

I know multiple people (and have myself experienced this) who've been greeted with warnings and concern from relatives when traveling to major cities... when those cities have violent crime rates far lower than the places they/we live. Like, a fifth as much or lower.

Especially post-9/11 up until COVID it was practically Disneyland. You had little chance of being a victim of random crime in the vast majority of city neighborhoods or on the subway. That's certainly not true anymore. (Caveat: In 2009 I was drive-by shot at on gang initiation night on 96th St & Columbus Ave in Manhattan.

It's not entirely that big US cities are necessarily super-safe (they're largely not, if you compare to international peers) but that lots of non-big-city parts of the US are shockingly dangerous, including many parts that folks don't expect to be. > Where I live now people truly do not lock their doors. Most garage doors in my neighborhood stay open 24/7. Rich suburban and small towns—and I mean where the whole area's kinda rich, not just a few neighborhoods—are in fact the sort of safe that lots of people incorrectly assume all suburbs and small towns are. I know how it is, I (now) live in one of those too, so Manhattan is in-fact more dangerous than where I am (these days). :-) Like, my kid's neurologist lives just up our street and there's a country club every half mile, it seems like. Yeah, this particular place is quite safe. Go figure, if there's vanishingly little poverty around there's also very little violent crime. But lots of US suburbs, rural towns, small suburban towns, and smaller cities are really, really poor and there doesn't (any more?

The rhetorical trick here is the cut-off point. For one thing, you're limiting it to cities in the first place. For another, take a look to see where their cut-off for size of city under consideration is—the higher it is, the more it'll skew toward big names (duh) so they almost always set it pretty high, and the lower you make the cut-off, the farther (most) of those plummet down and off the list as small and mid-sized cities take over. reply busterarm 1 hour agorootparentprevWe're not that rich here.

Yes, crime stats are a mess for a bunch of reasons. The most-reliable are murder stats, because they rarely go unreported or otherwise unnoticed, and are the hardest to \"juke the stats\" on, especially if you try to do it for more than a brief span of time.

I fully expect is that this type of thing is going to start happening more consistently worldwide for heads of these international mega-corps and others in finance. I've been involved in many hot and cold war areas since ~2009. The precursors to coups/insurrections are all present in most \"first world\" nations.

This is where people need to be paying attention, because those groups will form but the question remains - in what form? This isn't fear mongering - it's a look at the 'Order of Battle' from the perspective of identifying what organizations have the ability to: Attack, hold, and maintain political power over large swaths of physical territory. In North America, while a remote possibility, the closest thing I could see to a Taliban/Al-Qaeda like organization taking control, are the transnational cartels.

Why does it matter? reply InsideOutSanta 3 hours agorootparentprevI don't know about the original commenter, but societies only work when the vast majority weigh the cost and benefit they derive from the status quo against the cost and potential benefit they incur by fighting against it, and decide that they're better off playing along. Rightly or wrongly, we now have a situation where a lot of people believe that they no longer benefit from society, and are in fact harmed by it, while they also see a few benefit greatly. I believe this is why many people who understand the implication of that choice would still rather vote for Trump, who promises to break things, than for Harris, who would have only made minor changes. This is not advocacy for anything. I think these people are perhaps not exactly wrong, but they don't correctly estimate the cost of breaking a democratic system, even a poorly working one. reply rthrfrd 2 hours agorootparentYes it's not advocacy for anything: It's up to everyone how they respond to their situation if they feel disenfranchised and I'm in no position to judge them one way or another. The point is just that it's a tale as old as human civilization itself. It would be disappointing if we've not yet learnt enough from our history to avoid more change via trauma. reply AdmiralAsshat 3 hours agorootparentprevThe distinction would be that you can still seek legal redress in court for your spouse committing adultery. It may not be the redress you want, but it would at least get you something, e.g. grounds for divorce. Increasingly, though, people in the United States feel that the rich and powerful have become effectively insulated from the legal system, such that the common person is denied any redress. At that point, one no longer feels any reason to continue working within the legal framework, because it seems clear that the framework is not at all \"equal\" under the law. Hence, when all other options feel exhausted: murder. And, frankly, I imagine this will only continue with time, unless this country decides to actually provide some mechanism to hold people in power accountable. Like, I'm frankly surprised no one has attempted to assassinate members of the SCOTUS yet recently, given that they enjoy a lifetime appointment to make wide-impacting, scrutiny-free decisions. reply oceanplexian 2 hours agorootparent> Increasingly, though, people in the United States feel that the rich and powerful have become effectively insulated from the legal system, such that the common person is denied any redress. They're not insulated from the legal system, the problem is the public is being misled. It works like this: The media lies to the public and tells them that a CEO or Public Figure is getting away with X, so they get some washed up lawyer to do an opinion piece on it, a politician or two co-opts it, and possibly throws in some bait about the working class being screwed over, and then the public buys the made-up story- hook, line and sinker. Since TV Law is not the same thing as real law, the person in question is put through actual due process and the allegation or accusation turns out to be unsubstantiated. The public then feels outrage because \"The man on TV said this person was a criminal and he got away!\". reply fzeroracer 1 hour agorootparentThere are two outcomes here. Either they are insulated from the legal system (and in many cases, they absolutely are by virtue of having enough money to squash and drag out cases into oblivion), or the legal system is deficient. Consider the Yotta/Synapse situation. Many people have lost a huge sum of money and the two companies involved are simply shrugging and saying they have no clue where it went. In many countries, either this problem would've never been allowed to occur in the first place or the government would start jailing people from the top down until someone starts to talk. reply mindslight 2 hours agorootparentprevYou're missing the point. The people running corporations are NOT flagrantly violating the law-as-written, with the courts just refusing to enforce it (for the most part). Rather they bend the law, often through tiny repeated violations of the law-as-written, and also through lobbying/bribing to undermine the creation of directly applicable new laws, to produce abjectly terrible outcomes that end up being de facto legal. So when the average person feels ever-more subject to the law themselves while seeing the terrible corpos continually getting pass after pass, they become ever-less invested in the general idea of the rule of law. reply s1artibartfast 44 minutes agorootparentThere are still the factors of exposure rate and a difference between legal reality and expectations. Fundamental to this is that people are increasingly siloed and have little idea how closely the legal system reflects the will of the majority.

The obvious solution is moving from a fee for service system to a capitated fee per patient on your panel system but congress is broken so we're stuck in our shitty local minima.

Would that even be possible? reply lotsofpulp 2 hours agorootparentprevIt’s not middlemen. The middlemen (managed care organizations, aka health insurance companies) earn low single digit profit margins. In the US healthcare chain, the ranking of profit margins goes (and this is public info from public financials): Pharmaceutical companies Healthcare software companies (based on other software company margins) Healthcare providers (doctor groups) Hospitals (HCA, tenet, etc) Managed care organizations and retail pharmacies at the very bottom. The big one I don’t know is legal, which I assume slots between hospitals and healthcare providers, but could be higher. Those millions and tens of millions of dollar judgments don’t come from thin air. Go ahead and get rid of MCOs, and at best you will reduce costs by 5%. That’s an objective fact. They are just allocating the very limited resources among more and more demand. reply psadauskas 2 hours agorootparentI think you left out several layers. At least one of which in the news lately is the PBM, which sit between hospitals/providers and pharmaceutical companies, and are able to exert monopoly power on that market. They have agreements with hospitals that hospitals are only allowed to purchase through them, and then their suppliers are permitted to purchase exclusive access. This results in things like the saline shortage last year, and pushing small local pharmacies out of business. The PBMs also have incredible profit margins, upwards of 80%. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_2yTvHoGs4 reply lotsofpulp 1 hour agorootparentNot true. PBMs are just departments of MCOs, so they are included in the profit margins of MCOs (at the bottom). >The PBMs also have incredible profit margins, upwards of 80%.

Not only because it's fair but because it's better for everyone. There are many reasons for this including avoiding the alienation of labor and giving people dignity. All it takes is the ultra-wealthy to have slightly less wealth. So why is wealth concentration bad for society apart from that? Because the ultimate form of wealth distribution is war and revolution. It's way the descendants of Rockefeller, the Medicis or Caesar don't own the world. Society eventually snaps and a lot of violence ensues. Eventually you end up with the French Revolution and heads end up on pikes or separated by guillotines. One of the messages of Fight Club is that the rich and powerful cannot insulate themselves from the people they are oppressing. Your gardener, your driver, your chef, your security guard. Any of them is capable of taking matters into their hands and they will only be pushed so far. You saw this play out in Japan with the reaction to Shinzo Abe's assassination a couple of years ago. While world leaders were outraged, the Japanese kinda got it. You can dig deep into this with the Unification Church, its influence on Japanese politics and, if you really want, how the Unification Church is tied to the CIA. United Healthcare is quite literally killing people for profit. Just like the Sacklers and so many others. We've become completely desensitized to this. Private health insurance is completely inefficient (look at how much the US pays per-capita for health care vs any other developed nation and then compare our coverage). We could literally save millions of lives and cut costs by getting rid of these lecherous middlemen. So I don't condone or justify violence like this. It's simply analysis to see that this kind of thing is going to continue to happen as material conditions worsen and wealth inequality rises.

Stephen King to Shut Down His 3 Radio Stations in Maine The author, who owns the small independent stations in Bangor, said that the decision was prompted by a desire to get his business affairs in order. Listen to this article · 4:46 min Learn more Share full article The author Stephen King is shutting down his radio stations in Maine. Credit... Mark Lennihan/Associated Press By Derrick Bryson Taylor Dec. 3, 2024 Stephen King, the horror author whose books have sold hundreds of millions of copies, inspired classic films and disturbed untold nights of sleep, has long played another role closer to his home in Maine: local media magnate. For more than four decades, King, an enthusiastic rock fan, has owned small independent radio stations in Bangor, Maine. It began in 1983 when he bought WLBZ and changed its call letters to WZON, in a nod to his best seller “The Dead Zone.” He added WZLO and WKIT, which bills itself as “Stephen King’s Rock ’n’ Roll Station.” But now King, 77, is getting out of the radio business, having covered steady losses that the stations said had run into millions of dollars over the years. The stations are expected to sign off for the last time on New Year’s Eve and then shut down. “While radio across the country has been overtaken by giant corporate broadcasting groups, I’ve loved being a local, independent owner all these years,” King said in a news release in which he noted that he was in good health but that he had been feeling his age and was trying to “get his business affairs in better order.” “I’ve loved the people who’ve gone to these stations every day and entertained folks, kept the equipment running, and given local advertisers a way to connect with their customers,” he said in the release from the Zone Corporation, his radio company. King said that he and his wife, Tabitha, were proud to have been a part of the business for so long. A representative for King did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Almost nobody likes this development, yet no-one does anything about it. Almost everyone except politicians is critical of big corporations, yet they're ever growing like a tumor, leaving small mom-and-pop businesses by the wayside. In recent years, I'm hearing more and more how we're supposed to shop locally and support regional producers. Yet, I don't see how our government is supporting this call themselves. Without regulation, small businesses will not be able to compete with the giants. reply billy99k 6 hours agoparentMom-and-pop businesses usually have to charge higher prices, because they can't get large volume discounts. Big companies also have the infrastructure to ship things reliably from overseas. When it comes down to it, most people would rather save money and pay less than shop at small businesses. On a note about radio: it's dead. If you want a local radio feel, listen to podcasts. Stephen King most likely is losing advertisers because radio, as a medium, is getting overtaken by podcasts and things like Youtube.

You hit the nail on the head exactly here. People are very good at maximizing their short term situation, even at the detriment to their community. A good example is people who travel to nearby cities to buy things because they have lower taxes. They don't seem to understand that (for the most part), taxes in their own city benefit their city. Taxes they pay to a neighboring city don't benefit them or their neighbors. reply lolinder 5 hours agorootparent> They don't seem to understand that (for the most part), taxes in their own city benefit their city. They usually understand that perfectly well, but understanding that doesn't mean that they should not rationally try to minimize the taxes that they personally pay. The ideal scenario for any individual A is that A pays as little in taxes as possible and all A's neighbors pay as much as necessary to fund the government programs which A benefits from. For A, intentionally shopping locally in order to pay higher but local taxes is against their own rational self interest. Policy shouldn't be designed to only work for the collective good if every individual works against their own self interest—any policy designed that way is doomed to failure from the get go. reply throwway120385 2 hours agorootparentI think the point being made here is not that people should work against their own \"rational self interest\" but that paying taxes in your local community to support infrastructure, policing, education, public services, public health, and so on is actually directly in your own self interest. But people have this idea that taxes benefit nobody so we work scrupulously to avoid them. One of the biggest socialist programs of wealth redistribution in the US is actually our highway and road system, where we pay hundreds of billions of dollars from cities to smaller municipalities and counties to maintain a system of public roadways by which those smaller municipalities can reach larger cities by car. Absolutely nobody complains about that. So clearly paying taxes on that is beneficial. And that suggests that paying taxes on other things is beneficial. reply lolinder 1 hour agorootparent> and so on is actually directly in your own self interest. But people have this idea that taxes benefit nobody so we work scrupulously to avoid them. But my point is that it's not. It's in your interest to have those things but not in your interest to pay for them. Having government programs such as roads is beneficial. Paying for roads out of your own pocket is not. So we should expect to see people dodge taxes wherever it's practical to do so. This has implications for how you design a taxation system. For example, there is an optimal sales tax rate that is neither significantly lower than your neighbors nor significantly higher—one where the inconvenience of shopping somewhere else is higher than the cost of shopping locally. The only way to get around the problem is to make receiving the government services contingent on paying the tax. Vehicle registration fees are a good example, as are property taxes. If roads are paid for out of a tax that you can't avoid paying if you own a car, then using the government-provided infrastructure is contingent on paying for it and it's in your self interest to do so. Sales taxes are particularly problematic in this regard because the people who pay them are often not the people who benefit from the programs paid for. (Though this is less true in small isolated towns than it is in large Metro areas.) reply ensignavenger 4 hours agorootparentprevIf they are regularly spending time in that neighboring community, then the taxes they pay their do benefit them.

The fraction of businesses that are small fluctuates by a couple percent here and there but isn’t on some long term decline. How is it to our long term benefit to continue paying more for goods forever? Maybe we’re just better off in a world where industries that have severe economies of scale like retail get consumed by the big guys so we all save money, and small businesses keep fixing the pipes, designing our graphics, etc. reply CubsFan1060 5 hours agorootparentI can't back this up with data, so this is just my opinion. Economies of scale are better in almost every way, if the benefits of economies of scale are somewhat evenly distributed, and that the benefits don't come with significant negatives somewhere else. However, most of the time, the majority of the benefits of economies of scale tend to go to the wealthy. The small amount of benefits that do go to consumers/people make them think that they are the beneficiaries, and often the societal cost is masked. reply mattmaroon 2 hours agorootparentLots of small businesses exist in areas that do not have economies of scale, and sometimes have diseconomies. Think businesses where labor is the majority of the costs. Your local plumbing company is probably a small to medium business and Roto-Rooter isn’t hurting them. Some have some economies of scale but not severe and service or quality or other things matter and there you usually find big businesses and small competing with each other. (I work in the packaged food world, it falls into this category.) And some, like retail, have such large economies of scale that a small business just can’t really compete. In the case of retail, this is largely because of logistics being such a big portion of cost of goods. reply foxglacier 5 hours agorootparentprevIt should be OK if those big companies are publicly traded and mostly owned by ultimately, lots of individuals, say through retirement funds investing in them? reply ANewFormation 6 hours agorootparentprevI don't think the shipping is about infrastructure, but I don't know what it is. You can get a 40 foot shipping container (~2400 cubic feet) shipped half way around the world for ~$4k, yet try to ship a cubic foot of volume using any normal commercial shipping service, and you'll probably pay $100+. Perhaps I'm missing something, but if not then the shipping market is just completely broken and begging for disruption. reply lolinder 5 hours agorootparentWhat you're describing is the same as in any market—wholesale costs less per unit than retail because there are enormous gains in efficiency for the seller when they don't have to deal with smaller units. In the case of shipping, I'm not an expert but I do know a few of them: * The amount of time per mile a human needs to spend handling that shipping container is lower, because there are only a few very long legs rather than many transfers. * The amount of time per pound of goods a human has to spend handling the shipping container is much lower, because the container is moved all at once, where your cubic-foot package has to be handled individually. * The fuel cost per pound of goods per mile is lower with the shipping container because it is usually transported by boat and train, which are far more efficient than the trucks used in last-mile delivery. reply ANewFormation 36 minutes agorootparentWhat I'm getting at is that baseline costs for a cubic foot are about $1.50. A startup could sell cubic foot containers for $5 - shipped when able to fill a crate, and have a massive margin, for those willing to trade time for a 95% cost reduction. That no such service exists is so weird and dysfunctional. This also applies to endless other real world things and services. Prices for so many things are completely out of touch with reasonably approachable costs, yet there's no Elon in shipping or these zillion other broken industries that, if fixed, could really reshape and perhaps even revitalize the American economy. reply lovich 5 hours agorootparentprevIf you want to move less atoms than the standard(a standardized shipping containers worth), you are going to pay a premium for either the wasted space or for some other agent to figure out how to pack your shit with 100 other small customers and then also unpack that shit at the end and send it to the correct recipients. This is quite literally, one of the benefits people are referencing when doing commerce in large quantities when they mention “economy of scale”.

California has been a blue state since his immigration amnesty, this was not the case before - it was usually solid red. Was Bill Clinton \"right wing\" because of his free trade politics (eg NAFTA)? Contemporary left-wing politics do not look like communist Russia when it comes to the economy. The American use of the term \"liberal\" (or \"liberalism\") is more useful in that regard, and that includes free trade, and also immigration of foreign labor, something that naive observers might categorise as \"neoliberal\" or \"turbo-capitalist\", except that many left-wing governments engaged it in (US, Canada, UK and many more). reply BorgHunter 3 hours agorootparentIt seems to me that your main mistake here is assuming that parties like the US Democratic Party, the UK Labour Party, the Canadian Liberal Party, etc. are left-wing. They aren't. They've been practicing \"Third Way\" politics for decades now, and there's very little left-wing about their proposals. IMO this is the source of a lot of public discontent with these parties: They don't offer a true alternative, just a diet version of the same policies that largely harm the public. > Was Bill Clinton \"right wing\" because of his free trade politics (eg NAFTA)? Yes! This is the point. Who benefited from Clinton's economic policies? It certainly wasn't the employees of the companies who offshored production because they were incentivized to by NAFTA. By capitulating to the right on economic issues and trying to differentiate only on the basis of social issues, the Democratic Party ceded its strongest argument: That turbo-capitalist (as you put it) economic policy only benefits corporations and the wealthy, and harms labor and the country as a whole. Democrats as a party cannot credibly make that argument anymore, because they're fully complicit.

In fact, I wish I could easily mix my music library into my podcast library— specifically, interrupt podcasts with music (maybe replace the ads with a single song). I also like how easy it is to switch channels to something different. I could do that with CarPlay or something too with my own music, but then I probably have to actually think about it (when I should be thinking about driving). And for people who care about live music events (shows etc) it’s a great way to find out about those things, particularly if your city has a good public radio station and not just iHeartMedia. I’m not sure I Love radio, but I would probably really miss it if it wasn’t in my car. reply inferiorhuman 21 hours agorootparentDunno where you are but local radio programming disappeared in most markets years ago. Even in the Bay Area. All of what you've said about radio content was true a decade or more ago, but much less true now. And for people who care about live music events (shows etc) it’s a great way to find out about those things Big stations promote big acts, sure. But that's easy enough to find information on elsewhere (e.g. Youtube). Smaller stations (e.g. KXSF, KPFA, KZSU) out here promote smaller venues but I'm typically out of range and end up listening to their content via the good old internet. I’m not sure I Love radio, but I would probably really miss it if it wasn’t in my car. There was a time I would (late 90s, early 00s) but now? Not so much. The ratio of music to ads has gotten awful. Even stations that have ostensibly gone back to their roots like KITS are a pale imitation of their past glory. Like they'll wear the meat suit of genres that were previously popular but make sure to mix it with plenty of mediocre top 40 and a suffocating amount of ads. reply gazook89 21 hours agorootparentI don’t really listen to radio while traveling so I’ll take your word for it. In Minnesota we gave The Current, part of MPR family of stations which is pretty good from what I hear (about its status nationally, though always some one will say it “used to be better”). And yeah, that’s ONE station. Probably another part of it for me is that most of drives are probably considered short, the longest trip is usually 20-30 minutes depending on traffic and that’s only a few times a month. If I was doing hour long commutes, it’d be podcasts all day. reply HeyLaughingBoy 20 hours agorootparentprevThat \"most markets\" does a lot of heavy lifting. In the MSP area my two main radio stations are both public radio. The state's MPR (Minnesota Public Radio) station and The Current, which is basically what the GP described for the Twin Cities region. I don't know if I'd go so far as to say that I'd miss them if they were gone. OK, I really like listening to Terry Gross and Kai Ryssdal but besides that it's just nice background audio. reply inferiorhuman 19 hours agorootparentA real quick check of \"top radio station owners\" showed that the top ten all picked up more stations going from 2020 to 2021. Yes there are still a ton of small stations doing god knows what (on the order of 10,000 AM+FM commercial), but there's been a ton of consolidation. Your examples of Terry Gross and Kai Ryssdal kinda highlight that. Neither MPR nor WHYY are local for most of their audience (and arguably neither are focused on local content). reply vlowther 21 hours agorootparentprevGive monthly donations to your local NPR affiliate.

SIGN IN SIGN UP Home Porsche Macan News The Porsche Macan Electric Is Being Recalled Because Its Headlights Are Too Bright The fix doesn’t require new parts, thankfully. But you'll still need to schedule a service visit. Photo by: Porsche By: Iulian Dnistran Dec 02, at 8:19am ET Share Comment Porsche is recalling certain Macan Electric models in the United States. The issue lies with the headlamps, which may be too bright. A visit to a Porsche service center will be necessary to fix the problem. The electric Porsche Macan has been on sale in the United States for two months, and now there’s already a recall with its name on it. Thankfully, there’s no need for spare parts and it’s not the kind of recall that deals with flapping body panels. However, despite this being a software-related problem, owners will still need to go to a Porsche service center to get it sorted out. That’s because the headlights are too bright and the headlight control unit software will need to be reprogrammed to comply with federal regulation. And that can't be done via an over-the-air update. As per the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the upper beams on certain Macan Electric models aren’t calibrated properly and may shine too bright, which could reduce visibility for incoming drivers and thus increase the risk of a crash. Due to a software data set error, the affected vehicles were programmed from the factory after the Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) specs, whereas U.S.-spec vehicles need to conform to the requirements of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS).

Cars assembled after November 18 were shipped with the correct headlight software that complies with FMVSS No. 108. The fix for the affected EVs is free of charge. Porsche will notify dealers on December 11, while owners will be notified on January 24, 2025. The Porsche Macan Electric is sold alongside the gas-powered model in the United States. In Europe, however, the combustion-powered version has been retired due to new cybersecurity regulations and not because of tightening emissions regulations. Stateside, the most affordable Macan Electric starts at $75,300, but in traditional Porsche fashion, one could double the price tag relatively easily by going down the (very) long options list.

    "commentBody": "The Porsche Macan EV is being recalled because its headlights are too bright (insideevs.com)126 points by josephcsible 21 hours agohidepastfavorite266 comments crnkofe 8 hours agoPost-Corona cars are all much brighter. Its gotten so bad that I'm frequently left wondering if people are driving with high beams or just regular new-age lights. Got to wait to see if the person on the other side drops the lights to be sure. SUVs in particular are bad especially during acceleration which points the lights higher and on inclined road. I also regularly \"switch\" rear-view mirror to dim mode otherwise I'm literally 3-way blinded also from side mirrors. I didn't do any of these things regularly 5y ago. I'm still wondering if this is just automotive industry incompetence of making safe vehicles or an \"incentive\" to buy a SUV yourself so you don't get blinded all the time. reply ryandrake 3 hours agoparentThere are definitely people who don't care to switch between high and low beams when oncoming traffic appears. I was riding in the passenger seat with an ex-coworker the other night, and I noticed he just kept the high beams on the entire time. After a while I asked him, \"Why don't you turn the headlights down when there's oncoming traffic?\" He looked at me like I just asked the most ridiculous question and said \"What do you mean? The high beams are brighter and make it easier for me to see.\" I reminded him that high beams blind other drivers and he basically said \"Fuck them, I don't care and that's their problem if they don't like it.\" --that seems to be pretty much America's slogan right now. Fuck everyone else, I'm doing what I want. reply locopati 1 hour agorootparentMaybe mention that head on accidents sometimes happen because a driver target fixates on oncoming headlights. I can't imagine that high beams help with that. reply rahimnathwani 3 hours agorootparentprevWow. Since moving to the US and driving here, I've suspected people have this attitude, but this is the first time I've encountered confirmation. reply lovich 6 hours agoparentprevThey might actually have high beams on. I have a 2021 model vehicle and it has an “auto” setting for headlights, where it turns them on or off automatically depending on if it detects a car in front of them. It’s better latency then I have as a human remembering I have them on and turning them off so I use the feature but it’s definitely not instant and I’ve noticed it fail to detect a few times when there’s obstructions over the sensor like snow or rain. I assume this wasn’t unique to my $30k model of car and is a common feature now, so might be the cause of the extra brightness reply xyzzy_plugh 4 hours agorootparentI drove a car with this feature and retroreflective road signs or markers would set it off at night. In the dark of night on a country road, approaching a tight curve and your lights go dim. I've been turning it off ever since. I like the concept but it's one of those things I struggle to see working practically. reply cdaringe 3 hours agorootparentIve a ford maverick (smallest hybrid truck i could get in the states), and was very skeptical of this feature. Im surprised about how correctly responsive it is. I drive something like 60/20/20 suburban/urban/rural. Im always ready to turn it off, for fear of imperfect performance or incorrect toggling, but i cant point to a single instance where it did the wrong thing. It’s a little bit amazing! reply lovich 3 hours agorootparentI think it’s decent in some use cases but it’s not a silver bullet and any lack of maintenance on the sensor equipment used to control it causes bad experiences. As my vehicle ages I might consider turning it off as it gets worse performance but I also live with a few car people who constantly rail against the performance of the feature so I’m primed for this more than the median user reply numpad0 2 hours agoparentprevWould that be, possibly, because: - brighter headlights are falsely perceived to be of better quality, or, - they are but more prevalent because of COVID economic downturn necessitating upsells, or, - 2019 is simply 5 years ago, or, - undocumented neurological long-COVID effect is affecting engineers? reply vladvasiliu 6 hours agoparentprev> SUVs in particular are bad especially during acceleration which points the lights higher Aren't self-leveling headlights standard by now? I think in the EU it was mandatory for Xenon lights, but I don't know whether LED lights are considered differently. My dad's almost 20 yo Citroën had such headlights, even though, thanks to the funky suspension, the car never had dramatic changes in level. reply elric 6 hours agorootparent> Aren't self-leveling headlights standard by now? I don't know, but as a pedestrian & cyclist in the EU, not a day goes by where I don't get blinded by headlights. SUVs are by far the worst offenders, but it's not just SUVs. Most newer cars seem to have the same problem. Heck, many newer bicycles have a headlight that's offensively bright and often seems aimed directly at my face. It's a sad state of affairs. reply karamanolev 5 hours agorootparentprevSelf-leveling usually \"one time\", or \"slowly\", as in changes based on the weight on the rear axle. It doesn't work on the timescale of acceleration, braking, cornering, etc. reply vladvasiliu 3 hours agorootparentActually, it did it \"all the time\". I found out about this while being stuck in traffic, and seeing the lights move slightly up and down while inching forward and stopping. It was visible because it moved in discrete steps, compared to the continuous movement of the car. I hadn't known it was a thing before, and went looking in the owner's manual for confirmation. reply mannykannot 5 hours agorootparentprevThey might be, but that does not help much, as roads are neither level nor pitched at a constant grade. The attribution of the effect to acceleration might (at least in some cases) be a misdiagnosis of a problem actually caused by a slight longitudinal convexity of the road. reply ljf 7 hours agoparentprevHere in the UK I can't say that we have the same issue - BUT we have far fewer SUVs and lights are regulated far more. You'll fail your yearly MOT (car roadworthiness test) if you have lights that are too bright or misaligned, and I have seen people pulled over in London for having non-standard/too bright lights. We have a wattage maximum for headlights too. I am under the impression that roadworthiness test and regulations are very different in the states - is that the case? reply DrBazza 7 hours agorootparentIt certainly seems like headlights are far brighter in the UK right now, given that they're all LEDs. Of course it could just be confirmation bias, as I'm getting older and I suppose my eyes gradually deteriorate. I do a lot of night time driving and oncoming traffic is definitely brighter, for me at least, than 20 years ago. Then there's the fact that old headlights were one bulb, and the mirrored surface behind them was simpler. Another problem is white light is harsh, and the old incandescent bulbs had a yellow/off white tinge which is easier (the redder the light, the less likely it is to destroy your night vision). reply ssl-3 5 hours agorootparentWe're all getting older. But when I'm driving at night and there's a line of cars with sleepy old halogen incandescent headlights in my view, those seem about the same to me as they always did. Some are brighter, some are dimmer -- sometimes due to differences of voltages or aging, or sometimes due to differences in aiming or beam shape -- but they still appear to average about the same as ~all headlights did 20 years ago. Sometimes, they're uncomfortable. They very seldom hurt. I can almost always still see where I'm going without any particular trouble unless they're particularly, acutely bright for whatever reason. Just as before, when my eyes were younger. And unilaterally, they're easier to ignore than when modern bright-white (what are they, 5000k?) LEDs are shining my way. Those are uncomfortable more often than not. They're very often painful. I often can't see where I'm going when they're particularly bad. Same eyes. Same road. Same weather. Same night. Different headlights, different results. reply Hilift 6 hours agorootparentprevYes. The US has excellent national standards (low beams can be 15,000 to 20,000 candela per side), however nearly everything is administered by the states, and only 14 of 50 states have annual safety inspections. It used to be most states, but it was hijacked and used as a racket to steal from customers. Accessory LED lighting (off road) is illegal, but only required to be covered on road in California and Pennsylvania. Additionally, the US also bumper height restrictions that are mostly ignored (except California). Many lifted SUVs and trucks are illegal. That means if your car is t-boned by a lifted SUV you could be struck in the head by the bumper. reply lnsru 6 hours agorootparentThanks for detailed explanation. I wasn’t able to believe in YouTube videos, that many extremely tuned cars were legal in US. In Germany they would be immediately towed away as not roadworthy. The lifted trucks leave me always speechless. Why!?.. reply mannykannot 5 hours agorootparentYou may have noticed that the most fiercely-invoked right in the US these days is the one to be a full-on asshole. reply xtiansimon 5 hours agorootparentprevComic book lives? https://youtu.be/67aLDt1VJZI?t=116&si=5Cxyp-GT_i5DK-no Who is making these cars and mods? reply arethuza 7 hours agorootparentprevI live in a rural area of Scotland and I don't really have a problem with headlights - 99.9% of drivers dip their full beams when they are aware of you. Now if we could only get people to indicate correctly on roundabouts.... - that's a far bigger peeve of mine than headlights! reply trogdor 4 hours agorootparentprev> We have a wattage maximum for headlights too. Are you sure it’s not a luminance maximum? LED lights can be much brighter at the same wattage vs. incandescent lights. reply wrboyce 2 hours agorootparentI was curious about this too so had a look. The brightness is regulated by The Road Vehicle Lighting Regulations 1989 and does specify a minimum wattage in some cases but not for modern cars (“A motor vehicle with four or more wheels first used on or after 1st April 1986: no requirement”). As far as I can tell there are no legal maximums. https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1989/1796/schedule/4 reply echelon_musk 6 hours agorootparentprevWhile this check exists on paper it is not enforced in any meaningful way and hasn't caught up to modern headlights which to me are simply too bright even when original from the factory. If I look directly at any headlight they burn into my vision. It makes driving difficult. reply bsmithers 7 hours agorootparentprevReally? I think we have exactly the same problem in the UK. Granted, my eyes are more susceptible post laser surgery, but headlights are definitely getting brighter and higher as the years go by. reply foobarian 6 hours agoparentprevIt's so bad I am about to go to the optometrist to see if my eyes are just getting old. reply sangnoir 3 hours agorootparentIts not your eyes getting old, it's just that are just more inconsiderate assholes out there now, enabled by newer car models that have a uncomfortably bright high-beams with the worst color temperature for night vision (for both the drivers and their victims). I wonder if Teslas should be recalled too: all of them are seem too bright, particularly Model Ys. reply dig1 5 hours agorootparentprevI have often wondered if my eyes have become more sensitive to car headlights since covid, but it seems I'm not alone in this feeling. I frequently wear glasses with a blue light protective coating while driving on busy roads at night. Interestingly, I find that I don’t need them when the road is empty or when it’s a bright night. reply gooseyman 6 hours agoparentprevI struggle with the exact same issue in a pickup truck. I think people are driving around with their high beams on without knowing it. When I learned how to drive, my mom showed me how the headlights turned on and off. If you didn’t turn them off, the car died. The automation has made light management a very second thought. My friend didn’t know what the blue high beam icon on the dash was. I blame the automatic light feature. reply gortok 7 hours agoprevThe default 'height' of the Tesla Model Y headlights make it appear to be bright lights by default. I live in the DC metro area, and buses (who are typically folks that drive a lot) would constantly flash me to let me know they thought my brights were on. You can go into the car's settings and lower the headlights, but because of where it is by default, it presents a dangerous situation for other cars. How many non-tech folks would know to even search for this option? https://service.tesla.com/docs/Model3/ServiceManual/en-us/GU... reply mbreese 6 hours agoparentI had to do the same with my 3 when I got it years back. Now people also get confused when I have my fog lights on (but that’s rare given how annoying difficult it is to find the setting on a touchscreen while driving). Actually calibrating the lights angle should be done at the factory (or prior to delivery), but mine were definitely too high. But I think in general (and with other cars too), the problem isn’t the brightness of lights, but their angle. Bit even with my lights lowered, if I’m at a stop light that is on a slight hill, that still can cause the angle of my lights to appear to someone on the other side as too bright. reply tradertef 20 hours agoprevThere are too many cars with this problem. Especially high trucks and SUVs whose beams blinds drivers in front of them.. reply Reason077 18 hours agoparentIt's bad with cars but even worse with bikes that have flashing or even strobing lights. Busy cycle lanes in London can be horrible on dark winter evenings with all the LED lights that can be incredibly bright and are very often not installed/adjusted/aimed correctly. I appreciate that cyclists want to make sure they're seen by car drivers, but beaming ultra-bright flashing lights straight into the eyes of oncoming cyclists on a cycle lane surely creates a hazard that outweighs any benefits?! reply thecopy 10 hours agorootparentBlinking lights makes the bicycle driver more visible. When sharing the dark road with cars, this compensates slightly against not being inside a steel cocoon with airbags. If cities actually invested in safe infrastructure the need for such lights would go away. reply jeroenhd 9 hours agorootparentBlinking lights stand out more but also makes it near impossible to accurately judge speed and direction, especially with multiple cyclists on the road. That's why it's illegal to use blinking bike lights* here in the Netherlands. *: technically, you're allowed to use blinking bike lights during the day, but what's the point reply lupire 5 hours agorootparentBlinking lights grab attention. That makes them useful during the day reply TeMPOraL 7 hours agorootparentprev> Blinking lights makes the bicycle driver more visible. [citation needed]. They sure are annoying to look at, but I doubt about the improved visibility. Drivers are used to tracking positions and velocities of steady light sources - like those from cars, traffic lights, barriers, reflected lights, etc. Blinking lights are harder to track and are unusual; they seemingly should draw attention, but other than bicycles, they tend to show up on stuff like ads, Christmas lights, broken light fixtures, etc. - that is, things safe to ignore. reply thecopy 7 hours agorootparentThis is related to inattentional blindness, where car drives dont notice motorbikes since drivers are used to looking for two lights - not one: https://motolight.com/inattentional-blindness/ In the same manner, a single bicycle light might not register as a vehicle in the minds of car drivers. By blinking the light the short-circuit is broken - or so the theory goes. reply lhomdee 6 hours agorootparentCan confirm this anecdotally. When I use my bike light in blinking mode, drivers are more careful around me every time. When I use the non-blinking mode, there have been times when drivers have clearly ignored my presence and I’ve had to wave my hand in front of the light to simulate blinking to get their attention. reply lupire 5 hours agorootparentprev\"ads, Christmas lights, broken light fixtures, etc\" are not safe to crash into reply TeMPOraL 5 hours agorootparentThey are not. They are also not on the road. reply quietbritishjim 9 hours agorootparentprevI actually agree, they work great for drawing attention. The problem is, they're so distracting that they cause other problems. As a cyclist myself, I consider them a lot more selfish than bringing a steel cocoon with airbags with you. Recently I met one of these idiots on a dark cycle path and I veered away from them instinctively (partly because I could see they were present but couldn't judge where they were) and then overcompensated and swerved behind them - very nearly hitting their child on a kid's bike behind! I hadn't seen their child because I was blinded by the adult's light. They probably thought they were keeping their child safe but they were really putting them in danger. reply lupire 5 hours agorootparentInstead of veering repeatedly and blindly in a dangerous situation, consider slowing to a stop like an AI car does. reply haspok 8 hours agorootparentprevBlinking / flashing bike lights were kind of OK when they were in the 10-20 lumen range. But nowadays even the cheap ones are on the order of several hundred lumens, which is a completely different game. It is possible to buy a 1000 lumen light for around 50 EUR (Magicshine), now consider that a single car headlight is around 1500 lumens... These lights have no cutoff beam. The problem is not even cars though, but other cyclists. Even with a cutoff beam it is easy to blind oncoming traffic if the light is not setup correctly. Flashing, it should be illegal. reply blackhaz 9 hours agorootparentprevStroboscopes are creating hazardous situations. Everyone will start escalating their visibility until you can't see shit. Bikers need to wear reflective clothing, especially in London. I fucking hate those dudes all black on a black bicycle at night strobing their way through traffic. reply lupire 5 hours agorootparentIn current year, bicycles should have medium brightness LED rope lights for visibility. reply Angostura 8 hours agorootparentprevThere is quite a lot of discussion about this on the London cycling subreddit. The consensus amongst the cyclists there generally is that flashing front lights are a bad idea. The can be confusing and disorienting and are pretty unpleasant for other oncoming cyclists and pedestrians, not just other car drivers. reply prmoustache 6 hours agorootparentprevactually for drawing attention it is better to have lights mounted at the ankle as the pedaling movement attract attention, makes the cyclist recognizable, all the while without blinking annoyingly. There are also pedals that include front and rear lights. https://redshiftsports.com/collections/arclight-pedals reply Cumpiler69 10 hours agorootparentprev>Blinking lights makes the bicycle driver more visible. Blinking lights are not legal according to road code in Germany and I assume many other EU countries nor do they necessary improve your safety. Yes, strobing lights do draw more attention at a glance (which is why they are reserved for emergency vehicles and signaling an emergency) making you think you'd be safer, but actually not since it makes it very difficult for the human eye to determine the distance to/from that object in motion on the road if it's always blinking, making the use of only strobing lights on the road unsafe and therefore banned for non emergency purposes. That's why your front and tail lights must be in a constant state. It's for your own safety too, hence why emergency vehicles don't strobe their running lights/brake lights but have additional strobes for that. reply kataklasm 10 hours agorootparentI agree with the underlying logic here. However, when street maintenance trucks are driving around normally with their extremely bright orange strobes enabled (mind you, not parked in the street doing repairs, I'd totally understand that! Oftentimes they are just driving normally with the strobes on) I fail to see the logic applied consistently. In my opinion a good compromise for cyclists would be to allow strobing rear lights that only have power cycle of at least 90% and power periods of at least 2500ms, meaning they are on for 2500ms and then off for ~280ms, creating a strobing effect that is not as overpowering as normal strobing rear lights, which I'd agree are overbearing in commute traffic. reply Cumpiler69 10 hours agorootparent>when street maintenance trucks are driving around normally with their extremely bright orange strobes enabled Street maintenance trucks and all such vehicles, at least in Europe, don't strobe their running lights which are constant-ON as on all road vehicles and the strobes are additional warning lights. So they get the best of both worlds. But for cycling, blinking lights are stupid because you're strobing your only running light you need to see and be seen. reply kataklasm 8 hours agorootparentSame thing for bicycles btw. Strobing rear lights are allowed as long as they are on your person (i.e. clothing/helmet or backpack), only on the bike itself they are not permitted. reply mulmen 8 hours agorootparentprevI have both. My bicycle has a headlight and taillight. My helmet has built in front and rear lights, which can flash. reply robertlagrant 1 hour agorootparentFixed mixed with flashing or pulsing is fine. It's the strobing lights that do 5 super-short staccato flashes and then nothing for a moment that are the bad ones. reply KennyBlanken 9 hours agorootparentprevGermany also has the most cyclist deaths of any country in the EU (~450/year), twice as many as the next country. The UK has one quarter the deaths despite having ~3/4 of the population of Germany... reply jeroenhd 9 hours agorootparentBlinking lights are also banned in the Netherlands, which does a lot better in the statistics. Even then, the statistics are kind of useless; here bike deaths are mostly caused by old people on (electric) bikes falling over or getting into minor accidents, nothing to do with lights. The statistics are skewed in ways that cannot be compensated for easily, as on average UK cyclists are younger than Dutch cyclists and therefore less likely to die or get severely hurt in a traffic incident. Great Britain has half the bike usage of Germany. Germany has 36 million bikers (43% of 84 million), Great Brittain about 12 million (19% of 68 million), so the stats line up more than you'd think at a first glance. The difference between Germany and Great Brittain becomes laugably obvious when you look at the statistics for how many people use bikes as a primary transport method (6% GB vs 21% DE). That said, biking outside of large cities in Germany is kind of terrible, so I'm not at all surprised about how deadly cycling in Germany, though that may just be my spoilt Dutch take on things. Edit: my source for these statistics: https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/... reply Cumpiler69 9 hours agorootparentprevSuch statistics without the full context are meaningless. How many people per capita cycle in the UK vs DE. It's expected that if a lot more people cycle, you're gonna have more cycling deaths than in countries where fewer people cycle.

Since then they've slacked the rules by a lot due to the sheer amount of decrepit and new/modern bikes on the road that didn't conform, so now instead of a red rear light and a white section on your rear fender, a shitty 1 euro LED light strapped to the back of your backpack or package carrier is apparently enough.

Hub dynamos are indeed more expensive (around 50€ as a starting price) but since bikes are the primary means of transportation for many people, I think they usually see this as an acceptable price for the convenience it brings (I know I do).

For the past years adaptive headlights could even mean \"smart headlights\" with selective dimming. Does Tesla include these features as well? Anecdotally I can say that what stands out with (some?) Tesla headlights is that they keep the high beams shining for way too long and even the low beams seem to be overly bright.

I wish it would be some kind of oncoming active light dimming / compensation system. I think fancy Mercedes models have very advanced stuff like that. IIRC it's even crazier: in addition to compensate in the mirrors/rear-view mirror, they can also detect where another car or pedestrian is and adapt, constantly, precisely how their own beams are projected as to not blind anyone. EDIT: other manufacturer do it too, it is called \"Matrix headlights\". reply mattlondon 5 hours agorootparentI find these a bit annoying, as I think the side effect is that they are basically main beam all the time otherwise, and only dim selectively. Which is great and all, but means things like they are projecting FRICKIN' LASERS into people's homes (especially when turning) or if you are a pedestrian that it doesn't detect properly (e.g. at some distance down a cluttered urban road etc) you get someone driving at you with really very uncomfortably bright lights shining in your face (I get this a lot when running at night - perhaps the models detect a pedestrian walking but not jogging?). I am sure it works great in controlled conditions (and I have seen YouTube videos out on the clear open road where it detects oncoming vehicles nicely) but it feels pretty ineffective and anti-social in an urban/suburban environment, at least to me. reply TacticalCoder 8 hours agoparentprevI agree. I've got a Porsche Panamera and the headlights are too bright. At times people flash their headlights at me, thinking I've got my high-beams on: I then cannot do much else then quickly flash back the real high-beams to mean \"sorry mate, no, these were the regular beams, THAT is the high-beams so stop flashing at me\". Now even the regular beams they sure do work fine (the car even does fancy stuff as lighting the interior of a turn when you take a sharp turn at night) but honestly I find many cars, including mine, have headlights to bright. Worse: on these new cars with super fancy headlights if I'm not mistaken you cannot even configure where they aim at anymore. It's all automated. It used to be the case on older cars where it was easy to configure and you could aim the regular beam moderately low as to be sure to not annoy anyone. I don't bother flashing at people anymore because I figured out they may simply have a car where the regular beams are simply too bright too. reply marliechiller 6 hours agorootparentJust in case - have you tried directing the beams down a bit? Not sure what the situation is on that model but there is a dial to the right of my wheel (right hand drive) which controls for this. Maybe worth investigating if you have something similar reply vladvasiliu 6 hours agorootparentI think one of the points of these \"smart\" systems is to do the aiming themselves and adjust to the conditions, including the vehicle's load. My dad's 20yo Citroën had self-leveling lights, which weren't user adjustable (at least not in an obvious way). However, even though the lights were relatively bright (Xenon), nobody ever \"complained\" about them, they somehow always found a way to not blind oncoming cars while lighting the road very well. They were fixed pattern, with the high beam on a manual switch, though, so they never tried to guess whether there was someone in the oncoming lane. reply bradleyjg 7 hours agorootparentprevDon’t buy such an antisocial car next time? reply josephcsible 21 hours agoprevThis sentence stood out to me: > Due to a software data set error, the affected vehicles were programmed from the factory after the Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) specs, whereas U.S.-spec vehicles need to conform to the requirements of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS).

This isn’t the only option. Cars being built for pedestrian safety is one piece of that picture. As you note, impact safety falls into this category and provides limited benefits for collisions at speed. There’s a lot more to that story though, as we can see in societies that value pedestrian lives. Automatic braking and avoidance, driver attention monitoring, and speed limiters are all options. Add in safe infrastructure, safety enforcement, etc. There’s a broad range of tools available to reduce pedestrian deaths.

Making pedestrians safer so people can give up their cars is just a bizarre proposal to most Americans.

For what it's worth, I did personally live in a city and had a pedestrian lifestyle for about 15 years.

I doubt any manufacturer would want to limit their European vehicles to the American maximum: > European lighting standards (UNECE) allow over two times the light output from high beam headlight systems as compared to the U.S. (Broertjes, 2018). U.S. compliant systems allow a vehicle maximum of 150,000 candela while European compliant systems allow a vehicle maximum of 430,000 candela (Official Journal of the European Union, 2018).

For example, on what the headlights are illuminating. US headlights shine more light off to the right of the vehicle than EU and I think it is due to the assumption that roadside signs are more often lit via headlights/refection in the US vs sign-mounted lighting in the EU. I think most people agree that EU regulations allow for significantly better headlights than US regulations allow. But those better headlights must be paired with an expensive adaptive system or they become terribly dangerous.

Disappointingly little detail is given on just what the issue is in the linked article... https://www.motor1.com/news/706105/porsche-continuing-gas-ma... reply chrisbrandow 11 hours agoprevI’m so freaking sick of tall cars/trucks with LED beams that are so bright. reply cies 7 hours agoprevIt's a race: brighter lights and tainted glass. Looks really cool. Give privacy to the driver of such vehicle, while allowing them to see the road. Good for them. But other road users: bikes, pedestrians, old car drivers... They suffer. The only way to improve your situation: also buy a new car with bright lights and tainted glass. reply lifestyleguru 6 hours agoparentThe more tinted your windows are the brighter headlights you need, easy! You can also wear sunglasses at all times which allows for even brighter headlights. Absolute pro tip - cover the windows externally with reflective foil to return any light anyone will dare to beam at your car. reply ngcc_hk 8 hours agoprevMy little Toyota did dim the light or just lower the light … and hence it is better. You need the high beam all the time in uk roads as they mostly do not have road lights. But keep in switch on and off in my old cars are hard. But those high beam can kill me one day no doubt. Too many close call and hence the little Toyota i got I feel comfortable to use the high beam all the time. reply mistercheph 11 hours agoprevRegulators asleep at the wheel while drivers and manufacturers are locked in an eye melting arms race to blind everyone else on the road reply surfingdino 11 hours agoprevHow odd. I used to own a car that had an easily accessible setting adjusting lights to the EU or UK settings. Surely they ought to be a similar setting in Porsches? reply arkh 10 hours agoparent> setting adjusting lights to the EU or UK settings Many people on the continent need to learn about this. Lot of them are lighting up the opposite lane like if it was the side of the road instead. reply jeroenhd 9 hours agorootparentI've seen the same thing happen with UK cars here. I don't think most drivers even realise that their headlights aren't uniformly lighting up the road in front of them. IMO places where people switch what side of the road people drive on (ferries, tunnels, etc.) should put up warnings and hand out fines to people with reversed lights. For cars that don't have digitally adjustable lights, I'm sure there will be money making opportunities for garages near these places where the lights can be physically adjusted. reply surfingdino 7 hours agorootparentYou can buy special stickers that modify light beams. Adjusting lights is actually mandatory and not doing so can result in a ticket. My old car had a setting for it in the main menu. I used it every time I was driving to and from France/UK. reply potato3732842 7 hours agoparentprevAny modern car should just be doing that based on GPS since it has the hardware. reply Hamuko 7 hours agoparentprevI don't see why American Porsches would need such an option?

When I do, I drive with my high beams on and sunglasses.
