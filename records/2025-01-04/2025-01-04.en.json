    "originBody": "Together with some friends, I decided earlier this year to particpate in the Carbage run 2025 Winter edition. This is a 6-day journey in winter all the way through Sweden to the polar circle, and back down to Helsinki in a group of roughly 400 cars. One small catch (you might have guessed it from the name): your car has to be “carbage”. In practice, this means it needs to be at least 20 years old, and with a day value of less than €1000. This route, including the drive to get there and back from Belgium would mean driving roughly 6000km in just over a week, often in less-than-ideal conditions. In addition, our car will also be judged on originality, which is why this idea popped into my head: Why not make it self-driving? What?? How is this even possible? For those who don’t know: there is this project named openpilot, developed by comma.ai which adds L2 advanced driver assistance features (fancy words for partially self driving like Tesla’s Autopilot) to over 275+ supported car models such as recent Toyotas, Hondas, Hyundais, VWs, … Hell, there’s even support for Tesla’s Model 3/Y! The key word here is “recent”, which is to say: the cars that are supportable need to have some electronic way of actuating steering, gas and brakes. This is the case in pretty much all modern cars, since stock ADAS features such as lane keeping assists and adaptive cruise control are more and more prevalent. In these cases, the actuators are usually implemented in the form of Electric Power Steering (EPS), electric brake boosters / ABS pumps and electronic engine control units. These then accept (reasonable) actuation commands over CAN-bus messages from a camera module or similar, which then can be intercepted and replaced by more appropriate commands for openpilot. Coincidentally, I’ve been working at comma.ai for about 5 years as a hardware engineer, so I am quite familiar with the inner workings of the whole system. A few years ago, I even gave a talk about controlling cars that goes a bit more in depth. (by the way: we're hiring!) Back to 1993 This is the car we bought, sight-unseen at an online auction: a 1993 Volvo 940 Estate. While the state of the paint wouldn’t suggest it, it was actually in surprisingly good condition for a car over 30 years old. As you can imagine, there are very little electronics in this car: the steering is hydraulic, the accelerator is driven by a cable between the gas pedal and the carburator, and the brake booster is vacuum-based. Let’s go over these one by one and explain on how we can retrofit the needed actuators: Steering motor and sensor Probably the most important actuator needed for staying on the right track (and the one that turned out to be the most complex to adapt mechanically) is for the steering assist. As mentioned, the Volvo is fitted from the factory with a hydraulically powered assist on the steering rack. To be able to put torque on the wheel electronically, the most feasible option we found is to retrofit an electric power steering actuator / ECU from a 2020 Toyota Corolla. In the Corolla, this motor is mounted on the steering column behind the dashboard, and amplifies the measured driver torque to the output shaft. The 2020 Corolla steering rack we got from a junkyard While the full rack looks quite big, most of it is related to the steering wheel adjustment features, which can be removed for our use-case. To fit it behind the dash, we took out the original straight-axle steering column from the Volvo and fit the EPS inbetween: We cut off as much as we could from the Corolla rack and welded the interfacing splines to the top of the original Volvo column (which we also cut in pieces) With the motor now on the column, we added some extra bracing from the original steering frame to the EPS: Except for the motor itself, the Corolla also has an exernal steering angle sensor. While the EPS motor has one built-in, it is only used for precise relative angles needed for the inner control loops. The external angle sensor provides it with an absolute angle measurement (zero degrees while the car is moving in a straight line), which is also needed for openpilot’s car controller code. Machining a bushing to connect the angle sensor to the steering column shaft, and the sensor installed. With both the motor and angle sensors installed in the steering subframe, it can be mounted in the car again. To our surprise, there was enough space under the dash to accomodate all this extra hardware, and no further modifications were necessary to get the dash back in! I’ll dive into the wiring a bit more in an upcoming blog post, but in summary: hooking up the motor and angle sensor electrically is very straight-forward. Since you can download the schematics and connector references from Toyota for a small fee, it was easy to figure out that the steering rack only needs GND, constant 12V (fused at 80A!), a 12V “ignition” signal and CAN to the angle sensor. With just that, the EPS springs to life (likely in limp-mode since it’s missing some Toyota-messages it expects with the current car speed, …) and happily works as if it was in its original car. What about the original hydraulic steering assist? Don’t you have two systems now? Good observation. In short: yes. While you could just disable the hydraulic power assist and just rely on the new electric one, I fear that the steering rack might not be designed to handle the higher amounts of torque it would constantly receive from the EPS during normal driving and might potentially wear out over time. The steering works just fine with both systems active (it made the steering nice and light too!), but it’s not ideal. One downside of having both assists active is that the car doesn’t have enough self-centering torque to backdrive both systems and center the steering wheel when you let go of the wheel in a curve; It just stays where you put it. There might be multiple ways to resolve this, although I have not tried yet. For example, it might be possible to reduce the hydraulic pressure in the system, rendering the original assist less powerful. Brake booster Probably the most effective feature modern cars offer for reducing driver load in long drives is adaptive cruise control. To be able to follow the car in front of you at a safe distance without manual interventions, the car needs to be able to brake automatically. As you can guess by now: this is not something the 30-year-old Volvo was set up to do from the factory. Originally, the car’s brakes rely on a simple vacuum-assist system to amplify the pressure the driver puts on the brake pedal, which in turn pushes on the master cylinder. Diagram of a vacuum-assisted braking system (Image source: Summit Racing) Luckily, modern cars still work in a very similar way. In fact, the system used by Tesla for example is based on the Bosch iBooster, which just replaces the vacuum-assist with a force sensor and an electric motor: Diagram of the Bosch iBooster (Source) Unfortunately, it is well-known that these iBoosters are very useful for EV-conversion projects, since this is a way cleaner setup than having to replace the original engine’s vacuum source to get the original booster to work. It’s also widely known that these iBoosters go into limp mode without CAN connected, and thus can be used (without the controllable features) without having to do any complex work. One of the companies that uses these iBoosters in their conversion projects is EVcreate, located in the Netherlands. They also published multiple awesone blog posts about using the iBoosters, like this one where they show you how to hook it up. Since their wide use, the iBoosters are quite expensive on the second-hand market (especially compared to the rest of the car!). Since this is the case, I made a deal with Lars from EVcreate where he very generously provided me with an iBooster in exchange for the research required to get them controllable over CAN, outside of their Tesla comfy-zone. Lars, if you’re reading this: thanks again! Here comes the part that blew my mind: After removing the vacuum booster from the Volvo, I fully expected to have to design and weld in an adapter plate to fit it in the car. This couldn’t have been less true! The bolt hole pattern and center alignment hole lined up perfectly, and even the push rod built into the iBooster was approximately the right length to connect back up to the pedal. I say approximately, since we did have to add some 2mm washers to the threaded studs of the iBooster to get the push rod to sit fully extended when the pedal isn’t pressed. iBooster installed in the Volvo. Looks almost original! The orignal brake lines weren’t in the right spot due to the master cylinder on the iBooster having the ports on a different side, but after running new copper brake lines to the small distribution-looking block underneath the cylinder, bleeding the brakes and hooking up power, the brakes work normally! One minor complication with this retrofit is that the clutch was also operated hydraulically with brake fluid from the same reservoir, so we had to add an small extra tank (the iBooster master cylinder tank doesn’t have a port for this). Small tank with brake fluid for the clutch Accelerator servo Sometimes you also want to go faster instead of slower! Another thing that Volvo implemented purely mechanically. The accelerator pedal is connected to the carburator air valve by means of a bowden cable This is the only major actuator that I couldn’t easily find a suitable modern automotive solution for. This is mainly because newer cars don’t have carburators anymore, but rather use direct injection and advanced engine control units. Luckily this is also the only actuator that doesn’t come with major safety implications, so let’s just hack something together with off-the-shelf hobby parts! Standard cruise control logic dictates that the driver can override the applied accelerator position by just pressing harder on the accelerator pedal himself. This is easy enough to implement by just having two cables connected to the air valve pulley: the cable that pulls the furthest wins. With this in mind, I bought a (surprisingly strong!) waterproof RC servo from AliExpress, and had my Dad machine a second pulley that mounts onto it. After that it was just a matter of cobbling together a mount for the servo, and adding some bronze guide bushings to constrain the loose cables, and we’re in business! Vroom vroom! Bonus content! While this isn’t an actuator, we also fitted a Tesla Continental radar sensor behind the front grille. While vision-only ACC somewhat works in openpilot, being able to rely on a real radar still makes for a smoother and more consistent experience. Ping Ping! Wow what an amazing blog post!!! When will part 2 come out?? Good question. I’m lazy, so it might take a while. On the other hand, we’ll have tons of time in the car in a few weeks, so maybe then? I think part 2 will be about the wiring and the custom ECU I designed to keep the actuators happy, and to implement things like the cruise control buttons, as well as reading out the speed, blinkers, … After that, I’ll do part 3 explaining (and open sourcing) the code on the ECU and the openpilot port. After that, who knows! What would you like me to talk about more?",

I love the Volvo 940- it stands out as one of the best quality, and best designed cars ever made. It's an incredibly mature design evolved slowly from the Volvo 140 in the 1960s through the 240 in the 70s and the 740 in the 80s, and by the 940 they worked out almost any possible issue. I only wish one could have gotten them with AWD and a fuel efficient diesel (they had the latter but it was not sold here in the USA). The author seems to have a lot of electrical hacking knowledge, but didn't know some car stuff that could have made getting these controls installed much easier: 1) They could have just swapped in a newer BOSCH ABS pump, which can activate the brakes electrically without involving the brake booster. European cars started getting these when they got traction control in the late 90s, but I believe some would be virtually (or maybe even exactly) a direct swap into this vehicle. I was able to do this in a VW with about 10 minutes of work, which uses the same basic ABS systems as Volvo. This is assuming the car already had factory ABS which I think most (but possibly not all) 940s did. 2) They could fix the steering problem by swapping in an entire electric steering rack- they're fairly standard dimension wise, installing a fully manual rack from a Volvo 240, or adding an A/C compressor clutch to the hydraulic power steering pump to disable it above parking speeds (the only time torque would be high anyways). Moreover, these racks are strong enough to simply work with the hydraulic assist removed, because people in the Volvo racing/performance community do it all the time. 3) This car does not have a carburetor- it is electrically fuel injected. You can see the fuel injectors and rail above the throttle body. This could be just a mistranslation if the author is not a native english speaker. However, more importantly there was a factory system on this car to electrically control the throttle for the cruise control. They are missing those parts, but they are cheap and common, and would have just dropped in to a bracket and cam already on his engine. They consist of a vacuum servo on the throttle itself connected to a box that can actuate this with an electrical signal. reply garaetjjte 3 hours agoprev>This is the only major actuator that I couldn’t easily find a suitable modern automotive solution for. This is mainly because newer cars don’t have carburators anymore, but rather use direct injection and advanced engine control units. Actually injection system is largely independent from throttle control. Required amount of fuel is calculated based on manifold air pressure sensor, so there were cars with fuel injection and cable operated throttle plate. I suppose the problem was with plumbing in modern throttle body as carburetor needs to be upstream of throttle plate. reply loeg 3 hours agoparentI'm kind of shocked Volvo was still making carbureted vehicles in 1993. That is very late to still be using carbs. reply UniverseHacker 1 hour agorootparentIt’s not, the author either does not know what they are talking about and/or is mistranslating to English. You can clearly see in the photos that this car has electronic fuel injection, but simply has a physical throttle body- something that most cars still had for about a decade after this vehicle was made. reply throwaway173738 2 hours agorootparentprevIt wasn’t an american car. Did they have OBD I style regulation in Europe? I think that might have been the driver for electronic injection. reply cr125rider 1 hour agorootparentprevMy buddies ‘96 Taurus had a distributor cap. I was floored. reply calvinmorrison 2 hours agoparentprev80's and 90's Euro's were mostly using MAF sensors, a hot wire that detects how much air is passing, not MAP+Temp sensor. That came a little later but all the LH systems at the time had MAF sensors reply robingchan 2 hours agorootparentwould the distinction not be on wether the vehicle is turbocharged? or did they use map/maf regardless? reply calvinmorrison 2 hours agorootparentthe turbos also used the MAF, its on the intake side so theres no pressure. They're not very reliable. It wasnt until I think saab came out with the trionic system that a single computer controlled boost, fuel, and timing all together. Prior to that you had a few independent brains. ECU setting fuel, timing sometimes with an EZK brain, etc. reply brewtide 49 minutes agorootparentYup. T5 used a combination of MAP and temp sensors to do its fuel mappings. The system was able account for fuel quality by adjusting the spark timing and boost amount via controlling a solenoid valve down to whatever the actually physical waste gate spring was set to. The later T7 system involved a MAF sensor behind the intake, while still retaining the temp sensors and MAP but changed the fuel mapping in the system to be a speed - density system for greater control and better boost handling with large temp and altitude changes. (T5 shot for a pressure value t7 shot for a target air mass). There is software called t5suite / t7suite that allowed you to remap everything in the ECU, basically letting you modify the system in every possible way but not making you do all the setup that a complete stand alone unit would make you setup. It was and is, amazing. You could flash an ECU via BDM interface out of car, and in later T7 models actually make real time changes on a laptop that would immediately take effect. Later you could write them to the ECU flash (it requires more than 12v to flash, although some people rigged things up so they could also flash the memory in car). Good times. I still have a t7 Saab on my lawn. My custom tune isn't the best, but it went damn good. Interesting to note, the MAF in the t7 could be placed on the pressure side of the world and it would work perfectly fine minus the fact that they would die a lot quicker due to oils and such on the pressure side of the turbo. People sometimes did this as it was the only way to run a true blow off valve for cool effect. If the MAF is in the stick location and you do not recirculate that air, the car would be fueling for XYZ air density but you'd have dumped some out of the closed system and it ran rich as hell and like crap . reply gunnarmorling 2 hours agoprev> Luckily [the accelerator servo] is also the only actuator that doesn’t come with major safety implications This is giving me chills, what if that RC servo gets \"stuck\" at full throttle? I suppose the assumption is you could hit the clutch, but depending on the specific situation there might not be a lot of time for realizing what's happening and reacting accordingly. reply pavel_lishin 2 hours agoparentWasn't that the supposed cause of all those Toyota crashes a few years back? People claimed the accelerator was stuck on full, and pressing the brakes did nothing, but the actual cause was people panicking and slamming on the accelerator instead of the brakes? reply mdorazio 1 hour agorootparentThat and improperly sized or installed floormats catching the pedals. There are many examples of people hitting the gas instead of brake, freaking out, and hitting it even harder on the IdiotsInCars subreddit. Here's one: https://www.reddit.com/r/IdiotsInCars/comments/xj8540/they_u... reply sgerenser 36 minutes agorootparentAs discussed in that thread, apparently this mostly happens to “2-foot drivers,” people who use one foot for the gas and one for the brakes. When in a state of panic or surprise, they can accidentally mix up which foot they need to stomp down on and end up slamming down the accelerator instead of the brakes. reply dtgriscom 55 minutes agorootparentprevhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_unintended_acceleration reply skykooler 1 hour agoparentprevA car's brakes are required to be able to overpower the engine at full throttle. reply victorbjorklund 9 hours agoprevVery cool. But is this allowed to drive on public roads in Sweden? I would have assumed that swedish laws are very restrictive to these kinds of DIY modifications. Amazing if it is allowed! reply bgnn 8 hours agoparentDefinitely not allowed. The route they are taking requies the car to be road legal. These modifications make it definitely illegal on public roads on Sweden and Finland. It's often not enough to pass MOT (which this car wouldn't in the Netherlands, where it seems to be registered at), you need to get type approval to make it road legal. Dutch government has a nice English page about it: https://www.government.nl/topics/general-periodic-inspection... reply tpm 4 hours agorootparentIndividual approval, not type approval, at least in most of the EU. Type approval is for manufacturers. reply CalRobert 1 hour agorootparentThe same approval used to get thousands of otherwise illegal huge American trucks like Dodge Rams on Dutch roads, incidentally. reply amelius 7 hours agorootparentprevI hope they don't require a crash test ... reply anticensor 7 hours agorootparentIndividual approval does not require destructive crash testing. reply amelius 5 hours agorootparentGreat! :) reply mannykannot 26 minutes agoparentprevI would doubt that one could get it insured for use on public roads. Is having liability insurance a requirement for operation in Sweden and Finland? reply lwde 7 hours agoparentprevThe simpel solution is to register in Poland, at least here in Germany that's the normal way for ICE to EV conversions. reply anticensor 7 hours agorootparentDoesn't Germany have any EV conversion shops that has supplemental type approved kits? reply breckenedge 3 hours agoparentprevIt’s carbage, so if it gets caught, impounded and destroyed, I’m sure that’s all part of the fun of the experience. reply pxmpxm 3 hours agoparentprevAbout no way this is legal. The throttle set up looks dangerous - any issue with the servo and it won't fail-safe to closed throttle like any drive by wire throttle body. reply spamatica 8 hours agoparentprevTo me it sounds extremely unlikely a car with such heavy modifications would be allowed on swedish (or finnish) public roads. Very cool project though! reply sesvsesv 4 hours agoparentprevYou are correct that it probably won't be allowed. But your assumption that Sweden is restrictive isn't. I see that you live in Stockholm, so maybe you already know this, or you haven't spent much time outside the city in recent years. Almost every medium and small city in Sweden now features 16 to 17-year-olds driving old cars electronically or mechanically converted to only run at 30 kph (~20mph) without requiring a proper driver's license, adequate noise reduction, exhaust system and until recently not even winter tires or seatbelt. Making roads slow and dangerous, and the local environment much worse for everyone else. Now I don't expect this to be well-received because of \"cool hack\" but it is truly a major issue. Other issues like the high housing costs, bad healthcare, lacking infrastructure, mediocre education and a short-sighted population are all hard to solve. But this issue is clearly a priority. Swedish voters and politicians are prioritizing this over providing a good quality of life at a decent cost to enable education, research and knowledge based businesses. The result as a whole is that almost anyone who can is moving from these cities to bigger cities that don't have these problems, but are also so expensive that engaging in activates with high growth potential isn't viable. With grassroot hacking, small- and medium-sized business and major growth startup ending up being a fraction of what they have been and even more so should have been now. reply Tempest1981 4 hours agorootparent> features 16 to 17-year-olds driving old cars ... converted to only run at 30 kph I had to search to see what you were referring to: https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20230320-sweden-s-teen... reply sesvsesv 2 hours agorootparentAs I understand it some of the cars are newer cars electrically modified (usually the previous family car, often a station wagon). Those are mostly wasteful by driving at slow speed with only two seats and no storage (which are also rules to be able to convert them). These can be converted back to a normal car when the driver turns 18 and gets a proper driver's license. But it is also possible to disable the electronic limits. Other cars are pemanantly converted much older cars and sold as such. These are the ones that are also bad cars without the regulation affecting a normal car. Edit: Someone infamously converted and registered a heavy truck this way. Legal to drive as a 15-year-old with a moped license. https://www.expressen.se/nyheter/eddie-15-har-en-lastbil-som... reply DrRobinson 3 hours agorootparentprevThis comment seems out of place to me. It brings up (claimed) political issues irrelevant to the topic at hand. The account is recently created and this is the first and only comment/post they've made on this site. reply sesvsesv 2 hours agorootparentCar regulation is relevant to the topic, and so is car regulation of modified cars in Sweden which they are planning to drive through and a statement was made on. I have thought about this. It is something that is discussed a lot in Sweden. But not available outside it as those discussions are in Swedish, and also not held by everyone. I'm interested in quality of life because I spend a lot of time working, organizing thing and doing projects. This is also on topic. But as such I don't have that much time. Or at least not enough to end up getting stuck here instead of doing something more important. I've found that the best to manage that is not to hold a regular account. My first account is however many years older than yours. Sometimes I do have some time or find the motivation to post, because sharing information about something you know about to others who might not know about it but have thought about something I haven't is something that is harder to do anywhere else than on the Internet. In this case how the freedom to tinker with a car can affect the long time viability of creating bigger things. Unfortunately your comment doesn't seems out of place. It's very much part of why I'm not around a lot. It simply isn't worth posting anything when I have something better to do. (Which isn't really now since I'm on a train to Stockholm with little else to do considering the holidays). reply sakjur 1 hour agorootparentprevThe political issues are all somewhat valid, but like most political issues rather more complicated (and also more debated) than described. I’m not sure whether the commenter speaks Swedish or not, their username seems to suggest they do (sv_SE is the language code for the Swedish [country] dialect of Swedish [lang]) but their comment reflects a phenomenon I’ve both experienced and witnessed: Swedes are more likely to discuss policy issues in Swedish (and all of these issues are debated back and forth with varying degrees of success). Our grasp of English is mostly contextual since it’s a secondary and utilitarian language for us. I think it’s easy and natural for an English-speaker to mistake hitting language barriers as ignorance. That can extend into the ESL-speaker [English as a Secondary Language] feeling belittled, and eventually you get this effect of people just avoiding English because you associate it with feeling stupid. We get the French-waiter-that-clearly-speaks-English-but-refuses-to trope. On the other side of that fence we have ESLs butting in on domestic affairs in English-speaking countries because we happen to speak the language. That makes us appear elitist and judgmental, too. Apologies for deviating further from the topic. Going back to the legality of the car: It’s complicated. The police claims it’s illegal to use autopilot on their website, but there’s a blurry line between adaptive cruise control/lane assist and autopilot. The competition requires cars to be insured, hopefully that insurance company is aware of the modifications and can advise the owners on what they can and cannot do. https://polisen.se/aktuellt/nyheter/ost/2024/mars/autopilot/ [swedish] More practically, if they use country roads and drive somewhat near the speed limits, they’re not likely to run afoul of the law unless they’re in an accident. If the author is here, I’d urge them to remember that a moose is practically designed to bypass a car’s safety features and kill you. There are a quarter of a million of them in Sweden. Invest in good tires and headlights, drive carefully, and avoid hitting wildlife or reindeer. reply CalRobert 1 hour agorootparentprevHow does it make the roads more dangerous? reply sesvsesv 1 hour agorootparentDisregarding just being teenagers (using their phones, doing burnouts), not having a proper driver's license (usually a 20+ lesson affair in Sweden) and driving old cars without safety systems; driving at less than half the speed of regular traffic in a smaller city or a more rural area means a lot of dangerous overtaking as the standard road is one lane in each direction (especially where the terrain doesn't allow for much more) and these cars are not allowed on highways. Since you are allowed to choose high school in Sweden, some choose one further away and driving. Making such roads congested. reply CalRobert 28 minutes agorootparentI was thinking it’d be similar to tractors, which I’m guessing are already legal (but maybe I’m wrong!) reply sakjur 58 minutes agorootparentprevThey tend to lead to more unsafe overtakings since getting stuck behind one is stressful, they’re driven by young people who have a license to drive a moped and haven’t gone through the ice-driving classes a regular Swedish driver’s license includes, and the cars are often older inherently unsafer car models lacking proper maintenance. And a chunk of people driving them violate the framework and drive extra passengers, bypass the speed limiter, and drink and drive. reply kristjank 6 hours agoparentprevMost countries in the EU are pretty fascist concerning vehicle modifications.

There is a huge market for classic cars. Ever heard of Concours? Most of that crowd like to keep them stock, but there are tons of sub-genres like drift kids and Stance nation to name a few weird ones. Hotrodding is alive and well. There are car shows in most major us cities featuring hundreds of tricked out, restored and modified cars. The classic car market regularly appreciates. Just try to find an Alpha for a good price, or graph the price of a 1970 911 over the past 30 years. Also you can insure a classic for cheap since they see less road time, are garaged and generally well cared for. (see Hagerty) As for getting hotrods and restored classics on the road. California has half a dozen classic car rallies where roadworthy classics get out on the road for a couple days. I assure you the culture is alive and well. reply mp05 2 hours agorootparentA \"hot rod\" need not be a \"classic car\" and I'm sure that most Europeans don't know nor care about the nuance that we understand as Americans. They mean \"that 5.0 Mustang doing burnouts at 2am\" not a '32 Ford coupe. reply mp05 2 hours agorootparentprevFWIW I haven't heard the word \"hot rod\" in a long time, so that could be some indicator. It's not to say that \"nice cars\" are disappearing though. When I was a literal child in rural Appalachia, the standard fare Dream Car was a Dodge Viper or a Corvette and I did indeed admire those cars. But tastes certainly change as you get older and while I still have a \"nice car\", it's of a different breed than the All-American Dream Car. I'd dare say that demographic died off and hasn't been replaced due to cultural and economic shifts.

Moments before the crash only a tiny piece was left connected and therefore the car didn't respond in the bend.\" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Ayrton_Senna And the forces on a formula 1 steering column are also higher than on a road car, I imagine.

    "title": "VoxelSpace: Terrain rendering algorithm in less than 20 lines of code (2020)",
    "originLink": "https://github.com/s-macke/VoxelSpace",
    "originBody": "Voxel Space Web Demo of the Voxel Space Engine History Let us go back to the year 1992. The CPUs were 1000 times slower than today and the acceleration via a GPU was unknown or unaffordable. 3D games were calculated exclusively on the CPU and the rendering engine rendered filled polygons with a single color. Game Gunship 2000 published by MicroProse in 1991 It was during that year NovaLogic published the game Comanche. Game Comanche published by NovaLogic in 1992 The graphics were breathtaking for the time being and in my opinion 3 years ahead of its time. You see many more details such as textures on mountains and valleys, and for the first time a neat shading and even shadows. Sure, it's pixelated, but all games in those years were pixelated. Render algorithm Comanche uses a technique called Voxel Space, which is based on the same ideas like ray casting. Hence the Voxel Space engine is a 2.5D engine, it doesn't have all the levels of freedom that a regular 3D engine offers. Height map and color map The easiest way to represent a terrain is through a height map and color map. For the game Comanche a 1024 * 1024 one byte height map and a 1024 * 1024 one byte color map is used which you can download on this site. These maps are periodic: Such maps limit the terrain to \"one height per position on the map\" - Complex geometries such as buildings or trees are not possible to represent. However, a great advantage of the colormap is, that it already contains the shading and shadows. The Voxel Space engine just takes the color and doesn't have to compute illumination during the render process. Basic algorithm For a 3D engine the rendering algorithm is amazingly simple. The Voxel Space engine rasters the height and color map and draws vertical lines. The following figure demonstrate this technique. Clear Screen. To guarantee occlusion start from the back and render to the front. This is called painter algorithm. Determine the line on the map, which corresponds to the same optical distance from the observer. Consider the field of view and the perspective projection (Objects are smaller farther away) Raster the line so that it matches the number of columns of the screen. Retrieve the height and color from the 2D maps corresponding of the segment of the line. Perform the perspective projection for the height coordinate. Draw a vertical line with the corresponding color with the height retrieved from the perspective projection. The core algorithm contains in its simplest form only a few lines of code (python syntax): def Render(p, height, horizon, scale_height, distance, screen_width, screen_height): # Draw from back to the front (high z coordinate to low z coordinate) for z in range(distance, 1, -1): # Find line on map. This calculation corresponds to a field of view of 90° pleft = Point(-z + p.x, -z + p.y) pright = Point( z + p.x, -z + p.y) # segment the line dx = (pright.x - pleft.x) / screen_width # Raster line and draw a vertical line for each segment for i in range(0, screen_width): height_on_screen = (height - heightmap[pleft.x, pleft.y]) / z * scale_height. + horizon DrawVerticalLine(i, height_on_screen, screen_height, colormap[pleft.x, pleft.y]) pleft.x += dx # Call the render function with the camera parameters: # position, height, horizon line position, # scaling factor for the height, the largest distance, # screen width and the screen height parameter Render( Point(0, 0), 50, 120, 120, 300, 800, 600 ) Add rotation With the algorithm above we can only view to the north. A different angle needs a few more lines of code to rotate the coordinates. def Render(p, phi, height, horizon, scale_height, distance, screen_width, screen_height): # precalculate viewing angle parameters var sinphi = math.sin(phi); var cosphi = math.cos(phi); # Draw from back to the front (high z coordinate to low z coordinate) for z in range(distance, 1, -1): # Find line on map. This calculation corresponds to a field of view of 90° pleft = Point( (-cosphi*z - sinphi*z) + p.x, ( sinphi*z - cosphi*z) + p.y) pright = Point( ( cosphi*z - sinphi*z) + p.x, (-sinphi*z - cosphi*z) + p.y) # segment the line dx = (pright.x - pleft.x) / screen_width dy = (pright.y - pleft.y) / screen_width # Raster line and draw a vertical line for each segment for i in range(0, screen_width): height_on_screen = (height - heightmap[pleft.x, pleft.y]) / z * scale_height. + horizon DrawVerticalLine(i, height_on_screen, screen_height, colormap[pleft.x, pleft.y]) pleft.x += dx pleft.y += dy # Call the render function with the camera parameters: # position, viewing angle, height, horizon line position, # scaling factor for the height, the largest distance, # screen width and the screen height parameter Render( Point(0, 0), 0, 50, 120, 120, 300, 800, 600 ) More performance There are of course a lot of tricks to achieve higher performance. Instead of drawing from back to the front we can draw from front to back. The advantage is, the we don't have to draw lines to the bottom of the screen every time because of occlusion. However, to guarantee occlusion we need an additional y-buffer. For every column, the highest y position is stored. Because we are drawing from the front to back, the visible part of the next line can only be larger then the highest line previously drawn. Level of Detail. Render more details in front but less details far away. def Render(p, phi, height, horizon, scale_height, distance, screen_width, screen_height): # precalculate viewing angle parameters var sinphi = math.sin(phi); var cosphi = math.cos(phi); # initialize visibility array. Y position for each column on screen ybuffer = np.zeros(screen_width) for i in range(0, screen_width): ybuffer[i] = screen_height # Draw from front to the back (low z coordinate to high z coordinate) dz = 1. z = 1. while z < distance # Find line on map. This calculation corresponds to a field of view of 90° pleft = Point( (-cosphi*z - sinphi*z) + p.x, ( sinphi*z - cosphi*z) + p.y) pright = Point( ( cosphi*z - sinphi*z) + p.x, (-sinphi*z - cosphi*z) + p.y) # segment the line dx = (pright.x - pleft.x) / screen_width dy = (pright.y - pleft.y) / screen_width # Raster line and draw a vertical line for each segment for i in range(0, screen_width): height_on_screen = (height - heightmap[pleft.x, pleft.y]) / z * scale_height. + horizon DrawVerticalLine(i, height_on_screen, ybuffer[i], colormap[pleft.x, pleft.y]) if height_on_screen < ybuffer[i]: ybuffer[i] = height_on_screen pleft.x += dx pleft.y += dy # Go to next line and increase step size when you are far away z += dz dz += 0.2 # Call the render function with the camera parameters: # position, viewing angle, height, horizon line position, # scaling factor for the height, the largest distance, # screen width and the screen height parameter Render( Point(0, 0), 0, 50, 120, 120, 300, 800, 600 ) Links Web Project demo page Voxel terrain engine - an introduction Personal website Maps color, height color, height color, height color, height color, height color, height color, height color, height color, height color, height color, height color, height color, height color, height color, height color, height color, height color, height color, height color, height color, height color, height color, height color, height color, height color, height color, height color, height color, height color, height License The software part of the repository is under the MIT license.

I miss the era when novel and elegant algorithms like this delivered magical experiences. This could just be from getting old, but I feel like games have lost the magic they had when availability of hardware resources was limited. Back in the 80s, 90s and early 2000s we saw games push the medium forward practically every year, and certainly every generation. Developers squeezed all the performance they could from the hardware, using novel techniques and pure wizardry. Hardware advancements certainly helped, but it was never in abundance as it is today, so developers couldn't get complacent. Necessity is indeed the mother of invention. These days I find fantasy platforms like the PICO-8 much more interesting than the latest rehashed release from any AAA studio. I don't understand how games that are essentially asset flips can be so successful year after year. reply GuB-42 16 hours agoparentThere is still a lot of wizardry going on in modern AAA video games. In fact, the video game industry is one of the few that actually care about performance, often more than safety and correctness. It is just that it is much more complex and much less obvious. Before, an advance could going from flat triangles to textures, using a clever maths trick. Now an advance is better shading in the corners of a room, using a clever maths trick. The difference is that people will be able to tell immediately how an improvement the textures are, but unless they are in the field, they won't be able to point out the shadows in the corner of the room. These shadows are not useless though, it adds up to better graphics overall, but it is not as impressive. About the AAA gaming industry, the thing is that this is big business, these games are awfully expensive, financed by investors who want to see a return on their investment. Usually, it means that they study the market, see what sell, and do something along these lines. Not very original, but less risky. The indie game industry is the opposite. There are thousands of studios, they can't beat AAA on content and polish, and they need to come out of the pack, so they need something else, like original ideas. But overcoming technical limitations is usually not the driving force anymore, as there are not that many limitations anymore. In fact, they usually underperform compared to AAA productions because it would be unaffordable otherwise. I don't know much about the PICO-8 scene, how much of it is about overcoming the (artificial) technical limitations and how much is about using the platform \"as intended\" and focus on gameplay. reply Llamamoe 6 hours agorootparent> In fact, the video game industry is one of the few that actually care about performance, often more than safety and correctness. If it does, then it doesn't show. It feels as though most major game engines have completely given up on performance-as-a-default in favour of simplifying (sometimes marginally) art workflows, and the frame rendering breakdown articles/videos I consume now and then entail baffling, utterly ridiculous and unnecessary drawcall counts, unoptimized geometry, poorly optimized shaders that give marginal graphical improvements, huge overdraw, etc. It's gotten bad enough that resolution upscaling is becoming commonplace because of how ridiculous the per-fragment rendering costs are getting. That has no right to happen in games without high-fidelity subsurface scattering, volumetric effects, indirect lighting, raytraced reflections, etc. And yet it does. This is something nobody resorted to even in the 90s. I recommend videos from the YT channel Threat Interactive, where they break down a lot of the horrifying rendering performance regressions that have become the norm in recent times. reply sigmoid10 3 hours agorootparentOptimization happens elsewhere these days. Modern GPUs easily chug tons of triangles as long as they are not smaller than a single pixel. That's why stuff like Nanite is possible, where you auto-compute LOD geometry to roughly pixel-level polygon resolution and it will actually be faster than traditional LODs if you have tons of meshes in your view frustum. If you want to see some really fancy modern optimizations, look for example at how Guerilla implemented 3d volumetric clouds in Horizon. Using some clever tricks, they got the render cost down from 20ms to 2ms, thus making it possible to run on a base PS4. reply HappMacDonald 16 hours agorootparentprevI would say a little of both. Some of the most important bottlenecks a new game dev will encounter is \"number of colors, screen resolution, sound properties\" etc. The CPU speed is also limited but it's a different kind of challenge to try to make a game be so complicated that there's enough math to even do to challenge the available CPU allocation given how few permutations of screen space are available to try to alter. Depending on your game, RAM limitation and program space limitation might also come into play. But the artificial limitations are only one element to why the platform is popular, the other element is the tooling. Much like using Unity, Unreal, Roblox, etc you have loads of primitives and coding features (and music and SFX creation suites) at your fingertips built right into the platform, and how the limitations help here is to cap how subtle and complicated a person's goals are liable to be in order to help refocus the developer's attention back onto the gameplay loop. reply d3VwsX 8 hours agorootparentThe java 4k contest was fun (make a java applet game that is at most a 4096 bytes JAR, including all assets the game needs). Unfortunately I only discovered it shortly before it shut down (when no browsers supported java applets anymore). I did enter one year and it was not by coincidence that was the only time in 40 years of hobby-gamedev that I shared a game I made with people online. It was a lot of fun to try to squeeze a game into 4 kB but I can definitely also admit that part of it was being able to use the extreme limit as an excuse for making things simpler and not have to worry about the game being ugly or not having sounds or not having a title screen and all the other 90% of stuff that would have been expected to turn it into a complete game. I play around a bit with TIC-80. Some say it is just an open source PICO-8 and I guess it is to some extent. I paid for both but I have not spent as much time with PICO-8. I like that TIC-80 supports quite many different programming languages, but maybe PICO-8 does as well these days? There is no super obvious reason to use one or the other, so I go with the one with free source code. Real retro gamedev is tempting, but it is difficult to find a real console that were heavily restricted while also being convenient to develop for. The fantasy consoles cheat a bit in being restricted like some early 1980's hardware while running code like some 2010's game engine. It's like the best of both worlds, but also a bit boring compared to writing something actually limited to what some old console could do. reply circuit10 16 hours agoparentprevI was using this algorithm to make a 3D Mario Kart for my calculator (which can usually barely handle 2D graphics sometimes) which was pretty fun but I never finished This was one of the prototypes: https://youtu.be/9Z8Bm8ZmWKI reply HappMacDonald 16 hours agorootparentOooh, looks like Raycasting. :) reply circuit10 16 hours agoparentprevI was using this algorithm to make a 3D Mario Kart for my calculator (which can usually barely handle 2D graphics sometimes) which was pretty fun but I never finished This was one of the prototypes: https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/953383695908216843/... reply rossant 10 hours agorootparentThat's so cool!

In the Atari 2600 and NES days there were hardly any sources which reported on the quality of games. You basically had to decide based on box art or word of mouth. The result were cheap movie tie-ins or the like. Later there were a lot of specialized game review magazines, though it wasn't easy to get hold of a review for a non-current game if you didn't have past magazine issues laying around. Then there was the Internet with increasingly many free reviews, especially once online advertising took off and game magazines moved to the Web, and finally we got accessible average user ratings from Steam or Metacritic. If a game is bad today, everyone will know it. There are no bad movie tie-ins anymore. Games are at most bland, similar to an action movie sequel, or exploitative, by using addicting game mechanics. But they are rarely bad in the old sense.

I agree, but that's not what I'm saying. I was referring to cookie cutter games released by Ubisoft, the CoD franchise, and most sports games. They essentially use the same formula, sometimes even the same engine, year after year, and just upgrade the assets, and do some minor tweaks. Yet these releases are incredibly popular and people keep buying them every year. Similarly for lazy \"remasters\" for games released not even a decade ago. Now with AI upscaling it's even easier to just increase the texture resolution and charge half or even full price for it. It's practically a scam. > I do know that a lot of the games that I really enjoy are not technologically \"pushing the envelope\" at all: caves of qud, cube chaos, kenshi, rift wizard, just to name a few. Sure, and I enjoy many of those as well. A game doesn't have to be technically impressive to be enjoyable. But IMO these don't have the \"magic\"/\"wow\" factor that was so common back in the 90s. If you played Doom or Mario 64 when they were released, you were _mesmerized_ by what you were seeing. Yes, these were great games, but the technical wizardry was what made them stand out from everything else. The jump from 2D to 3D and hardware accelerated graphics certainly played a role in that, but it was also due to very clever algorithms than ran on the same hardware as other games that weren't as impressive. Today VR can arguably deliver that \"wow\" factor, but that's mostly due to the technology rather than the games themselves. Even nearly a decade into the modern VR wave, there are only a handful of games that deliver an experience close to what many games in the 90s did. I can basically think of only one example of a modern game that delivered that same feeling: Breath of the Wild. We were used to open world games, we were used to Zelda games, but we hadn't seen such design ingenuity and technical polish, especially on a handheld system. Tears of the Kingdom is arguably a better game, but it didn't deliver that same experience for me. reply idiotsecant 18 hours agoparentprevThis is mostly rose colored 1/4\" thick welding goggles, I think.

It's why for display pretty much every modern voxel engine processes the sparse voxel world into a dense surface list - which then maps (reasonably) well to triangles. I'd argue this difficulty in parallelization is a bigger hurdle than \"just\" engineering effort. Much of the way a GPU functions isn't because we decided we loved triangles, but we found things that parallelize well and worked backwards. And then on modern GPUs don't actually devote that much area to dealing with \"triangles\" - so little is gained that it's often not worth redesigning to remove that capability from data centre \"GPUs\" that will never see a single triangle in their lives. reply xyzsparetimexyz 16 hours agorootparent>The issue with voxels is sparseness - to have any hope of storing a world in the ram we have available it pretty much needs to have some variable length encoding, which makes it extremely difficult to use in a parallel manner as required by hardware.

    "originBody": "/ notes / projects / about 🖍 5 ways to draw an outline Different techniques for rendering outlines in Unity. 21 minute read Jump to heading # Introduction Rendering outlines is a technique that is often used in games either for aesthetic reasons or for supporting gameplay by using it for highlights and selections around an object. For example in the game Sable, outlines are used to create a comic-book-like style. In The Last of Us, outlines are used to highlight enemies when the player goes into stealth mode. Sable. The Last of Us. In this post, I will discuss 5 techniques for rendering an outline around an object. 🖍 Interested in an outline rendering toolkit for Unity? 3 years after making this post I made Linework! Jump to heading # Rim Effects Jump to heading ## Technique One of the most basic outline effects can be achieved by using a so called fresnel effect which can be used to render an outline on the rim/edge of an object. The fresnel effect describes the reflection/transmission of light when falling onto a transparent surface. However, when using it for rendering outlines, this physical meaning of the effect is not important. The following formula is used to form the outline. 𝑂 𝑢 𝑡 = 𝑝 𝑜 𝑤 ( ( 1.0 − 𝑠 𝑎 𝑡 𝑢 𝑟 𝑎 𝑡 𝑒 ( 𝑑 𝑜 𝑡 ( 𝑁 , 𝑉 ) ) ) , 𝑃 ) Out=pow((1.0−saturate(dot(N,V))),P) The formula takes the dot product between the normalized normal vector 𝑁 N and the normalized view direction 𝑉 V. Then, this gets exponentiated with a power 𝑃 P. It is important to note that this is only an approximation of the fresnel effect, but it works well for our outlines. When putting this fresnel-based outline on a sphere, you see that when we approach the grazing angle (the edge/rim of the object), the effect gets stronger. Jump to heading ## Implementation For this approach, the objects that need to have an outline get rendered using a custom shader. This shader implements the fresnel effect and allows us to set the width, power, softness and color of the outline. float edge1 = 1 - _OutlineWidth; float edge2 = edge1 + _OutlineSoftness; float fresnel = pow(1.0 - saturate(dot(normalWS, viewWS)), _OutlinePower); return lerp(1, smoothstep(edge1, edge2, fresnel), step(0, edge1)) * _OutlineColor; The technique produces an outline that is always an inner line and is not visible outside of the object and so maybe shouldn't even be called an outline. By controlling the width, power and softness of the outline, it is possible to create hard lines or a more soft/glowy effect. Characteristic for this approach is that it works well for objects like spheres and capsules with smooth and round edges, but it breaks down for objects like cubes or more complex models that have sharp edges. For a cube for example, the outline will look really bad and not even resemble an outline. For a more complex model, you will have the issue of getting lots of uneven line widths, although the overall outline effect can look alright. 💬 Rim effect outlines are simple but only work well on spherical objects. Jump to heading # Vertex Extrusion Jump to heading ## Technique The second technique uses a re-rendered/duplicate version of the original object/mesh to form the outline. This duplicate object gets shown behind the original object and its vertices get extruded in order to make the duplicate object larger than the original one. The duplicate object is usually just rendered with a flat color. Jump to heading ## Extrusion direction In order to make the duplicate mesh larger, we need to change the positions of its vertices. We will be moving the vertices a certain distance along a certain direction. The first step is to pick this direction. 1. Vertex position The first method to enlarge the mesh is to simply scale it up. This is done by moving each vertex position along the vertex position. This may sound weird but the vertex position in local space, can be seen as a vector between the center of the object and the vertex position itself and so we can move the original vertex position along that vector. For the distance, we use a width parameter. // Move vertex along vertex position in object space. positionOS += positionOS * width; Doing this just kind of inflates the mesh. For a sphere, all of the vertices have the same distance from the center point of the object and so they all get moved an equal amount. However, for other objects, these distances may vary and so vertices that are distanced further away from the center of the object, will get moved more. To fix this, you can normalize the vector along which the movement occurs. // Move vertex along normalized vertex position in object space. positionOS += normalize(positionOS) * width; The result is that now all the vertices get moved an equal distance in object space, usually resulting in an outline that looks more equal-width. However, due to working in object space, the outline still isn't a perfect equal-width outline. We will address this later. 2. Normal vector A second method is to move the vertices along their normal vector. // Move vertex along normal vector in object space. positionOS += normalOS * width; The result is a pretty nice-looking outline for objects with smooth corners such as spheres and capsules. We're still working in object space so again, the outline isn't a perfect equal-width outline. For objects with sharper corners such as cubes, you will get visible gaps in the outline. Any model with sharp angles will have these kind of artifacts. This can be resolved by using custom-authored normals, addressed in the next method. 3. Vertex color A third method is to move the vertices along their vertex color. The logic behind this is that you can generate custom normals and store those in the vertex color channels of the mesh. For example you could bake spherical (smooth) normals into vertex colors and use those for a cube mesh. // Move vertex along normal vector in object space. positionOS += vertexColor * width; You can see the the outline around the cube looks much better when using custom normals. This method can avoid artifacts with models that have sharp edges but the big downside is the manual setup involved since you need to generate custom normals for your mesh, although this process can be automated using a script that bakes the normals. Jump to heading ## Extrusion space Once we have decided the direction along which we want to move the vertices, we need to choose in which coordinate space this extrusion should happen. During the vertex stage of our shader, the coordinates of the vertices start out being defined in object space and end up being transformed to clip space. This is done by applying the MVP (model/view/projection) matrix. Throughout the whole rendering pipeline, the coordinates of the vertices go through these spaces. 1. 📦 object/model/local space 2. 🌍 world space 3. 📷 camera/eye/view space 4. ✂ (homogeneous) clip space 5. 🖥 screen space 6. 🖼 viewport/window space The significance of these coordinate spaces for our outlines will be explained below. Object space The first method is to translate the vertices in object space. // Move vertex along vertex position in object space. IN.positionOS.xyz += IN.positionOS.xyz * width; There are 2 big issues with doing the outline in object space. This is because when working in object space, the MVP transformations are yet to be applied. These transformations will alter the shape of the outline, distorting it in the process. The issues are as follows: Scaling of the outline -> when going from object space to world space (applying model matrix M) Foreshortening -> due to the perspective divide happening when going from clip space to screen space Another consideration is that when translating the vertices in object space, this is done in a 3D space. This means that some translations will be done directly towards or away from the camera, not contributing to the apparent-width of the outline. Instead of using object-space units, it might be better to be able to control the outline width in terms of screen-space pixels. Clip space A second method is to perform the translations of the vertices in clip space. // Transform vertex from object space to clip space. OUT.positionHCS = TransformObjectToHClip(IN.positionOS.xyz); // Transform normal vector from object space to clip space. float3 normalHCS = mul((float3x3)UNITY_MATRIX_VP, mul((float3x3)UNITY_MATRIX_M, IN.normalOS)); // Move vertex along normal vector in clip space. OUT.positionHCS.xy += normalize(normalHCS.xy) / _ScreenParams.xy * OUT.positionHCS.w * width * 2; As a first step, the vertex position and normal vector are both transformed from object space to clip space. As a second step, the vertex gets translated along its normal vector. Since we are working in a 2D space now, only the x and y coordinates of the vertex positions get altered. The offset gets divided by the width and height of the screen to account for the aspect ratio of the screen. Then, the offset gets multiplied by the w component of the clip space vertex position. This is done because in the next stage, the clip space coordinates will be converted to screen space coordinates with a so-called perspective divide which will divide the clip space x/y/z coordinates by the clip space w coordinate. Since we want to end up with the same outline after this transformation to screen space, we pre-multiply by this clip space w coordinate so that the perspective divide will have no net effect on the outline. Finally, the offset gets multiplied by our desired outline width and a factor 2 so that a width unit 1 will correspond with exactly 1 pixel on the screen. Phew! I recommend reading this post on creating an outline in clip space. Having something explained in different ways is always useful. The result of this whole process is a very clean outline. Since we're working in clip space, the outline is equal-width, extending the same amount (visually) around the object. Still, (if not using custom-authored normals) the method has issues with meshes that have sharp-corners, resulting in gaps in the outline. This will be apparent in meshes that are more complex. Also, if the normals of the mesh are not set up correctly and some of them are facing the wrong way, the vertices of the outline will be moved in the opposite direction, resulting in gaps in the outline. This method being dependent on the normal vectors of the mesh is the most important downside. This is visible for the mesh in the image below. Jump to heading ## Masking The duplicate mesh should be rendered so that only the outline sticking out is visible. The most common solution for this is to cull the front-facing geometry of the duplicated mesh, using the backfaces of the geometry to form the outline. A depth test of less than or equal to is used to make sure the backfaces only show up where the outlines should go. Another option is to use a stencil mask to prevent the duplicate mesh from showing up in front of the original mesh. When using this stencil mask method, no culling is needed. One side-effect is that there will be absolutely no inner lines on the inside of the object and if two objects overlap, the outline will also only be visible around those 2 objects. 💬 Vertex extrusion outlines are simple and look good when done in clip space. There are issues with sharp corners but these can be mitigated by using custom normals, which do require some extra setup. Jump to heading # Blurred Buffer Jump to heading ## Technique A third method to render an outline is by using something that I call a blurred buffer. For this technique, the silhouette of an object gets rendered to a buffer. This silhouette buffer is then blurred which expands the silhouette which is then used to render the outline. Jump to heading ## 1. Silhouette Buffer The first step of this technique is creating the silhouette buffer. For this, each object gets rendered to a texture using a shader that outputs a plain color. You can use the color white for all silhouettes, allowing you to choose a single color for all outlines at the end by multiplying with the desired outline color. Alternatively, you can render each object silhouette with a specific color if you want each object to have a different colored outline. Jump to heading ## 2. Blur Pass The blur pass is used for expanding the silhouette buffer. This is usually done using a box blur or gaussian blur. To improve performance, the silhouette buffer can be scaled down before blurring. This is advantageous because blur passes can be expensive, having to process multiple pixels per pixel since they work by taking a (weighted) average of the pixels surrounding a given pixel. Additionally, the blur pass should be done in 2 passes. This brings down the complexity of the algorithm from 𝑂 ( 𝑁 2 ) O(N2) to 𝑂 ( 2 𝑁 ) O(2N). This can be done if the used blur algorithm is a so-called separable filter which is the case both for a box blur and a gaussian blur. When doing the blur in 2 passes, the pixels get first blurred vertically, and then the vertically-blurred buffer gets blurred horizontally resulting in the final blur. Vertical blur. Horizontal blur. A simple seperable box blur can be implemented by taking the non-weighted average around a given pixel. For a gaussian blur, the used kernel will be a gaussian kernel so that the weighted-average will be taken. // Vertical box blur. half4 sum = 0; int samples = 2 * _KernelSize + 1; for (float y = 0; y < samples; y++) { float2 offset = float2(0, y - _KernelSize); sum += SAMPLE_TEXTURE2D(_MainTex, sampler_MainTex, IN.uv + offset * _MainTex_TexelSize.xy); } return sum / samples; // Horizontal box blur. half4 sum = 0; int samples = 2 * _KernelSize + 1; for (float x = 0; x < samples; x++) { float2 offset = float2(x - _KernelSize, 0); sum += SAMPLE_TEXTURE2D(_MainTex, sampler_MainTex, IN.uv + offset * _MainTex_TexelSize.xy); } return sum / samples; The outline width is controlled by the _KernelSize parameter of the blur shader. Jump to heading ## 3. Outline Pass After the blur pass, the blurred silhouette gets combined with the original scene to form the outline. Using a blurred buffer is great for having soft or glowing outlines, but the buffer can also be stepped to render a hard outline. Jump to heading ## Masking Just like for the vertex extrusion method, a stencil mask can be used to make sure the outline only gets rendered behind the geometry. 💬 Blurred buffer outlines are great for soft and glowy outlines but can have a bigger impact on performance compared to other methods. Jump to heading # Jump Flood Algorithm The fourth method is to use the Jump Flood algorithm to render outlines. The main advantage of this technique is that it can render really wide outlines, at a very reasonable performance cost. I won't go into details at this time since the technique has a good explanation in this article from Ben Golus. 💬 Jump flood outlines are a great option when you need performant, wide outlines. Jump to heading # Edge Detection Jump to heading ## Technique A fifth method is to use an edge-detection pass for rendering outlines. This full-screen pass draws lines by detecting discontinuities in the scene and rendering an outline between areas that have a large enough discontinuity between them. Discontinuities can be detected between the depth buffer value, the normal vector, the albedo color or any other data that is made available. Jump to heading ## Detection of discontinuity Roberts cross Detecting discontinuities can be done by using an edge detection operator such as the Roberts cross operator. This operator works as a differential operator by calculating the sum of the squares of the differences between diagonal pixels resulting in a cross-like pattern. In practice, edge detection operators can be applied by convolving the original image with kernels. There are 2 kernels, one for the x direction and one for the y direction. For Roberts cross, the diagonal pixels get sampled and convolved with these kernels. The kernels have a size of 2 𝑥 2 2x2. static const int RobertsCrossX[4] = { 1, 0, 0, -1 }; static const int RobertsCrossY[4] = { 0, 1, -1, 0 }; These kernels can then be used as follows. horizontal += samples[0] * RobertsCrossX[0]; // top left (factor +1) horizontal += samples[3] * RobertsCrossX[3]; // bottom right (factor -1) vertical += samples[2] * RobertsCrossY[2]; // bottom left (factor -1) vertical += samples[1] * RobertsCrossY[1]; // top right (factor +1) edge = sqrt(dot(horizontal, horizontal) + dot(vertical, vertical)); Roberts cross is a very simple operator but can already give nice results. The operator only needs 4 samples around a given pixel. Sobel operator Another method is to use a Sobel operator. Again, 2 kernels are used but this time the kernels have a size of 3 𝑥 3 3x3. static const int SobelX[9] = { 1, 0, -1, 2, 0, -2, 1, 0, -1 }; static const int SobelY[9] = { 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, -1, -2, -1 }; This time, 9 samples are used around a given pixel. The Sobel kernels can be used like this. horizontal += samples[0] * SobelX[0]; // top left (factor +1) horizontal += samples[2] * SobelX[2]; // top right (factor -1) horizontal += samples[3] * SobelX[3]; // center left (factor +2) horizontal += samples[4] * SobelX[4]; // center right (factor -2) horizontal += samples[5] * SobelX[5]; // bottom left (factor +1) horizontal += samples[7] * SobelX[7]; // bottom right (factor -1) vertical += samples[0] * SobelY[0]; // top left (factor +1) vertical += samples[1] * SobelY[1]; // top center (factor +2) vertical += samples[2] * SobelY[2]; // top right (factor +1) vertical += samples[5] * SobelY[5]; // bottom left (factor -1) vertical += samples[6] * SobelY[6]; // bottom center (factor -2) vertical += samples[7] * SobelY[7]; // bottom right (factor -1) edge = sqrt(dot(horizontal, horizontal) + dot(vertical, vertical)); You can read this blog post on Sobel filters if you want to learn more about how Sobel filters work. Jump to heading ## Sources of discontinuity A common approach is to look for discontinuities in the textures that the render pipeline generates for the scene such as the depth texture, normals texture and color texture. During the edge-detection pass, these textures are sampled and discontinuities are detected using the edge detection operators mentioned earlier. The resulting edge that is drawn can be caused by any discontinuity that was found in one of the 3 buffers. With this technique, the outline gets applied to all the objects that write to these buffers and so you have less control over the outlines on a per-object basis. In the image below, edge contributions by depth/normals/color are represented by the color red/green/blue respectively. Allowing discontinuities to be detected from different sources makes for a more robust outlining system. In the debug image above you can see that while some edges would be detected by all three discontinuity sources, a lot of them only get picked up from a contribution of a specific discontinuity source. Each discontinuity source can be given a different weight and different thresholds can be used for each of them, allowing you to control the visual of the outline. Jump to heading ## Edge detection modulation Usually, just using an edge detection operator on the discontinuity source buffers is not enough to get a result without artifacts. Some modulation has to be done to get rid of these artifacts. For example, since the depth buffer is implemented non-linearly in a lot of render pipelines, two objects 1m apart located close to the camera will have a larger depth difference than two objects 1m apart located far away from the camera. To accommodate for this, the threshold used for detecting discontinuities in depth can be modulated by the depth buffer itself so that geometry located close to the camera will need to have a larger discontinuity in depth value before being detected as an edge. depthThreshold *= _DepthDistanceModulation * SampleSceneDepth(uv); A second common artifact is unwanted edges showing up on objects at small grazing angles. To resolve this, you can modulate with a mask that is generated from the dot product between the normal vector 𝑁 N and the view direction 𝑉 V. This is the same fresnel mask that was used in the initial outlining technique using a rim effect. float fresnel = pow(1.0 - saturate(dot(normalWS, viewWS)), _Power); float grazingAngleMask = saturate((fresnel + _GrazingAngleMaskPower - 1) / _GrazingAngleMaskPower); depthThreshold *= 1 + smoothstep(0, 1 - _GrazingAngleMaskHardness, grazingAngleMask); Other modulation techniques can be used, depending on the visual fidelity you want to achieve but these depend on the specific effect that you're after. Jump to heading ## Custom discontinuity source It is also possible to provide the outline shader with a custom discontinuity source. This would be a render texture that you create yourself during the render process, containing custom data that you wish to use to generate outlines. The advantage is that since you control what writes to this custom buffer, you can control which objects receive an outline. For example in the scene above, the discontinuity source is generated by rendering the vertex colors of a mesh to a texture. Other techniques that come to mind are coloring faces based on their world position or creating a custom buffer that combines both information from the depth buffer and the normals buffer. 💡 Want more info?

So fascinating! Thanks for indirectly leading me to this! I love thinking about all the various approaches available at the pixel/texel/etc level! It's also another case where it's a very clever way of generating a type of SDF (Signed Distance Field) that is doing a lot of the heavy-lifting. Such a killer result here as well! Any-width-outline-you-like in linear time?!! Amazing when compared to the cost of the brute-force ones at huge widths! I wholeheartedly endorse SDFs, whether they are 'vector' ones, function-based, like Inigo Quilez's amazing work, Or 'raster' ones like in the article, texel-or-voxel-based. Houdini supports raster-SDFs very well I think, has a solid, mature set of SDF-tools worth checking out (there's a free version if you don't have a lic)! And of course there's all the many other places SDFs are used!! So useful! Definitely worth raising-awareness of I reckon! reply johndough 3 hours agoparentNote that the 'Jump Flood Algorithm' is O(N log N) where N is the number of pixels. There is a better O(N) algorithm which can be parallelized over the number of rows/columns of an image: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36809404 Unfortunately, it requires random access writes (compute shaders) if you want to run it on the GPU.

SDFs are very powerful! reply fleabitdev 6 hours agoprevOne day, I'd love to dive into stylised 3D graphics as an R&D project. There's been decent progress recently, but I think there's a lot of low-hanging fruit left to pick. Some open questions: - How do you reduce the detail of a toon-rendered 3D model as the camera zooms out? How do you seamlessly transition between its more-stylised and less-stylised appearance? - Hand-drawn 2D animations often have watercolour backgrounds. Can we convincingly render 3D scenery as a watercolour painting? How can we smoothly animate things like brush-strokes and paper texture in screen space? - How should a stylised 3D game portray smoke, flames, trees, grass, mud, rainfall, fur, water...? - Hand-drawn 2D animations (and some recent 3D animations) can be physically incorrect: the artist may subtly reshape the \"model\" to make it look better from the current camera angle. In a game with a freely-moving camera, could we automate that? - When dealing with a stylised 3D renderer, what would the ideal \"mesh editor\" and \"scenery editor\" programs look like? Do those assets need to have a physically-correct 3D surface and 3D armature, or could they be defined in a more vague, abstract way? - Would it be possible to render retro pixel art from a simple 3D model? If so, could we use this to make a procedurally-generated 2D game? - Could we use stylisation to make a 3D game world feel more physically correct? For example, when two meshes accidentally intersect, could we make that intersection less obvious to the viewer? There are probably enough questions there to fill ten careers, but I suppose that's a good thing! reply Jare 1 hour agoparent> Would it be possible to render retro pixel art from a simple 3D model? Not exactly retro pixel art, or maybe it is since it's been 25 years (omfg) but in Commandos 2+ we had 3d models for the characters, vehicles, etc which we rendered at runtime to a 2d sprite which we then mixed with the rest of the pre-rendered 2d sprites and backgrounds. reply rng_civ 5 hours agoparentprev> Hand-drawn 2D animations often have watercolour backgrounds. Can we convincingly render 3D scenery as a watercolour painting? How can we smoothly animate things like brush-strokes and paper texture in screen space? There are various techniques to do this. The most prominent one IMO is from the folks at Blender [0] using geometry nodes. A Kuwahara filter is also \"good enough\" for most people. > When dealing with a stylised 3D renderer, what would the ideal \"mesh editor\" and \"scenery editor\" programs look like? Do those assets need to have a physically-correct 3D surface and 3D armature, or could they be defined in a more vague, abstract way? Haven't used anything else but Blender + Rigify + shape keys + some driver magic is more than sufficient for my needs. Texturing in Blender is annoying but tolerable as a hobbyist. For more NPR control, maybe DillonGoo Studio's fork would be better [1] > Would it be possible to render retro pixel art from a simple 3D model? If so, could we use this to make a procedurally-generated 2D game? I've done it before by rending my animations/models at a low resolution and calling it a day. Results are decent but takes some trial and error. IIRC, some folks have put in more legwork with fancy post-processing to eliminate things like pixel flickering but can't find any links right now.

It's similar to the one described as \"Blurred Buffer\", except that instead of doing a blur pass, I'm exploiting the borders created by the antialiasing (I think via multi sampling, or maybe texture filtering). I draw the object in plain opaque white on a transparent black background, and in the fragment shader I filter what does not have a fully opaque or transparent alpha channel (according to some hardcoded threshold). It gives decent enough results, it's cheap performance-wise and is very simple to implement. reply eknkc 2 hours agoparentWouldn’t that cause aliasing if you set those pixels to a solid color? Or do you keep the alpha and set a color so the outline is faint but not aliased? reply Seb-C 1 hour agorootparentI'm reusing the alpha channel indeed. And I reverse it for the innermost side of the border. const float MIN_ALPHA_THRESHOLD = 0.3; const float MAX_ALPHA_THRESHOLD = 0.7; [...] if (fragmentColor.aMAX_ALPHA_THRESHOLD) { // Inner edge of the border float outputAlpha = 1 - ((fragmentColor.a - MAX_ALPHA_THRESHOLD) / (1 - MAX_ALPHA_THRESHOLD)); outputColor = vColor * outputAlpha; } else { // \"Inside\" of the border outputColor = vColor; } So if the border goes like transparent->opaque, I divide it into segments using a threshold (transparent->min_threshold->max_threshold->opaque) and change the alpha values: - Smoothen out the transparent->min_threshold segment, so that it goes linearly from a=0 to a=1 - make opaque (a=1) the min_threshold->max_threshold segment - Revert and smoothen out the max_threshold->opaque segment so that it goes linearly from a=1 to a=0 reply alcover 8 hours agoprevThat is excellent and the result can be very pleasing as this render in the article : https://ameye.dev/notes/rendering-outlines/edge-detection/co...

I remember at the time there was a lot of PR around this being the first game to introduce that effect and how the developers basically invented it. I can’t comment on whether that was actually true or just PR BS, but it was definitely the first time I experienced it as a gamer. reply mewse 5 hours agoparentI suspect a lot of people 'invented' the effect at approximately the same time. Honestly, the Dreamcast was the first piece of hardware really capable of doing the effect to a high level of quality in real-time. I developed the cel shading effect for the Dreamcast game 'Looney Tunes: Space Race' (developed by Infogrames Melbourne House) literally during the first week we had access to a Dreamcast development kit. Infogrames Sheffield (devs of Wacky Racers) were shown an early version of our implementation, and added the similar effect to their game. It looked great, but went into their game pretty late in production, so the game hadn't really been optimised for it the way that ours was. And the folks behind Jet Grind Radio came up with the effect on their own as well, and beat both of us to market. They were using exactly the same algorithm, but were using it in a very different way; they were fully embracing and leaning into the uneven, wide and jagged outlines, where Sheffield and we were fighting against them and trying to match a more uniform and traditional art style. And then only about a year later, somebody seemed to have figured out how to make the edge-detection cel shading approach work in real-time on Xbox, for the game \"Dragons Lair 3D\". I had done a test implementation of that approach on the Dreamcast, but it wasn't nearly performant enough for us to run it on multiple characters at once while playing a game too! Not sure whether it was due to the Xbox being more powerful or them just having a smarter algorithm than mine, but you can't argue with their results! If you're making a game that you want to look like an actual hand-drawn cartoon, that is still absolutely the best quality way to do it, IMHO. Someday I'll find an excuse to try my hand at implementing one of those again. Performance shouldn't be a problem at all any more, I imagine! reply hnlmorg 4 hours agorootparentThanks for sharing that. It was a great read. reply cubefox 7 hours agoparentprevApparently it released simultaneously with the (more famous) Jet Set Radio, also for Dreamcast, which had similar effects. Quite the coincidence. reply evanmoran 5 hours agorootparentNot quite as much of a coincidence as you might think. Many of these algorithms come from graphics researchers presenting at SIGGRAPH (https://www.siggraph.org, the leading conference). So if so if Jet Set Radio was released June 2000, you can look for related papers a couple years before to see if new techniques were appearing. And, in fact, they were!

There actually are various recent hobbyists who have achieved these effects even on an N64 due to the quite programmable hardware. But if the basic idea or concrete algorithms were only invented in 1998, it makes sense that contemporary games didn't use it until the Dreamcast was out. reply kace91 4 hours agoprevI started my career working on VR apps and soon pivoted to webdev due to the better market.

They have not been able to adapt to a changing information landscape and were stuck on models that worked in the past, like \"both sides\"ing issues sort of reflexively. That works great with a lot of things like \"how much should we tax companies?\", but not so much for some more fundamental questions like whether someone supports democracy. I'm not sure what will emerge in its place. It's a big problem, and has hit hardest and first among local newspapers which are increasingly hollowed out husks of their former selves. This has a real cost to society that's actually quantifiable in dollars and cents: https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-closures-of-local-new... Things like social media don't really take the place of people paid to do the hard work of, say, sitting through local city council meetings and making sense of what's happening there. A friend of mine tried doing that for fun and it lasted a few years, but he got burned out because of the tremendous amount of work. reply trogdor 16 hours agoparent> stuck on models that worked in the past, like \"both sides\"ing issues sort of reflexively. That works great with a lot of things like \"how much should we tax companies?\", but not so much for some more fundamental questions like whether someone supports democracy. As someone who worked for years as an investigative reporter, I feel like this comment fundamentally misunderstands what it is that journalistic organizations strive to do. Generally speaking, the goal is to report the facts about newsworthy events. They are not trying to tell people what to think, or even what the reporter thinks. That is what opinion pieces and editorials are for. Would you be more specific about what you think should be done differently? For example, in reporting about whether someone supports democracy? reply JohnBooty 15 hours agorootparentGenerally speaking, the goal is to report the facts about newsworthy events. They are not trying to tell people what to think I think (good) reporters are going to do this in the micro, yeah. Taking a slightly broader view, though, surely we can see that there is a myriad of implicit editorialization in any publication, no matter how factual they are. There can be no \"neutral\" media because the people controlling it still make a wide range of choices regarding those facts. They make choices regarding which stories and beats receive funding and staffing, the presentation of those facts (which stories are at the top of page 1, which ones are buried on page 83 next to the obituaries?) and which facts are not reported. Imagine a newspaper that only investigates the private lives of Political Party A, looking for fraud or salacious incidents. We then draw attention to them and put them \"above the fold.\" We do not tell lies either privately or publicly and follow strict journalistic guidelines. You can see where this is going: the catch is that we never investigate Political Party B. Not exactly a balanced presentation of the truth, even though we never lie. reply davidw 15 hours agorootparentRight - and big enough news outlets can even \"make their own weather\". This investigation of \"circular reporting\" at the NYT is pretty illustrative: https://css.seas.upenn.edu/new-york-times-a-case-study-in-in... reply foxglacier 13 hours agorootparentprevDespite unavoidable bias, there's a clear line that journalists often cross where they present something in a way that they had to know was misleading. I'm not talking choice of what stories to cover or how prominent to make them but writing things like \"X is increasing\" when they really just cherry picked a time interval over which it increased it's otherwise been decreasing but they don't mention that. They can also omit obviously relevant information which would oppose the general impression they're trying to present. Or they'll add qualifiers that show doubt in information they don't like but not to information that supports the political belief they're trying to push. There's also the practice of making naked assertions with the obvious intent to persuade people like \"X is false\" instead of \"source Y said that X was false\". I think this kind of stuff is why they're widely disrespected. reply mmooss 12 hours agorootparentLike poor journalism, that's a speculative narrative. Things could work that way, and like all human endeavors journalism has many flaws, but I don't see evidence that it characterizes journalism as a whole. I think there is wide disrespect for two reasons: Most of all, it suits powerful people to spread disrespect of news media, because it challenges and often undermines their power. Every time journalists report something undesireable to someone powerful - which is the core job of journalism - the powerful person attacks the journalist rather than address the issue. Some powerful people want to reduce or eliminate journalism more broadly. Without journalism, what will challenge the powerful? How will you know what they are doing? It's time to stop finding problems, and start thinking of consequences. What replaces serious journalism? reply valiant55 15 hours agorootparentprevFor example, having a debate about climate change with one scientist from each side of the debate is insane because there's scientific consensus on only one side of that debate. Trying to cast equal light on both sides of a topic tips the scale in favor of the minority opinion. Or take some reporting about DT's insane idea to take over Greenland, treating it like a legitimate idea and polling people about their thoughts just further legitimatizes absolute insanity. reply rsynnott 3 hours agorootparentThere was a painful period in the run-up to the Irish referendum on same-sex marriage a decade ago where RTE, the state broadcaster, took its obligation to allow equal time on elections a little too literally. A particular highlight was a business program on the radio in which the presenter talked to a hospitality industry representative about the impact of more weddings on the industry; due to RTE’s rules they also had to get on some lunatic to rant for five minutes about how the gays were going to destroy civilisation. (By the time the referendum actually happened, there was all-party support, the church was sitting it out, and there was enough society consensus that RTE really only had a panel of about ten public figures to take the anti side, and most of them were fairly unhinged.) reply mike_hearn 7 hours agorootparentprevFinding scientists who disagree with one or more climate change narratives is easy; it's actually the media who decided one day that they must stop talking to such people because there is \"consensus\", which is obviously doublethink. If there's consensus then you don't need to make an explicit decision to silence one side, because there is only one side to begin with. You yourself admit that this is true when your post goes from talking about a \"consensus on only one side\" to there being a \"minority opinion\" i.e. no consensus. But if you simply decide to report the majority opinion on any topic then you're once again engaged in circular reasoning, as the majority opinion will be affected by whatever you report. There isn't any way to do honest journalism on complex topics other than to actually report all sides of the issue, including disagreement by minorities, including if you believe those minorities are wrong. The media used to do \"both sides\" because that's what it takes to be trusted, when they stopped doing that trust in them started to decline. Ironically, this totally one sided kind of reporting leading to mistrust is what Bezos is now trying to fix. Far too late, but he is at least trying. reply belter 5 hours agorootparent> Finding scientists who disagree with one or more climate change narratives is easy Do you have a reference? reply rsynnott 3 hours agorootparentIf you’re willing to define ‘scientists’ very broadly, and in particular if you’re okay with ‘scientists’ in unrelated fields, it’s very doable. reply mike_hearn 1 hour agorootparentprevJust read any skeptics blog to get a daily feed of such scientists. Here some examples but there's an endless stream: Storms not getting worse: \"there is no clear trend in most basins, but a significant decrease in power dissipation index has been detected in the South Indian Ocean basin since 1994, which is almost entirely due to a decrease in both tropical cyclone frequency and duration in this basin\", https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01683-2 Pacific islands not drowning: \"Results challenge perceptions of island loss, showing islands are dynamic features that will persist as sites for habitation over the next century\", https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-02954-1 Warming in 20th century over-estimated: \"correcting the ocean cold bias would result in a more modest early-twentieth-century warming trend\", https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08230-1 Or for more direct refutations: Roy Spencer, climatologist, who has written entire books refuting climate change narratives: https://www.amazon.com/Global-Warming-Skepticism-Busy-People... Judith Curry, (retired) climatologist, https://judithcurry.com/2024/05/26/fact-checking-the-fact-ch... \"All things considered, planet earth is doing fine. We are obviously not facing an existential crisis. Anyone who tells you that we are, is not paying attention to the historical data. Instead, they are concerned about what “might” happen in the future, based on predictions from inadequate climate models, driven by unrealistic assumptions.\" Nicola Scafetta, climatologist, https://wattsupwiththat.com/2012/01/09/scaffeta-on-his-lates... \"The attempts of some of current climate modelers to explain and solve the failure of their GCMs in properly forecasting the approximate steady climate of the last 10 years are very unsatisfactory for any practical and theoretical purpose.\" John Clauser, Nobel prize winner in physics, https://clintel.org/nobel-prize-winner-dr-john-f-clauser-sig... \"Misguided climate science has metastasized into massive shock-journalistic pseudoscience.\" The usual response to all this is usually a No True Scotsman argument similar to the one posted by rsynnott, or a claim that \"consensus\" doesn't mean everyone agrees but only requires some arbitrary threshold in a carefully selected subgroup. Even there, it fails. The famous claim that 99% of climatologists agree with human-driven global warming doesn't replicate: https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/11/11/215 ... and has severe methodological errors. reply tim333 9 hours agorootparentprev>having a debate about climate change with one scientist from each side of the debate is insane It depends what aspect you are debating.

As far as local newspapers, they just lost the ad war. reply xocnad 15 hours agorootparentCan you provide some specific examples that inform your viewpoint? reply sincerecook 14 hours agorootparentFiery but mostly peaceful protests, Biden's dementia is actually just a speech issue, Russia hacked our brains, peaceful Muslims (after a massacre), etc, etc. reply mmooss 12 hours agorootparentIsn't that just journalists not supporting your personal narrative? That isn't the measure of truth (and neither is mine). reply mike_hearn 7 hours agorootparentBiden having dementia isn't a personal narrative, it's a matter of fact that was clearly visible for years but most US based journalists refused to report on. The position you're staking out here is called postmodernism, and is based on the idea that there is no objective truth. There is only my truth and your truth. This is a highly ideological and contentious position, in fact to people who don't subscribe to postmodernism, postmodernism is an objectively untrue belief system. Biden shows all the symptoms of being in a state of advanced dementia. People who work with him say he's only cogent and capable of handling presidential business for a few hours a day at best, and that's probably an exaggeration. It is objectively true that he has dementia by the definitions of those words. When journalists refused to report that or pretended the problems were caused by other things, they weren't merely preferencing personal narratives of equal value to any other narrative, they were explicitly manipulating their readers in order to achieve their ideological goals via subterfuge. Which is why nobody rational trusts them anymore. reply mmooss 12 minutes agorootparentSpare me the postmodernism lecture and don't try to put me in your preconceived box. There is lots of ground between 'there is no objective reality' and assuming that you, mike_hearn, have some special access to to the Truth. If someone could have such special access, how do you know it's you and not me? It's not that voice saying you are right - everyone has it; it's part perceptual mechanism and part ego; why is your voice superior to mine? And we also know that political movements play to that voice, manipulate it, and then encourage it - 'you and I know the truth'. And aren't you the one just repeating an ideology? All you say I have heard many times as dogma of the current right-wing movement. And as you offer nothing else but insistence on it, is there any more to these claims? Where do you think for yourself and depart from it? What is your reasoning beyond 'nobody rational' would disagree with the movement - a strong signal of reason-by-mass-psychology. The essence of reason is another voice, which connects our intellect and knows, through experience and training, that the first voice is not trustworthy. It doesn't say, 'nobody rational would disagree with me'; it says, 'my perception and knowledge are limited and I need to base my beliefs on much more'. The core of reason and rational thought is resolving a dilemma: how do we find truth if our perceptions and beliefs are unreliable? What's worked very well and is widely accepted is to use something outside ourselves: publicly verifiable fact. > objectively untrue > nobody rational Those words aren't evidence, they are just signals that it's a dogma. A rational discussion would bring in evidence, and talk about its strengths and weaknesses, and talk about the strengths and weaknesses in your ideas. It would include curiosity about others' ideas. I'm sure you have plenty of good ideas (and so do I), but it's impossible to explore anything if you won't. > journalists refused to report that I saw plenty of reporting about his age-related problems, for example in the New York Times and Fox News.

Instead it was \"loud noises heard\". https://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2024/07/13/media-rea... reply mmooss 12 hours agorootparentThat's a bizarre claim on your part. It was called an assassination attempt everywhere I looked; it was everywhere in the news. reply mike_hearn 7 hours agorootparentIt will only sound bizarre if you didn't read ivewonyoung's link, which provides specific examples of big news outlets doing exactly what was claimed. Maybe everywhere you looked didn't do that, but if so you weren't looking at NBC, MSNBC, the Washington Post or CNN at the time of the attack. The link supplies screenshots of their reporting in all cases. reply mmooss 10 minutes agorootparentI read lots of news from many, many sources, including those. Nobody had a problem calling it an assassination attempt once there was evidence of that that's what it was. There are many more likely, alternative explanations for any delay. Of course they shouldn't conclude anything about anything without evidence; they shouldn't say 'assassination' as soon as someone hears a loud bang. In fact, many report Trump was hit by a bullet when, last I knew, we had no evidence that it wasn't shrapnel that cut him (but I haven't really kept up with new developments). mike_hearn 2 minutes agorootparentCome on, it was a political rally at which shots rang out and someone behind Trump was killed on the spot by a bullet, with the shooter being killed seconds later by snipers and the Secret Service evacuating him. You don't need extensive investigative journalism to work out what happened and other news outlets reported it correctly immediately. It was only the usual suspects who had trouble writing accurate headlines. healsdata 13 hours agorootparentprevLet's look at the coverage of California's requirement that Type 48 license holders provide drug testing kits to patrons. Because the article/reporter wanted to provide a look into both sides of the issue (those who like the requirementand those who don't) they included this quote: \"While I've heard about drink spiking, I suspect that it's extremely rare, at least here in the Palm Desert area.\" If the reporter had been providing all the facts, they would have immediately followed that with the rate of occurrence of drink spiking. If it was \"extremely rare\", they could have then followed up with a government official's thoughts on why the requirement is necessary even if the drink spiking is \"extremely rare\". There was no such information provided, leaving the reader with one man's opinion that is clearly only conjecture but given credibility by being included in the article. In an effort to present both sides, but surely on a deadline that prevented proper research, they left the reader with the idea that drink spiking is rare and that the government is simply overreaching. reply mmooss 12 hours agorootparent> they would have immediately followed that with the rate of occurrence of drink spiking I would be surprised if that data existed.

For example, in reporting about whether someone supports democracy? No, because I'm not a news person myself. I can see there's a problem, but I don't know how to fix it; I don't know the job or the business behind it well enough. I'd look to people like Jay Rosen and Margaret Sullivan for good critiques and perhaps some suggestions of what should be done differently. But it's tricky! Because not only is the reporting part of it struggling right now, the whole business aspect is in trouble as well, which compounds problems - like I mentioned with local news. And once again, I have no idea how anyone fixes that. Perhaps some enterprising person on Hacker News will figure out something that works, although I suspect it's more of a people problem than a technology one. reply deathanatos 16 hours agorootparentprev> Generally speaking, the goal is to report the facts about newsworthy events. I disagree; I think \"reporting the facts\" has taken somewhat of a backseat in journalism these days. Instead, it is much more just \"this is what each side says\"; while one might argue that, yes, the quote of what each side said is itself a fact, it's a pretty poor quality fact, worse than witness testimony since the witnesses aren't under oath and if politicians, are well known to be unreliable. Worse, it feels as if it doesn't matter if one side is uttering absolute bullshit, it just gets quoted & printed, giving equal weight to each side's statements regardless of how absurd it might be. And because the truth is usually harder to put pithily and often takes longer to even determine, it usually loses out, and it becomes competition of \"who can scream the loudest?\" or first, or the most convincingly. (“A lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is still putting on its shoes.”) Deeper questions such as \"what does science say?\" or \"what are the actual facts\" (not just what people say the facts are) or \"what would someone knowledgeable in these matters ask about this situation?\" are left unreported. (And yes, I acknowledge that science itself can have inherent bias, or come to an erroneous result. But are you asking a physicist about the physics, or are you asking a politician about the physics? Are you making an attempt to get beyond the sound bite and determine the actual nuance to the topic, or is it the same \"A screams A, B screams B\" stances & the societal debate on the topic shall go nowhere?) > They are not trying to tell people what to think, or even what the reporter thinks. But by simply quoting people without putting things into the context of facts, the media becomes a mouthpiece for those being quoted, usually politicians. No, the reporting isn't telling us what to think, the politician is. For example, in one topic that I'm knowledgeable on¹, journalists routinely print what are lies, full stop, from one of the political parties. Now, again, \"X say Y\" is technically a fact, and could be printed. But I've seen it followed up with \"Science has no evidence about Y\" — which is patently false, and is at best a confused conclusion by the reporter (science has a strong result about Y ­— Y does not occur; but you if write \"there is no evidence about Y\", people read that as \"we don't know\", but we do know, and it's ¬Y.) Let's take another example, where I'm not an expert: the recent Korean air crash. Reading the reporting left me wondering things like \"Why did the EMAS not arrest the aircraft? How did a bird strike take out the landing gear? If, e.g., there was a hydraulics failure in the landing gear, why did they not gravity drop the landing gear? ATC transcripts?\" I saw no reporting even questioning any of those things; most of it was surface level: a crash occurred, here's the death toll thus far. Even simpler: 9/10 times a court is involved, there's no link to the ruling. Or, quite often, I can be reading article A, which makes claim 1, and I think \"claim 1 is a surprising claim; I would not have expected claim 1 to be true\". Thankfully, claim 1 is a link! And I click it … and the linked article does not support claim 1. But by having claim 1 be a link, the upstream article's claim feels legitimate and cited, when in reality … it isn't. ¹I don't want to name it, as it's a charged topic, and would certainly derail the thread. reply verzali 9 hours agorootparentThat type of journalism exists, people just don't read it.

As for damaging credibility with the public, I don't know of any rigorous opinion polls which show that, but at any rate you'd expect finally admitting a problem exists to temporarily harm credibility. What will be interesting is whether Bezos can actually change things in a way that increases public trust in the WP.

It didn't turn your stomach when corporates donated to Biden's inauguration? reply paxunix 11 hours agorootparentIt's that the guy who won this time is a horrible human being and is the head of a party that seems barely interested in governing, but more in enriching themselves even if it means sacrificing rights and privileges of those they govern. The guy that won last time is not as horrible a human being and was interested in governing for all Americans. So when the oligarch heads of companies decide to donate to the new guy's big party, it's tantamount to simply ignoring all the truly shitty things the new guy and his party have done and have said they're going to do, because it's more important to the oligarchs that the real power in the land[1] look favourably upon them and their designs. It has been made abundantly clear that currying that favour costs money. [1] Make no mistake, the US government is more powerful than all of the tech companies in the country and its new leader intends to wield that power as capriciously as he sees fit. reply JohnBooty 15 hours agoprevIf I read the linked post with images disabled, I might have agreed entirely with the cartoonist. I certainly think this is an important thing to call out, because it sucks: The cartoon that was killed criticizes the billionaire tech and media chief executives who have been doing their best to curry favor with incoming President-elect Trump. But when you look at the image... something doesn't line up here: There have been multiple articles recently about these men with lucrative government contracts and an interest in eliminating regulations This isn't a cartoon with Biden handing them piles of money, or Uncle Sam handing these guys money, or... I don't know... the aforementioned group of CEOs groveling or fighting for a dollar bill dangled on a fishing line by Trump. This is a cartoon with those dudes handing Trump himself piles of money directly. Like a direct bribe. Which is the exact opposite of what she claims to be attempting to criticize, which is about \"men with lucrative government contracts\" ie money flowing in the other direction. Corporate and private donors do definitely line the pockets of politicians, a little more indirectly. That is a big problem and maybe it's part of what she wanted to convey. Feels like she's on the right side of things, but it doesn't feel like good execution. reply CamperBob2 14 hours agoparentThis is a cartoon with those dudes handing Trump himself piles of money directly.

I am so sick of the self aggrandizement across the board that seems to have become especially prominent over the past couple of years. I am certain I am not the only one. A cartoon in the Washington Post is at best preaching to the choir. Not a single \"powerful person or institution\" in history has ever even once been \"held accountable\" by a Washington Post cartoon. So, so many people have such an inflated sense of the importance of what they do, like they're on some holy crusade. I am reminded of that scene at the beginning of Silicon Valley, \"I don't want to live in a world where someone else makes the world a better place\", and all the cringy Steve Jobs impersonators we've all seen over the years. In my opinion these kinds of people are exactly the reason that the same people being \"held accountable\" in the cartoon have managed to come to power. Because they've been putting themselves out there as unlikable self-righteous snobs for the better part of the past decade or so and a whole lot of people got sick of them and put the idiots in charge out of spite.

It’s almost as if internet 1.0 shook out the way it did for a reason, and for all the complaining about ads, fast forward 25 years and consumers still fundamentally refuse to pay for search. It’s the same reason the phone book was also free and ad supported pre-internet.

It was just paid by the subscriptions. There was only one state owned phone company. reply ryukoposting 6 hours agoparentprevDo consumers refuse to pay for search, or has nobody asked them if they'd want to? Kagi is well-known on HN, but I guarantee my parents have never heard of it. I told my wife about it the other day, and she had never heard of it either. She thought it was a cool idea. $10/month is just too much. Sure, YellowPages had lots of ads. Hell, PCMag was ~35% ads. The difference was that their ads were clearly labeled and physically distinct from the actual content. They didn't camoflauge the ads to make them blend into the rest of the page layout. Advertisers occasionally tried, sure, but the layout would still be visibly different. Ads on the web are more insidious, and more intrusive. reply wkat4242 1 minute agorootparentI won't pay for search either. I just filter the ads out like I do with every website. I also have SearXNG in between. I don't really care about the sustainability of business models. And really, Google is not about search. It's an advertising company. reply tokioyoyo 5 hours agorootparentprevNo hate to Kagi, but my non-techie friends would laugh at my face if I suggested them to pay for a search engine.

It will not happen over night but we're starting to care more about the quality (and incentives) of what we feed our minds. reply tokioyoyo 2 hours agorootparentNone of the things in the list is a dealbreaker for an average consumer. By the way, I used to pay for Kagi as well, so I get it from my perspective. For other people? Not so much. reply chrisweekly 14 hours agoparentprevYet Kagi is doing well, and I'm very happy to pay a few bucks a month to be their customer instead of their product. reply wrasee 11 hours agorootparentGenuinely interested. So I went to their site and I have to say it's quite refreshing. But then - a few bucks a month turns out to be $5/month, and that comes with a limit of 300 searches/month. That's an average of just 10 a day and while in practice I probably wouldn't actually hit that limit it's uncomfortably low enough that the added fiction of each search having a tangible cost is just a non-starter. I can't help feel that when the competition is free - and on precisely the recognition that people don't pay for search - that a more aggressive $2 tier for personal customers could get a much wider penumbra of folk such as myself over the line, rather than be yet another $5 service that when applied consistently actually start to add up. reply i_am_proteus 7 hours agorootparentThe \"right way\"[0] to use Kagi is the unlimited search tier ($10/mo) and then aggressively rank domains in searches. Within a few weeks, the search quality improves tremendously, because I have filtered out the domains responsible for low-quality results, and up-ranked the domains I find to be most useful. [0]My opinion. Probably true. reply wrasee 3 hours agorootparentI suppose my argument was essentially that $5/month felt on the high side, so I love that the answer is actually to pay $10/month. This is the way. In all seriousness, I am sure you are right and don’t deny the promise on offer. I’d also be willing to pay for search much more so than many other online services of more questionable value. But I just don’t think they’re going to get cut-through at $5, not least $10, in the way they might exponentially do so if they could stretch to an entry tier that really starts to feel accessible to a much, much wider set of people. WhatsApp took over the world at $1/year. reply nickpsecurity 4 hours agorootparentprevThere’s also the idea of vote with your wallet. What we spend can be a tool to change the landscape.

Much like a browser is not just another app you barely use. Search is central to my internet experience. If there is one service worth paying for, it should be search. But for that it should be better enough than ad-supported options to be worth the subscription. I think Kagi has got so close that I should start shelling $10/mo for it. (Another service I think is a no-brainer to pay for is YouTube, mostly because ad-ridden YouTube is insufferable.) reply pembrook 8 hours agorootparentprevBy doing well, you mean they’ve reached a user base that is 0.00001% the size of Google (feel free to “actually…” me with the correct number of zeroes). If we want the productivity unlock of search (and AI) to be accessible to the entire world and not just to niche internet nerds who live and work online all day, we probably are going to get ads again. I’m sorry that this is true and has always been true. OpenAI is just a few years from admitting this themselves. Even if they reach 100 million paid users at $20/m, it’s not enough to stay competitive given competition will offer a free product that shows ads to monetize the other 5 billion AI users on earth in addition to a pro subscription tier and will always have the superior model. Not all humans are the same as you and care about the same stuff enough to pay for it, I know, it’s upsetting. But this is reality. And its better for the world. It helps the most people in a sustainable way. reply freediver 3 hours agorootparent> By doing well, you mean they’ve reached a user base that is 0.00001% the size of Google (feel free to “actually…” me with the correct number of zeroes). I will! (Kagi CEO here, and Happy New Year!) It is closer to 0.01%, comparing the number of daily queries which is my favorite metric. Other way to put it is that Kagi is currently ~7 seconds of Google's daily search volume. You may say it is a small number, but each one of Kagi's searches is paid and deliberate - and I dare say - a vote for the better web. reply Aeolun 7 hours agorootparentprevI don’t think ads fundamentally help people. reply pembrook 7 hours agorootparentExcept they do. They help connect buyers with needs/wants to sellers with solutions. I know this breaks HNs brain so I don't expect to win this one however. Can ads encourage people to buy stuff they don't need? Yes. Like most things (including humans), they aren't perfectly rational. reply gjm11 3 hours agorootparentI gladly affirm that in principle it is possible for advertisements to be beneficial on net by informing people with needs about how suitable products meet those needs. Now turn off your ad-blocker, look at the next ten ads you see on the internet, and count how many of them fall into that category. reply seanhunter 6 hours agorootparentprev> They help connect buyers with needs/wants to sellers with solutions. You know what else does this but in a non-creepy, non-tracking way that doesn't try to artificially create needs/wants in people? Accurate search results. If I want something I can search for it and find it. SEO and advertising and sponsored results are the way companies try to skew search results (usually by making them less accurate and useful for the person searching) in a way that benefits them. reply pembrook 6 hours agorootparentThe problem is the best way to weight the accuracy of results (as you say, SEO exists) is with skin in the game. A bidding-based advertising system ultimately results in the most valuable solution winning, since the ad spend will be marginally bid up as close to the value the consumer is willing to pay for the product/service minus producer input costs. The most successful companies ultimately have the most to spend on ads. Again, this does not result in perfectly rational outcomes all the time (because humans are irrational), but comes damn close. Now, whether we should let one company take the profits off of that ad bidding system (since it inherently trends to monopoly) is another question. reply seanhunter 5 hours agorootparentIf you genuinely believe that then I’m delighted for you. You are living in paradise reply bdangubic 7 hours agorootparentprevI agree except when it is overwhelming. ads are so prevalent these days that many brains (mine included) look at every ad as a scam reply adaptbrian 6 hours agorootparentIt just depends where you consume media.

I wouldn’t call that “doing well”. Edit: that should be 29K subscribers reply fweimer 7 hours agorootparentI think it's a bit of a cultural defect that we consider a product with 29K (supposedly satisfied) users a failure. More problematic (for Kagi) is that it's not a free-standing engine (“Our search results also include anonymized API calls to all major search result providers worldwide” per https://help.kagi.com/kagi/search-details/search-sources.htm...), so it's still dependent on the weird business practices around non-paid search.

I don't get it. It's not like there aren't people focused on sustainable businesses. 90% of businesses are probably SMBs - just not in tech. For most people in the world, the word entrepreneur means \"someone who's opening a McDonalds across the street\" or \"someone opening a pizza shop\". Even in tech, there are plenty of not-hypergrowth companies around (I run a small dev shop, for example). The reason we here are exposed more to VC-style startups is because a) they make more news, for obvious reasons, but also b) there are structural reasons in tech that favor that style of company, most importantly because software itself is scalable in a way that most things aren't. reply Tostino 12 hours agorootparentI'm not against using tech's natural advantages with scale - that's one of the beauties of software. My concern is with the disproportionate resources being poured into hyper-growth ventures, where the vast majority fail after burning through enormous amounts of capital. If even a fraction of that talent and investment was redirected toward building sustainable businesses that create real value, rather than just competing for finite resources like user attention or market domination, I believe the tech industry, the tech workers, and society would benefit more in the long run. reply edanm 9 hours agorootparentFirst, I think VC makes up a tiny percentage of invested capital, so I'm not sure the intuition of \"so much money is thrown at it\" is right. There's far, far more capital and talent in e.g. traditional non-software businesses, finance, government, etc. Just look at places like Google, which has 180k employees. Not all are tech/innovation talent, necessarily, but that's probably more than most new startups combined. In any case, I'm not sure I trust you, me or anyone to be smarter about how to get innovation than our current relatively-free-market capitalistic system, where there's actually pretty good incentives to pursue innovation. Look at how many things today that absolutely improve our world have been created through this messy process. It's apparently monetarily worth it to have 95 failed startups in order to get 5 ones that change the world, and that's probably a good thing for society, because the world is better than it war 20 years ago in terms of technology/innovation. (The world is worse in other ways, and a different criticism of tech is that some of it can also be negative for society, but that's a separate concern than it being wasteful, which I just don't agree with.) reply Retric 8 hours agorootparentVC funded companies are into the trillions of total investment (100+B / year adds up). That’s a small but meaningful fraction of global wealth for such a tiny slice of companies. It’s not that these are necessarily bad investments, but growth at any cost tends to suck up a lot more talent than the business actually justifies. Of course the industry is mostly dumb investments. Looking back Google+ was part of a wave of social websites that didn’t really go anywhere. Facebook was founded in 04, Twitter in 06, but in 2011 suddenly everyone wants in on the action… The wave of crypto was similarly almost pure waste but most VC firms aren’t really about wise investment. It’s about charging high fees for funds under managed, they succeed when someone invests not when companies become profitable. reply edanm 6 hours agorootparentYeah, they're into trillions, but aren't they like 5% of most pension funds, which are the biggest stores of wealth? Also, if you're looking at trillions invested, I'd hardly call them startups or speculative investments. It's certainly true that something like OpenAI or Uber spent (and still spend?) many years without making profit, but by the time they're raising rounds of billions, it's no longer anywhere near the same level of risk, and the statistic that \"most fail\" rings less true. reply DannyBee 3 hours agorootparentprevSMBs have roughly the same characteristics even when they do that. That is, the vast majority still fail, most do not make enough profit to come close to sustainability, and the 80-90% of revenue is earned by the top 10% of SMBs Even if you go through the data and try to restrict it to some definition of \"not going to be an obvious failure\" it's not pretty. It is a fascinating read though. So while I agree with your sentiment it does not seem to help much in practice. reply dmje 10 hours agorootparentprevAs founder of a 15 year micro consultancy I'm nodding along.

If search evolves further and further away from textual matching, that will impact them as well. (For search providers, it could be commercially reasonable to replace more or less traditional document indexing with a way to synthesize responses—at a very high level similar to what some analytical tools for time series do.) I hope that by then, they have deployed their own crawlers and indices, so that there's still an alternative, rather than merely adopting the latest industry trends. reply devsda 13 hours agoparentprev> for all the complaining about ads, There are couple of main complaints about ads: 1.

From what I've seen, it's typical for startups at this stage to be generating minimal revenue. Perplexity has raised close to $1 billion, so they likely aren't under pressure to be profitable just yet. Bringing in tens of millions in revenue annually would actually be quite a strong start. It may sometimes seem like “no one pays for anything”, but clearly a lot of people are paying for Perplexity Pro.

And customer support... What's that? reply jorams 6 hours agorootparent> Isn't payment processing just single digit percents? It is usually a fixed component + a single digit percentage. For larger payments the fixed component becomes largely irrelevant. For small payments it can eat up most of the money involved. As a quick example, Stripe's standard price for a credit card transaction in the US is 2.9% + $0.30. For a $5 payment that's almost 10% in direct fees, which is just about low enough that this is often where saas pricing starts. This assumes you do tax calculation yourself (or ignore it until you're big enough) and handle fraud detection yourself. If you pay Stripe for these you're paying a significantly larger fixed fee. There's also another significant risk at such low prices: In case of a disputed payment, which can happen a long time after the payment and will likely be more frequent if you don't pay to proactively deal with fraud, Stripe will charge you a $15 dispute fee regardless of the end result. reply carlosjobim 6 hours agorootparentprevNo, it's percents plus a fixed cent amount.

But it is an accurate description of the service, nevertheless. reply janalsncm 10 hours agorootparentI feel like this is a bad-faith response, no offense. A person explained why cable TV is a bad deal and wished there was a “decent” alternative. Clearly, “decent” is being used from the user perspective, not the effect it has on society. From the user perspective Spotify is indeed “decent”. On-demand, unlimited access to essentially all music for a flat fee. But switching the definition of “decent” to what its effects on society are seems unfair. It’s not like the price gouging cable business model has avoided race to the bottom reality TV either. reply PaulDavisThe1st 3 hours agorootparentI'm not switching the definition of decent. I'm noting what the actual effect of Spotify's business model and operations are. If you find it decent a user, and are OK with the long term impact, go ahead and use it. People just need to be reminded from time to time that their individual choices (as \"users\") have ramifications beyond whether they get decent service. Also, as a side note: HN is a generally US-centric (and more broadly anglophone) context. The word \"decent\" in english currently has some related but not trivial to distinguish meanings. There's a British english version (now spreading into American english, certainly among younger cohorts) which equates roughly to \"quality\". There's also a version that is more related to some sense of morality. A \"decent person\" isn't so much about what they will do, as what they won't. There's the version used in the question \"Are you decent?\", asked before entering a room.

If both of us pay to see a film in a movie theater, we're almost certainly talking an amount in excess of $20, potentially higher than $30 and not inconceivably over $40. From my POV, a streaming service has to provide us with 1 film's worth of \"decent\" entertainment per month to be \"worthwhile\". Although all of them occasionally fail to do that in a given month, I don't think any of them fail to hit the \"12 film's worth\" over the course of a year. reply asdff 17 hours agorootparenteven though movie pass is dead it created some pretty savory monthly plans from the theater. there are dead months sure but on aggregate you can easily beat their guess at the median user and come out quite ahead if you are into seeing new movies. reply dgfitz 19 hours agorootparentprevApple TV has by far the highest production quality of any streaming service I’ve used. reply dleink 16 hours agorootparentprevWouldn't you want to be loyal to the productions themselves rather than whatever streaming service is exhibiting them?

When Google was announced in the early 1990s the founders said they wanted to provide a search engine for the academnic realm, transparent and free from the influence of advertising. Google's original \"business plan\" was to license their search engine to corporations. Obviously that did not work. Netscape had a similar plan for its Navigator web browser. No doubt some of these \"AI\" companies believe they can license to companies as a viable business. Meanwhile, they may end up like Netscape. If ads are and always were a viable \"business model\" then why do these companies try to pursue licensing first. Perhaps some myopia is created by mesmerising effects of certain selected companies, e.g., Google, that have operated their \"ads business\" free from meaningful competition or regulation, leading to immense growth and market domination, the later maintained long-term by anticompetitive behaviour. reply lmm 19 hours agorootparentprevGoogle is the world's fourth most valuable company. reply tomrod 2 hours agorootparentI agree.

Turn off the ads (which is visual and aural pollution in 99.99999% of cases) and said company is literally not viable. We accept ads because we're conditioned to, not because they represent a real business. The vast majority of advertising spend is inefficient and wasteful in terms of ROI. Most advertising in the space show substantially low statistical power, in effect being unable to identify an effect from random noise.[0] This means ROI measures are normally bunk. Ad-supported businesses are subject wholly to the whims of unrelated companies and people outside their target client base. We worry about AI slop, rightfully, yet do little to nothing to stop the memetic, exploitative mind virus advertising (and adtech especially) is.

The differences between the standard plan and the standard plan with ads, aside from the ads, is that the plan with ads also: (1) only has \"most\" of the movies and TV shows Netflix, (2) and does not allow purchasing an \"extra member\" slot. The difference between the standard and premium plans, besides 4K, is: (1) premium lets you download on 6 devices at once (both standard plans are limited to 2), (2) premium includes spatial audio, and (3) premium lets you purchase up to 2 \"extra member\" slots. I'm really curious how many people who do not get Premium go for Standard rather than Standard with ads. I subscribed a couple days ago, specifically to watch a show that was prematurely cancelled by its original broadcast network (on a cliffhanger!) that Netflix picked up and finished.

So far, after 5 episodes of just under an hour each...the ads were barely noticeable. It has shown me 3 ads, each 30 seconds long.
