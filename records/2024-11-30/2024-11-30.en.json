    "originBody": "What does this button do? My new car has a mysterious and undocumented switch Koen van Hove ·Nov 29, 2024· 4 min read Last week I bought a car. After twelve years of service, my old trusty Peugeot 107 in blue has had its best. Expensive repairs were coming at some point, and I did not feel like waiting around for them to come. Plus the existing list of faults (like the high oil usage of about a litre per month, a brake that sometimes blocked without reason, or the smell of exhaust fumes that sometimes came into the car when the fan was on high) also started getting longer and longer. Anyway, new car time! After a lot of research I ended up with an Opel Corsa from 2020. To be precise, it’s an Opel Corsa Edition with 101 HP, and most importantly, it’s mine. Unlike the Peugeot, the Opel has gadgets - quite a few of them. Of course it being my car, I want to know what all buttons do, so I read the entire manual (which is very annoying to read, as they make one manual for every version of the car, so half of it does not apply to this car, but I digress). One of those buttons was the following below the lighting controls. Those do not appear in the manual, or the website, or anywhere. What could they be? Just flipping the switch does nothing, apart from turning off the light on the switch. So let’s look where the button goes. I can see that part of it is wired to the back of the OBD2 port (a port that retrieves data from the onboard computer about the car, such as pedal position, temperature, lights, rev count, speed - basically if you can see it on your dashboard it can be read using the OBD2 port), so it is getting information from the car, but apart from that the wires go to places that I can’t see without taking the car further apart. Something else that I noticed before is that I heard the typical inference noise coming from that area of the car when putting the ignition on. You know, this sound. Ti-ti ta, ti-ti ta, ti-ti ta, ti-ti ta, ti-ti ta, ti-ti ta, ti-ti ta, TAAAAAAAAAAA. That gave me the ominous feeling there might be something sending data in there. Sure, my car does that too so I can see in the app where I parked it (seriously, it does that), but at least I gave permission for that. I asked the wisdom of the crowd. A lot of ideas came up: nitrous (would have been fun), LPG switch (it’s only petrol), flame kit (I wish), front parking sensors (those are standard on the car). No avail. I called my dealership and asked. They guessed it might have been an immobiliser - bit strange on a car this young and type, and also strange for it to be a switch like this. I called the dealership that previously maintained the vehicle based on the phone number in the service history. They did not install it, and guessed it might be a black box. They did tell me who it previously belonged to (a large company), so I called their headquarters. They told me they don’t do their own cars any more, but that they outsourced it, and gave me a phone number. I called them, they told me they don’t do that, but he speculated it might be a GPS tracker. Some more searching, and I figured I would just drive to my dealership. More speculating with the salespeople, who told me to make an appointment with the mechanics. I did, they had a quick look at it and I now have an answer: The metal part is something to hold a magnet next to. It registers who's driving to a fleet tracker via a device also mounted in the car, which sends it to a fleet manager via the internet. That way it can be tracked which employee did what (and potentially who to send the fine to). That would also explain the mobile phone interference noises I've heard from that area of the car. So it’s a black box, a GPS tracker, and maybe also an immobiliser? I am not sure about the last one (and why it has a switch). I'm getting it removed because now I'm basically driving around with a foreign GPS tracker. Some lease company somewhere is getting data on wherever I go. Kind of spooky if you think of it, especially as I assume I am one of the few actually looking into what this is. Most people would have probably driven around for years with a foreign GPS tracker. And that’s how the search comes to an end. After a bit of perseverance I figured out what it is. I now know my car is being tracked still, and that they know I did try out what the car’s acceleration is like at full throttle. There are more interesting angles to this, like “can I request my data from the fleet manager thing that has been tracking my whereabouts under the GDPR?”, and “can I get free data from the SIM card embedded in the device that I now technically own?” but I will leave those for another day.",

Apart from privacy concerns of your data being used or sold by the car vendor, government outreach is also a concern. There was a bill announced in the US for all new cars to be equipped with \"driver impairment\" tech which was called a \"kill switch\". Media rushed to say it's not really a kill switch, just \"sensors or cameras to monitor the driver’s behaviors, head or eye movements\" and \"block the driver from operating the vehicle\". So... a kill switch. https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-402773429497 Anyway, I'm staying with my old gas Honda until it dies which is probably never with proper maintenance and eventually restoration. I'll never go electric. Modern cars are just smartphones on wheels at this point, and smartphones are just spying devices at this point. reply MaxBarraclough 17 hours agoparentLast year Mozilla did a study on the privacy of modern cars. Every car they tested showed terrible privacy problems.

For me it took 6 months. reply malfist 1 hour agorootparentYou can also opt out of Ford too. They default enable sharing with third party for features, default disable for sharing with data brokers like LexisNexis. It requires you to put in your driver pin to enable that reply BolexNOLA 4 hours agorootparentprevWhenever I talk about this issue with friends and family I bring up how that report revealed Nissan was gathering info on sexual activity in their cars and can sell it to third parties. That usually gets people to start listening. reply dghlsakjg 3 hours agorootparentWas Nissan actually collecting this data? All I can find is that the privacy policy retained the right to it (some lawyer probably though about what happens if they accidentally record you getting frisky, and put it in there preemptively), but no evidence if it actually happened. reply BolexNOLA 2 hours agorootparentDoes it matter? We can split hairs over whether or not they are actually doing the thing they give themselves the rights to do, but that feels unproductive and disingenuous. reply brookst 2 hours agorootparentYes it matters. Or at least it matters whether the claims you make are true, and there is a difference between “had a right to” and “did”. Have I told you about my neighbor who uses a leaf blower nonstop from 7am until 8pm? Well, he doesn’t actually, be he has a right to, and it’s splitting hairs whether he actually does or not. reply myself248 1 hour agorootparentOn the other hand, do we have any means of finding out whether they did? It's one thing if you can say \"No, they definitely don't, here's what's actually sent and here's how it's used and here's the contracts limiting what's gathered\". Otherwise we're all just speculating. But in the absence of solid proof, I think the history of the last several decades of surveillance shows that it's completely reasonable to assume the absolute worst. Snowden showed that the scope of government data collection was far beyond even the wildest assume-the-worst theories floated in tech media prior to the revelations, and Doubleclick (wearing its Google façade) makes the NSA look lazy. The reason these assumptions are reasonable, is that there's incentive for them to be true. Someone's willing to pay for that data. Maybe not very much, but if it costs almost nothing to collect, then it works out. The way some manager sees it, Nissan would be \"leaving money on the table\" if they didn't spy on their customers to the absolute maximum permitted by their EULA. This gets brought up in every internal meeting about telemetry features, I can assure you. (I've been in those meetings for a number of automakers, though not Nissan specifically, the whole industry is on board. It turns the stomach. My voice was not heard.) reply BolexNOLA 1 hour agorootparentYeah at this point in my life I just immediately assume if I give a company a right to do something, they’re going to do it. It’s an assumption everyone should operate under. reply chipsrafferty 32 minutes agorootparentprevIt's different. The leaf blower thing is something everyone has a right to do, and if it actually bothered enough people the municipality would put some restrictions on it regardless, and they didn't have to intentionally seek it out in legal scripture, and anyone can verify that they are using the leaf blower. With the cars, they went out of their way to get the right to do so, implying they want to do it, otherwise it would be a waste of money. Nobody can really verify whether they are or are not doing so, as that's confidential company information and it's not illegal (since they have to right to do so) so nobody can subpoena them to find out. So maybe they are doing it and just lying about not doing it. reply BolexNOLA 1 hour agorootparentprevOk, give me remote access to your computer. I’ll send a contract saying I can sell what I find, but I haven’t done it so it’s cool and it shouldn’t be cause for alarm. reply brookst 1 hour agorootparentIt’s for sure cause for alarm, but it is a different alarm than if you gad broken into my computer. I’m not a fan of the “they did something bad, so we might as well pretend they did something worse” line of argument. It strikes me as dishonest. reply BolexNOLA 44 minutes agorootparentIn 2024 to assume a company is not exercising virtually all the rights you’ve given them when you agreed to their terms and services - especially when they stand to make a ton of money doing so - is wild to me. These companies do not get the benefit of the doubt. I do not need proof to assume they are selling us to the highest bidder when they explicitly outline it in their terms and services and have done it time and time again. Experience has shown us that more often than not they will. I also didn’t say Nissan stole or broke into anything. My example is appropriate. reply dghlsakjg 2 hours agorootparentprevYes. It comes down to intention. The charitable read is that they are notifying you of the possibility that the car’s data collection may unintentionally include sexual activity. E.g. your car was recorded as having a rocking motion while parked. The other read is that they are intentionally collecting sexual activity data for nefarious purposes. The first is the lawyer drafting the release being overcautious. The second is a corporation being evil. I’m not in love with either, but the claim was that Nissan was actively collecting data about sexual activity, when there is no proof of that. The only thing there is proof of is that they put a notice in their terms of service. reply Mordisquitos 1 hour agorootparent> The first is the lawyer drafting the release being overcautious. The second is a corporation being evil. How was the hypothetical overcautious lawyer able to independently come up with such a specific scenario, which would require intimate technical knowledge? I believe your are missing a third option, which is a synthesis of both. This is that the engineers reported that their sensor data could be used to collect sexual activity. However, in response to that, the corporation preferred to cover themselves legally rather than making any technical effort to address the risk on their customers' privacy. The lawyer is not being overcautious, but simply displaying the corporation's priorities. The corporation is not being evil, it is just being psychopathic. reply jncfhnb 1 hour agorootparentSeems more likely that a lawyer simply made it up without engineering justification reply prirun 54 minutes agoparentprev> Anyway, I'm staying with my old gas Honda until it dies which is probably never with proper maintenance and eventually restoration. I would have stuck with my 2003 Honda Accord too, except that some woman, probably talking or texting on her cell, slammed into me while I was stopped at a light, totaling my car and damaging 3 others. I got $8K for my car after arguing with the insurance company, and paid $28K for a 3 y/o replacement. The fine for texting while driving in Kentucky is $25. reply Someone 5 hours agoparentprev> but the GPS and eSIM that comes with most (all?) new cars All. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECall: “eCall (an abbreviation of \"emergency call\") is an initiative by the European Union, intended to bring rapid assistance to motorists involved in a collision anywhere within the European Union. The aim is for all new cars to incorporate a system that automatically contacts the emergency services in the event of a serious accident, sending location and sensor information. eCall was made mandatory in all new cars approved for manufacture within the European Union as of April 2018.” reply aagha 4 hours agorootparentIt's crazy the EU passed this and collecting someone's IP address or assigning them a random UUID is considered a GDPR violation. reply wizzwizz4 4 hours agorootparentAssuming the tech is not abused, it makes perfect sense (GDPR Art. 6(1)(d)). And, in fact, abusing the tech would be a GDPR violation. You might consider it foolish, but it's not inconsistent. reply _heimdall 3 hours agoparentprevThis is a huge reason why I won't buy more modern vehicles. Safety features and fuel economy are night and day when comparing a 5 year old car and a 30 year old one, but between the privacy issues and inability to diagnose or fix a new car I just can't do it. I bought an 80s model truck that sat in a garage for over a decade and has 50k original miles on it. I'm still chasing down a couple gremlins in the system, but its nice to be able to work on it myself. Bonus that it may not be driving perfectly right now but its happy keep on chugging, even if a sensor is bad or I get an occasional code for running lean. reply alchemist1e9 2 hours agorootparentIsn’t the gas mileage really really bad though? reply _heimdall 1 hour agorootparentWe don't drive very much honestly, and the cost of maintenance has tended to even out. Our truck probably gets around 16 or 18 around town, up to 20 if the conditions are right. Not great compared to a modern truck with a 4 cylinder turbo, but I really don't think I go through more than a tank of gas in a month (albeit a larger 20 gallon tank) reply uoaei 2 hours agorootparentprevEveryone chooses their own balance of bills. Personally (I'm not who you're replying to) I'm happy to pay more in rent and utilities if it means I can ride my bicycle most places instead of, say, being a 10-minute drive from the nearest crosswalk. In the end, my emissions are probably much lower than someone who can't imagine leaving their house without their car keys even though I drive an ICE. reply alchemist1e9 2 hours agorootparentMakes sense. The other issue that is mentioned would be the safety features. Air bags and side impact systems are massive jumps forward in safety. Most people aren’t concerned enough with privacy to trade those for it. reply _heimdall 1 hour agorootparentSafety is definitely a tricky tradeoff for me. If I couldn't work on the vehicle myself either way I'd have something newer, the combo of privacy and maintenance tip the scales for me (definitely an outlier though). reply uoaei 7 minutes agorootparentFWIW I'm the same, definitely sketched out by the thin pillars and lack of side airbags though. But I absolutely hate the GPS and presumably-always-on front- and rear-facing cameras. dclowd9901 21 hours agoparentprevI'm with you here. I have an 89 BMW (which is old enough to have an actual servo motor attached to the intake manifold for cruise control) and an 83 Land Cruiser (whose most advanced feature is that it controls its emissions using vacuum controlled pneumatic circuitry). I'm very glad I've put in the time to learn how to work on cars because I have zero interest in the tech direction of modern vehicles. reply op00to 5 hours agorootparentI love older cars and drove an early 80s Volvo until 2010 or so, but I also love side impact airbags, antilock brakes, and a car that mostly just “works”. reply dclowd9901 2 hours agorootparentI do have one newer Toyota Tacoma for the purpose of \"just working\" and it does a great job of fulfilling that role, but includes a host of features and such that I really have no interest in. But if you have project cars, you really just need a very stable \"normal\" vehicle for day to day. reply Loughla 4 hours agorootparentprevWhen I was younger I loved having an 84 Chevy Scottsdale. It was a cool looking truck and was easy to work on. I used to love getting under the hood to chase down problems and find solutions. Now my knees hurt when it's cold outside, so crawling around on the ground to fix the fucking u-joint AGAIN isn't that fun, and I also like knowing that my children might survive if we get in a crash; something that's genuinely up for question in old vehicles. I would pay a premium for a new car without an \"infotainment\" system, cameras (except backup camera), gps, or any form of touchscreen. reply _heimdall 3 hours agorootparentI was really hoping to see am EV startup go after the niche of barebones vehicles. I would absolutely have an EV if it was a safe chassis with good range, a powerful enough motor, and none of the infotainment bells and whistles. I want to be able to diagnose my car if it has issues, but I don't want a system complex enough that it requires over the air updates. reply ddingus 9 hours agorootparentprevRight there myself. One conversion I want to attempt, but am unfortunately unlikely to, is an electric rear wheel drive. Front wheel can remain gas with transmission. Add more generating current capacity, and have that dumped into the rear drive system batteries. With my current car, the V6 gets very good economy at speed, and poor economy in town or in traffic. An assist from the rear can tackle the poor economy cases nicely, leaving the rest to the gas engine. Depending on battery capacity, I suppose it could do most in town driving at say 40 and below. reply Gh0stRAT 4 hours agorootparentThis is exactly how Toyota's AWD works in the Sienna these days. It gets 35mpg city and highway, 1mpg less than the front wheel drive Sienna (which, to be fair, is also a hybrid) reply ddingus 2 hours agorootparentGood to know. Does it have EV only range, or just assist? reply don-code 17 hours agorootparentprev87 BMW here. I believe my servo is controlling the throttle cable itself. When the cruise control commands the vehicle to accelerate, the pedal physically moves. It's not my daily driver, but I would absolutely love to one day get another one as a project car - one that's not in such good condition that I'd feel bad removing the engine - and drop an electric motor in it. That likely _would_ become my daily driver. The car's incredibly well made, and a joy to drive. reply InsomniacL 2 hours agorootparentI'm not knocking anyone, but i bet there were people who showed the same level of scepticism to a electric motor being attached to the throttle cable as people do today to electric cars reply dclowd9901 17 hours agorootparentprevYep, you explained it better than I did! It's a really charming setup. reply no_wizard 10 hours agorootparentprevThis makes me wonder what the cost is to convert a vehicle over to biodiesel so it can be ran on used oil. Still green, unlike gas, but restricts the surface area of issues related to modern cars reply mtreis86 4 hours agorootparentMost injection systems are rated for 20% bio aka b20 without voiding the warrantee. Bio beyond that doesn't have enough lubrication so you have to supplement it with a splash of something like 2-stroke oil. It can run for a long time like that without hurting the pump but manufacturers don't support it. Some gas stations sell b20. If you're talking straight veg you need a certain type of injection system for reliability, and even there you're decreasing the life of the pump. Old mechanical pumps work great, first gen cummins, vw 1.6, mercedes om617 machines can run on straight heated veg for a long time with no issues. Electronically controlled mechanical systems like the vw 1.9 tdi can run on it too but might be a bit more finicky about what you're injecting. Assuming you want to make your own bio you'd have to set up a transesterification process where you convert the trans fats out of the oil, that process uses lye so it needs a decent container and is best automated. If you're trying to recover the solvent, which is probably methanol, you'd need a still as well, and decent ventilation. Fully automated with raspi or arduino components is a couple grand or more, prefab units run something like 10k. If rather than bio you're talking straight grease, it is cheaper to clean but more expensive to set up the car. You'd need a second fuel tank, preferably heated depending on climate, some solenoid valves, and a heated fuel filter. And a pile of hoses and wires to connect it all. Maybe a grand or so to set it up depending on driving conditions, kits run 1-2, some are better designed than others. Either way you'd also want some big drums for holding tanks at home where you can let the fluid layers separate and a pump to move them around. Most car washes give away polyethylene 50gal barrels. Most expensive thing in my opinion, is your time and the cost of the oil. You can get something like 5-50gal per week per restaurant, tho most overuse the oil. Best places don't cook meats in there at all. Chain and large restaurants want a schedule. Cost of the oil varies, used to be paid to take it, somewhere around 2010 that inverted and now you pay for the oil. reply WarOnPrivacy 20 hours agorootparentprev> 89 BMW ... and an 83 Land Cruiser I'm with you. Our daily drivers are 2011 Mitsu, 96 Toyota, 92 Buick and a 63 Dart. Also a 61 Sunliner for when it's not-summer. The Mitsu is unfortunately drive-by-wire; I mostly avoid it. reply floydnoel 6 hours agorootparentThe Cybertruck is the only vehicle on the market that has drive-by wire. There was previously an Infiniti model that was partially drive by wire. reply _huayra_ 3 hours agorootparentI'm guessing that car is \"drive-by-wire\" via the throttle, which has not been an actual cable in most cars for decades at this point. Steer-by-wire is indeed just the cybertruck at this point afaik. reply rpcope1 3 hours agorootparentprevAlmost every early electronic throttle like that drives like pure ass, and newer ones are hit or miss at best. Toyota seems have done a decent job with it, but everyone else kind of keeps pooching it. That falls in with a lot of stuff that felt like it might have made sense on race cars that I don't understand why people keep asking for on street vehicles (drive by wire throttle, CVTs, huge wheels with rubber band tires, certain kinds of traction and stability control, viscous coupled or electronic \"all wheel drive\" (not 4WD), along with the Subaru boxer 4 people get Stockholm syndrome over); all I can figure is that people are just OK driving stuff that drives and behaves like total shit. reply volemo 10 hours agorootparentprevHow large is your family? Why do you need so many cars? reply sgt 9 hours agorootparentPeople who have many cars usually don't do it because of necessity, but because they love tinkering with the old automobiles. reply cratermoon 3 hours agorootparentAt peak teenager/young adult time my family owned six cars. That's for two adults and three driving-age kids. The sixth car was something my dad, who was an old-school motor head of the sort who grew up using feeler gauges, just kept around for no obvious reason but to tinker now and then. reply dclowd9901 2 hours agorootparentprevBingo. reply KumaBear 19 hours agoparentprevThat whole system looks like what we install on police patrol cars. Left switch allows you to keep car running even when keys are removed (but you can’t drive it will kill the ignition). GPS is for obvious reasons tracking.

The \"expectation of privacy\" in public doesn't refer to losing all your rights and letting anyone peek into anything when they want to.

And ICE engines are heavy, so it typically is reasonable to work out as the lighter engine compensates for the battery weight. It is a design task, not a project killer. reply ndsipa_pomu 5 hours agorootparentIf modern EVs are anything to go by, the battery weight will be substantially more than the weight of an ICE engine plus gearbox etc. But yes, it'd be for the hobbyist to figure out the details and whether it is safe enough to drive. reply nine_k 8 hours agorootparentprevAlso time and expense. reply bluGill 18 hours agorootparentprevYou can convert any ice car to an ev.

TBH, it is probably less true with a lot of EVs than it was with the gas cars. ECUs are pretty strict and sometimes hard to hack. Meanwhile, third party motor controllers for Tesla motors exist, and the batteries aren't exactly magic. There's really nothing about electric drivetrains that makes anything vastly more locked down. reply p1necone 14 hours agorootparentYeah if the world went in the direction that prepper types seem to get wet dreams about petrol ICE cars would only be usable for a year or so - petrol has a shelf life, and you ain't running your own refinery. A lot of diesels can run off of any vaguely fuel-like liquid you decide to put in them, so I'm sure sufficiently knowledgable people would keep those running, machining parts for them etc. But electric vehicles are by far simpler than both of those, and generating electricity is easier than producing fuel you can shove in a diesel engine. reply snozolli 2 hours agorootparentpetrol ICE cars would only be usable for a year or so The Internet really overstates this. Fuel injected systems are sealed. Carbureted systems are open to outside air, so the fuel is constantly evaporating, leaving residue behind, and absorbing moisture from the atmosphere.

The Luddites weren't fighting progress, they were fighting to keep themselves and their descendants from destitution. Alas, since technology was involved and technology is magic, the misconception about the Luddites has spread wide and persists to date, conveniently distracting everyone from what the actual problem was.

My Toyota was older than the Honda, both similar mileage, but the Honda failed earlier. Transmission. :( I came back to Toyota, but wanting some of the creature comforts offered by Honda, I chose Camry this time. Excellent car. It's a serious, understated, very unassuming vehicle. It performs, feels better than a Corolla did, and still lacks the subtle things like gear ratios that are a bit more fun. I live where one can put a half mil on a car, if it's up for it. Damn near did that on a Ford Expedition 2000's era vehicle. Guzzled gas, but man! I loved that one for a ton of reasons. Being an active family at the time, the Expy made sense. For me having the thing just go when I do the maintenance properly matters more than the other aspects do. So, Toyota it is! *I buy used, 10 to 20 years back, moderate to low mile cars, under $5k. No new vehicles for me. They simply do not make sense. Now, current Toyota might be a turn-off for me too. The quality issues playing out right now seem worrisome. I hope they get past that. I'm driving 2000 era vehicles because that was the sweet spot for people like me who will do their own work a majority of the time. I enjoy that, and I know it's done right.

I didn't say anything at all about that term in my comment, and while the article says it's hyperbolic, arguing about that term is clearly not the focus of the article. Just going to quote the whole opener here - it's about the claim that the law enables cops to monitor you and shut down your car, which is clearly false. --------------- [Headline] Posts distort infrastructure law’s rule on impaired driving technology CLAIM: President Joe Biden signed a bill that will give law enforcement access to a “kill switch” that will be attached to ALL new cars in 2026. AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. While the bipartisan infrastructure bill Biden signed last year requires advanced drunk and impaired driving technology to become standard equipment in new cars, experts say that technology doesn’t amount to a “kill switch,” and nothing in the bill gives law enforcement access to those systems. THE FACTS: In November 2021, Biden signed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, ushering into law a $1 trillion bipartisan deal to maintain and upgrade the country’s roads, bridges, ports and more. One provision in the legislation aims to prevent drunk driving deaths by requiring all new vehicles to soon include “advanced drunk and impaired driving prevention technology” as “standard equipment.” However, in the months since the law passed, some social media users have misrepresented the provision online, falsely claiming it will give police access to data collected by the technology or allow the government to shut down cars remotely. “Joe Biden signed a bill that would give law enforcement access to a ‘kill switch’ that will be attached to ALL new cars in 2026,” read several posts shared widely on Twitter and Facebook. reply AnthonyMouse 11 hours agorootparent> Just going to quote the whole opener here - it's about the claim that the law enables cops to monitor you and shut down your car, which is clearly false. That's just the straw man the article is using to claim that it isn't a kill switch. They want the claim to be false so they adopt a version of the claim with a flaw in order to knock it down. The obvious problem being that the actual implementation is at least as bad. Now you have the law mandating that the car activate the kill switch by itself, with no human in the loop you can even try to reason with. What happens when you're driving erratically because you're on some dangerous ice road and trigger a false positive that strands you in the wilderness? What happens when you're actually impaired and then turn around to discover a wildfire approaching your location, in which case \"don't die in a fire\" should override \"don't drive impaired\" and you should immediately evacuate, but your car won't let you? It's an ill-conceived and dangerous law and its critics are in the right.

So... a kill switch. It's not a kill switch, the link you provided explains that it's not a kill switch, yet you still call it a kill switch. If you were paying any attention, then you know that idiots online were portraying this as the cops being able to remotely disable your car at their will. In fact, the requirement is for the vehicle to pull safely to the side of the road when it detects an impaired driver (DUI or medical emergency). There is no external initiation, it's entirely self-contained. It's not a kill switch. It's not remotely like a kill switch.

(If I've mischaracterized or misunderstood, my apologies; please correct me.) Let's take some two hopefully-simple examples: speed limiters on cars, and guns. I agree with you when it comes to speed limiters on cars. We shouldn't have them, and government should not be allowed to mandate them. Sure, some people drive too fast for conditions, and that's dangerous, and sometimes they hurt or kill other people by doing so. But we can combat this to some extent with education, licensing requirements, and the threat of penalties for when something bad happens. And I can think of several situations (emergency or otherwise) where someone might be justified in driving faster than a speed limiter might allow, and if the limiter was in place, that could also have bad consequences. But then let's look at guns. They are designed to injure and kill; that is their main intended purpose. Most gun deaths, IIRC, are attributed to suicides and accidental discharges (the latter of which often involve children; I am definitely not a \"think of the children!\" type person, but I think in this case it might actually apply). Other gun deaths involve mass shootings, gang violence, and other criminal activity. The threat of home invasions is highly overblown, and the vast majority of the people who buy them to keep at home for protection will never need them (and will sometimes be involved in accidents or other unintended bad uses). People (in the US, primarily) who think that they need guns to protect them from a tyrannical government are delusional (if the government/military really did try to violently oppress them, the idea that they'd be able to successfully fight back is laughable). There are lots of different types of guns, from small-caliber, small-capacity weapons that don't do quite as much damage; up to semi-auto and auto \"military style\" weapons that can be used to kill large numbers of people in a fairly short amount of time. I don't think I'll ever be convinced that we shouldn't have any restrictions on gun ownership, and I would probably not even be bothered by the idea of a complete ban on private gun ownership (obviously not constitutionally possible here in the US). But as a middle ground, I at least support strict licensing and background-check requirements for firearm ownership, and I think that certain classes of weapons should be restricted from private ownership. I don't intend this to turn into a political discussion about gun control, but I just think it's weird to consider every possible kind of restriction on freedom in the same way, without critically examining what is being restricted, what it is designed to, what kind of harm a lack of restrictions will cause, and what are the negative/unintended consequences of putting those restrictions in place. A few specific comments: > I've realized with time that while drivers can be dangerous, they are relatively limited in how much harm they can create. This just doesn't ring true to me. Car-related fatality statistics paint a very different picture to me. > I honestly rather want everyone including me to have freedom to do stupid things instead of limiting freedom. Maybe this is where the disconnect is, and where we might not be able to agree on anything. The problem with this kind of statement is that it doesn't acknowledge that personal freedoms can come at a cost to other people. If I screw something up in the exercise of my freedoms, it usually doesn't just hurt me: others get caught up in it too. My \"freedoms\" should include being able to live my life in peace, without other people destroying that peace, as long as I am not hurting anyone else. Unfortunately that can't be done without putting restrictions on what I and others can do in many situations. reply salawat 20 hours agorootparentprevYour e-bike shouldn't be limited.

Even if it's an empty limited access highway and the speed limit is set too low because whatever government runs the road can't be bothered to update it to reflect the current circumstances? Sure, if a cop catches me (or a monitoring camera does) doing these things, I get a ticket and have to pay a fine.

If they were about actual safety, then I wouldn't get a ticket for violating the letter of a traffic law when there was negligible risk of actual harm.

When your mobile device connects to the Internet, the connection tunnels through the mobile network to a gateway specified by the \"APN\" (access point name). This is usually set up automatically these days, but you can dig the setting out of your phone. That's for an Internet connection - however a company can pay for a \"private APN\". This is still a gateway, but they control what it connects to. This is often done for machine to machine connections, e.g. for utility smart meters - so a SIM for a gas meter will not be provisioned for the normal Internet APN, and if you were able to get that SIM out (difficult as they are not usually in card format) you would not be able to connect to the Internet. Typically the equipment company will negotiate a cheaper data price than for Internet access, since the data usage will be low and predictable. Now it could be that the people who built this tracking device are too small scale to negotiate a deal, or just don't know this, but my guess is that (a) the SIM is not in a physical format which can be removed and fitted in a different device; and (b) it is connected to a private APN which is not connected to the Internet. BTW, if you look up the Wikipedia article, bear in mind that it is a bit inaccurate - for instance it refers to an APN as being a gateway to the Internet, which is not always true. I'll correct it some time. reply throwaway984393 15 hours agorootparentCars now have cell modems that you can hook up to select telecom providers to turn your car into a hotspot, so those cell modems/SIMs do have an APN for internet data reply realityking 21 hours agoparentprevIt’s surprisingly common for SIMs in IoT devices to not be locked down.

We have an agreement to pay for all legitimate traffic at a contractual rate, but the device manufacturer actually owns the connection and pays for the data themselves.

As for people who have said “oh she should have charged for the storage” - that would have been nice, but that wasn’t the agreement, and French law treats a verbal agreement as a contract, and also places the onus in this type of situation on the person holding the goods to make extensive efforts to contact the owner and/or their heirs. reply sidewndr46 20 hours agorootparentprevWhy?

    "originBody": "Breaking the 4Chan CAPTCHA Fri Nov 29 2024authored by blackjack Introduction This project was entered into as a learning experience, to enhance my knowledge of machine learning, as well as TensorFlow specifically. At the end, I wanted to have a trained machine learning model that runs in the browser to reliably (at least 80% accuracy, >90% preferred) solve the 4Chan CAPTCHA. These goals were achieved - let's talk about how I got there! If you'd like to follow along with the code references, I have made the code public on GitHub here. Terminology CAPTCHA: A challenge-response test to determine whether or not a computer or website user is a human. The acronym stands for Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart. 4Chan: A public, anonymous imageboard website with discussion boards on various topics. These boards are used for posting images and text discussions. Filling out a CAPTCHA is required before every post or reply. Normal CAPTCHA: The simplest form of the 4Chan CAPTCHA, that consists of an image with 5 or 6 alphanumeric characters. The user must read and correctly enter all of the characters in a field in order to make a post on 4Chan. Slider CAPTCHA: A more complex form of the 4Chan CAPTCHA, that consists of a background image with random-looking character fragments, and a foreground image with transparent \"holes\" or \"windows\" in it. A slider in the browser CAPTCHA form must be moved to correctly align the two images in order to see the CAPTCHA text. Getting the Data I've heard many times that the hardest part of any machine learning problem is getting the data to train your model. This assertion was definitely pertinent here, for several reasons. There's two parts to this problem: Getting the CAPTCHAs, and getting solutions to those CAPTCHAs. Scraping CAPTCHAs from 4Chan After looking at the HTTP requests in the browser console when requesting a new CAPTCHA, I found that it makes a request to https://sys.4chan.org/captcha?framed=1&board={board}, where {board} is the name of the board we're trying to post on. The response is an HTML document that contains a script tag with a window.parent.postMessage() call with some JSON. On a hunch, I tried to remove the framed=1 parameter, and found that this causes it to just spit out the raw JSON. That should be easier to work with. The JSON looks like this: { \"challenge\": \"[some long and random string here]\", \"ttl\": 120, \"cd\": 5, \"img\": \"[a base64 string here]\", \"img_width\": 300, \"img_height\": 80, \"bg\": \"[a base64 string here]\", \"bg_width\": 349 } Some of these keys are pretty obvious. ttl and cd are the least obvious to me. I know from experience that the 4Chan CAPTCHA only displays for about 2 minutes before it expires and you have to request a new one, so that's what ttl must be. But what about cd? Let's make another request, shortly after the first one: { \"error\": \"You have to wait a while before doing this again\", \"cd\": 23 } If I keep making the same request, the cd parameter steadily decreases, at a rate of about 1 per second. Alright, so this is how long you have to wait before requesting a new CAPTCHA. cd likely stands for \"cooldown\". If I wait the 23 seconds, and then make another request, I get a successful response, but this time, the cd is 32. We have to wait longer every time. After some experimentation with a script, it looks like the first few requests can be made every 5 seconds, then it increments to 8, and then continues to roughly double until it's capped at 280 seconds, and stays there. Additionally, once you've hit the 280 second timers, the CAPTCHA gets somewhat harder. It looks like this: Difficult 4Chan CAPTCHA with several horizontal lines and an oval obscuring the text, in addition to general noise all over the image instead of this: Easier 4Chan CAPTCHA with one curved line over the text, in addition to general noise all over the image So, there's some throttling in place. The data also gets of lower (but still usable) quality if you make too many requests. Something I will briefly touch on is that the user has to pass a Cloudflare Turnstile challenge to even request a CAPTCHA in the first place. As a result, simply using many proxies with a naive script is not realistic, without first passing the Cloudflare Turnstile and saving the relevant cookies. When I was scraping CAPTCHAs with the script I wrote for this, I simply copied the Cloudflare cookies from my browser, and manually replaced them whenever they expired. I scraped several hundred CAPTCHAs in this manner - not enough to train the model, but it's at least a start. This still leaves us with a problem, though. We have all these CAPTCHAs, but we don't have the solutions. I could fill them out manually, but instead, let's try something else. Getting the Solutions Or, Humans are bad at solving the 4Chan CAPTCHA. A recurring theme in this project has been \"this is easy for a computer to do, but hard for a human to do.\" Many users find the \"slider\" style CAPTCHAs incredibly frustrating, but I've had a 100% success rate in aligning them with the heuristic script I made (trainer/captcha_aligner.py). The 4Chan CAPTCHAs in general are widely considered by users of the site to be frustrating to solve. But, surely, for people who solve CAPTCHAs for a living, it shouldn't be an insurmountable challenge, right? I coded a quick script (seen in the project under trainer/labeler.py) to send the CAPTCHAs to a commercial CAPTCHA solving service, where real humans would solve the CAPTCHAs for me for a nominal fee. Writing the script was simple, but actually employing it was an exercise in frustration. I sent a couple dozen CAPTCHAs to the service, and nearly all of them came back with one or more characters incorrectly solved. The service has a feature called \"100% Recognition\", which allowed me to specify that all my requests be first sent to n workers, and if x of those workers don't return the same solution, then send them to up to y more workers. It would only return an error after sending the CAPTCHAs to n + y workers and not getting at least x solutions the same. I configured my account with the values n = 2, x = 2, and y = 3 - that is, initially send the CAPTCHA to 2 workers, and if they don't both agree, then send them to up to 3 additional workers until two of them agree, or none of them agree. This improved the situation somewhat. About 80% of the CAPTCHAs were now being successfully solved, and after reviewing the results, 90% of those were correct, but about 10% had errors in them, which indicated that multiple workers were making the same mistakes. This was still less than ideal. A quick aside: What if I just ask someone I know to be reliable to do it for me, or even do it myself? I explored both of these approaches. I wrote a quick user script that saved the CAPTCHA image and the solution text, and just sat there requesting and solving CAPTCHAs in my free time. I also asked a good friend of mine to do the same. This yielded several hundred images, which I did add to the training set, but in the end this approach was abandoned because we still ran into the throttling problem, and the problem of the CAPTCHAs getting harder (and eventually, near-impossible) if you request too many of them. I begun to wonder if there was a different way to look at this altogether. What if we didn't need to scrape CAPTCHAs and have them solved by humans? Generating Synthetic Data What if we could generate our own 4Chan CAPTCHAs? 4Chan, and the CAPTCHA it uses, are not open source, so I couldn't literally run the same code locally. But I could definitely approximate it. The 4Chan CAPTCHA can be dissected into two main parts. The background, which looks like this: 4Chan CAPTCHA background with the characters removed, leaving only general noise over the image and the characters, which look like this: 4Chan CAPTCHA character set, the characters 0, 2, 4, A, D, G, H, K, M, N, P, S, X, and Y with general noise and distortion We don't need to generate our own backgrounds from scratch. It's a relatively simple computer vision problem to take an image like the 4Chan CAPTCHA, and find all of the large contours in the image, which represent the characters, and remove them. This leaves only the noisy background, as seen in the image above, which was generated using this algorithm. Next, we need to isolate a decent number of characters, and label them with their values. If this was trivial to do with an algorithmic script, well, we wouldn't be here, because solving the CAPTCHA would also be trivial to do with an algorithmic script :) It's pretty easy to do this by hand, though, and that's what I settled on doing. It was annoying. I tagged the characters with VoTT and then extracted them with a quick and dirty script, which also postprocessed them to make sure it was only the characters in the images. I ended up with 50-150 isolated images of each character. It was during this stage of the project that I realized the 4Chan CAPTCHA includes only the characters 0, 2, 4, A, D, G, H, K, M, N, P, S, X, and Y - likely done to avoid ambiguity. Now we just have to put it all together. When extracting the digits, I observed a few patterns in how the characters are usually clustered or spread apart, and so I wrote my script to assemble images with backgrounds according to these formulas. And, of course, since the input character images are labelled, I can easily label the generated synthetic CAPTCHAs with their solutions. Creating the Model Now we've got the data, it's time to train the model. I assembled a model architecture based on some research, after reading several different articles on CAPTCHA solving using neural networks. I settled on an LSTM CNN architecture with 3 convolutional/max-pooling layers and 2 LSTM layers. A fourth convolutional layer was also tested, but it did not improve performance. CTC encoding of the CAPTCHA text was used, because the output was of variable length (either 5 or 6 characters). I built the model using Keras on top of TensorFlow. Processing the data The input to the model was a mix of pre-aligned slider CAPTCHAs, normal CAPTCHAs, and synthetic CAPTCHAs. The training script took care of ensuring they were 300x80 pixels and converted to pure black-and-white. Always read the docs The arguments might not be in the order you expect. One of the important steps in my data processing pipeline was making sure that all the CAPTCHA images are exactly 300x80 pixels. Some images from the dataset, namely the older aligned \"slider\" CAPTCHAs, don't match this resolution / aspect ratio. I could just fix the training data, but it's better in the end to make the training script able to cope with any data I throw at it. I used tf.image.resize() for this. The docs on this are pretty simple, for my use case I just need to pass the input image tensor, and the size, which is probably just a tuple of (width, height), right? Well, I made that assumption, and the code ran fine, so I didn't really give it a second thought. Until... My model's performance was absolutely abysmal! Even after training for 32+ epochs, the model barely performed at all on images it had seen before, and it really couldn't make anything at all of brand new CAPTCHA images, yielding seemingly random predictions. What the heck was going on? I decided to actually visualize the images I was feeding into the model, and see what they looked like - maybe my black/white thresholding was going wrong? I took a random image from the input data after processing, and visualized it, and I got... this: 4Chan CAPTCHA that is vertically stretched to 80x300 pixels and completely unreadable Yeah, you probably saw that coming as soon as I said \"probably just a tuple of (width, height)\". Turns out it's not. It is, in fact, a tuple of (height, width)! Had I taken the time to read the whole documentation page, I would have found this near the bottom of the page, where it provides more detail on the expected argument. This is definitely a lesson learned - read the documentation thoroughly when working with libraries you're unfamiliar with, even if you think you know how it works, and especially if things aren't working how you'd expect. After fixing this bug, the training performance looked a lot more promising. Training the model The final dataset consisted of approximately 500 hand-solved images, and approximately 50,000 synthetically-generated images. The synthetic images were generated based on random samples from approximately 2,500 background images and 50-150 images of each character. This dataset was randomly shuffled, and then segmented 90/10 into training and evaluation sets. Training took approximately 45 seconds per epoch on my NVIDIA RTX A4000 Laptop GPU. At the end of the first epoch, the loss did not look very promising - it's still all the way up at 19. During the evaluation callback phase, predictions were nowhere near correct, yielding only 1-2 predicted characters that didn't match any of the characters in the image. This is to be expected during the early stages of training. Later epochs greatly improved performance. By the end of the fourth epoch, loss decreased to 0.55, and the predictions were already looking good, with 5/5 of the random test predictions at this stage yielding correct results. Loss steadily decreased throughout the rest of the training epochs. After experimenting with different numbers of epochs, 8-16 epochs was found to be a good trade-off between time and final model performance. Loss stabilized by the 8th epoch, and increasing the epoch count beyond 16 yielded greatly diminishing returns. Graph of model loss versus epochs, showing initial large decrease followed by steady decline and levelling out I wrote a quick test script (trainer/infer.py) to infer CAPTCHA solutions in Python. Results were promising on images the model had not seen before, yielding correct solutions in the limited number of test cases I tried. Using the Model in TensorFlow.js Writing the TensorFlow.js code for the user script was quite straightforward. I chose TypeScript for this task. I re-implemented the CAPTCHA alignment algorithm from the Python code, as well as the image preprocessing code. All of this code is located in the user-scripts/ directory in the repository. The Python TensorFlow/Keras model formats aren't compatible with the model format expected by TensorFlow.js. There's an official conversion script, with instructions on how to use it. This should be easy, right? The converter doesn't work on Python 3.12 This was a pretty simple problem that took awhile to figure out. The official TensorFlow-to-TFJS model converter doesn't work on Python 3.12. This doesn't seem to really be documented, and the error messages thrown when you try to use it on Python 3.12 are non-obvious. I tried an older version of Python (3.10) on a hunch, using PyEnv, and it worked like a charm. TensorFlow.js doesn't support Keras 3 New problem: The conversion script supports converting Keras 3 models to TensorFlow.js format. The only problem? TensorFlow.js doesn't support actually reading those converted models. I found this out from a forum post, after I spent a bit of time puzzling out why TFJS wouldn't read the model that the official conversion script output. Luckily, the solution was easy: Use Keras 2. We can do this by training the model with the environment variable TF_USE_LEGACY_KERAS=1 set, after installing the legacy tf_keras package. This may require some code changes. In my case, I only had to trivially modify one line. We also have to export the model using the legacy .h5 model format, and specify that as the input format when running the conversion script. Real-World Performance We've seen the performance on the training dataset, which consists mainly of synthetic images. But it doesn't matter if it can solve synthetic CAPTCHAs - we care about solving the real ones. Good news: It works great on the real 4Chan CAPTCHA. Solving is fast, taking about 1 second to load the model the first time, and then being imperceptibly quick on subsequent executions. In my experience over hundreds of real CAPTCHAs solved in the browser, the model exhibits a greater than 90% successful solve rate. It rarely gets characters wrong - when it is innacurate, it typically omits a single character entirely. I believe this could be improved with greater training on actual data, or possibly tweaking the CAPTCHA layouts in the synthetic dataset generator. Animation of requesting a CAPTCHA in the 4Chan post form, and it being automatically solved by the user script. Small fun fact: This model has far better accuracy than the human-powered CAPTCHA solving service I described above. 4-character CAPTCHAs While I was writing and editing this article after completing the project, I noticed that 4Chan begun sometimes serving CAPTCHAs with only 4 characters, rather than the usual 5 and 6-character CAPTCHAs. Despite this model only having been trained on 5 and 6-character CAPTCHAs, performance on the 4-character CAPTCHAs is the same as for the 5 and 6-character CAPTCHAs. Conclusion I enjoyed this project a lot. It had a few challenges to overcome, and I learned a ton about machine learning and computer vision in the process. There are surely improvements that can be made, but for now, I'm pleased with the results, because I achieved what I set out to do from the start. I hope you enjoyed reading this write-up as much as I enjoyed writing it, and I hope you learned something too! Find blackjack on:website: https://blackjack.codes/",

Even before captcha is being served your TLS is first fingerprinted, then your IP, then your HTTP2, then your request, then your javascript environment (including font and image rendering capabilities) and browser itself.

Only then it makes sense to analyze captcha's input but by that time you caught 90% of bots either way.

For example: If the user solves the CAPTCHA in 0.0001 seconds, they're definitely a bot. If the user keeps solving every CAPTCHA in exactly 2.0000 seconds, each time makes it increasingly likely that they're a bot. If the user sets the CAPTCHA entry's input.value property directly instead of firing individual key press events with keycodes, they're probably either a bot, copy-pasting the solution, or using some kind of non-standard keyboard (maybe accessibility software?). Basically, even if the CAPTCHA service already has a decent idea of whether the user is a bot, forcing them to solve a CAPTCHA gives the service more data to work with and increases the barrier of entry for bot makers. reply sdk16420 4 hours agorootparentprevI found several websites switched to 'press here until the timer runs out', probably they are doing the checks while the user is holding their mouse pressed, it would be trivial to bypass the long press by itself with automated mouse clickers. reply kccqzy 14 hours agoparentprevThat's what reCAPTCHA does. reply benreesman 10 hours agoprevIn my opinion the granddaddy of all 4chan CAPTCHA busts is still Yannick Kilcher’s GPT-J tune on “Raiders of the Lost Kek” set, and might be the coolest thing an LLM has ever done on video: https://youtu.be/efPrtcLdcdM?si=errY0PrEhnX9ylDw reply chiph 2 hours agoparentNearly a full minute of disclaimers and warnings about 4chan.

We want to see how they react and what they say when they are protected from consequences by the anonymous nature of the forum. We want the full spectrum of humanity, good and bad. The opinions of bots are not just irrelevant, they are a form of consensus creation attack. They make it seem like a lot of people have an opinion when the reality might be the opposite.

No, the other reason they're using this is to make it so annoying that you'll spend $20/yr to buy a 4chan pass to bypass it. If you're not making your free website annoying to drive revenue there's obvious ways to make it less annoying. E.g. keep the annoying captcha, but don't show one again for the lifetime of a cookie, validate users who can make a money transfer of $0.01 etc. reply alekratz 17 hours agorootparent>No, the other reason they're using this is to make it so annoying that you'll spend $20/yr to buy a 4chan pass to bypass it. I think this is a really cynical outlook, especially for a website that is not run as a modern tech-centric company. 4chan's roots are in that of the Old Internet, where it is a creative and messy and interesting place to be. why would they be banking solely on using a terrible captcha as a method to drive user subscriptions, when they have the option to run circus-tent ads? if making money was their sole purpose, why would they not kick the problematic and porn boards to the curb and ban the use of slurs to make room for more friendly advertisers? there are so many other avenues to increase profitability that most websites have taken which 4chan has staunchly refused to follow. why would they choose only the 4chan pass and ads as their only opportunity at making money? reply iterance 16 hours agorootparentDoing so would destroy the culture of 4chan. Companies centered around communities don't generally have leeway to shape their communities into a profitable form by directly altering the fabric of the community. Time and again it has been shown that forcing changes to the identity of a space leads to communities' rapid demise. In rare circumstances and with a skilled hand a community can be guided here and there in even some significant ways, but 4chan probably does not have that option: they'd need a massive shift to pull off what you describe. Instead profit must generally be built around what is there. But whether or not such communities exist to make profit, they surely must be profitable, or they will not survive. They must, some time or another, be free of deficit. This is not a matter of capitalist greed for most communities, but an attempt to find a path towards stability. reply Anon1096 17 hours agorootparentprev> keep the annoying captcha, but don't show one again for the lifetime of a cookie This is already being done, there's a cookie and heuristics in place that will give you an easier captcha or occasionally skip it entirely. But 4chan really does have a couple (and I truly mean a small amount of super super dedicated users) of bad actors who constantly spam and try to work around any roadblocks given to annoy the rest of the userbase.

If you have a dynamic IP address from your ISP, you just spam/derail threads with personal crusades/whatever until you get banned, reset your router and repeat. This countdown increases the cost of ban evasion, since you can't get right back in to continue. Everyone on your targeted board/thread now gets at least a 15-minute respite.

People like Bridget Riley in particular. I saw the big Riley exhibition at the Tate in 2003 and it was fantastic. They had this enormous one-off piece that had been specifically created for this exhibition on the first wall you encountered as you went in. It was basically a massive very bright white wall with a quite spacious grid of 3/4 circles in black. The gap in each circle was rotated as you looked across and up and down the wall. It was such a perculiar optical effect it made your brain hallucinate colours and movement in this purely static, black and white piece. I knew Bridget Riley’s work a bit before going into the exhibition because she was one of the visual artists you learn about when you study 20C music, and so I had seen a few of these op art pieces, but I never expected an illusion to work so well on such a huge scale.

    "originBody": "home Engineering Sleep Background Sleep claims a third of human life. Like water, it’s not a desire but a necessity. Sleep rules virtually every important system: brain, heart, mood, and immunity. Nature’s terms are harsh. Sleep eight hours or face mental and physical decay. Can we rewrite the terms in our favor? Can we sleep less, but still feel refreshed? I believe we can, and that now is the best time to start engineering sleep. Rare mutations suggest a great variation in sleep efficiency between people. A small proportion of the population have Familial Natural Short Sleep (FNSS), a benign mutation that allows them to sleep 1-2 hours less than the recommended 7-9 hours, without experiencing the negative effects of sleep deprivation [1]. Contrary to symptoms of chronic sleep deprivation, people with FNSS are “healthy, energetic, optimistic, with high pain threshold, and do not seem to suffer adverse effects of chronic restricted sleep” [2]. This goes against everything we know about sleep. The most plausible explanation is that people with FNSS are more efficient sleepers. Whichever functions of sleep make it so crucial, they are doing it faster and better. The Sleep Mutation How does FNSS work? Five genes have been implicated in the FNSS phenotype, but DEC2 is the most studied. In 2009, professor Ying-Hui Fu at UCSF discovered a DEC2 point mutation from two individuals in the same family who slept 6.25 hours on average [3]. DEC2 codes for a repressive transcription factor (a protein that inhibits the expression of some gene). Normally, the gene that this transcription factor represses is responsible for expressing orexin, a neurotransmitter. In the mutation, proline is replaced by arginine at position 384 in exon 5 (DEC2P384R), disrupting its ability to repress orexin expression. Consequently, more orexin is expressed in individuals with this mutation. The UCSF group hypothesizes that this elevated level of orexin expression partially explains reduced sleep [4]. Fig 1. In normal humans, Dec2 weakens E12/Myod1’s binding affinity to the Ebox1 promoter site of prepro-orexin, which is responsible for endogenous orexin synthesis. In FNSS mutants, the DEC2P384R interaction with the E12/Myod1 complex is weaker, and there is greater orexin expression. Two decades of sleep research supports the link between orexin and sleep [5]. In both narcolepsy and insomnia, orexin is the key neurotransmitter that modulates awakeness. A deficit of orexin producing neurons is responsible for excessive sleepiness in narcolepsy [6]. An overexpression of orexin is responsible for hypervigilance in insomnia [7]. Throughout the day and night, we move between the wake-sleep axis defined by orexin levels, which are lowest in the middle of the day and highest during the transition from NREM to REM sleep [8]. Orexin is a commercially validated lever for controlling sleep. As of late 2024, there are eight orexin receptor agonists (promotes firing of neuron) in clinical trials for treating narcolepsy and hypersomnia, and two orexin receptor antagonists (inhibits firing of neuron) on the market for treating insomnia. To summarize orexin, too little of it makes you sleepy, and too much of it makes you unable to sleep. But if elevated orexin levels explain reduced sleep in both FNSS carriers and insomniacs, why is one sleep deprived but not the other? We don’t know. Variation in dynamics of when, where, and how much orexin is released could explain the difference. Also, FNSS carriers might have developed compensatory mechanisms to cope with elevated orexin, leading to more efficient sleep. Experiments to reproduce FNSS will give us answers. Reproducing FNSS Given our current knowledge of FNSS, has anyone tried to reproduce it? A true reproduction would be safe and effective over the lifetime of the host, just like we see in the natural phenotype. The closest attempt was by the UCSF group that identified the DEC2P384R mutation. In their pioneering 2009 study, the group embryonically edited human DEC2P384R into transgenic mice and saw a 1-2 hour reduction in sleep. However, we don’t know if it was safe and effective over the lifetime of the mice. They recorded sleep architecture and sleep recovery during a 24-hour window in six to eight month old mice, tracking no other health markers [3]. The study intervened at the embryo level of the host and saw short-term success reproducing FNSS. But what we’re really interested in is adulthood intervention and lifelong efficacy. Giving normal people the ability to sleep more efficiently is the ultimate goal. Expressing the DEC2P384R mutation in normal adult animals and conducting a lifelong study would answer this question. Two possible pathways to reproducing FNSS are reviewed below. Path I: Orexin Agonists Fig 2. Pathway I success case Approach Orally dose orexin receptor agonists. The mechanism leverages direct receptor activation, similar to drugs currently in clinical trials for treating narcolepsy. These small molecules are designed for optimal blood-brain barrier penetration and selective binding to orexin receptors. Unknowns Primarily, we don’t know if elevated orexin levels explain the FNSS phenotype. Also, we don’t know the effects of chronic orexin receptor activation on sleep architecture and cognition. Pharma companies developing orexin agonists have data on short-term sleep effects, but none of them have published data on long term effects [9]. Also unknown are tolerance and withdrawal effects over time: like other receptor agonists (think nicotine), we may see diminishing effects, and withdrawal effects on return to baseline. Finally, variations in individual response are unknown. Path II: Gene Therapy Fig 3. Pathway II success case Approach Replicate the natural FNSS mutation through episomal expression. Episomal expression is when the gene is expressed from a piece of DNA that is outside the cell’s chromosomal DNA. Since chromosomal DNA is left alone, there is no risk of passing down the mutation to offspring. For this approach, we use Adeno-Associated Virus serotype 9 (AAV9) vectors to deliver the DEC2P384R gene to orexin-expressing neurons in adult mice. The vectors (the piece of extra chromosomal DNA) remain in the nucleus, continuously synthesizing the mutant DEC2 protein. This aims to partially mirror the mechanism seen in FNSS. Unknowns We are more certain that DEC2P384R explains FNSS, but we don’t know if expressing it in adulthood works. We also don’t know off-target effects on DEC2-regulated pathways beyond sleep. A specific unknown to episomal expression is the competition dynamics between DEC2P384R and native DEC2. The usual unknowns of variations between individual responses, particularly immune response, apply. Overview of Pathways Too good to be true? Around 90 families with FNSS have been identified to date [10]. If FNSS is truly benign, why is it so rare? Shouldn’t more efficient sleep confer a survival advantage? It could be that the mutation really is benign, but does not help reproductive success. But, the mutation could also have negative fitness effects that are not observed. Fig 4. Fisher-Wright simulation showing allele frequency dynamics with 10% fitness penalty across population sizes (N=100, 1,000, 10,000). Initial carrier frequency 1%, tracked for 20 generations over 100 simulations. Solid lines show means; shaded regions show standard deviations. Under the Fisher-Wright model, harmful mutations can appear neutral when tracking small populations across just a few generations. If the mutation has a tiny effective population size, limited generational depth, and low carrier frequency, it would be hard to distinguish between neutral drift and negative selection. Fortunately, there is no risk of the mutation being passed down to offsprings in either the orexin agonist pathway or the gene therapy pathway. So we can rule out the nightmare scenario of offspring effects gone wrong. Instead, the risks are concentrated in medium to long term health of individuals who undergo therapy. As of now, we simply don’t have enough data to profile risk factors. More experiments are needed to know if “FNSS for all” is too good to be true. Where is my better sleep? People with FNSS are living proof that we don’t need 7-9 hours of sleep to be healthy. We already don’t get enough sleep. 34% of Americans are chronically sleep deprived [11]. What if they could keep sleeping less, but with no consequences? That’s possible with advanced sleep engineering. Here’s what else would be possible: falling asleep and waking at will, sleeping 4 hours but feeling like you slept 8 hours, always in perfect mental and physical condition. Considering the huge upside of engineering sleep, an unreasonably small number of experiments have studied FNSS. Due to their relatively singular effect on sleep, FNSS mutations are a gold mine for studying sleep. But, there have been only two attempts to mimic FNSS outside of Fu et al: a study that found better memory consolidation in sleep deprived mice [12], and another that found greater longevity in flies [13]. None have been lifetime studies in mammals, which are most relevant to therapy development. 15 years after its pioneering work that identified DEC2P384R, Ying-Hui Fu’s lab is the only group that came close to reverse engineering FNSS. Perhaps this represents what J Storss Halls called a “civilizational failure of nerve”, where institutions become pathologically risk-averse, more focusing on preventing downside risks than enabling upside potential [14]. Scientific and technological progress rests on the willingness to experiment. If existing institution’s won’t give us better sleep, we should build ones that do.

Sleep deprivation is one concern, but there’s a more subtle impact on cognitive functions (working memory, creativity, deep focus), overall health (particularly the endocrine and immune systems), and long-term health outcomes (such as an increased risk of dementia). When I was younger, I was fascinated by various optimized sleep schedules. However, I noticed a stark contrast: many of my math friends consistently slept 9–10 hours a day. They needed that—not just to function in daily life but to achieve the deep focus required for their work. Living on less sleep might not affect immediate action (and in some cases, it might even seem to enhance focus on doing), but it can impair deeper, more complex thinking. Some suggest that one of sleep's key roles is to help the brain regenerate. Chronic sleep deprivation, in turn, is linked to a higher risk of dementia. For anecdotal evidence: Churchill and Thatcher, known for boasting about sleeping only 4–5 hours a night, experienced significant cognitive decline later in life. reply Aurornis 4 hours agoparent> When I was younger, I was fascinated by various optimized sleep schedules. I was also fascinated with alternate sleep schedules when I was younger. Some of the books and biohackers of the time made them sound like magical ways to get more hours out of the day. Then every single experience report I found that was not coming from someone trying to sell me a book or get me to subscribe to their newsletter, YouTube, or other social media was extremely negative. Nobody who tried these had continued them very long. After going back to regular sleep schedules they felt significantly better. A common report was that they didn’t realize how badly sleep deprived they were until they stopped the alternate sleep schedule and went back to normal sleep. A lot of the sleep biohacking reports follow a similar trend: People who try alternate methods of minimizing sleep don’t realize the negative effects until they quit. This is also true for people who rely on stimulants (caffeine or stronger) which mask feelings of sleep deprivation but can’t actually reverse the negative effects of sleep deprivation. reply djtango 5 hours agoparentprevThis is true, I was neighbours with one of the top mathematicians in my uni and he slept what felt like an excessive amount everyday. I definitely underperformed academically due to sleep deprivation and I probably benefited greatly during my revision period because I had a very strong sleep routine. That said, I entered my final exam having only slept probably less than two hours and that was 100% the right call because the extra cramming was necessary and drove the needle significantly. reply vacuity 3 hours agorootparentSleep deprivation affects many different things, some of which are salvageable with stimulants like caffeine, and certain functions are fairly unaffected.

As someone with clinically-diagnosed insomnia, I've been lucky enough to/unfortunate enough to have to try the orexin receptor antagonist sleep aids for a while. As recent, on-patent drugs, they are very, very expensive ($360/month was the number marked on the receipt slip, not that that means much in the US; I certainly wasn't paying that)... and they work. They really, really do work. I was prescribed them because I tried every single other class of sleep aid on the market and they were mostly ineffective, had massive side effects, or were benzos (temazepam: best sleep of my life, but better not use it for longer than a month!). This stuff? Orexin receptor antagonists? They work. Holy crap, do they ever work. Sleep quality better than the Z-drugs, great tolerability, no massive disruption going off them... when these things go off-patent they're going to be massive. Sleep quality was not perfect (maybe 80% of \"normal\"? I don't know) but that is absolutely minor compared to the alternative. (And for the record, I'm off them now due to other stuff clearing up such that I don't need this level of sleep assistance anymore. Not because I can't afford them.) I guess that's a long-winded way to say that if you're going to do questionably-advised sleep biohacking, orexin receptors are probably the place to start. reply rsyring 3 hours agoparent> As recent, on-patent drugs, they are very, very expensive ($360/month...

If you sleep 30% of the time, that's 30% of the time you aren't eating, mating, etc. Also, during sleep you are more vulnerable to predators. One would expect evolution to get rid of sleep in creatures who don't rely on sunlight cycles. So, there must be some really good evolutionary reason for sleep. reply JumpCrisscross 4 hours agoparent> during sleep you are more vulnerable to predators Marine mammals sleep unihemispherally [1]. Land mammals can burrow, et cetera, which explains why predation and injury risk decrease during sleep. (Counterfactual: \"large animals that are not at risk for predation, such as big cats and bears, can sleep for long periods, often in unprotected sites and appear to sleep deeply\" (Id.).

Is there some really important reason many animals have brains in their head (versus elsewhere in their body), or is it that many species happen to be derived from some ancestor who had that trait. Another way to ask this would be how much of a benefit would be not sleeping? It's difficult to preserve food, but I guess there is no limit on how much energy you can expend pursuing a mate. reply jlpom 4 hours agoparentprevRepairing cellular damage (mitochondrial and main DNA) from oxidation thanks to slower metabolism is the main reason.

That does imply that it must also be good for the animal, right? In order to statistically benefit the population, the benefits to any given animal must statistically outweigh the costs. It can’t be all bad for all animals and still be good for the whole. But sleep can be partially bad for some animals, they can be more prone to becoming prey while sleeping (though Google tells me sleep also prevents nighttime activity where predators have the advantage). There are definitely evolutionary adaptations around sleep to make it safer, sleeping in trees, sleep patterns & duration, hypnic jerk, etc. reply jampekka 2 hours agorootparentprevI don't know why this is downvoted. It's entirely feasible that weaknesses in a species (or its individuals) may be beneficial for the ecosystem and hence survival of the species in the long term. E.g. rabbit population being culled by predators may prevent the rabbits from eating their feed plants to extinction. reply pedalpete 2 hours agoprevI work in the sleep space, particularly enhancing slow-wave sleep - the synchronous firing of neurons which define deep sleep, the most restorative and vital component of sleep. Only focusing on the amount of time asleep is a significantly limited viewpoint, but I believe this will change in the coming years as we gather more knowledge of sleep and access to EEG data about our brain activity during sleep increases. Only measuring sleep time is like measuring the health of a persons diet is by measuring how much time they spent eating, but of course, looking at macronutrients, calories, is the right way of doing it. I'll be writing more about this in the coming months, but my current thinking is that the concept of \"can we sleep less\" isn't the correct approach, and can be dangerous. At AffectableSleep.com - we increase the efficiency of deep sleep, and much of the research (https://affectablesleep.com/research) focuses on enhancing deep sleep in sleep deprived individuals (I'll post more research soon). This doesn't mean we should be sleeping less. A lack of quality sleep is already an epidemic in society, and massively underreported because the focus of the sleep industry has been the amount of time asleep, not the restorative functions of sleep. Our goal isn't to help you sleep less, and we will need to be very clear in our marketing, but rather to ensure the sleep you get is as restorative as possible. Of course, like any technology, some people will use it for negative purposes, which I believe would be to just \"get by\" on less sleep, rather than optimize your health through better sleep.

The last product I tried was the Philips deep sleep headband (which, unfortunately, never appeared in Netherlands, I had to import it from the US even though Philips is a Dutch company). The main problem I had was that the headband is not compatible with ear plugs. Without ear plus, I get woken up very easily, either by outside traffic or by people in the household going to the toilet. The sound insulation in my house is terrible, and it cannot be improved short of tearing down all the walls and rebuilding them. So now I use a pair of really good ear plugs, and I also put a noise cancelling head phone over that to block out extra sounds.

This appears to cause them to inappropriately enter REM sleep. OP notes that the mutation lowering the sleep requirement causes an increase in orexin. I wonder whether the increased orexin could be inhibiting REM and perhaps facilitating a more restful architecture of sleep. Alternatively, perhaps elevated orexin levels during the day cause wakefulness such that you just don't need as much sleep, regardless of how efficient the sleep is. It would be interesting to compare sleep tracking data of people with and without this mutation to see if there are significant differences in time spent in different sleep stages. reply jlpom 4 hours agoparent> Alternatively, perhaps elevated orexin levels during the day cause wakefulness such that you just don't need as much sleep, regardless of how efficient the sleep is. As noted elsewhere ITT, there is a strong biological need for sleep, and its main role is very likely to reduce reactive oxygen species (though the amount needed vary by genetics) Orexin levels increase the noradrenaline ones, which is one of the few antioxidants able to reach neurons (along with melatonin) and by this way also increase slow wave sleep, making it more efficient.

And according to my smartwatch, I spend around 2 hours dreaming and 1 hour in deep sleep each night, although this varies quite a bit night to night.

However, I have researched this before and the most consistent answer I get is that we don't really know what the 5 hours spent in light sleep is for.

Just a thought. reply kator 8 hours agoprevThis article makes me want to get a DNA test. In my family, it’s very common to sleep in the six-hour range. I personally sleep from 10 pm to 4:25 am every day, often waking up around 4:15 am before my watch vibrates to wake me. If I sleep eight hours, I feel groggy, jet-lagged, and generally have a day where I’m slogging through molasses to get from one task to the next. My wife has raised concerns about my sleep pattern, so I started using sleep-tracking tools like Fitbit and, more recently, an Apple Watch. She tracks her sleep too, and the big difference we’ve noticed is that I fall asleep within about two minutes, and my “sleep efficiency” using these tools is 98%. If I’m traveling and feel a bit jet-lagged, I can take a 20-minute nap (often without an alarm) and wake up feeling refreshed. She also seems to wake up a lot, most nights I \"sleep like a log\" and I only wakeup in the morning. My mother has the same pattern but stays up later and sleeps about six hours into the morning. I used to do this too, but around age 23, I switched to an earlier bedtime and a consistent daily routine. When I became a “morning person,” I found I could code like crazy in the morning before “starting” my day, and this rewarding experience reinforced the habit. I’ve tested this pattern in many ways, including not using an alarm (I still wake up around the same time for weeks at a time) and using a “light clock” I built with a Raspberry Pi to slowly brighten the room. Again, I wake up after roughly 6 hours and 20 minutes. Now, I use my Apple Watch to vibrate as a gentle reminder to start the day. On weekends, I keep the same schedule and use the extra time to read or hack away at side projects, often coding until the late afternoon when my wife protests enough that I need to stop and hang out or do my honey-do's. About 10 years ago, during my annual checkup, my wife asked my doctor about this sleep pattern. The doctor asked me several questions, seemingly looking for signs of sleep deficit or dysfunction. In the end, he said I could do a sleep study but concluded, “If it works, don’t break it.” As for productivity, I’ve found I can code effectively from 4:30 am to 8:30 am, then shower and work from 9 am to 6 pm without much trouble. I also practice intermittent fasting, typically eating only at 6 pm, with a protein shake around noon. This habit happened by accident—I realized breakfast slowed me down, and eating lots of carbs impaired my cognitive function and ability to code or handle complex tasks in the morning. Before you ask, I generally don’t use caffeine or other stimulants. Occasionally, I’ll have one cup of coffee around 9 am as a social habit, but I recently stopped that again and actually feel better. I’ll most likely drop it again for a while until it sneaks back in again. reply clumsysmurf 11 hours agoprevRecently this came up on sleep deprivation : \"preemptive administration of low-dose aspirin during sleep restriction reduced pro-inflammatory responses.

There are hypotheses out there that a single 8h block of sleep is a myth - possibly socially induced by industrialisation and 3x8 shifts - and that waking up in the middle of these 8h is a normal thing. \"waking up\" here may mean anything from near-consciousness sleep to actually waking up and possibly do shit for an hour then going back to bed; or even for some, splitting sleep in two 4-hour blocks spread around the 24h day. In parent's post it may be that one 4h block is done, then social pressure (work/child schedules) pushes one to continue with this one-block schedule. It may even look appealing as triggering sleep through exhaustion superficially appears to help with sleep in the short term. Long term it gets exhausting but this perceptually becomes the new normal, especially when the symptoms of this kind of sleep deprivation aren't that obviously tied to sleep habits, the naively expected ones being masked by external pressure (schedule), habit bias (normalisation of deviance through repetition), exogenic (alcohol, caffeine, nicotine) or endogenic (adrenalin, cortisol, dopamine).

As a result niches develop and as each generation survives compared to their peers their survival strategies are optimized. Optimization perfectly describes what is happening to the survivability and reproduction of certain genes. You appear to be working backwards. That there was a niche and evolution somehow crafted an organism to fit that niche. That is misleading. Genes replicate, and in a certain context some genes survived and replicated better than in some other context. So genes evolved in that new context creating a niche. reply naming_the_user 10 hours agorootparentprevSorry, I edited my post a bit so what you've quoted isn't there any more but I agree fully with what you're saying. I guess what would be cool is being able to play with the sliders. People already do this in other ways, for example people at the extreme end of bodybuilding or strongman are almost certainlhy explicitly shortening their lifespans for a shorter term benefit, calorie restriction looks like it lets you go the other way, etc. Maybe you could even fiddle and have 16 hours of sleep and overclock your brain for the other 8 being super-intelligent, lol. reply mewpmewp2 5 hours agorootparentprevUnless there's some huge evolutionary inefficiency that can be artificially hacked.

My two daughters, 5yo and 3.5yo, both sleep from \"as late as they can get away with\" to \"about an hour earlier than parents would like to wake up\".

My whole life I have been shaving my sleep time to try to cram more of what I want to do into my day. I used to wake up an extra couple of hours before school so I could squeeze in extra gaming time. On holiday I regularly sacrifice sleep to extreme levels to do more. This isn't some kind of box ticking behaviour with its roots originating from toxic hustle culture, simply the adverse effects of sleep deprivation don't outweigh my enjoyment of things. And when my sleep debt finally catches up with me, I sleep my heart's delight. From experience, I have friends who share in my world view and threshold for sacrificing sleep for pleasure and I have met people who think are mortified by this behaviour. My immediate family are all willing to sacrifice sleep on the drop of the hat notably - waking up at the crack of dawn to send/accompany someone to the airport is simply modus operandi. My wife is very keen to protect her sleep on the flipside and so when we travel together our decision frameworks need to accommodate both MOs Ironically sometimes I'm most protective of my sleep during the weekly grind (and also training for fitness) because then my performance matters. If my only short term downside is discomfort from fatigue, I'll regularly trade that for more \"uptime\" reply necovek 4 hours agorootparentI hear you, but the thing is, what do you achieve by \"cramming\" more \"doing\" in? Do you also switch to those nutrient rich powder meals to save an extra hour or two prepping and eating food too? Are not all of those things that could be optimized away an opportunity to let yourself feel, relax and simply be? The examples you bring up (like waking early to do something for someone you care about) has nothing to do with the topic of engineering for consistently reduced sleep, imho. reply necovek 4 hours agorootparentprevI never said we couldn't and I did not refer only to work: it's still the wrong goal in my mind. \"Fun\" is usually defined as something providing instant gratification (through hormonal response), though there is fun in retrospect too (\"I was scared like shit, that was fun\"). And while it's nothing to sneeze at and we should always have some, you can achieve the similar with different medications or narcotics (if the goal is \"have more fun\"). But I wouldn't optimize for that: we can achieve plenty in our lives, including having plenty of fun, by just being ourselves. As in, get the sleep you need. Do the work you must and the work you enjoy. Have the fun you want. While our lifetimes are short, they are not that short. Even if we got 10% more of the waking hours, that won't be the thing that makes your life worthwhile or not. If you spent the other 90% making it worthwhile, that'll do.

    "originBody": "The deterioration of Google 7 November 2024 – Baldur Bjarnason google This post announcing the closure of Giant Freakin Robot set me on a bit of a journey into the state of Google. “The End Of Independent Publishing And Giant Freakin Robot” GIANT FREAKIN ROBOT isn’t the first site to shut down. Hundreds of independent publishers have shuttered in the last two years, and thousands more are on the way. I’m in communication with dozens of other independents focused on different topics. None of them are doing well. They all expect to be out of business soon. I went to Google directly, on their behalf, and told them about the problem. The message I walked away with, was that they do not care. Our industry is done. What I discovered was that web media companies can’t count on any of the traffic coming from Google or Facebook any more. Very few, even one that are frugally run, are capable of surviving on the traffic that remains. The problem doesn’t seem limited to a few sites. What seems to have happened is that Google tried to “fix” their search engine results by using machine learning to rank sites. From What we can learn from the Google creators summit for HCU impacted sites: We know that the helpful content system was a machine learning (AI) system. Machine learning systems are trained by seeing good examples and bad examples. They then work to figure out the characteristics they can consider and how much weight to give them so as to predict whether an unseen example is a good one or a bad one. But this does not seem to be working properly. Anybody who has used Google for search over the past year knows that it lets a lot of LLM-generated spam through and blogs and small sites have basically disappeared from most results. Those sites have effectively been delisted by the machine learning model and nobody seems to know exactly why. Some have been hit hard. From “I Drank the Kool-Aid at the 2024 Google Web Creator Summit”: I’m 44 years old, luckily I don’t have a mortgage, I barely getting by, I’m eating at the food bank now, I had grossed $250,000 last year and I just don’t know where to go from here my traffic is down 97% Even if your first reaction might be “good riddance” these are all people whose work Google wants to see in the search engine results. That’s why they were invited to the summit. An exchange on Twitter, which I usually avoid but is where this crowd seems to still be congregating, describing a scene from the summit captured the situation perfectly: Lily Ray: I’m still stuck on “your content wasn’t the issue.” What? Morgan: So, so many times they said this. Literally Danny hand picked us because we all create helpful and satisfying content. They just cannot get the algorithm to understand that. They are actively doing query debugging based on examples sent by our group. Morgan: Literally Danny said he sat with an engineer team with examples of people in the room and said why aren’t they showing up and they did their “debugging process” and couldn’t figure it out. Morgan: the robots are winning. The “algorithm” seems to have become a black box even Google engineers can’t figure out The fact that over a year ago ML experts at Google (El-Mahdi El-Mhamdi at least, if I recall correctly) who have since left warned that LLMs should be avoided because they made products chaotic and hard to control seems relevant. As is the fact that around the same time others also warned that one common consequence of mass layoffs is they tend to turn internal systems into black boxes because everybody with a deep understanding of them has left. But, fundamentally, what lets this deterioration continue is that it does not affect business outcomes at Google in any way. They are a monopoly and monopolies are extremely effective at capturing whatever value happens in their vicinity, even if the utility of their products declines. And, given the political situation in the US, the tech industry monopolies and oligopolies are only going to be strengthened and the actual productivity, performance, and effectiveness of their products will be less and less important to them. Because they know that most of us will not have any real alternative.

I would much rather have Android from 5 years ago, and the ability to make it work how I want, than what there is now. reply viraptor 11 hours agorootparentYou still can have seen Android from 5 years ago experience. There's lots of custom ROMs for that. On the other hand, for an average person, I believe Android is better today in most ways. reply tim333 7 hours agorootparentprevI don't know about deep level impressive but I'm finding the new Google Lens thing built recently into Chrome pretty cool and useful. You click it and highlight part of the page and then it figures what the image is or ocr's text in it and optional translates or searches it. I use it multiple times per day. Also just being able to do that was a bit sci-fi 15 years ago. Deep level impressive but maybe just by a company owned by Google is the Deepmind stuff like AlphaFold which recently got a nobel prize and AlphaGo and MuZero.

Otherwise you'd have to ignore that they kinda pioneered llms, until OpenAI poached their tech, polished into a (for a consumer) breathtakingly functional \"AI\" They also kept researching self driving via weymo etc On the business side they've also made a significant mark on the programming world via k8s, golang and angular2 among other things But I'd completely agree with the sentiment that they completely dropped the ball wrt their original target demographic. Beyond the improvements to android, I can't really think of anything since 2010 either that really improved things. reply asah 14 hours agorootparentprevSorry but no: - maps has had TONS of improvements, including mobile, transit, reviews, etc. - docs got serious with Word compatibility, added suggest mode, mobile, improved layout (100s of bug fixes), Drawing, embedded and updatable gsheets, improved print, image layout, etc. - search added song lyrics, mobile, calculator, currency conversion incl Bitcoin, flights, hotels, embedded maps info, AI summaries, product search improvements including more inventory. I would bet big$ that I could name 1,000 user features across gsuite, search, maps, Android, Chrome since 2009. reply qwerpy 13 hours agorootparentMaps may have had lots of improvements but they keep relentlessly cramming more and more ads and sponsored content into it. I now actively avoid using it as much as possible. Which is directly relevant to the topic being discussed here. Engineers work hard to make real improvements but the product as a whole is sabotaged with the never ending pressure to monetize more. reply askvictor 14 hours agorootparentprevDocs and Sheets are still so much better than Word and Excel, except that there doesn't seem to be a way to, from the desktop, launch a .csv into Sheets (or .doc into Word). Though I think that, for every minor improvement, I could name a regression or product shut-down. reply saghm 14 hours agorootparentprevSome of that stuff is impressive, but I think you might be stretching a bit with lyrics and calculator. They're nice quality of life improvements, but I don't think I'd classify them as \"impressive\". reply sillyfluke 8 hours agorootparentprevSorry no: maps has gotten way worse for my use cases. On mobile, they started agressively trying to get you to use the app instead of browser and try to get you to turn on your location constantly. They also kneecapped the \"near to here\" query button when looking at an adress on the mobile browser, where you need to try to use a roundabout hack to get it sort of working.

Two notable big names, Wells Fargo and Bank of America both \"illegally used or obtained consumers’ credit reports, and then applied for and enrolled consumers in credit card accounts without consumers’ knowledge or authorization.\" [1][2] Banks had each employee need to sell 50 credit cards a month. Employees sold 50 a month. Banks needed \"line goes up\" for every quarter. Banks had each employee sell 100 a month. Employee's tried to sell 100 a month. Banks needed \"line goes up.\" Eventually market was saturated, yet banks said sell 1000 credit cards a month. Employees replied, \"we cannot, market is saturated.\" Bank said \"sell 1000 a month.\" Employee's responded with \"make shit up, open accounts without consumers knowledge.\" Fraud.

Even if you were stuck with the same slice of eyeball time, you can still grow by selling it for more, and in many ways that's what google's auctions are set up to do. But google's investment in youtube in particular has steadily grown the eyeball-time they have access to as well. I'm not ruling out fraud but I don't see how these facts prove fraud, it seems more like google continuing to naturally benefit from the decline of traditional print and television media. reply causality0 15 hours agorootparentSometimes I wonder what fraction of people employed in advertising think they're making the world better by exposing customers to good products and what percentage aren't in denial about the fact they're weaving dollars out of human misery. reply dasil003 14 hours agorootparentNever worked in ad tech so no incentive to see things one way or the other. I do think it’s sad that so much brain power has gone into it, but “weaving dollars out of human misery” is a bit much. reply e6u4u 12 hours agorootparentprevIs total available human attention actually relevant here? It implies that all the possible attention is available already for advertising purposes which doesn't seem true at all. reply VyseofArcadia 14 hours agorootparentprev> Total available human Attention does not grow. Yes it does. It scales with population, which last time I checked is still going up. reply eitland 18 hours agoprev> Morgan: Literally Danny said he sat with an engineer team with examples of people in the room and said why aren’t they showing up and they did their “debugging process” and couldn’t figure it out. Meanwhile a single Swede with a single desktop class machine in his living room created a search engine so good that I would often switch to it when Google failed. These days I use Kagi, which has prioritization and block lists (which I don't use because the results are good out of the box). Wanna know what is really interesting about the Kagi story? While Kagi is building its own index, for a long time they were kind of reselling a wrapped version of Google + Bing results, but still were extremely much better IMO. I have two theories: - either Kagi has some seriously smart systems that read in the first tens of results and reshuffle them - or more likely in my opinion the reason why results have been so good is because kagi has api access which bypass the \"query expander and stupidifier\"[1] on the way in to Google and the personalization thing on the way out. That way they just interact with the core of Google search which somehow still works. [1]: \"stupidifier\" the thing in the Google pipeline that rewrites - \"obscure-js-lib\" (think one that a previous dev used, that I now need to debug - to \"well-knowm-js-lib-with-kind-of-similar-name\". Or decide that when I search for Angular \"mat-table\" I probably want some tables with mats on even if they don't have anything to do with Angular. reply bigfatkitten 17 hours agoparentThe stupidifier also rewrites searches for SmartOS, Illumos et al as Solaris just to make sure you get nothing but irrelevant results. reply kstrauser 17 hours agoparentprevUgh, that thing.

It's not exactly rocket science if that's allowed. reply efitz 17 hours agoprevI’m not precisely sure what problem the author is talking about. Is it the fact that some sites have built a business model around search results or is it that Google changed it search algorithm and they don’t like the way they are prioritized or is it something else? It seems kind of unreasonable to expect Google to never experiment with their algorithm; and unfortunately at its core it is a zero sum game. You might be a winner today but a loser tomorrow. if your concern is about revenue, sharing or referrals or ad placements or ??? then I would point out that it’s very unwise to build a business whose success is based entirely on the whims of another business. I think search in general is becoming a very poor way to discover content as it is slowly getting planted by LLMs and also for years has been gamified by SEO. I think that the right model for content discovery is either crowd sourced by a like-minded community, like hacker news or curated; if the curator or community drifts away from your interests, then you have to find a new one, but oddly enough, this can actually be done within the same framework. reply dghlsakjg 16 hours agoparent> then I would point out that it’s very unwise to build a business whose success is based entirely on the whims of another business. When that other business is a monopoly, what choice do you have? The rise of google has effectively killed all other sources of traffic. Web sites used to get their traffic from things like webrings, directories and a variety of smaller search engines. Now? Google, or one of its properties, and to a smaller degree Meta are basically it. The curator and community discovery model is a victim of google, not a solution to it. reply Ferret7446 15 hours agorootparentBuilding a business that relies solely on Web traffic is iffy for reasons unrelated to Google. Supply far, far exceeds demand, to the point that you have to pay to get people to visit your website. Which really explains a lot about the current Web ecosystem. reply dismalaf 16 hours agorootparentprevReddit, Instagram, Facebook, Tik Tok, even YouTube (Google property but not Google the search engine) are all paths to discovery. To a lesser degree sites like HN. There's also nothing actually stopping anyone from going to Bing or something. My Chrome browser takes me to Bing if I type in it or change the search engine... Also de-ranking SEO spammers is a net positive IMO. reply dghlsakjg 15 hours agorootparentThey are paths to discovery, but are they actual drivers of traffic? My impression is that if you aren’t listed on google, your site is pretty close to dead. In any case, if you somehow managed to drive traffic via other social media, you are one underpaid moderator’s hasty decision from ruin. The point isn’t about deranking spammers it is about concentrating a huge majority of traffic (and therefore power) in the hands of a single entity which is unaccountable to anyone. reply benrutter 15 hours agorootparentI think traffic/discovery patterns are a really good distinction. Something like Hacker News, Reddit etc will drive a lot of traffic in a short burst. People are sharing \"cool stuff\" and visiting it in one go. Ideally, we need a fix as well for more regular discory of problems people have. If I want \"Norwegian cooking blogs\" google will probably return me mostly spam, and waiting for someone on reddit to maybe post something in that category obviously isn't an option. reply tempest_ 15 hours agorootparentprevAnother thing to consider is that those sites would rather you did you click those links. They don't benefit when you leave the platform and they down rank things they think will cause users to leave the walled garden regardless of the content. reply tempest_ 15 hours agorootparentprevThere is nothing stopping people from going to Bing sure but I think you are forgetting that most people now a days interact with the internet through a mobile device. Typing w w w . b i n g . c o m on a mobile device is are a huge barrier to entry vs just using the google search box Google pays the phone manufactures to bake into the the OS. reply rockskon 13 hours agorootparentThere is absolutely something stopping me from going to Bing and I wager it's the same reason with most other people: Despite how awful Google has become in recent years...Bing is still consistently worse. reply hollerith 15 hours agorootparentprevWait: which manufacturer's OS doesn't let the user switch the search engine to Bing in Settings? reply tempest_ 15 hours agorootparentThey totally let you.

If anything I'd say mobile demonstrates that Google doesn't have a monopoly...

Not just for the users of its search engine, but small businesses counting on being discovered that way. Arguably, the problem is black-box algorithms and how they are manipulated. The same problem can be faced by any curated community, where there is little to no transparency. Curated can still mean manipulated. People can jump from place to place, but that may not be advantageous, because where they want to be or the most likely places for discovery are not available. reply fallous 14 hours agoparentprev\"I think that the right model for content discovery is either crowd sourced by a like-minded community\" and now you've re-created the original Yahoo search, which was killed off in the original Search Engine Wars by the likes of AltaVista and later Google because it didn't take long for the amount of new content on the web to overwhelm the manual curation process. A manually curated system can only truly work with a constrained domain of content/subject matter and tolerance for high lag regarding new information. Wikipedia is an example of what that kind of system would look like. reply aspenmayer 9 hours agoparentprev> I think search in general is becoming a very poor way to discover content as it is slowly getting planted by LLMs and also for years has been gamified by SEO.

Perhaps the ranking was terrible before and now is better. Or is it the other way around? reply RA2lover 14 hours agoparentprevThe capability of A/B testing should have made this experimentation a one-armed bandit problem, which is far more ammenable. reply refulgentis 17 hours agoparentprevIn a sentence, the theory is that as search added optimization layer based on ML, after optimization layer based on ML, it's nigh-debuggable. Put another way, Google launched 1000 experiments that got +0.2% CTR and seemed innocuous, and now they have a system that only wants to give out Reddit and Quora links. I've seen this story on Google's private Blind section multiple times. Usually, coupled to discussion about a more cautionary approach taken by the pre-2020 head of search, who was worried about this outcome. IMHO they're feeling out the same outcome without the benefit of the above knowledge. I don't see this theory well-understood outside Googlers, modulo a pair of popular blog posts, whose name I can't recall, that hit the nail on the head. (disclaimer: xoogler as of oct 2023, didn't work on search) reply Filligree 16 hours agorootparentI agree. But it's a tough problem, isn't it? I don't just mean filtering out the spam; that's a hard problem on its own. But the good-click metrics... if serving up reddit and quora links at #1 makes more people satisfied with the first result, defining satisfied as 'reads the #1 page and doesn't go back for more', then... What's wrong with that metric? That isn't a rhetorical question. It's tempting to claim the users are wrong to prefer it, but not very nice. Why do they do so? reply throwawayffffas 15 hours agorootparent> if serving up reddit and quora links at #1 makes more people satisfied with the first result. It does not, what google is optimizing for is ad click-through not organic results click-through. The whole model is you will search for X see a couple of ads and a sea of bad results and opt to click on the ad. It's the same reason that if you search for \"graphics card\" on amazon and sort by price you will get 20 pages of \"Graphics card Holders\" and \"Graphics Card Elbows\". They want you to not actually use the search just click on their ad. reply refulgentis 15 hours agorootparentprevUsers aren't wrong (tangentially, I strongly believe they don't like it) Bravely flattening a root cause analysis to one agreeable-sounding villain, I'd do Goodhart's Law. Click-through rate not being a great proxy for user satisfaction. i.e. I always clicked reddit first, I used to append reddit to my searches. But I get a very uneasy feeling now that everything has reddit 3 times in top ten. Impossible. It's a big world. It'd be like if Encyclopedia Britannica started just including the snippet-sized version of Wikipedia articles. Not what I'm looking for from that product. reply dangus 17 hours agoparentprevAlso the article did a terrible job by confusing LLM and AI query results with Google’s not-LLM search engine. And yes, like you alluded to, search engines aren’t the only way to acquire your readership or regular customers. Some media outlets basically don’t even use search engines to drive traffic, like so many social media based businesses out there.

It's like an alternate internet where Google stayed cool. reply FrustratedMonky 15 hours agoparentprevIsn't most of Google from 2006 open source, or at least known in publicly available papers? So someone in the US should be able to re-create Google, and go back to basic page rank. Is there anything preventing new search engines? Except scale and servers. But what most of us want is just plain old ordinary search as it existed in 2006, so that is probably reproducible. I know there are some other engines. Like DuckDuckGo, but just found out they are really just Bing. Which I guess begs the question, if Google Sucks so bad, why doesn't Bing take over??? It isn't as bad, even if not great. Edit: After reading more posts. Appears Kagi is doing this. reply lmkg 14 hours agorootparentPageRank relies on pages from one domain linking to pages on another domain as the main signal of quality. But no one does that anymore, because of PageRank. Most cross-domain links are from \"partnerships\" made under the explicit premise of boosting PageRank score. The metric became the goal, invalidating the metric. Another factor is that since 2006, social media has displaced blogs. Blogs were a rich source of \"authentic\" cross-domain links, and the movement of online discussions to consolidated and closed platforms has dried up that well. Some even go so far as to pin the downturn of blogging on the demise of Google Reader. reply BarryMilo 14 hours agorootparentprev> so that is probably reproducible Is it? How many more pages get published each day? If you include each YouTube video and social media post, it's easily several orders of magnitude. Organizing this kind of firehose isn't easy, neither is prioritizing/ranking it. 2006 was child's play in comparison. reply transcriptase 14 hours agorootparentThe difference is 2006 Google just showed you what you were searching for. 2024 Google runs your query through 200 legal, moral, and “benefit to Google” layers of filtering, reinterpreting, and reordering before showing you results. If you don’t believe me, search “watch frozen 2” (or anything else) on google, then on yandex. Both knew what you wanted, but only one is actually going to return the relevant results. reply anal_reactor 10 hours agoparentprevI use DuckDuckGo as my primary search engine, and Yandex as secondary reply lukev 17 hours agoprevGoogle has clearly transitioned away from prioritizing customer value (and content creator value, unless you're an advertiser) in favor of some internal opaque KPIs. After switching to DuckDuckGo years ago, and Kagi last year, it's obvious every time I go back to Google how much they have lost the plot. It'll take another decade before they lose dominance, but the writing is on the wall. Inertia and market position are the only reason they're still on top. Meanwhile, the younger generation barely uses web search, and the tech savvy are starting to drain away more and more quickly. Startups should be excited. Rather than being the 800-lb gorilla that is going to come take your lunch, Google is the walking dead behemoth waiting to be harvested for conceptual parts. reply manquer 13 hours agoparentSeriously ! after switching to Kagi along with recent annoying changes to Google search last 2 years , the switch back to google unimaginable.

I also tried a few complex queries and compared them to Kagi: \"How much bitcoin does microstrategy own\" -> Google returns the correct snippet from here[0] while Kagi only linked to articles about how much it acquired in the last few days. \"how to pronounce stratchery\" -> Google returns the correct snippet from the Stratechery website[1] while Kagi's first result is a spam entry[2] with the wrong pronunciation (the second result is a tweet with the correct pronunciation).

The point of search was no longer to provide requested data, but to generate clicks for Google's ad service. 2. Generating clicks for Google's ad service required that exact text search, boolean searches, & everything else useful had to be excised because giving what was asked for reduced engagement. 3. Ads had to be stuck on the top half of the results page, & the second half of the search results, for more clicks to be earned, had to be filled with garbage sites that did not provide what was sought. This encouraged the proliferation of scrapers & bot-generated text sites. Hand-in-hand with this was the elimination of long-tail results, as digging into results might give useful results. 4. It appears that a decision was made at some point to curate & direct answers toward particular results. While much has been made about certain political leanings being almost disappeared by this move, it appears to be much more likely that this was a result of returning results which generated more ad revenue & clicks (which may say more about the sorts of sites Google runs ads on than anything else). 5. In parallel with the dominance of ad-revenue mining, data mining became a major purpose of receiving search requests. Thus the requests for location information on every search, tied in with the drive to personalize results not for the purpose of giving good results, but to give identified users results they were more likely to interact with to both interact with Google ads & give Google more data to suck down & use. If we could get them to revert back to the 2006-era search engine, where more than just major sites & bot farms are indexed, we would have something useful.

    "originBody": "Sol-Ark manufacturer reportedly disables all Deye inverters in the US Published by derek the solarboi on 11/17/2024 Updated on Mon, Nov 18th, 6AM to add corroboration and Sol-Ark’s response, and 4PM to add an additional response from Sol-Ark, including changes in wording from “OEM” to “contract manufacturer”, a distinction highlighted by Sol-Ark. This story is still developing and may be subject to change. Update Nov 30: Deye has issued solarboi.com a statement regarding this issue, click here for that story. James Showalter, Founder/Owner of EG4 Electronics and Signature Solar, via DIY Solar Power Forum: ⤤ Ethics-wise you are literally shutting down equipment homeowners paid for and depend on to fit some twisted business strategy. literally seeing dozens of people call me all morning, and I never even sold Deye Seemingly at the drop of a hat the morning of Friday, Nov 15th, Deye-branded inverters across the US were reportedly intentionally bricked with the message: This inverter is not allowed use at Pakistan/USA/UK Pakistan contact inverex USA contact Sol-Ark UK contact Sunsynk Pls return to your supplier. The following page requires a 5-digit pass code to start This pass code is automatically generated overseas Several others in the thread have corroborated this: Screenshot from Facebook group post by an installer in Puerto Rico ⤤ webbbn (Arizona) reports his inverter is bricked ⤤ PanGirl, from Panama (interestingly, outside of US territory), who has one Deye inverter with a dongle, one without. ⤤ The one with the dongle is bricked. van-traveler86 (Puerto Rico) reports he has 2 customers with this problem. ⤤ newageddrywall (Canada) reports his inverter was bricked ⤤ Deye is the contract manufacturer of the Sol-Ark hybrid inverters, and Sol-Ark have the exclusive right to sell the inverters in the US since 2018, as shown in several lawsuits over the years ⤤. Deye-branded inverters have been sold for installation by several companies (seemingly in breach of Sol-Ark’s exclusivity agreement with Deye), and Sol-Ark has exercised its right to exclusivity through the court system. It’s unclear what the impetus is for this reported shutdown, why it’s happening now, and why it didn’t happen sooner. As many people in the DIY Solar Power Forum have noted, it seems unfair to bring innocent consumers into the fight, who probably have no idea what their inverter brand even is. One forum user called Sol-Ark on Saturday ⤤. The tech who answered the phone seemed to have no idea what the issue was but did say he got some calls from Canada about the same issue. This is backed up by newageddrywall’s post in the forum, as well. ⤤ Between this and the report from Panama, it seems this may not be limited to inverters in US territories. Deye has not given a public statement on this issue yet, but Sol-Ark gave me this statement: Sol-Ark has learned of the situation caused by the unauthorized sales of Deye-branded inverters within Puerto Rico and the USA. Though Sol-Ark has no control over Deye’s actions, we recognize that the messaging conveyed through the Deye-branded inverter’s screen suggests Sol-Ark can provide warranty or service for these cases, which we cannot. Though we are not responsible for Deye-branded inverters or any inverters that are not branded and sold by Sol-Ark or through an authorized Sol-Ark distributor or reseller, Sol-Ark has determined to offer a possible solution to those consumer households that have purchased Deye-branded inverters. Sol-Ark’s mission, as a veteran-owned company created 12 years ago, is to enable the most reliable, innovative, and affordable energy storage solutions to power families and businesses. Because of this mission and the direct effect that Deye’s actions may have on individual families, for the period from November 15, 2024 through December 31, 2024, Sol-Ark will permit each consumer household that has installed a Deye-branded inverter and has had that inverter’s functions disabled by Deye, to purchase a new Sol-Ark inverter of equivalent performance at a substantially discounted price. If you purchase a Sol-Ark inverter under this limited program, Sol-Ark will pay to have the Sol-Ark unit shipped to your address in Puerto Rico. Sol-Ark will not make this offer available to any person after December 31, 2024. The offer is limited to consumer households and is not being made available to commercial entities or for installation at commercial facilities (only residential locations). Sol-Ark will not be responsible, and will not pay, for any costs related to installation of the Sol-Ark inverter, removal of any Deye inverter or for any damage that may have been caused by the Deye inverter or Deye’s actions. To take advantage of this offer, the homeowner should take a photo of the serial number and model number of their Deye inverter and then contact Adriana Navarro of Sol-Ark at +1 (214) 919-1632 to initiate the process during normal business hours between 8 AM and 5 PM Eastern Standard Time, Monday through Friday. Sol-Ark will retain the full right and discretion to make final determinations regarding the availability of this program and the terms under which it operates. This response would suggest that higher-ups at Sol-Ark are not party to the reason for the shutdown, and that the shutdown was done solely at Deye’s discretion. To address potential concerns about internet-connected Sol-Ark inverters, Simon McLean, Vice President of Marketing for Sol-Ark, commented this: Sol-Ark inverters are managed, updated and serviced through Sol-Ark’s proprietary “MySolArk” platform, which has been designed and implemented to ensure the security and privacy of Sol-Ark customers. Data obtained through the platform is processed and maintained by Sol-Ark in the U.S. and used solely in accordance with Sol-Ark privacy policies. For further information on Sol-Ark’s privacy policies, see www.sol-ark.com/privacy-policy/ ⤤. Energy security, resiliency and customer privacy are fundamental Sol-Ark tenets, and we will continue to develop and deploy the MySolArk platform with data and energy security at the forefront. This situation is not only concerning because people may be without their solar production and backup power right now, but also because it seemed incredibly easy for a company in China to flip this switch on their inverters that brought power production to a halt. It brings to mind the mind-boggling amount of solar installed in the US that’s producing power using Chinese-manufactured inverters. As tensions and trade wars escalate with China, it’s an uncomfortable level of leverage that China may hold over our country. Plus, country-level politics aside, the internet-connectedness of all solar installed over the last 5-10 years is a huge potential problem, illustrated by this exact situation. By default, most inverter manufacturers have ways to remotely configure inverters, and those internal systems pose large targets for cyber attackers. If any of the big manufacturer’s systems are breached, that’s gonna be a real bad time. It’s easy to start running down the cliff of assumptions, but our takeaway here as installers is to be very careful what inverters we install (making sure there is official and direct support in the US), and even start thinking about more secure networking structures for the systems we install, especially if they’re used for backup power in the case of an outage, or used as off-grid inverters entirely. It’s unknown what the resolution for this will be for the affected customers. It truly is shitty that Deye didn’t run this geographical check at the initial installation of these inverters. This will likely penalize the wrong people as a result. Published innews cyber security Deye Sol-Ark solar inverters",

Some components, like lights and switches, have (very) expensive American alternatives. Some support ZigBee or Matter and can be controlled locally. Many many others require cloud infrastructure operated outside of the US and become bricks without it. I would love to see the US mandate ITAR for all IoT devices sold in the US.

One for you, one for the Chinese shit. Keep your [phone/PC/whatever] on one VLAN, with a NAT gateway, and they'll work just as they do now. Keep the IoT Things inside of their own VLAN, without a gateway to the Internet. And if a device like Home Assistant or whatever needs to exist on both VLANs in order to be useful, then: Make sure it isn't forwarding/routing/NATing packets. --- The implementation details vary, but they needn't be particularly expensive. What I do at home is run OpenWRT on a Pi 4 for my home routing purposes. It's fast enough for my needs and it's got simple GUI configuration options for VLAN. (Why OpenWRT? Because it's easy for me to puzzle out when I need to adjust something after a few months or a year -- I don't deal with routing every day, nor do I wish to. (Also SQM is a built-in, which always keeps WAN latency tolerable.)) From there, I've got cheap managed switches that enforce/insert VLAN tags where that is useful to me, so I can decide which physical ports are capable of talking to whichever VLANs. And from there, I've got relatively inexpensive Mikrotik access points that are configured to provide different SSIDs for different VLANs. It all works OK, though more enterprisey folks will almost certainly choose a very different path. reply anonymousiam 1 hour agorootparentVLANs are great. Unfortunately, I've got an unmanaged 12-port PoE+ switch that doesn't support them. My workaround is to put two subnets on the same physical LAN, and my DHCP server (pihole) has an IP address on each subnet. My (openWRT) router also has IPs on both subnets, and routes both LANs to the WAN. Restricting/throttling WAN bandwidth is easily managed in OpenWRT. Preventing WAN access is easily done by not providing a gateway in the DHCP assignment (pihole). Obviously the big difference between this and a VLAN is that an ill-behaved device could still access the other subnet, and could still discover the gateway and route to the WAN. So far, none of the IoT crap on my restricted subnet has misbehaved. reply Loughla 4 hours agorootparentprevOur setup looks exactly like yours I think. One connection for humans, one for machines.

And now even the low end has alternatives if you spend some time and effort. Name any category of product whatsoever and I will personally find you a non-Chinese alternative.

I can connect to my home network using tailscale to monitor power usage and generation through the HA app if I'm not at home reply drdaeman 12 hours agorootparentprevThe issue is that a lot of IoT things won't even work unless they have Internet connection and a registered account. The careful approach to IoT is to never connect a device to anything, dump the firmware, analyze it, reflash the EEPROM with patched TLS certificates (if necessary), write your own server implementation, let the IoT device join a dedicated IoT WiFi network, on that network run everything through a gateway pretending to be \"the Internet\", where the emulated server is running. Yep, it's this bad. Of course, if the device or its malfunction cannot cause sufficient harm (e.g. it's a light, usually it's not worth to reverse engineer it) then just run it on a separate SSID and VLAN, with least access necessary to get it running (starting from blocking everything and allowing network by network until it works). And, uh, if the device has a LTE or can use something like Amazon Sidewalk, it gets even trickier to keep it tame. I don't have any solar power stuff, but I did this with my old cat feeder machine. In the process I discovered a service/backdoor SSH account, a system that does not encrypt p-frames at all before uploading data to the cloud, and a bunch of other things that made me happy I did not connect it to any public networks. Short conclusion: consider against with a camera or a microphone that runs on Tuya-developed firmware. Generalized conclusion: consider against IoT from any manufacturers you don't trust to fully respect your best interests, or aren't willing to audit first. The downside is obvious, of course. And with every year more and more manufacturers tighten up their hardware, but I'm certain the crappy programming and service backdoors are all there, only ways to mess with the network traffic or firmware are clamped down. reply wolrah 1 hour agorootparent> The issue is that a lot of IoT things won't even work unless they have Internet connection and a registered account. To a significant extent I see this as a \"buyer beware\" situation. Now, a lot of people aren't even really aware of the problem nor knowledgeable enough to know what to look for, but I'd expect the majority of the HN audience is both aware of and able to understand the problem enough to be capable of looking out for and avoiding it. I personally don't mind if a device uses internet connectivity to provide a useful service, but I refuse to buy anything that requires internet connectivity arbitrarily for functionality that could easily be performed locally. The first thing I do when I think a new IoT device might be neat is google \" Home Assistant\" and see what comes up. If there's no integration or the integration is cloud based instead of local I probably won't buy it. IoT devices are not necessities, most of them are either luxury items or disposable novelties. You can always just not buy them. There are certainly some categories, particularly in the residential market, where it may be harder to find an option you find agreeable but its far from impossible. If every major offering in a category is bad in this way, you almost certainly don't actually need that thing. reply breeskee 13 hours agorootparentprevI stuck IOT stuff on a cheap linksys WRT router with ExpressVPN firmware.

Perhaps this manufacturer decided to economize and make both of them part of the same \"box\", with the result that an error condition in the controller would result in the non-operation of the inverter part. Some systems like mine (Enphase) do a good job of letting the inverters operate independently of the monitoring/control software. But to do this, I believe they need to add data storage to the inverters themselves in order to log data during a controller \"outage\". reply bartvk 4 hours agoparentprevIt's just a bad idea.

You return the faulty device to the entity you purchased it from. I bet some small-time installers that were sourcing on the grey market will go bankrupt because of this. reply malfist 1 hour agorootparentYou return a solar inverter you already have installed? Maybe purchased years ago? And in the meantime you might be without power. That's not recourse. reply _trampeltier 14 hours agoparentprevIt seems they shut the inverters down because a legal dispute. So the reason is the law. reply perihelions 2 hours agorootparentCivil contract disputes don't empower or obligate you to commit crimes in the process of trying to make things right. The power inverters were *not their property*. Remotely accessing them, without authorization and with the intent of disabling them, is a textbook CFAA felony. reply Dylan16807 14 hours agorootparentprevThat's like saying if I punch someone because of a legal dispute, the law is to blame. reply rvba 3 hours agoparentprevCould USA wrap it under the terrorism laws? reply jfengel 15 hours agoparentprevThere probably are. But it appears to be coming out of China, so good luck enforcing it. reply dymk 15 hours agorootparentThere is a US based company that is importing and selling these devices. Go after them. reply Schiendelman 3 hours agorootparentFor what? They didn't send the signal. reply andix 14 hours agoprevIm sure there is some US law, that considers this an act of terror against the national power grid ;) reply gdjskshh 2 hours agoparentI agree. We should make an example out of the folks that financially gained from enabling this - the consumers that saved money by purchasing equipment from AliExpress and then connecting it to the grid. We lost manufacturing to China, let's not lose distribution too. AliExpress, Temu, Shein - None should be tolerated. You should either buy directly from an international manufacturer, or through a US-based distributor. reply hakfoo 1 hour agorootparentAren't some of those platforms more-or-less official outlets of the manufacturer for some brands already? While it's entirely possible some of the storefronts are just flashing \"official widgetco shop\" as a credibility-enhancing gesture, it's probably also the easiest way if you're a Chinese firm with little understanding of global last-mile logistics and small-dollar payment processing to get into the direct-to-consumer business. I thought AliExpress was spawned from the B2B relationships Alibaba already had. If you put up a rule like that, I suspect those sites would just pivot to being \"Shopify for Chinese Vendors\" -- offering an embeddable storefront that the manufacturer can put directly on their page. The only losers would be the consumers, who would no longer get the convenience of centralized search, being able to put together an order from ten vendors in a single shopping cart, and the ability to efficiently combine shipping. And let's not say \"we lost manufacturing.\" We GAVE IT AWAY. It's not just that foreign labour is cheaper, it's that Asia was industrializing later, so you get state-of-the-science facilities, while the American plant is 50 years old and nobody wants to splash the capex to rebuild it to modern standards. reply Firerouge 14 hours agoprevSol-Ark certainly seems to embody 'never let a crisis go to waste '. Sol-Ark may not have pulled the trigger on bricking the inverters, but it certainly sounds like their legal actions pressed Deye's hand. And then to shake down all the individuals who's inverters broke with a limited time opportunity to buy a brand new one from them.... reply greenthrow 3 hours agoparentWhy are you blaming Sol-Ark when Deye is the one in breach of contract taking illegal actions the entire time? Seems very disingenuous. They also did not force Deye's hand in this action and seem surprised by it. reply jeroenhd 10 minutes agorootparent> in breach of contract I can't really figure out what they did that was in breach of contract. As far as I understand it, they don't do business inside the areas affected, so there is no contract to speak of. Instead, their authorized resellers seem to be the ones installing for their hardware; I don't even think it's legal to sell their hardware if it doesn't comply with FCC/etc guidelines. Is geo-blocking illegal? Am I entitled to a refund if I import American hardware that refuses to operate in my country? I think people were risking a broken setup for a big discount, and now it's come back to bite them in the ass. If the units affected were official installations done by their American reseller, their reseller wouldn't be so ready to offer up free replacements. reply kstenerud 14 hours agoparentprevWait, what? So defending your rights under an exclusivity agreement through the courts is somehow now \"forcing\" their hand? The evil Sol-Ark by suing for compliance to their contract pushed the hapless Deye into bricking consumers hardware? reply Firerouge 10 hours agorootparentI like how you quoted forcing, but I very specifically did not use that term. Had there been no exclusivity agreement, I think we can agree that the inverters would not of been bricked for being located in the wrong regions. I think the malice from Sol-Ark here is that they are only offering a limited time deal, which may pressure people to pay up before the courts clear this up. Regardless of who shares the majority of the blame, Sol-Ark, Deye or 3rd party vendors, this could of been handled better by all parties involved, and should not have harmed end consumers in this way. reply jrflowers 38 minutes agorootparent> I like how you quoted forcing, but I very specifically did not use that term. I like that you substituted a similar word while paraphrasing a common phrase and then used the opportunity to say “I didn’t mean what you thought I did. I meant something else but will not describe what that is exactly” reply mint2 1 hour agorootparentprevIt’s unclear who caused it exactly, but sol-ark does not seem to be at fault unless one thinks exclusivity contracts are illegal or wrong. It seems deye either willfully or negligently ignore their contract they made with sol ark. Or their middle men in other countries did. Deye then punished the end users for deye’s lapses. Where does solark get blame unless the exclusivity contract is what one objects to. reply lazide 4 hours agorootparentprevBlaming Sol-Ark for that is just absurd. reply metalman 7 hours agoprevoff grid here,off and on since the early 90's current iteration uses US made charge controller and inverter, midn9ght and magnum both capable of firmware updates, but continue to function after 10 years without coms.The midnight controller did pop up a cheeky message of \"got coms?\" for years, but for some reason , gave up. The thing with both of these pieces of equpiment is that they are designed by bad ass electrical engineers to survive and continue to function under the worst conditions..... and then some, which I have personaly tested. I believe that a firware update could be done with any old laptop, and that while as a new owner I did go all ocd watching all of the data(did learn a lot), now I sometimes forget that the system exists, ......its that reliable reply Schiendelman 3 hours agoparentWhat products would you recommend today? reply Filligree 2 hours agorootparentNot GP, but Victron makes some serious beasts.

Could it be reset to not be bricked by disconnecting it from the Internet and rebooting or reflashing? reply tibbydudeza 2 hours agoprevI presume they locked out the solar recharging of the battery and home supply but do not stop mains grid power to the home ???. reply api 3 hours agoprevIf it depends on the cloud to operate it's not yours. reply greenthrow 3 hours agoparentThese devices do not depend on the cloud. If I want to take my Sol-Ark inverter offline I can just take the wifi dongle off it. Dunno about the bootleg Deye one. reply greenthrow 3 hours agoprevTitle is a bit misleading and makes it sound like Sol-Ark did this. They did not. Title should be \"Deye manufacturer reportedly disables all Deye inverters in the US\". They are the same entity but this wording avoids confusion about Sol-Ark being responsible. reply totallykvothe 15 hours agoprevPeople responsible for this kind of evil need to pay with personal property seizure. reply bagels 14 hours agoprevThis time, it's a malicious manufacturer, next time it's a malicious hacker. Doesn't seem like connecting these to the internet is worth it. reply 4ntiq 14 hours agoparentI love the narrative of a Chinese manufacturer selling electronics to the West only to one day shut everything off for no reason at all than to fuck with people and disappear and for people to find out the supposedly registered company never existed. It's like a trashy, second-rate William Gibson knock off novel but there's something awfully amusing about it. reply lazide 14 hours agorootparentFrankly it doesn’t even require (special) maliciousness (per-se) - spinning up random ‘brands’ to sell to rubes on Amazon while obfuscating beneficial owners is essentially standard operating procedure. The only surprising thing here is they took an action to brick something instead of just abandoning it. reply 4ntiq 14 hours agorootparent>The only surprising thing here is they took an action to brick something instead of just abandoning it. You're right, but I wouldn't say surprising. I do wonder what would happen if the units just stopped working outright one day and they're all intended to be gridded and nothing works properly anymore and the distributors are stumped and can't get ahold of anyone. reply lazide 14 hours agorootparentFair point - it would be trivial frankly to embed a ‘bug’ which causes them to all brick at some arbitrary point in the future too. Considering the level the firmware works at, probably even catch on fire. reply profsummergig 14 hours agorootparentprev> and for people to find out the supposedly registered company never existed This already happened to me. Sort of. Saw an advt for Air Jordans for $7. With a pic of actual Air Jordans. Thought to myself, \"it's only $7, let's see what happens\". A very sorry looking pair of shoes arrived a couple weeks later. With \"Air Jordan\" printed on them. They weren't actual Air Jordans. There was no way, absolutely no way, to get in touch with the Chinese company that did this. reply wmf 13 hours agorootparentThis is why it's worth paying a few dollars more for certified superfakes instead of the regular fakes. reply 4ntiq 14 hours agorootparentprev.. y-you wouldn't happen to still have them or are by any chance selling them would you? Strictly asking for a friend. (one year later: \"Auction sells rare early Air Jordan prototype for $3 million\") reply t-3 14 hours agoparentprevProbably wrong to classify the manufacturer as malicious rather than the importer. Sounds like these units were brought to the US in violation of contractual agreements and thus were disabled when the manufacturer decided to enforce it. reply A1kmm 14 hours agorootparentIt's likely they had no contractual agreement with the current owners of the inverters, and yet they have elected to wilfully damage the property of the current owners because they can. Wilfully damaging someone else's property without permission of the current owner seems pretty malicious, regardless of whether the importers (or maybe someone who supplied to the importer) were in breach of a contract. reply yuliyp 14 hours agorootparentprevBut regardless, they're clearly not owned by Deye any longer. Causing damage to an unrelated party in retaliation for a contract dispute between two manufacturers is not OK. reply lxgr 13 hours agorootparentprevDeciding to enforce something like this after your product has already been sold/installed seems extremely dubious. Even just building in the capability (assuming this wasn't installed via a generic software update, in which case I'd have some follow-up questions on the security against malware of these things) shows significant malicious intent. reply bagels 11 hours agorootparentprevManufacturer did something with intent to damage someone else's property.
