    "originBody": "hi, i'm daniel. i'm a 15-year-old high school junior. in my free time, i hack billion dollar companies and build cool stuff. 3 months ago, I discovered a unique 0-click deanonymization attack that allows an attacker to grab the location of any target within a 250 mile radius. With a vulnerable app installed on a target's phone (or as a background application on their laptop), an attacker can send a malicious payload and deanonymize you within seconds--and you wouldn't even know. I'm publishing this writeup and research as a warning, especially for journalists, activists, and hackers, about this type of undetectable attack. Hundreds of applications are vulnerable, including some of the most popular apps in the world: Signal, Discord, Twitter/X, and others. Here's how it works: Cloudflare By the numbers, Cloudflare is easily the most popular CDN on the market. It beats out competitors such as Sucuri, Amazon CloudFront, Akamai, and Fastly. In 2019, a major Cloudflare outage knocked most of the internet offline for over 30 minutes. One of Cloudflare's most used feature is Caching. Cloudflare's Cache stores copies of frequently accessed content (such as images, videos, or webpages) in its datacenters, reducing server load and improving website performance (https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/). When your device sends a request for a resource that can be cached, Cloudflare retrieves the resource from its local datacenter storage, if available. Otherwise, it fetches the resource from the origin server, caches it locally, and then returns it. By default, some file extensions are automatically cached but site operators can also configure new cache rules. Cloudflare has a vast global presence, with hundreds of datacenters in 330 cities across 120+ countries—an estimated 273% more datacenters than Google. In the U.S. East region, for example, the nearest datacenter to me is less than 100 miles. If you live in a developed country, there's a good chance the nearest datacenter to you is less than 200 miles from you. A few months ago, I had a lightbulb moment: if Cloudflare stores cached data so close to users, could this be exploited for deanonymization attacks on sites we don't control? You see, Cloudflare returns information about a request's cache status in the HTTP response. cf-cache-status can be HIT/MISS and cf-ray includes the airport code for the closest airport to the datacenter that handles the request (in my case, IAD). If we can get a user's device to load a resource on a Cloudflare-backed site, causing it to be cached in their local datacenter, we can then enumerate all Cloudflare datacenters to identify which one cached the resource. This would provide an incredibly precise estimate of the user's location. Cloudflare Teleport There was a one major hurdle I had to get through before I tested this theory. You can't simply send HTTP requests to individual Cloudflare datacenters. For \"security purposes\" (presumably DDoS protection), all Cloudflare IP ranges are strictly anycast. All TCP connections opened to their network are always handled by the nearest available datacenter to you, there's no way you can ask a datacenter in Canada to handle your request if you live in the US. However, after some research, I found a forum post (https://community.cloudflare.com/t/how-to-run-workers-on-specific-datacenter-colos/385851) from a community member showing me exactly how. The author shared a bug he found to send requests to specific Cloudflare datacenters with Cloudflare Workers. I'm still not 100% sure of the specifics of this bug, but using an IP range used internally by Cloudflare WARP (Cloudflare's VPN client), we could ask certain datacenters to handle HTTP requests. Normally, this IP range blocked inbound connections from external IP addresses but requests sent from Workers could bypass this since the connection would originate from inside Cloudflare's network. I spent a few minutes reading their post and I quickly spined up a tool for this: Cloudflare Teleport (https://github.com/hackermondev/cf-teleport). Certain IP ranges corresponded to different datacenters (https://github.com/hackermondev/cf-teleport/blob/main/scripts/data/colos.json). Cloudflare Teleport is a proxy powered by Cloudflare Workers that redirects HTTP requests to specific datacenters. For example, https://cfteleport.xyz/?proxy=https://cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/trace&colo=SEA would proxy a HTTP GET request to https://cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/trace specifically to a Seattle (SEA) datacenter. Cloudflare would end up completely patching this bug a few months later, making this tool obsolete, but more on that later. For a majority of my initial, I used this tool. First \"Deanonymization\" Attack As soon as the Cloudflare Teleport tool was complete, I was able to confirm my theory. I coded a simple CLI program that would send an HTTP GET request to a specified URL and list all datacenters that had the resource cache and its age. For my first test, I used Namecheap's favicon (https://www.namecheap.com/favicon.ico). This resource has Cloudflare Caching enabled, it's just a simple static image of their logo. (This was the quickest site I could find that didn't have rigorous bot protection): Boom, it worked. Namecheap had configured their cache age extremely low (5 minutes) but I was able to see every datacenter that had cached the their site's favicon in the last 5 minutes. Since everytime you load their site, your browser automatically downloads this favicon, this means a user from each one of this locations has visited the Namecheap.com site within the 5 minutes with the last visit from Tokyo, Japan. This was just meant to be a simple test and there's almost no impact here, but with this I confirmed my theory. This proved the concept of using Cloudflare caching for deanonymization attacks. Real-World Application: Signal Signal, an open-source encrypted messaging service, is widely used by journalists and activists for its privacy features. Internally, the app utilizes two CDNs for serving content: cdn.signal.org (powered by CloudFront) for profile avatars and cdn2.signal.org (powered by Cloudflare) for message attachments. 1-Click Attack When a user sends an attachment (e.g., an image) on Signal, it is uploaded to cdn2.signal.org. Once the recipient opens the conversation, their device automatically downloads the attachment. Since Cloudflare caching is enabled for these URLs, an attacker can use the cache geolocation method to pinpoint the recipient’s location. The https://cdn2.signal.org/attachments/* path is configured to cache responses with Cloudflare. This means once a user's device automatically downloads an attachment, it's possible for an attacker to run a cache geolocation attack to find out which local datacenter they're near--similar to how law enforcement track mobile devices through cell phone towers. To test this, I quickly patched the Signal desktop app to remove SSL pinning and configured Burp to intercept and view HTTP requests/responses sent through the app. Reproduction Steps 1. Block HTTP GET requests to cdn2.signal.org/attachments/* in from the Signal using Burp. This ensures that the app doesn't download attachments uploaded from the our side (the attacker) since that would cache them to our local datacenter and pollute the results. The best way I found to do this with Burp is to configure intercept rules for attachments, then leave request intercept on and deny all requests. 2. Send an attachment (image) to a target. This should work with any attachment but images are automatically downloaded when the user opens the conversation so they work best. I used a simple 1x1.png image for this test. The upload request is sent to Signal's CDN and you can see the attachment url in Burp once we send the attachment in the conversation and Signal uploads it (ex. https://cdn2.signal.org/attachments/UjLld11tvaL16M8mrd86). 3. Attack After the targets opens the conversation (verify this with read recipts), their device should download the attachment which in turn causes Cloudflare to cache the file in a local datacenter. I ran this attack on myself, used the CLI tool I mentioned earlier with the attachment url and found local datacenters that had cached the attachment. In my case, I'm in New York and one of the closest datacenters to me is Newark, NJ (EWR) which is about 150 miles from my actual coordinates. With an innocent-looking attachment, an attacker can deanonymize users and find their location within an approximate radius. 0-click Here's where things get interesting. Although the 1-click method works, it requires the user to open the Signal conversation. Is it possible to run this attack without a single user interaction? Enter push notifications. Push Notifications Signal's mobile app has 3 push notification settings. Push Notifications are triggered if the user receives a message while not actively on the Signal app. By default, the mobile app includes the author, and message when it sends a push notification to your device. The image shown on the right of the notification is the attachment sent with the message from Signal. If the target has push notifications enabled (which it is by default), they don't even have to open the Signal conversation for their device to download the attachment. Once the push notification is sent to their device, it automatically downloads the image from Signal's CDN triggering the local datacenter to cache the response. An attacker can run this deanonymization attack any time and grab a user's current location without a single interaction. Signal, like Telegram, is used by journalists, activists, whisteblowers from all over the world. The potiental for this attack is massive. This attack can be used to track Signal accounts, correlate identities, find employees meeting with journalists and much more. Real-World Application: Discord During my research, another app I found vulnerable to this type of attack is Discord. Discord is a free app that allows users to communicate with each other through text, voice, and video. Although the app is targeted towards gamers, Discord has been in the news recently this past year for facilitating government leaks and Discord hosts a significant portion of cybercrime on the internet. The 1-click aspect is very simple and fairly similar to Signal, I would say the impact is even wider with Discord. Discord allows users with a Nitro subscription (their $9.99/mo premium service) to use custom emojis in a variety of places: Messages, User Presence, Channels, etc. These custom emojis are loaded from Discord's CDN and are configured to be cached on Cloudflare. An attacker can use the same deanonymization attack with Signal to deanonymize users. So, instead of sending an attachment in a Discord channel, an attacker can display a custom emoji in their user status and simply wait for the target to open their profile to run a deanonymization attack. I've disclosed the entire HackerOne report I sent to Discord which has specific details, but I want to focus on the 0-click aspect here. In Discord, mobile push notifications are sent for a variety of events (not just for messages recieved like Signal). For example, sending a friend request to a Discord user triggers a push notification on the user's mobile device. Interestingly, even if the user is actively on Discord, friend request notifications are always sent to the user's mobile device. How would a deanonymization attack be used with a friend request notification? Well, take a look at the notification. When you recieve a friend request and Discord sends the notification to your device, it includes the user's avatar url to be shown with the notification. Your phone downloads the avatar url (without any user interaction) and displays it alongside the notification. Discord has Cloudflare caching configured on the CDN path for avatar urls, which means we can simply do the same cache location attack mentioned earlier. In Discord, the avatar URL format used in push notifications is: https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/{user_id}/{avatar_hash}. The avatar URL format used in the website to display user avatars is slightly different (it always contains an image extension) (https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/{user_id}/{avatar_hash}.png). Both URLs leads to the same image but since images displayed in the app have a different path, they're cached separately. This ensures our results are not polluted and allows us to ensure we are finding the datacenter of a device that loaded the avatar through a push notification and not just the profile on the Discord app. Just like that, we have the steps for a 0-click version of this attack for Discord: Change your user avatar. This randomizes your avatar hash and ensures your avatar URL has not been loaded by anyone yet, increasing the accuracy of the attack. Send a friend request to the target. Although there's a variety of ways to trigger push notifications with Discord, I choose friend requests because they are always sent regardless of whether the user is active on Discord. They also don't require any mutual server with the target, meaning you can practically do this with anyone on Discord. Use Cloudflare Teleport tool on the user avatar and find all local datacenters that have cached the avatar GeoGuesser I'm very familar with Discord's API and I realized I could automate every step in Discord's 0-click attack, and so I did. Introducing GeoGuesser. This is a private Discord bot with a single command that takes a username, runs an attack with the steps mentioned earlier and returns the result entirely through Discord. When the command is called, it uses my account credentials to access the Discord User API, changes the user avatar to a randomly generated image (to randomize the hash) and sends a friend request to a username specified. Finally, it uses a private API based on the Cloudflare Teleport CLI to run the same cache enumeration attack and displays the results directly on Discord, all in less than 30 seconds. To show the extent of this attack, one of the first users I tried this attack on was Stanislav Vishnevskiy, Discord's CTO. Here's the bot in action: The bot sends a friend request to Stan, then waits a couple of seconds to ensure he receives the push notification. It finds 2 local Cloudflare datacenters that have cached the avatar. This could mean he has multiple devices hooked up with his Discord account that recieved the push notification, or his device loaded the avatar twice and the requests were load balanced within different datacenters. GeoGuesser, powered by the Google Maps API, generates a likely location of the user. It finds the midpoint between the 2 datacenters and draws 2 circles that signify his radius. Discord's HQ is located in San Francisco, CA (which is in the outer circle) so this map is accurate. Stan is most likely located somewhere near the edge of the inner circle which is about ~300 miles. This entire process took less than a minute to run. I'm sure Stan saw the notification on his phone, didn't think twice and simply dismissed it. This was just a simple attack but this attack, if calibrated, can be used to track and monitor Stan's location. An attacker like this can be launched on any Discord user and it's almost undetectable. Bug Bounty Reports I responsibly disclosed to the affected parties my research, hoping something would be done to protect or warn users against this type of deanonymization attack but I was mostly disappointed. Signal Signal instantly dismissed my report, saying it wasn't their responsibility and it was up to users to hide their identity: \"Signal has never attempted to fully replicate the set of network-layer anonymity features that projects like Wireguard, Tor, and other open-source VPN software can provide\". I disagree with this. Signal markets itself as a privacy-first communication platform. While it does not claim to provide network-layer anonymity like Tor, users trust Signal to minimize privacy risks. The vulnerability demonstrates that the platform unintentionally leaks information that could narrow down a user’s location within a few hundred miles. This leakage conflicts with the expectations of many privacy-conscious users who rely on Signal for more than just end-to-end encryption. Telegram, another privacy-focused application, is completely invulnerable to this attack as (1) they use a custom in-house built protocol thats not reliant on HTTP and (2) don't rely on cloud providers like Cloudflare for caching. Discord Initially, Discord's Security Team promised to look into this and make changes to protect their users against this type of attack but eventually they also changed their position on this, citing this as a Cloudflare issue other consumers are also vulnerable to. Cloudflare Cloudflare ended up completing patching the bug used by Cloudflare Teleport to traverse datacenters. The bug had been reported to their HackerOne program a year ago by another reporter, but they hadn't done anything about it back then since they didn't see any impact of traversing datacenters until I shared my research. Cloudflare reopened the old report, resolved it and awarded a bounty to my report and the original. Although this is a step in the right direction, this doesn't actually fix the core issue here. Every attack shown in this write up has been done in the last 24 hours even though Cloudflare patched this bug weeks ago. Cloudflare patched the bug inside their network that facilitated datacenter traversal, but that's not the only way to easilly traverse datacenters all over the world. 24 hours after their patch, I reprogrammed Cloudflare Teleport to use a VPN instead. Numerous VPNs provide multiple locations that users can connect to which sends their traffic through servers in different parts of the world and these servers map to different Cloudflare datacenters all over the world. I chose a VPN provider with over 3,000 servers located in various locations across 31 different countries worldwide. Using this new method, I'm able to reach about 54% of all Cloudflare datacenters again. While this doesn't sound like a lot, this covers most places in the world with significant population. Cloudflare's final statement about this says they do not consider the deanonymization attack to be a vulnerability in their own systems and it is up to their consumers to disable caching for resources they wish to protect. There's clearly a problem here as Cloudflare says consumers are responsible for protecting themselves against these types of attacks, while consumers (ex. Discord) are putting the blame on Cloudflare. How to Protect Yourself The potential for exploitation using this deanonymization attack is significant, especially for users in sensitive positions like journalists, activists, and privacy-conscious individuals. The attack leverages fundamental design decisions in caching and push notification systems, demonstrating how infrastructure meant to enhance performance can be misused for invasive tracking. Although Cloudflare has patched the Teleport bug, and some applications like Discord and Signal may have implemented mitigation measures following my disclosure, the underlying risks remain. Any app using a CDN for content delivery and caching can still be vulnerable if the proper precautions aren’t taken. Final Thought This attack highlights how complex and interconnected the digital ecosystem has become. While CDNs improve performance and scalability, they also inadvertently introduce risks that can be exploited in novel ways. By raising awareness and promoting best practices, we can work together to minimize the potential for abuse. For users in sensitive roles or those concerned about their privacy, the key takeaway is this: stay informed and vigilant. While no system is entirely foolproof, taking steps to limit your exposure can make a significant difference.",

I'd say \"deanonymization\" is stretching it, unless the user is in the middle of nowhere (no other users near the data center). But interesting writeup anyway. reply thrwaway1985882 3 hours agoparent\"Near a user\" is also a big assumption. I'm ~200 miles to ORD and ~500 to IAD, but my ISP's peering & upstream arrangements mean Cloudflare serves my traffic 700 miles from DFW. But, at the same time: Cloudflare isn't going to serve me a cache from Seattle, Manchester, or Tokyo. Pinning down an unknown Signal user to even a rough geographic location is an important bit of metadata that could combine to unmask an individual. Neat attack! reply btown 3 hours agorootparentIt's also quite insidious as you don't need to control anything on any server to get this information; as long as you can get your target to load a unique URL never before loaded by anyone else, you can simply later poll it with an unauthenticated HTTP GET from different locations, and find which one reports a Cloudflare HIT (or, even if they hid that information, finding the one that returns with lower latency). If you're allowing user uploaded content, and you use Cloudflare as a CDN, you could mitigate and provide your users with plausible deniability by prefetching each uploaded URL from random data centers. But, of course, that's going to make your Cloudflare bill that much more expensive. Cloudflare could allow security-sensitive clients to hide the cache-hit header and add randomized latency upon a cache hit, but the latter protection would also be expensive in how many connections must be kept alive longer than they otherwise would. Don't do anything on a personal device or account if you want your datacenter to be hidden! reply chatmasta 1 hour agorootparentPre-fetching also becomes an issue for apps that are meant to be e2e encrypted, since it requires the server to download (read) every attachment. But if the app is already caching the attachment then they’re effectively reading it anyway. (EDIT: Apparently signal e2e encrypts images prior to upload, so pre-fetching the encrypted blob from one or multiple servers would in fact be a mitigation of this attack.) I do wonder if Telegram is as invulnerable as the author assumes. They might not be using Cloudflare for caching, or even HTTP, but the basic elements of this attack might still work. You’d just need to modify the “teleport” aspect of it. reply duskwuff 1 hour agorootparentTelegram doesn't use local CDNs for caching. All users are associated with one of about five telegram DCs, and upload files to their local DC. If a file was uploaded by a user on another DC, users connect to it temporarily to download the file. The DC that a user is associated with is exposed by the API you don't need to get them to upload a file to discover it but it's so broad that it's not much of a deanonymizing signal. (Knowing that your target is in DC1, for example, just means that they're probably somewhere in North or South America. Or that they registered using a phone number that said they were.) https://core.telegram.org/cdn reply ipaddr 1 hour agorootparentprevGoing forward uploaded content should never go through cloudflaire and it never really needed to. Add unique urls. Maybe just avoid it altogether. reply 8338550bff96 1 hour agorootparentprevI doubt how useful it would be as an attack. As a single point of info it tells you next to nothing. As part of a composition of other indicators it would be the weak link in the chain probably just causing noise for the not un-likly scenario where the person you're targeting is using a VPN. If it was any less specific we'd be talking about a deanonymization attack that outs whether or not a target is still on Earth. reply ajsnigrutin 1 hour agorootparentprevfor \"normal people\", that's a pain, but with enough resources,... Although. it has edge usecases even for \"normal people\": Eg. you suspect your coworker to be catfishing you on eg. discord, you know that he's in your city now, verify, then wait for him to leave for a vacation to somewhere abroad, check again. reply dotancohen 13 minutes agorootparentThis is actually pretty smart, and shows that this exploit could be chained with other information to identify a specific individual. This could also be used to e.g. check which world-travelling reporter is communicating with you. reply bigbones 3 hours agoparentprevIt gets more interesting when you think about the impact on groups. Sending an image to a group is enough for all devices associated with that group to be identifiable from CloudFlare's side, who additionally see a giant chunk of unencrypted traffic from the same client addresses going to other web sites. Given Cloudflare's less-than-straight approach to sales, it is astonishing the words \"secure\" and \"Signal\" ever appear in the same sentence. CloudFlare get to see a fuckton of metadata from private and group chats, enough to trace who originally sends a piece of media (identifiable from its file size), who reads it, when it is is read, who forwards it and to whom. It really doesn't matter that they can't see an image or video, knowing its size upfront or later (for example in response to a law enforcement request) is enough reply lolinder 3 hours agorootparent> Given Cloudflare's less-than-straight approach to sales, it is astonishing the words \"secure\" and \"Signal\" ever appear in the same sentence. This is an overly binary take. Security is all about threat models, and for most of us the threat model that Signal is solving is \"mainstream for-profit apps snoop on the contents of my messages and use them to build an advertising profile\". Most of us using it are not using Signal to skirt law enforcement, so our threat model does not include court orders and warrants. Signal can and should append some noise to the images when encrypted (or better yet, pad them to a set file size as suggested by paulryanrogers in a sibling comment) to mitigate the risks of this attack for those who do have threat models that require it, but for the vast majority of us Signal is just as fit for purpose as we thought it was. reply vel0city 20 minutes agorootparent> Signal can and should append some noise to the images when encrypted (or better yet, pad them to a set file size as suggested by paulryanrogers in a sibling comment) to mitigate the risks of this attack for those who do have threat models that require it Adding padding to the image wouldn't do anything to stop this \"attack\". This is just watching which CF datacenters cache the attachment after it gets sent. reply hedgedoops2 56 minutes agorootparentprevMaybe not individual warrants (at least not warrants to do non-scalable collections like hardware bugs in one's phone I.e. warrants that, most users, with high probability, are not subject to). But mass surveillance, e.g. NSA, even with 'mass warrants' (e.g. Verizon-FISA warrant), that everyone is subject to, is probably in most people's attacker model. I don't have a study handy, but it seems reasonable that most users use signal to protect against mass surveillance and signal advertises itself as being good for this. Also Marlinspike and Whittaker are quite outspoken about mass surveillance. If cloudflare can compile a big part of the \"who chats with whom\" graph, that is a system design defect. reply crawfordcomeaux 1 hour agorootparentprevHello, I'm an organizer for a system to coordinate multiple mutual aid networks, many of which are only organizing by Signal & Protonmail exclusively because they think they're secure and private. People who are doing work to help people in ways the state tries to prevent (like giving people food) rely on this tech. These are the same groups who were able to mobilize so quickly to respond to the LA fires, but the Red Cross & police worked to shut down. This impacts the people who are there for you when the state refuses to show up. This impacts the future version of you who needs it. Most people aren't disabled, yet.

But what if somebody gave them a good reason? reply echoangle 3 hours agorootparentAren’t the files end-to-end encrypted? How would they inspect the files? reply dingnuts 3 hours agorootparentyeah, the person you're referring to is confused because the Cloudflare HTTP service terminates TLS and presents a Cloudflare certificate, but that doesn't have anything to do at all with Signal's E2EE which is not based on HTTPS PKI reply diggan 3 hours agorootparentprevLast time I used Cloudflare I think their settings default to only \"Origin SSL/TLS\" (or whatever they call it), which wouldn't encrypt anything between Cloudflare and the origin, it would only encrypt data between Cloudflare and the end-user/browser. reply lolinder 3 hours agorootparentBut the Signal client encrypts images before sending them to the Signal server. If it padded out the images at that point, the images would all be indistinguishable from each other unless Cloudflare were actually able to break the encryption (which would completely undermine the entire security model). reply diggan 3 hours agorootparentAh yes, I'm sorry, I mistook the context. If Signal encrypts the images E2E, you're right that it wouldn't matter what Cloudflare does, especially if padded. reply echoangle 3 hours agorootparentprevTLS doesn’t matter for End-to-end encrypted stuff though, you could exchange the data over Telnet and it would still be secure. The content itself is already encrypted before being transmitted and can only be decrypted by the receiver. reply kijin 2 hours agorootparentAFAIK the attack described by OP only works if the attacker knows the (randomly generated) URL of the image, which probably means they have a Signal client that can decrypt the image already. So the secrecy of the content is not at issue. The question is whether some specific person has received the same image, and from where. reply chatmasta 56 minutes agorootparentPart of his attack requires disabling the cache on his (sender) side so that he doesn’t pollute the cache. That implies that both sides of the conversation share the same URL, which means Cloudflare could assume two IP addresses requesting the same URL on the Signal attachment domain are participating in a shared conversation. reply doodlebugging 2 hours agorootparentprev>It gets more interesting when you think about the impact on groups.

Silence is secrecy. reply xnorswap 3 hours agoparentprevIt could be useful for correlation. Say for example that you're an investigating agent in regular contact with someone. A single data-point wouldn't mean anything. However, a sequence of daily image retrievals might tell you that they spend 90% of their time in WA and 10% of their time elsewhere. That information alone still might not mean anything, but if you also have a specific suspect in mind, it may help confirm it. Or if you have access to the suspected person directly, if you're able to also befriend their \"clean\" profile, you might be able to pull the same trick and correlate the two location profiles. De-anonymisation isn't about single pieces of information, but all information helps feed into a profile to narrow suspects or confirm suspicions. ( By \"agent\" I just mean a person, not an AI agent nor Law enforcement, who could presumably just get the information more directly from cloudflare. ) reply genewitch 3 minutes agorootparentyou don't have to \"befriend\" them. you send a friend request because that defaults to a push notification for users with the discord app on their phone. Now, with signal, i don't use it so i don't know how initial chats start, or whatever. The discord one is 0-click because the PFP in the friend request is the payload delivered via PUSH. And to someone else's point they had to block the request on their end with a MITM to do the 1-click version on signal. No such MITM is needed with the friend request. As an aside, one time i got doxxed hard in an IRC channel with several hundred active users. I had a suspicion of who it was, and i knew they lived in chicago. So i \"accidentally\" sent a link to \"screenshot proof\" that was hosted on one of my domains. there was 1 immediate click. instant.

The expectation is that Signal does not reveal any observable aspect of your IP address or location when receiving messages on it. Whether this specific level/type of deanonymization is a problem for your particular use case is an entirely different question. Personally, I wouldn't even care if mutual contacts were to see my IP address outright (and they do for calls), but I'm not every user. reply pyeri 1 hour agorootparentExactly.

(But notifications are already a bad idea for opsec anyway.) reply gruez 42 minutes agorootparent>But opsec is hard [...] That's why the attack is contrived. If you have poor opsec you don't need need this attack at all. You can probably get the victim's exact IP by getting him to click on a link, or sending him an email.

I'll echo the other comments and say \"deanonymization\" is stretching the definition of the word, along with \"grab the user's location\", as it isn't anything near precise. 150 miles is approx. a 2-hour drive on the highway from Atlanta, GA to Augusta, GA. In that radius, there's probably 700,000+ people. I do think the auto-retrieve attachment feature of Signal is slightly concerning, as for a private messenger I'd expect there to be an option to turn it off (like turning off JS in Tor). I don't know if I'm not looking deep enough, but there doesn't seem to be a feature for that. Signal appears to take a useful-by-default approach that balances privacy and ease-of-use in order to encourage adoption by the masses, I'd assume most people that are really concerned are hardening Signal, similar to what is in this guide: https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/2022/07/07/signal-con... . They've always recommended a VPN / proxy + a modification of settings for more high-security scenarios. Caching isn't going anywhere, and neither is CloudFlare. The DoSing days of old in P2P multiplayer lobbies with exposed IPs seemed to carry more of a threat than this, CloudFlare's response seems to be the best out of the 3. Caching sensitive information is never recommended and the onus is on the application doing the communicating to tell their CDN / middle-service to not cache specific items. reply giancarlostoro 2 hours agoparent> \"deanonymization\" is stretching the definition of the word, along with \"grab the user's location\", as it isn't anything near precise. You'd think so, but you would be surprised how quickly this adds up to other details people share, like \"oh I just drove 15 minutes to get Starbucks\" or something to that effect, small things that eventually add up to a precise location over time. reply alp1n3_eth 2 hours agorootparent> you would be surprised how quickly this adds up Yes, but if social engineering is involved and tracing back through user conversations across a platform, it's hardly a vulnerability, let alone one deserving of a bounty. The way this is currently functioning is intended functionality, and can be further locked down depending on the user's threat model. This can essentially be classified as opsec failure for the Signal user. If they're trying to hide from a hit in a 300 mile radius, they've got bigger problems to worry about, and should already be using a VPN setup. Every time you click on a link your external IP addresses is exposed, is this a vulnerability? Being online without a VPN / proxy is inherent consent to have your external IP & other required items to be shared with services / middlemen.

How anonymous would satoshi be today if we had his location to within 250 miles? Repeated applications of this attack (maybe disguised somehow?) could let you track someone’s travel over time, and it is usually only takes 4-5 zip code sized locations to uniquely identify someone. reply aimazon 53 minutes agoparentThe counter point is that anyone who cares about being anonymous is using methods to disguise their identity that cannot be compromised by this attack, e.g: a VPN. Plus, there are much more effective versions of this attack, like sending a link to an endpoint that you control getting someone to click a link isn't hard if you're considered trustworthy enough to send them notifications. And less technical versions, like correlating when the user is online vs. offline with timezones around the world. The method that both Apple and Cloudflare use in their own privacy software (iCloud Private Relay for apple, WARP for Cloudflare) is specifically based on the idea that your region is not information that reveals your identity. If you enable Apple Private Relay, your origin IP will be obscured but the IP your traffic is routed through will be in the same country same principle. https://www.apple.com/icloud/docs/iCloud_Private_Relay_Overv...

Discord without a proxy. State actors have much more sophisticated techniques available. (It's still an interesting vector, though! But it's true that the headline and writeup are a bit sensationalized.) reply nine_k 2 hours agoprevSo, it's like the [Spectre] attack against CPUs: trigger an access from a privileged context, check if the access has filled in some cache, infer privileged information from that. It seems that time and again, security-enforcing procedures assume that many functions they invoke are pure, but in reality these functions have side effects, and these effects are observable much easier than the security requires. The actual problem here that the secured area is only the stuff that came through the encrypted channel. Any access beyond it, like following a link, is obviously insecure. If the link was sent via the secure channel, it becomes even less secure because it allows to observe a correlation between the secure channel (otherwise impenetrable) and the insecure outside context, and allows to blow (some of) the cover. Opening links via Tor would mitigate it a bit. The hard truth here is that almost everything may have observable side effects, so opsec needs to permeate all aspects of life, the more cover you need, the fuller. This is mostly incompatible with a convenient UX, but, to be popular, a secure messenger has to be reasonably convenient. This necessarily limits the level of security attainable by its casual use.

It seemed like the ability to query which caches HIT on the dye-test image relied on being able to call out to each other DC. Without this control over the route (driving the probing of which caches were hit), the attack would no longer work, right? reply devmor 31 minutes agoparentThere is another method to query the caches. This is mentioned in the article. reply kevindamm 6 minutes agorootparentAh, the VPN deployment which probes from various geographies?

Even a bare minimum threat model requires a user to use VPN or Tor which completely eliminates your \"0day\". Signal rightfully declined your report because it's only job is to provide secure communication reply lxgr 1 hour agoparentSignal is definitely also aiming to provide metadata privacy, which they understand to be part of secure communication. Otherwise, they wouldn't pad attachment and message sizes, offer a \"sealed sender\" feature, allow relaying all calls to avoid callers/callees from learning users' IP addresses etc. reply cesarb 1 hour agoprevIt seems to me that a key requirement for this attack is that both the attacker and the victim load the same link, that is, that the attacker knows the URL the victim is going to load. If Signal/Discord created a different link to be given to the victim, and never shared it with the attacker, this attack wouldn't work. That could be as simple as adding some extra pseudo-random parameters to the URL which will be ignored by the origin (but honored by the caches), or as complex as creating a completely separate URL for the receiver of the message, and somehow giving it to the receiver without giving it to the sender (easy on Discord, harder on Signal due to its end-to-end nature). reply layer8 1 hour agoparentSince creating separate URLs would largely defeat the purpose of caching, a simpler solution would be to just disable caching, as Cloudflare suggested in their response. reply ryao 3 hours agoprevUsually, being identified as being part of such a huge group that there is no chance of being found is an example of anonymization, rather than deanonymization.

In this PoC the attacker disabled their own outgoing image requests. But that wouldn't help anyway, even if the image could be cached near the sender first, or the signal server prewarmed some other cache. After the victim opened the image, the attacker would see two locations that have the image cached, and could easily deduce which one is the victim's location (e.g. if Signal pre-warmed a random cache, repeating the attack a couple of times would be enough to eliminate the randomness). reply sitkack 3 hours agoprevYou could use this technique to see what geographic areas view what sites based on the content cache age, you would have to have the list of sites, but it would allow you to bucket a geographic by top sites from the test corpus. reply aaurelions 2 hours agoprevIf you need to deanonymize a user who moves around a lot, this method makes sense. reply devmor 32 minutes agoprevThis is an extremely cool avenue of attack, I love the bot/demonstration. reply squigz 3 hours agoprevThis doesn't strike me as a new 'attack' (I have to imagine there's even a name for such attacks), and 250 miles seems a large radius to 'deanonymize' someone, even a high-value target (even if such people didn't take any other measures to avoid being tracked...)

      "A 15-year-old high school student discovered a 0-click deanonymization attack using Cloudflare's caching system, which can locate users within a 250-mile radius. This vulnerability affects popular apps like Signal and Discord, enabling attackers to track users without their consent. Despite reporting the issue, only a related bug was patched by Cloudflare, leaving the core vulnerability unaddressed, highlighting the need for users, particularly journalists and activists, to be vigilant about their privacy."
    ],
    "commentSummary": [
      "A 0-click deanonymization attack exploits Cloudflare's caching system on platforms like Signal and Discord, potentially revealing a recipient's rough location by checking cache status. The attack does not require server control, only a unique URL, and can expose important metadata, raising privacy concerns for users of these secure communication platforms. Mitigation strategies include using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) or disabling auto-downloads to protect user privacy."

Largely, the make up of the audience in HN. I sincerely doubt that the hard core of people doing startups, thinking of doing a startup, or just very interested in the topic has gone away or changed attitude very much. But the profile of HN has grown. It's a miracle that it's still an interesting and curious group, but from comments I'd be astounded if there were not a far greater proportion of people who are here because they are generically interested in tech topics and not specifically startups. That broader group was always there, of course, just its proportions relative to the hard core of entrepreneurs has changed. I'd love to see some objective analysis of how things changed after the twitter and reddit kerfuffles, but I don't believe the article's thesis that the zeitgeist is the cause.

I came here because of smart people having smart discussions about life, universe, and everything (tech or otherwise). HN both got me to drink the startup kool-aid early on, and then cured me from it later on, ultimately making me a startup-skeptic (and infecting me with an unhealthy dose of cynicism). I guess this is how growing up looks like :). Ultimately, I still hang around HN because of high-quality discussions; there's really no other place like it, or at least I've found none. Or maybe after all this time, it just feels like home. Still, were the balance to shift hard towards startup talk, I fear we'd lose all the intellectual curiosity driven submissions and discussions they'd just turn into sharing tips and tricks to make moar moneys with tech, which I personally find BOOOOOORING AF. reply fragmede 33 minutes agorootparentRelatively :) reply Macha 7 hours agorootparentprevThis was always me, and I've been here 15 years. It was pretty much a tech forum then (arguably more then than now, there's much more discussion of culture war issues now, even when stories are flagged it's ever-present in the comments). I think the time when HN was primarily startups was much further back and much briefer than most people nostalgically remember. reply dcminter 6 hours agorootparentYes, but the proportions have still changed. It's not static, it's a progression. 2010 will have been different to 2008 (when I joined) but so will 2013 with respect to 2010, 2020 with respect to 2013, and 2025 with respect to 2020.

If you're determined to look at the world through a particular lense, by discarding any points to the contrary, you're basically right. That's not the same as actually being right, but it comes down to attitude and world view. If you believe the world is shit, you can find countless examples of it being shit. Because sometimes it is. If you want to have hope and believe in better, you can find those examples too. Because they're also there. Life isn't a math problem though, so you can't take 100 misery points and combine them with 200 hope points and end up feeling happy. As far as the people at the \"top\" being amoral psychopaths.

Secondly, the whole world is playing catchup to US which it comes to money, not just Canada. Lastly, the valuations & money in US are a result of an insane ethos (working hard, breaking shit), very corporate-friendly government policies, and a very capitalist society. Canada isn't perfect, our housing is way too expensive and we'll always play second fiddle to USD.

Serious question: do you think having the next FANG is desirable? Many people would say that those companies (Netflix are kind of the exception) are too big, too powerful, stifling competition and innovation, and even deserve to be broken up. Lots of folks would create their own business, but it takes a special person to dream of world domination and want their company to be a global multi-industry behemoth. As a fun example, contrast successful restaurants in France vs in US. In France, very few restauranteurs branch out with other locations or start their own chain, it's considered a sort of selling out/diluting of quality. That's how you have decades old highly profitable and loved restaurants that are just there and work well.

It's just that you're looking at working quietly, humbly, but perseverantly for the next 25 years, slowly growing the business and balancing the risks and opportunities along the way. You won't be looking for an \"exit\" because you want to take care of the company you built. That's a very different story from whatever vibe it is that startups acquired after the dotcom boom, i.e. find something that hasn't been done before, scales quickly, and sell the company after a few years for 1000x, and then something. That never was sustainable, I think, and effectively it became a glorified hiring process for big tech who bought the best toy companies to get to the people behind. And now even big tech figured it's cheaper to just hire the talent directly and not buy their token company for a few million first just to get the guys in. Not saying a good company with a good idea and execution at the right time couldn't still make it big quick: there always were some lucky ones and there will always be. But the process isn't repeatably stable enough that there's a lot of wasted effort to make a few shooting stars. And everybody seems to be slowly accepting that. Go for it if the opportunity arises but if you spend 10 years trying and trying without the fish biting you're likely better off saving off from a decent salary when those years have passed. reply Draiken 5 hours agoparentBut at that point, does it fit a startup definition? In my view, startups always involve rapid growth and VC money to achieve it. If the company doesn't meet that criteria, isn't that simply a regular business? reply s_dev 3 hours agorootparentI agree however it's the 'Paul Graham' definition. i.e. a trade off must be maintained between the bottom line and growth and a startup is a business that prioritises growth over basic financial sustainability.

Jokingly Swedish and Spanish colleagues have said that weather probably plays a part too because it's so cold outside, lots of time is spent indoors some of it with friends socialising or chilling (they even have a word for it, Fika), but not only. So you have lots of opportunities to read, think, explore, experiment. In contrast, in Spain the weather is often nice and sunny, so you're outside more often, with friends, drinking and eating.

We can observe this is well with the open-source community, where profit motivation is not the main driving factor.

A VC invests expecting most of their investments to fail. Banks expect returns, and the things they fund are expected to turn a profit. There are systems in place to claw back assets and funds in the event it fails to do that; and most will, but they're expected to come to the bank with a plan for profit in hand. There are different kinds of bankruptcies to address different kinds of failure. Banks tend to not give loans to people who fail a lot, and the terms get worse with each failure. Meanwhile, in VC-land, the 1/10 startup that brings the profit for the fund could very well be started by the person who failed the other 9/10 times. It seems like if the expectation is, with rare exceptions, most startups won't turn a profit, and there's no real penalty or punishment for repeat failure (because it's expected), it's not a for-profit system. It's a patronage system that periodically mints new patrons. reply rUsHeYaFuBu 2 hours agorootparentI disagree. The VC is there for profit because they expect the 1 win to overshoot the loss from the other 9. They expect potential for profit in all the ventures they invest. Period. And they put forth capital in the amount representative of their belief that a particular venture will turn a profit. Those they believe have more potential will receive more funding/resources than those ventures that seem less favorable. They are not, as you put it, performing in a patronage system, because simply they are not interested in losing their capital. reply myth2018 6 hours agoparentprev> I get bombarded with premature growth and commercialization concerns That general mindset was a major source of pain for me.

It's called your own Career... reply tlogan 4 hours agoprevI think several factors have changed over time, which have made the startup landscape—and for us mere mortals who dream about it—less exciting: Massive consolidation in tech: Large tech companies can easily acquire and neutralize potential competitors by offering founders a few million dollars, leading to fewer truly groundbreaking success stories. The evolving role of accelerators and VCs: They’ve turned startups into something akin to product management roles within their own agendas. Whether it’s cloud, AI, or the next big trend, founders often end up building what investors want rather than pursuing their own unique visions. A lack of truly groundbreaking ideas: We don’t see as many revolutionary concepts anymore—the kind that once gave birth to companies like Google or Amazon. This is likely tied to the investor-driven focus mentioned above. A shift in cultural expectations: Perhaps we—or at least the HN audience—are becoming more like Europe, with an increasing expectation that governments will take care of us, whether through healthcare or other social services. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but it does shift the mindset around risk and entrepreneurship. reply jschveibinz 3 hours agoprevHere are a few anecdotes from the U.S. that can hopefully add substance to this conversation: 1) I am an investor in startups, and I have slowed my investments to a trickle since the beginning of Covid. I have noted that this has been generally true of other investors like myself. 2) There are still tons of problems to solve through technology applications; but there needs to be a moat between your solution and what AI will likely disrupt in the next few years. So, think about solving problems in the physical world. 3) Many startups create a pool of equity at around 10-15% of total shares for awarding to key employees. If your startup doesn't have this, then that is a red flag. 4) When assessing a startup, consider two things first: are the founders experienced in the industry and market they are attacking? Is the value of the solution obvious? i.e. people will likely willingly pay well to have the solution? 5) startups are still thriving at universities that support entrepreneurship and technology commercialization. 6) financial stability of startups, especially technical startups, is greatly affected by non-dilutive grants and contracts, e.g. SBIR awards.

There are massive opportunities out there and it isn't a problem focusing on hypergrowth and exits. It is however a problem that even when these massive growth and exits do happen the payout is usually not worth it for all but the founders and VCs. If you stay too long and the company does grow, but your salary doesn't keep up, and you decide to leave you now have to either abandon your options or buy them and pay taxes on an overinflated FMV (if I can't sell them then the FMV is 0 to me). You are now left with options that are, at best, worthless for a long time or most likely worthless forever. Meanwhile founders have gotten money from internal raises to keep them going and have some ability to make sure their shares have value when an exit happens. Staying means you watch year after year as your options continue to not be worth anything and your share of the company continues to be cut as rounds of funding happen all the while watching as people at a FANG are making 50% more than you. The only strategy that has a chance at any value is leaving early and leaving often or coming in very late to have a real salary and a chance at a minor boost on your options when an exit happens. If you are an early employee (20 or less, and your options are valued at ~0.10 or less) AND you think there is some chance the company will 'make it' then buy a few k of your options as soon as they vest and leave after 1-1.5 years to go to the next place. This avoids taxes on worthless options and gives you some shot at maybe having one give you some value back. If you are any later than that then don't buy your options and make sure you get a salary that is competitive and still leave after 2-3 years if the company hasn't made it. The options are probably going to be worthless but now you are using them to grow in ability and salary. Options as compensation is a lie and that is the core problem. reply cjbgkagh 2 hours agoprevStartups have been on average a shit deal for a long time.

For example, we continue to use the same vehicles (e.g. cars) with a well known technology while SpaceX is advancing on sending rockets to the space.

This is not to say that software is not evolving but most startups don't have an issue with building software but with business development (e.g. selling). reply InkCanon 6 hours agorootparentBut there's still a ton of innovation going on in cars. Tesla and BYD are some of the biggest companies in the world. And conversely, rockets was regarded as a sleepy, government contracting business for a long time. I don't particularly understand why (some) people say X technology has stagnated, like web or apps. There's a ton of innovation going on off the top of my head, WebGPU and WASM will unlock huge amounts of performance for web apps, creating a lot of possibilities like much more powerful web game engines. There seems to be widespread beliefs that the market is \"saturated\" or \"well developed\". This always struck me like saying automotive startups won't work because rubber tyre technology has stagnated. Webs and apps are just the delivery mechanism for software. I think there's two flawed reasons people think this. One is that they only perceive the change in people using it. So they think anything which has a lot of people already using it means it's saturated. Two, they as consumers don't perceive the vast, complex systems used to deliver those services. So a website is a website to most people, but they don't understand the massive changes it has undergone over the decades. The only technology that really dies is very specific ones competing with others in a narrow field. For example vacuum tubes lost to the transistor. reply wslh 4 hours agorootparentThere is innovation, but you’re operating within the same business domain. I wasn’t talking about stagnation but addressing the point made in the article as a software-based founder: will you compete with NVIDIA? Highly unlikely. Will you create an AAA game? Unlikely. Will you advance AI at a fundamental level? Again, highly unlikely. When I said “no way” I meant the chances are close to epsilon. In the past, there was more room for improvement and breakthroughs in these fields. This doesn’t mean you can’t create a successful startup based on AI, but its success will likely stem more from the business development side than the software itself. The secret lies in bizdev. reply InkCanon 2 hours agorootparentIMO thinking about it as business domains first isn't good. From \"first principles\" you have technology (which is rapidly changing). After the technology has been made sellable, people come up with a label for it to put what it is in a box. So business domains are always lagging indicators . And inside there's this deeply buried implicit assumption that anything in the same business domains delivers the same value, plus some market CGAR. It doesn't how value generated by products can change radically. To do that you really need to understand the technology itself. Not me personally because most of what you listed requires deep expertise and founder fit. But certainly a lot of people are. It was always unlikely a startup would succeed, but from a technological perspective, the opportunities have just blown up because of AI. For example compiler/programming language startups like Mojo are back in vogue (the last major one being Java) because of the increased demands of AI/heterogenous hardware. There's many hardware startups like Cerebras. There's people trying to find use cases for AI education, healthcare, automation, etc. Several incredibly successful games were startups recently Genshin Impact, Black Myth Wukong. Yes you're unlikely to make an impact in a very specific field like going head to head against OpenAI, DeepSeek, Anthrophic etc on SOTA models. But there's these hundred other innovation opportunities opening up precisely because these models do so well. Historically the greatest errors in thinking about innovation have been thinking about it like a linear progression of increasing the supply of a commodity to meet demand, like if you have enough computers that's going to be it. It's really like a tree, with an exponential explosion of the surface area of innovation opportunities. If you want a forward looking model, you need to think this technology X has gotten huge, what other technologies will this lead to? reply wslh 2 hours agorootparentWe agree that there are many opportunities. However, I would like to clarify that the market for these opportunities has become more sophisticated than before, and business development plays a key role. Ultimately, you will rely on or utilize advanced technologies created by others and few, such as OpenAI or Llama. The software you are developing could be built by many developers in the world, there is no secret there. While the quality of your developers matters, some may be better or worse, it's important to remember, as the startup adagio points out: your company doesn't fail because you can't deliver software; it fails because you lack product/market fit (and go-to-market fit). reply schappim 7 hours agorootparentprevI 100% agree with this.

For HN case, initial cohort either become too busy with life and success and left forum or become jaded and skeptical about startups by experiencing it by themselves. The second group is still very active here, driving a lot of sentiment in discussion. HN also changed audience to be more general techy forum that startup forum. There are more people that want to discuss politics instead of technology (see deepseek, UK hardware talent to AMA with Peter Roberts).

I personally observe that people have quite different \"sensitivities\" to this phenomenon. It might be true that such people exist, but at least in my \"echo chamber\" it's rather exactly the other way: the more dark pattern such people observe, and the more they feel \"jailed\" by these large platforms, the more they are willing to leave the platform just out of spite. Thus, at least many people of my \"echo chamber\" show exactly the opposite behaviour from what you claim and the platforms intend.

There’s nothing inherently wrong in the latter, but it’s super unusual, and it’s pretty safe to be wary of startups shouldn’t do unusual things with their financing / cap table. Exercising options post departure, on the other hand, is par for the course with any option-based compensation (note that this shouldn’t apply to RSUs, since those are usually owned outright after vesting). A similar question arises with payment of taxes for 409a elections.

I mean, the model for most companies having a very heavy legal component when big money figures are being generated/spent requires a great deal of bureaucracy which, somehow, inherently prohibits participation at an individual scale, in the massive profits. It seems that a lot of it hinges on the nature of work for hire. If only there were systems in place that could make every human being a work for hire payment, even those performing CEO duties, then possibly the profits would be easier to spread. I think a lot of startup problems exist in the Founder/CEO versus Founder/CTO versus Founder/CFO dynamic, which is what any company following the legislated structures must deal with. VC’s exploit these dynamics, they can do it with money/financing, and they can do it without it, as well.

If I can get the same compensation working at a FAANG with less stress, better hours and more balance/control over my life, and the resume entry may be 'more interesting' in some ways, but its hard to argue with FAANG on a resume either why wouldn't I? the choice to risk all of that for only a chance at reaching that compensation is a hard sell. The possibility of pouring your hard work into a company from the start/early on with others equally dedicated, and if it blows up you all blow up is the selling factor. On top of that, how many startups came from employees of previous successes that turned that wealth into more innovation? Restricting that path to wealth for many and concentrating the profits to a smaller and smaller group doesn't seem to me the best economic bet to make long-term. reply absolutelastone 3 hours agorootparentThis is the opposite of my experience.

I’ve succeeded to the 99th percentile with wage negotiation the last 2 times I job hopped (both FAANG). The trick is you really do need to do the work to collect a poker-hand of competing offers with which to have leverage. You can then say “I won’t take your offer unless you make it (top of band, L+1, remote)” etc. This has not backfired on me. It just takes 8 times more effort than getting hired at one place. I figured the benefit would compound. reply KaiserPro 37 minutes agorootparentWait so you got an offer at a FAANG for one level, and you negotiated to go up a level in pay, but not actually go up a level? reply kccqzy 51 minutes agorootparentprevI know multiple successful wage negotiators at FAANG. Before their promotion their annual salary increase is on the order of hundreds to low thousands because they are already at the top salary for their level. reply cdavid 4 hours agorootparentprevnegotiation is very much a thing even at FAANG. If anything, it can help you being at the top of your assigned band. Other things can be negotiated. Source: I am no great negotiator, but I've always negotiated my salary and got 10-15 % more than what I would have had w/o asking anything. This compounds after a few stints. And I've been a manager in startup/mid size/big tech: always negotiate. reply compiler-guy 1 hour agorootparentThere is also the signing bonus, which is usually available for a recruiter to sweeten things if the first offer is marginal. Google-recruiters for years claimed it was non-negotiable, all the while negotiating it for people who were willing to play the game. reply liontwist 3 hours agorootparentprevFunny, my experience is engineers (at ICT level) at big companies are also really bad at politics all they do in public setting is ask for more perks and benefits. reply kridsdale1 1 hour agorootparentI see this too. An incredible amount of griping about the Wednesday cookies. Not much about how the shop across the street is giving an extra $100,000 for the same work profile. reply kijin 3 hours agorootparentprevBeing successful at a startup isn't about being a good coder, either. Especially if you're a founding member or an early hire, it often has much more to do with having good insights about where technology meets business, knowing how to tackle difficult problems using limited resources (IRL, not just in a computer), and even a sprinkle of politics if your startup happens to \"disrupt\" the wrong kind of industry. If your startup has a management team that can abstract away all of that stuff so that you can just code in peace, I agree that your tenure there will probably not be worth the hassle in a resume. reply zcw100 3 hours agorootparentprevI've learned not to expect anything from being an early employee. It's right in the name, you're an employee. Expecting some sort of consideration for being early is naive. Every time you receive a paycheck you and your employer are even and you shouldn't expect anything more. reply bityard 1 hour agorootparentThis is true, except in the usual case where early employees are made offers that include some presumption of partial ownership of the company through stock grants or options, often with a corresponding decrease in salary that scales inversely with the strength of the founder's reality distortion field. reply zcw100 55 minutes agorootparentThere's no such thing as presumptive partial ownership. Lando had a presumptive partial ownership and if you do you should expect the Vader treatment, \"I am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further\". reply quacksilver 4 hours agorootparentprevNot everyone is in a position to work for a FAANG they don't support working in all areas in all countries, often have formal education requirements and generally will be less flexible hours-wise than working for yourself. If you don't want to leave where you are, a full time or side-project web startup can be started and bootstrapped with barely any prior requirements that you can't teach yourself and could be a good option. reply slashdev 3 hours agoparentprevThis. FAANG and adjacent pays so well, it's a better and more guaranteed outcome than startups for people that have that option. Dan Luu wrote about it over a decade ago: https://danluu.com/startup-tradeoffs/ The math is not in favor of working at a startup, if you do it, don't do it for the money. People finally wised up to this. Even as the founder, working at a FAANG usually works out better financially and is much less stressful. VC's do all kinds of horrible things to founders, like firing them, forcing them to sell at a price that means they get $0 (VC's get preference usually up to 2x their investment if the sale price is lower than 2x the investment, founders and employees alike get wiped out.) People are also wising up to this. If you're going to found a company think really hard about joining YC and/or going the VC funded route. I think it'd be a lot more pleasant to found a company worth $10 million after 10 years, and own 100% of it, than to found a company worth $100 million after 10 years and own 10% of it. VC is only really for when you've found real product market fit and your biggest problem every day is meeting the insane demand. Everything is just falling over and you can't scale fast enough and you're leaving piles of money on the floor because you just don't have the resources to serve those customers. Then maybe it becomes a good tradeoff. You definitely don't have that in the beginning, and most companies never experience that. I used to drink the koolaid, I applied to YC multiple times. I'm still trying to start stuff on the side of my day job, but I no longer apply to YC and fully intend to bootstrap a smaller but profitable software business. reply bluGill 2 hours agorootparentTo add, VC is for when you have a market that is large enough to pay off their investment with something left over. There are a lot a business opportunities out there that only can return a million per year and they won't scale. This isn't worth VC time, but if you can find one, a million overhead is still a nice income for you the private business owner. Just remember that as a business owner you need to watch the bottom line, many small businesses go under because they don't account for all the costs of running a business (both time doing bookwork instead of what the business is about and costs of supplies) reply slashdev 1 hour agorootparentYes, this is a great point reply swiftcoder 8 hours agoparentprevThe other bit here is that hacker news attracted a lot more engineers (vs more entrepreneurial-leaning folk) in the intervening time and engineers never really made bank on startups. Even in successful startups the engineers are typically lower on the pay-out ranking than the less-technical founders and the VCs... reply liontwist 3 hours agorootparentThat’s a good point. Also the engineer personality tends to be extremely risk averse. reply kridsdale1 1 hour agorootparentThank goodness. reply diggan 7 hours agoparentprev> I think the bigger issue is that most of the financial upsides of startups were illusory I wouldn't say I'm an old-timer by any metrics, but even back in 2012 when I first discovered and joined HN, I remember it was pretty clear in the community (and people I spoke to around me) you shouldn't go to work at a startup if you were looking for \"a lot + safe\" money. Sure, you could belong to the 0.001% and work on the next Dropbox, but most likely you would end up not, so don't start at a startup to chase riches, as there are better venues for that. Do work at a startup if the environment/mission/team feels right to you, but with no expectations of a big payday-exit. reply pjc50 7 hours agorootparentHere's a question: what's the list of startups fitting the criteria of after 2008 Great Financial Crisis actual startup, not spinoff from larger company financially successful exit early non-founder employees made a substantial amount of money? reply hackitup7 7 minutes agorootparentIf you look at the companies that went public from 2018-2021 (boom/tail end of the latest \"bubble\"), you should assume that all of those generated somewhere in the range of 25-500+ non-founders who cleared $1m+ worth of stock pre-tax (a small-mid cap SaaS will be on the lower end, Uber/AirBnB will be at the higher end). It's harder to know from acquisitions, but I'd guess that most of those with sale prices >$1b generated ~10-250 non-founders with $1m+ share packages. I think that the Qualtrics founders said that they minted 250 millionaires from their initial sale to SAP. reply dare944 4 hours agorootparentprevEveryone has a different interpretation of \"substantial\", but I'll say Nest. reply eamag 6 hours agorootparentprevGPT: whatsapp, instagram, airbnb, slack, uber, snap reply pjc50 5 hours agorootparentFact check: almost totally correct, most founded in 2009 except Airbnb which was 2007. Interesting. Seems like 2009 was a good year for startups; I guess building at the market bottom is a good way to ride the market up. reply kridsdale1 1 hour agorootparentAlso coincides with the start of the app + REST economy reply nejsjsjsbsb 6 hours agorootparentprevOpenai? reply zer0tonin 2 hours agorootparentNo exit in view. reply philipwhiuk 6 hours agorootparentprevThe slave isn't going to turn on its master ;) reply rpcope1 5 hours agorootparentprevSolidfire (which never got talked about at all on HN) fits the bill nicely. reply nejsjsjsbsb 6 hours agorootparentprevWhy the after 2008 foundatuon criteria. Someone who joined FB in 2010 could have got rich right? Same with Google, Amazon, most other unicorns that established before 2008. reply swiftcoder 5 hours agorootparentGet rich in the sense of \"decent salary, and HODL the company stock\", sure. Get rich in the sense of riding that startup VC wave, no. Amazon had north of 100,000 employees by the time I joined in 2012. The \"plucky startup\" days were long gone, even if they did still tell the fable of the door desks at every orientation class reply pjc50 5 hours agorootparentprevOh, it's somewhat arbitrary, but Facebook was founded in 2004 and by 2010 no longer counts to me as a \"startup\". I suppose 2010 is still pre-IPO (2012) and therefore has a chance for advantageous stock grants. (Not lost in all this: over the years the tax treatment of option grants has changed! It used to be a hugely advantageous way of giving employees something of value, and that's been eroded a lot.) reply alexander2002 7 hours agorootparentprevTechnology is inherently a domination force and you can see this invisible domination battle between technology startups all the time. Have a moat* or get exhausted battling against other similar startups until one is the major winner. Technology is the easy part (for most people) Winning the battle is the hard part. TO summarize, win battle=big-payday reply diggan 7 hours agorootparentThat's assuming \"Winning\" means \"More money\", but that's not everyone's goal in life. There is plenty of space for smaller companies that earn enough profits to let every employee live a good life, without chasing unicorns. reply TeMPOraL 7 hours agorootparentCorrect, but if you're interested in that, you start a regular small business, and you take a loan from a bank for seed capital. Venture Capital will give you much more more money and ask less questions precisely because they expect you to go for world domination and they expect corresponding returns. You don't reach for VC if you just want a lifestyle business, much like you don't reach for mafia money just to pay down your mortgage earlier. You have to know who you're getting in bed with, and what their expectations are. reply pjc50 7 hours agorootparentprevThis is called a \"lifestyle business\", which some people get very annoyed about. And as mentioned you can't get VC for this model. reply diggan 2 hours agorootparentActually, what I was referring to is just called \"company\" or \"business\", or at least used to be called that. I understood \"lifestyle business\" to be a company that tries to be adoptable to the lifestyle of the founder/owner, but maybe I understood it wrong or it changed. reply ghaff 6 hours agorootparentprevI think a lot of people get annoyed (probably including myself) because the term sort of implies that there's great work-life balance which definitely isn't the case with a lot of small businesses. reply Kye 6 hours agorootparentprevI saw the same posts you did, but how many people actually listened? How many, instead, came back later asking how to salvage a situation that didn't match the dream? There are always cooler heads raising alarms on these booms. What turns them into bubbles is the inflection point where there are more people coming for the dream than for the thing that motivates people who understand the risks and know the statistics. I seem to remember 2015 or near it as that inflection point. Tech media went from worrying about the steady march of unicorns to not talking much about valuations. reply the_af 6 hours agorootparentprevThe thing that puzzles me is the early \"only eating Ramen and pulling all nighters\" startup founder story. I suppose nobody believes this anymore, fortunately. I mean... we all agree, it would seem, this is not the path to getting rich for most people. And it's unhealthy and stressful, so it's also not the best way to work. So it has to come down to \"the mission\". You must be doing something so amazing, so innovative, a boon to mankind, that all else is secondary and you're willing to endure financial risk and a stressful job, right. Right? But no. Most startups' products are unremarkable or banal with some honorable exceptions and mankind doesn't really care either way. reply signatoremo 5 hours agorootparent“The mission” isn’t the only meaningful drive. It is hard to build a successful business out of even a most mundane ideas. That alone can be a great accomplishment that many people strive for. Also to be able to set and execute initiatives is also a great motivation. Seeing the fruits of your labor can be very rewarding. reply wat10000 4 hours agorootparentprevOr you think you’re special. You know it’s risky and many people fail, but you’ve got the right idea, intelligence, work ethic, etc. It might even be true sometimes. I’m sure success isn’t randomly distributed. The trouble is figuring out if you really do have it or if it’s self delusion. reply the_af 4 hours agorootparentI'm not saying it's completely random. It's very likely a combination of skill [1] and luck, with luck being the bigger factor. So even if you're \"special\", you're unlikely to make it. [1] And possibly contacts, or safety net, or wealthy family and/or friends. reply wat10000 4 hours agorootparentI think there are special circumstances where success, while far from assured, is a lot more likely than usual. Apple and Google probably had decent odds. (Where “decent” here means something like 10%.) But they’re really rare, and honestly and correctly evaluating whether you have an opportunity like that is really hard.

The rest of the money belongs to the MBAs and the bankers. It's always been their money, it will always be theirs. reply robertlagrant 6 hours agorootparentYes, that's probably true. Investors, or people who take a risk, get the payoff from the risk. If you join as a salaried person, you're taking zero risk (other than that you might need to get another job if the place folds, but then all the money's gone anyway), as you're just getting paid a salary each month regardless of how the company's doing, so you don't get an outsized reward. reply Gud 3 hours agorootparentGenerally this is not true the \"risk\" taken by these people is very small, because of how wealthy they or their parents are. If I had $1M and lost it, I would be devastated. If I had $1B and lost $1M, it would be a rounding error. I don't have any money, so how do I even get to $1M? And neither does my parents. reply kijin 3 hours agorootparentWe're not talking about that kind of risk. It's just a synonym for the amount somebody is going to lose if the company fails, regardless of what the amount means to them personally. VC invests $1M in a startup, they are risking $1M. You just work at a company, get paid every month, and don't buy any stock, you are risking $0. That's all. If the comp",

    "originBody": "Reverse Engineering Call Of Duty Anti-Cheat Jan 4, 2025 39 min read Anticheat Reverse Engineering I’ve been reversing Black Ops Cold War for a while now, and I’ve finally decided to share my research regarding the user-mode anti-cheat inside the game. It’s not my intention to shame or promote cheating/bypassing of the anti-cheat, so I’ve redacted a few things. To clear up any confusion, Black Ops Cold War does not have the kernel-mode component of Ricochet that Modern Warfare (2019) and later titles have. I’ll be referring to the anti-cheat as TAC (Treyarch Anti-Cheat) as the game I reversed is a Treyarch game. Also, whenever I provide function pseudocode, it will be the best I can do since the actual decompilation is super cluttered with a lot of junk/resolving code. The biggest difference between the newer games is the kernel-mode driver, while the majority of anti-cheat code is user-mode and very similar to TAC. Let’s look at how the anti-cheat and the game is protected before we dig too deep. Arxan Arxan is an obfuscation/protection tool that’s used on many Call of Duty games, most of which are anything past Black Ops 3. Which includes many features, that make cheaters/reverse engineers’ life a lot harder. Runtime Executable Decryption The game executable is packed and encrypted; Arxan inserts code during the startup process to unpack and decrypt the game executable. Executable Checksums Arxan is constantly monitoring the game executable for any patches. If you want to learn more about these, momo5502 has a great blog post which can be found here Whenever Arxan detects a debugger or a checksum mismatch, it will terminate the process. Jmp Obfuscation Arxan can take a function and all of its instructions and separate them with a jmp. This is also useful to hide where a function is called from, it breaks IDA and requires an external tool to sift through the instructions. push rbp mov rbp, offset unk_7FF60ECD1310 xchg rbp, [rsp] push rbx jmp loc_7FF62B2050A6 loc_7FF62B2050A6: push rax mov rbx, [rsp+10h] mov rax, offset loc_7FF60ECD1622 cmovbe rbx, rax jmp loc_7FF62BD590D3 loc_7FF62BD590D3: mov [rsp+10h], rbx pop rax pop rbx retn loc_7FF60ECD1622: jmp loc_7FF629D04404 ; etc This is difficult to analyze statically, especially whenever it’s a giant function that’s been planted with hundreds of jumps. Entrypoint Obfuscation It’s really difficult to follow the entry point on Arxan-protected games; first, you have the protected Arxan code that unpacks and executes the game’s real entry point, which jmp obfuscation can also be planted in here, making it extremely difficult to understand what’s going on. Pointer Encryption This was actually thought to be Arxan for the longest time, but with recent information, it’s pretty certain this is just something Treyarch has developed and shared with IW for their games, or maybe it’s the other way around. Important pointers such as the current game glob, entity array, object pointers, etc., are encrypted and decrypted every time before use. There are 16 variations of the same encryption method; the current PEB address is actually what decides which encryption method to use. This is pretty effective and does make your life harder for a little bit. Forces you to get the decrypted pointer. Prevents cheat engine pointer scanning (when scanning for the memory address of something that is encrypted, the actual global value will be holding the encrypted value, and this value is never set with the decrypted value; the decrypted value is always on the stack.) There are a couple of ways to retrieve these decrypted pointers (these are not all of them): Using a tool to trace the decryption instructions. Creating a hook on spots where the memory has already been decrypted by the game for use. __forceinline int get_encryption_method() { // this is actually how it is in the exe // the result of this ROL is 0x60 which is gs[PEB] // these values are generated and will not always be the same const auto value = (unsigned __int8)__ROL1__(-127, 230); auto peb = __readgsqword(value); return _byteswap_uint64(peb (NtCurrentPeb());auto head = &peb->Ldr->InMemoryOrderModuleList;int mc = 0;auto entry = head->Flink;while (entry != head){ auto table_entry = CONTAINING_RECORD(entry, LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY, InMemoryOrderLinks); auto n = static_cast(offsetof(LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY, DllBase)); char buf[255]; size_t count = 0; wcstombs_s(&count, buf, table_entry->FullDllName.Buffer, table_entry->FullDllName.Length); // this is just from my hash tool; +20 skips past C:\\Windows\\System32 auto h = ac_mod64(buf + 20); if (h == hash) { return table_entry->DllBase;break; } entry = entry->Flink;} return nullptr; } How can we figure out what these hashes are? The answer is super simple; I grabbed a list of all the loaded modules in my game process and copied over the game’s hashing function (note: dll names are hashed a little bit differently), which can be seen here. // this is used for dll names size_t ac_mod64(const char* str) {auto base = ac_getbase();while (*str){ auto v203 = *str++; auto v39 = v203; if (v203 >= 0x41u && v39 > 8) ^ (0x100000001B3i64 * (static_cast(v39) ^base)));}return base; } // this is used for exported function names size_t ac_fnv64(const char* str) { auto base = ac_getbase(); while (*str) { auto s = *str++; auto v12 = s; if (s >= 65 && v12 e_lfanew); IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY* edirp = &nt->OptionalHeader.DataDirectory[IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_EXPORT]; IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY edir = *edirp; IMAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY* exports = RVA2PTR(PIMAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY, mz, edir.VirtualAddress); DWORD* addrs = RVA2PTR(DWORD*, mz, exports->AddressOfFunctions); DWORD* names = RVA2PTR(DWORD*, mz, exports->AddressOfNames); for (unsigned i = 0; i NumberOfFunctions; i++) { char* name = RVA2PTR(char*, mz, names[i]); void* addr = RVA2PTR(void*, mz, addrs[i]); MEMORY_BASIC_INFORMATION mbi; if (ssno::bypass::VirtualQuery((void*)name, &mbi, sizeof(mbi))) { if (mbi.AllocationBase == mod) { hashes[ac_fnv64(name)] = std::string(name); } } } } } void lookup_hash(size_t base, size_t hash) {ac_setbase(base);hashes.clear();cache_exports();if (hashes.find(hash) == hashes.end()){ printf(\"Failed to find hash: 0x%p\", hash); return;}printf(\"0x%p, 0x%p = %s\", base, hash, hashes[hash].c_str()); } After all of this, it was time to do some manual work. I went in by hand and grabbed the base hashes and function hashes from the decompilation then put those into my program. Now I was able to tell exactly which APIs the anti-cheat was calling. Here’s how my tool ended up working. // (lookup_pebhash is the get_module_base function I wrote about further up) lookup_pebhash(0xB8BC6A966753F382u, 0x7380E62B9E1CA6D6); // ntdll lookup_hash(0x6B9D7FEE4A7D71CEui64, 0xE5FAB4B4E649C7A4ui64); // VirtualProtect lookup_hash(0x1592DD0A71569429i64, 0xB5902EE75629AA6Cui64); //NtAllocateVirtualMemory lookup_hash(0x3E4D681B236AE0A0i64, 0x3AB0D0D1450DE52Di64); //GetWindowLongA lookup_hash(0x77EF6ADABFA1098Fi64, 0x94CA321842195A88ui64); //OpenProcess lookup_hash(0xA3439F4AFAAB52AEui64, 0xE48550DEAB23A8C9ui64); //K32EnumProcessModules lookup_hash(0x2004CA9BE823B79Ai64, 0x828CC84F9E74E1A0ui64); //CloseHandle lookup_hash(0x423E363D6FEF8CEAi64, 0x5B3E9BDB215405F3i64); //K32GetModuleFileNameExW lookup_hash(0x52D5BB326B1FC6B2i64, 0x1C2D0172D09B7286i64); //GetWindowThreadProcessId lookup_hash(0x13FA4A203570A0A2i64, 0xB8DA7EDECE20A5DCui64); //GetWindowDisplayAffinity I do want to mention that these hashes aren’t going to be the same in different versions of the game. Also, this isn’t the only way of beating this hashing technique; these function pointers are stored in global variables; you can simply inspect them and match the virtual address of the function to one of the exported functions from all of the DLLs loaded. Ok, now we have established that TAC detects API hooking (It only checks functions that it uses, not actually checking all important APIs for hooks, just the ones it’s using). These are only here to monitor API hooking attempts that would hurt or prevent the anti-cheat from doing its job. What if there was a hooking method that bypassed their hooking detections? Debug Registers For actual cheaters trying to hook into the game, Arxan has got the code patching covered; cheaters must use non-code patching hooking methods while Arxan is present. There are a couple of these hooking methods, and I’ll list a few here: Exception hooking Forcefully triggering an exception and handling it. Exceptions can be triggered in multiple ways. Modify a global pointer to be a nullptr or invalid memory address. Modify page access protections to trigger an access exception (Example: PAGE_NOACCESS or PAGE_GUARD). Debug registers telling the CPU to break (throw a STATUS_SINGLE_STEP exception) on a specific instruction. These are very powerful; the CPU can break on any or all of these conditions for a given instruction address. Read Write Execute Debug registers are the easiest to use, the most popular, and the easiest to detect! Since debug registers are so popular and powerful, and completely bypass Arxan’s .text patch monitoring, this makes them the perfect hooking technique for Call of Duty games. Here’s how TAC checks for debug registers. __forceinline void ac_check_debug_registers(HANDLE thread_handle, fn callback) { CONTEXT context; context.ContextFlags = CONTEXT_FULL; if (!GetThreadContext(thread_handle, &context)) { return; } if (context.Dr0 || context.Dr1 || context.Dr2 || context.Dr3) { if (GetProcessIdOfThread(thread_handle) != GetCurrentProcessId()) { callback(\"debug registers found, but not in our process\"); } else { callback(\"debug registers found inside current process\"); } // the anti-cheat would then jump to the quit functions that I wrote about a little bit further down // default will call ac_terminate_process_clear_registers // if ZwTerminateProcess was hooked it will jump to ac_close_game2_crash_zeroxzero } } // access rights that are requested __forceinline HANDLE ac_open_thread(int pid) { return OpenThread(THREAD_QUERY_INFORMATIONTHREAD_GET_CONTEXT, 0, pid); } Since debug registers are in the DR0-DR3 registers, you can’t just write some custom assembly to directly read them because these registers are privileged and must be fetched by the Windows kernel or sent to the process by Windows whenever an exception occurs. ; This will throw a STATUS_PRIVILEGED_INSTRUCTION exception mov rax, dr0 ret Driver Signing Enforcement Windows has a test mode, which is designed for driver development. This will allow you to bypass the normal Windows restriction on kernel-mode drivers not having valid digital signatures. This is a protection mechanism in place to prevent bad actors from running kernel mode drivers on your system without the proper authorization. TAC will know if you have test mode enabled on Windows, via ntdll!NtQuerySystemInformation. This isn’t going to ban you directly, but this will have your account flagged. __forceinline bool is_test_signing_on() {SYSTEM_CODEINTEGRITY_INFORMATION sys_cii;sys_cii.Length = sizeof(sys_cii);NTSTATUS status = NtQuerySystemInformation(103, &sys_cii, static_cast(sizeof(sys_cii)), static_cast(NULL));if (NT_SUCCESS(status)){ return !!(sys_cii.CodeIntegrityOptions & /*CODEINTEGRITY_OPTION_TESTSIGN*/ 0x2);}return false; } __forceinline void ac_check_test_signing(callback cb) { if (is_test_signing_on()) { cb(); } } Now we understand some of TAC’s anti-static analysis and debug register detection tactics. We’re going to move on to the more advanced detections implemented into TAC. How does TAC exit the process? TAC uses two ways of exiting the process; both of them clear the registers, and these are written in inline shellcode. The first method sets RCX to 1 as it calls NtTerminateProcess. TAC will not use this method if NtTerminateProcess is detected to be hooked. If NtTerminateProcess is hooked, it’ll go to the second one, which jumps to 0x0. xor rax, rax xor rbx, rbx xor rcx, rcx dec rcx xor rdx, rdx xor rsi, rsi xor rdi, rdi xor r8, r8 xor r9, r9 xor r10, r10 xor r11, r11 xor r12, r12 xor r13, r13 xor r14, r14 xor r15, r15 mov rsp, 0x0F8 jmp qword ptr [0x1B607DC7FF0] ; This is not a custom syscall setup; this is a jump to ntdll!NtTerminateProcess. spot_1B607DC7FF0: mov r10, rcx mov eax, 0x2C test byte ptr [0x7FFE0308], 1 jne NtTerminateProcess + 0x15 (0x07FFA7A3CDA75) syscall ret Here’s the second method; we can see the same register clearing, and we see a jmp. This jump goes to 0x0, which will crash the process. xor rax, rax xor rbx, rbx xor rcx, rcx xor rdx, rdx xor rsi, rsi xor rdi, rdi xor r8, r8 xor r9, r9 xor r10, r10 xor r11, r11 xor r12, r12 xor r13, r13 xor r14, r14 xor r15, r15 xor rsp, rsp xor rbp, rbp jmp qword ptr [0x27E45550036] ; value of 0x27E45550036 = 0x000000000000 These are hard to recover from since all of the important registers are cleared.

The PEB (Process Environment Block) contains information regarding the allocation of a console. The PEB contains a ton of useful information regarding the process. If you want to read more about this click here; most of this structure is undocumented, but that’ll take you to the MSDN page. The game knows that there shouldn’t ever be a console window allocated; checking for one is super simple and will catch some people who use this method of logging. Here’s the implementation. __forceinline void ac_detect_allocated_console(fn callback) { if (GetConsoleWindow() != 0 || NtCurrentPeb() >ProcessParameters->ConsoleHandle != 0) { callback(); } } Detecting Visuals Cheaters need to draw on the screen if they want a working ESP or even a Menu/User Interface. How do they do this? There are a few ways of drawing on the screen; the most common method for internal cheats is to hook whichever graphics API the game is using and draw their information in there. Modern Call of Duty games are made with DirectX 12. A common function to hook when wanting to draw things on DirectX is IDXGISwapChain::Present. The present function is what presents the rendered game image to the user. The idea is you add your custom data to the image before it’s presented to the user, update the image then present it to the user. How is this detected? First, we need to understand how these functions are hooked. The DirectX functions are inside of the dxgi DLL on your computer. DirectX interfaces hold vtables which will point to the functions inside of dxgi, these vtable indexes will be the same across the versions of windows. IDXGISwapChain vtable holds the present function. This can either be directly hooked, or pointer swapped. Detecting these hooks. Something that can be done is to scan the DXGI present function, but TAC doesn’t currently do this. TAC checks the present pointer in the vtable. DirectX 12 introduced command queues; whenever the game is drawing something, it’s from the command queue, a list of draw commands. This is something cheaters will also need if they want to draw. How do cheaters get this command queue? The most common method of grabbing the game’s command queue is to hook another function from the command queue interface, ID3D12CommandQueue::ExecuteCommandLists. Since this is an interface, the methods will have a this pointer passed as the first parameter; in this case, that pointer is the command queue. Cool information: Many things such as OBS Studio/Streamlabs OBS/Discords game overlay/Steams game overlay actually all do this, while Steam and Discord draw here, things like OBS studio are just here to capture the rendered image (capture the frames) and save them into your recording. This only happens if you use game capture on recording software. Cheaters can ignore the game, and simply hook into Discord/steam and draw things there if they want to. What about External Cheats? External cheats are most likely going to create an overlapped window that covers the width and height of the game window. There are a few ways to detect this; the detection methods heavily rely on Windows APIs and require more effort to implement. TAC loops through all of the windows, checking their window style for WS_EX_LAYERED using GetWindowLongA; once it finds that, it then compares that window’s rect with the game rect using GetWindowRect. After all of that, if the window is over the game’s rect and it is a layered window, the hwnd to that window will be cached, which will later be used for many string checks. This stores a bunch of information and uploads it to their servers. Here we can see how that works. GetWindowRect(hwnd, &output_rect); if (output_rect.right >= game_rect_7FF61BBA2F50.left && output_rect.left = game_rect_7FF61BBA2F50.top && output_rect.top = 0.5 && cached_window_count ; We can see 0x780 and 0x438, which represent 1920 by 1080, which was my screen size. Okay, so we know the windows are cached. Now what? The cached list is handled in another function that checks the window text and its class names. TAC queries the window text using GetWindowTextW. TAC queries the window class name using GetClassNameA. Cheat developers can hide their overlapping windows from recording software, and screenshot tools using SetWindowDisplayAffinity with WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE. This is checked by TAC, and it’s saved into the buffer that will be uploaded to their servers later. ac_fmt_sprint(v1035, 32LL, \"%lu\", display_affinity); There are a couple more things related to the window that are uploaded as well. The normal window style is also checked; you can find more here. TAC checks that the window is visible first before any more processing happens on it. TAC also stores the list of modules, including the exe name of the overlapping window. When you do anything in Windows to another process, you need to have permission; Windows has an API that will let you request permission from the system. OpenProcess HANDLE process_handle = OpenProcess(0x410, 0LL, pid); The first parameter in OpenProcess is the access desired, since this is a bitmask our reversing software will just show us 0x410 by default, but that doesn’t do us any good! This can be figured out with some IDA magic. Creating a bitmask structure in IDA Pro and setting that as the function declaration’s first parameter helps us out. // these are taken from https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/procthread/process-security-and-access-rights enum __bitmask process_access_flags { PROCESS_TERMINATE = 0x1, PROCESS_CREATE_THREAD = 0x2, PROCESS_SET_SESSIONID = 0x4, PROCESS_VM_OPERATION = 0x8, PROCESS_VM_READ = 0x10, PROCESS_VM_WRITE = 0x20, PROCESS_DUP_HANDLE = 0x40, PROCESS_CREATE_PROCESS = 0x80, PROCESS_SET_QUOTA = 0x100, PROCESS_SET_INFORMATION = 0x200, PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION = 0x400, PROCESS_SUSPEND_RESUME = 0x800, PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION = 0x1000, PROCESS_SET_LIMITED_INFORMATION = 0x2000, }; Here’s the resulting code we get from IDA. HANDLE handle = OpenProcess(PROCESS_VM_READPROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION, 0LL, pid); As you can see, TAC wants to read the overlapping process’ virtual memory, and it wants to query information about the process. This is the access level you would expect for enumerating process modules. example. The first thing TAC does with this handle is call K32EnumProcessModules. After that, TAC loops through the process modules and gathers the name of each using K32GetModuleFileNameExW. Then the strings are encrypted and stored into the encryption buffer. Here’s what the majority of the code looks like. void ac_cached_window(HWND hwnd) {if (hwnd == game_hwnd){ return;}const auto is_visible = (GetWindowLongA(hwnd, GWL_STYLE) & WS_VISIBLE) != 0;if (!is_visible){ return;}const auto window_style = GetWindowLongA(hwnd, GWL_EXSTYLE);const auto is_top_most = (window_style & WS_EX_TOPMOST) != 0;const auto is_layered_window = (window_style & WS_EX_LAYERED) != 0;if (!is_top_most && !is_layered_window){ return;}RECT output_rect;GetWindowRect(hwnd, &output_rect);if (output_rect.right >= game_rect.left && output_rect.left = game_rect.top && output_rect.top ((min_value_y1 max_value_y2) * (max_value_x2 min_value_x1)) / static_cast((game_rect.top game_rect.bottom) * (game_rect.right game_rect.left)); if (difference_center >= 0.5 && cached_window_count = lpcbNeeded / 8uLL) break;const auto current_module = modules[current_module_index];WCHAR wide_module_name[260];if (K32GetModuleFileNameExW(process_handle, current_module, wide_module_name, 260LL)){ char ascii_module_name[1568]; WideCharToMultiByte(65001LL, 0LL, wide_module_name, 0xFFFFFFFFLL, ascii_module_name, 1560, 0LL, 0LL); ac_string_encrypt(encrypted_string_buffer, ascii_module_name);} }}CloseHandle(process_handle); } void ac_handle_window(HWND hwnd, char* encrypted_string_thing) {// tons of string encryption stuff all over herewchar_t window_text_WIDE[512]{0};GetWindowTextW(hwnd, window_text_WIDE, 512LL);char window_text_asci[3072]{0};WideCharToMultiByte(65001LL, 0LL, window_text_WIDE, 0xFFFFFFFFLL, window_text_asci, 3072, 0LL);char window_class_name[256]{0};GetClassNameA(hwnd, window_class_name, 256LL);RECT window_rect;GetWindowRect(hwnd, &window_rect);const auto window_gwl_style = GetWindowLongA(hwnd, GWL_STYLE);const auto window_gwl_ex_style = GetWindowLongA(hwnd, GWL_EXSTYLE);DWORD display_affinity = 0;GetWindowDisplayAffinity(hwnd, &display_affinity);// adds these strings to the buffer directlyac_string_encrypt(encrypted_string_thing, window_text_asci);ac_string_encrypt(encrypted_string_thing, window_class_name);// store infoac_fmt_sprint_encrypt(encrypted_string_thing, 32, \"%li\", window_rect.left);ac_fmt_sprint_encrypt(encrypted_string_thing, 32, \"%li\", window_rect.top);ac_fmt_sprint_encrypt(encrypted_string_thing, 32, \"%li\", window_rect.right);ac_fmt_sprint_encrypt(encrypted_string_thing, 32, \"%li\", window_rect.bottom);ac_fmt_sprint_encrypt(encrypted_string_thing, 32, \"%li\", window_gwl_style);ac_fmt_sprint_encrypt(encrypted_string_thing, 32, \"%li\", window_gwl_ex_style);ac_fmt_sprint_encrypt(encrypted_string_thing, 32, \"%lu\", display_affinity);DWORD pid = 0;if (GetWindowThreadProcessId(hwnd, &pid)){ ac_log_cached_window_process(pid, encrypted_string_thing);}else{ // assuming encrypted failure message, logs the current process id instead.} } void ac_process_cached_windows() {// lots of encryption stuff herechar* encrypted_string_thing = (char*)malloc(0x40000);for (unsigned int i = 0; i (_ReturnAddress()); if ( (protect_location & cpu_stamp) + (protect_locationcpu_stamp) (protect_location + cpu_stamp) ) { if ( (cpu_stamp & 1) == 0 ) { protect_location = (protect_location + 5120) & 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFF000uLL; } if (!VirtualProtect(reinterpret_cast(protect_location), 1, PAGE_NOACCESS, &old) ) { // this is here just to detect someone hooking VirtualProtect and returning false on PAGE_NOACCESS callback(); } } } Here’s a good example of code that’ll never be reached again. (The program will never reach the top of the main function again.) int main(int argc, const char** argv) { enable_anti_sig_scanning(); scan_pattern(GetModuleHandleA(nullptr), \"xxsaj3\"); // pretend this is a signature that's far into the executable } The scan pattern function will start at the base of the executable and continue to the end until it finds the pattern it wants, ultimately hitting the PAGE_NOACCESS memory, and crashing the process. Anti-Debugging TAC has a simple anti-debug check; but remember, Arxan is still running, so they still have all of those anti-debugging tricks. How does TAC prevent debugging? TAC loops through all threads in the current process by using CreateToolHelpSnapshot32 with SnapThread passed and checks the thread for a DebugObject, which is going to be present if a debugger is running. void ac_loop_threads_debug(fn callback) {HANDLE snapshot = CreateToolhelp32Snapshot(TH32CS_SNAPTHREAD, GetCurrentProcessId());THREADENTRY32 te32{};te32.dwSize = sizeof(te32);do{ if (te32.th32OwnerProcessID != GetCurrentProcessId()) {continue; } const HANDLE thread_handle = OpenThread(THREAD_ALL_ACCESS, FALSE, te32.th32ThreadID); if (thread_handle) {HANDLE debug_object_handle = INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE;ULONG ret_length = 0;THREAD_BASIC_INFORMATION thread_basic_information;if (!NtQueryInformationThread(thread_handle, 0, &thread_basic_information, sizeof(thread_basic_information), &ret_length)){ if (thread_basic_information.TebBaseAddress) { if (thread_basic_information.TebBaseAddress->DbgSsReserved[1]) { debug_object_handle = HANDLE(thread_basic_information.TebBaseAddress->DbgSsReserved[1]); } }}if (debug_object_handle != INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE){ callback();}CloseHandle(thread_handle); }}while (Thread32Next(snapshot, &te32));CloseHandle(snapshot); } A weird anti-debug trick. It throws an access violation by writing to invalid memory; if the code ever gets past the exception, a debugger got past it or handled the exception properly. void ac_exception_anti_debug(fn callback) { // this is writing to invalid memory and will throw an access violation __sidt((void *)0xFFFFFF8000000900LL); callback(); // this should never be reached } Standard API check __forceinline void ac_check_remote_debugger(callback cb) { BOOL dbg = false; if (CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent((HANDLE)-1, &dbg)) { if (dbg) { cb(); // the process will close } } } ThreadHideFromDebugger sends exceptions to the process instead of the debugger which means whenever the debugger attempts to pause the process, a STATUS_BREAKPOINT exception will go off which will close the process. The best part about this is you can not unset the ThreadHideFromDebugger flag once its been set from user mode, this tactic runs in their tls callback which is before the entry point of the exe. ```c++ __forceinline void ac_hide_current_thread() { char use_ThreadHideFromDebugger = 1; nt_set_information_thread((HANDLE)-2, ThreadHideFromDebugger, (void**)&use_ThreadHideFromDebugger, 0); } Monitoring Network Traffic This is a super cool detection method used for some cheats, and don’t be alarmed by this; they do not store any of your active connections; they are only looking for a very specific check. A cheater can write shellcode into the game process that starts a network server inside of the game process on the local network, then the cheater can have their external application send and receive information to this local server, kind of like a local command and control center. Here’s how it’s implemented. // custom tac struct struct tcp_entry { DWORD OwningPid; DWORD LocalAddr; DWORD RemoteAddr; DWORD LocalPort; DWORD RemotePort; }; void ac_detect_local_command_center(fn callback) { // WSA must be the first call before any other Windows socket functions can be called successfullyWSAData data;WSAStartup(MAKEWORD(2, 2), &data);bool successfully_looped_tcp_table = false;__int64 tcp_table_container[3]{}; // allocate the tableauto table = static_cast(malloc(sizeof(MIB_TCPTABLE2))); // get the tcp table size, the first call is expected to failULONG size;auto result = GetTcpTable2(table, &size, 1);if (result == ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER){ free(table); table = static_cast(malloc(size));} // store the tcp table into our newly allocated bufferresult = GetTcpTable2(table, &size, 1);if (!result) // it returns NO_ERROR which is 0x0 on success{ for (auto i64 = 0; i64 (table->dwNumEntries); ++i64) { // store each entryPMIB_TCPROW2 tableptr = &table->table[i64];if (!static_cast(add_tcp_entry(tableptr, tcp_table_container))) break; } successfully_looped_tcp_table = true;} // memory is no longer neededfree(table);if (successfully_looped_tcp_table){ // get the current process id const auto current_process_id = GetCurrentProcessId(); tcp_entry* tcp_table; init_tcp_table_entry(&tcp_table); tcp_entry* dummy; // loop the tcp table for (tcp_table = *get_tcp_table_entry(tcp_table_container, &dummy);; increment_tcp_table_entry(&tcp_table)) {auto next_tcp_entry = get_next_tcp_entry(tcp_table_container, &dummy); // break if we are just comparing the same entryif (!tcp_entires_different(&tcp_table, next_tcp_entry)) break;auto tcp_ptr = get_tcp_ptr(&tcp_table); // verify the entry was created by the current processif (tcp_ptr->OwningPid == current_process_id){ // get the other entries tcp_entry* entry2; init_tcp_table_entry(&entry2); for (entry2 = *get_tcp_table_entry(tcp_table_container, &dummy); ; increment_tcp_table_entry(&entry2)) {auto next_entry2 = get_next_tcp_entry(tcp_table_container, &dummy); // we have relooped back to the start, breakif (!tcp_entires_different(&entry2, next_entry2)) break;auto entry2_tcp_ptr = get_tcp_ptr(&entry2); /* if the entrys port and the one found inside the current process match and they aren't owned by the same process */if (entry2_tcp_ptr->LocalPort == tcp_ptr->RemotePort && entry2_tcp_ptr->OwningPid != tcp_ptr->OwningPid){ // flagged callback();} }} }} } Encrypted Custom Syscalls Whenever you look at exported APIs in ntdll, you’ll notice most of them do a syscall. A syscall is what moves over into the kernel, where the actual implementation of the function is. This is what a syscall stub looks like. IMO this is the coolest feature TAC has! ; rcx is used by the kernel as a jump back location for the syscall instruction. ; rcx needs to be stored so the kernel can use it. mov r10, rcxmov eax, 0x11B ; eax holds the syscall index which the kernel looks up in the table of system callssyscall ret Writing your own syscall stub has a purpose. Whenever a user-mode cheat hooks those ntdll functions that syscall, it’ll work, but their hooks can be bypassed very easily if the anti-cheat just calls the syscall instruction with eax set to the same syscall index as the normal function. Syscalls are vulnerable to instrumentation callbacks; these are callbacks coded into Windows, and they will work on every single user-mode process. These callbacks will catch every syscall instruction and every exception. Just an FYI, instrumentation callbacks are called AFTER the syscall; their return address will be right after the syscall instruction. This would normally allow cheaters to easily see where every syscall is coming from since all of the functions using it are just exported in ntdll. It fails because the cheater will see a syscall from a random ntdll function, rather than the anti-cheat code. If you want to see instrumentations in action, you can do so here. Let’s take a look at TAC’s custom syscall stub. At a quick glance, this is very confusing and hard to figure out statically. They even make it confusing to see what memory is being written to. some_random_text_encrypted_func[0] = ((unsigned __int64)&loc_7FF60E12D0B0 + 4095) & 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFF000uLL; It turned out to be pretty simple to figure this out and understand exactly how it works. That memory being written to is actually a large chunk allocated in the .text section that they just virtual protect for write/execute rights. Now we could spend all day in our XOR calculator and try to build the byte array of these XOR encrypted instructions ourselves. Or we could just let the computer do it…. This was pretty much just copy and paste from IDA Pro, all I did was allocate my own memory here.auto v3867 = 12288LL;LABEL_1798:auto v2168 = __rdtsc() % (v3867 3);auto v1328 = v2168;auto ac_NtReadFile_1 = (char*)GetProcAddress(GetModuleHandleA(\"ntdll\"), \"NtReadFile\");__int64 i67 = 0;for (i67 = 0LL; ; ++i67){ if (v1328 + i67 >= v3867)goto LABEL_1798; if (ac_NtReadFile_1[i67 + 1 + v1328] == 5&& (unsigned __int8)ac_NtReadFile_1[i67 + 2 + v1328] == 195&& ac_NtReadFile_1[i67 + v1328] == 15) {break; }}auto nt_read_file_syscall_instruction = &ac_NtReadFile_1[i67 + v1328];volatile __int64 syscall_stub_memory = (__int64)VirtualAlloc(nullptr, 0x4096, MEM_COMMITMEM_RESERVE, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE);__int64 syscall_index = 0; // this is going to be the syscall index; it's 0 here just while I'm explainingauto offset_that_doesnt_matter = 0x50; // it's just here to add to the confusion; this can be any number above 4*(_QWORD*)(syscall_stub_memory + offset_that_doesnt_matter + 28LL) = (__int64)nt_read_file_syscall_instruction;*(_QWORD*)(syscall_stub_memory + offset_that_doesnt_matter + 20LL) = 0x63B4B73DD1E509A9LL;*(_QWORD*)(syscall_stub_memory + offset_that_doesnt_matter + 20LL) ^= 0x7FA6B73DD1E72C56uLL;*(_DWORD*)(syscall_stub_memory + offset_that_doesnt_matter + 12LL) = syscall_index;*(_DWORD*)(syscall_stub_memory + offset_that_doesnt_matter + 8LL) = 997864955;*(_DWORD*)(syscall_stub_memory + offset_that_doesnt_matter + 8LL) ^= 0x7CEB6A07u;*(_DWORD*)(syscall_stub_memory + offset_that_doesnt_matter) = 1006268688;*(_DWORD*)(syscall_stub_memory + offset_that_doesnt_matter) ^= 0x62ADC0BFu;*(_DWORD*)(syscall_stub_memory + offset_that_doesnt_matter + 4LL) = 1637542171;*(_DWORD*)(syscall_stub_memory + offset_that_doesnt_matter + 4LL) ^= 0x75B49DA9u;*(_DWORD*)(syscall_stub_memory + offset_that_doesnt_matter + 16LL) = 109211239;*(_DWORD*)(syscall_stub_memory + offset_that_doesnt_matter + 16LL) ^= 0xBBCA6C8C;auto syscall_stub_ptr = (__int64(__fastcall*)(_QWORD, _QWORD, _QWORD, _QWORD))(syscall_stub_memory + offset_that_doesnt_matter + 4LL); printf(\"memory allocated: %p\", syscall_stub_ptr); getchar(); Inspecting this memory address reveals the unencrypted shellcode and we can see the standard syscall stub here. Starting with the “mov r10, rcx” instruction. Following that jmp after the mov, 0x2C is the NtTerminateProcess syscall index for my Windows version, and we can see that being moved into eax. Following the jump after mov eax, this is where the address of the syscall instruction comes in; it’s just a jump to it. Syscall instruction. We can take a look at where this syscall instruction is located, just to verify that it’s a bit random. And just to double-check, if we run the code again, our syscall instruction location will change! This is a lot, so let’s recap quickly. Why would you use a custom syscall stub? This will completely bypass cheaters hooking ntdll functions. What’s going on with the NtReadFile stuff? TAC is actually searching for the syscall instruction; their encrypted syscall stub is designed to actually fake where syscalls are coming from, the CPU time is the RNG factor. Example: Someone monitoring the process will see that a syscall happened from NtReadFile, so they’ll do some inspecting and try to cover up anything NtReadFile would expose of theirs, but the syscall wasn’t even NtReadFile. The actual syscall could have been anything; the cheater will never know unless they’re able to inspect the eax register after the syscall (which should be cleared out and replaced with the NTSTATUS code). This is really cool; an attacker won’t have any way of knowing what syscall instruction to monitor. A good way to monitor these would be preventing page execute protections, and looking at the exception, this is what the stub looks like in Ida Pro. Just for bonus points, I’ve recreated their syscalling method. __forceinline int get_syscall_index(unsigned __int64 address) {return *(int*)&reinterpret_cast(address)[4]; } __forceinline __int64 get_syscall_instruction_address(unsigned __int64 func) {const auto distance = 12288LL; LABEL_1798:const auto starting_distance = __rdtsc() % (distance 3);auto ntdll_exported_func = reinterpret_cast(func);__int64 syscall_instruction_spot = 0;for (syscall_instruction_spot = 0LL; ; ++syscall_instruction_spot){ if (starting_distance + syscall_instruction_spot >= distance)goto LABEL_1798; if (ntdll_exported_func[syscall_instruction_spot + 1 + starting_distance] == 5&& (unsigned __int8)ntdll_exported_func[syscall_instruction_spot + 2 + starting_distance] == 195&& ntdll_exported_func[syscall_instruction_spot + starting_distance] == 15) {break; }}return reinterpret_cast(&ntdll_exported_func[syscall_instruction_spot + starting_distance]); } __forceinline void* generate_syscall_stub(unsigned __int64 syscall_instruction, const int syscall_index, void** base, int* size) {if (base == nullptr || size == nullptr){ return nullptr;}*size = 0x4096;auto offset = rand() % (*size 0x40); // using virtual allocated memory just for the example, game has a .text blob allocated for thisvolatile __int64 syscall_stub_memory = reinterpret_cast(VirtualAlloc(nullptr, *size, MEM_COMMITMEM_RESERVE, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE));*(_QWORD*)(syscall_stub_memory + offset + 28LL) = (__int64)syscall_instruction;*(_QWORD*)(syscall_stub_memory + offset + 20LL) = 0x63B4B73DD1E509A9LL;*(_QWORD*)(syscall_stub_memory + offset + 20LL) ^= 0x7FA6B73DD1E72C56uLL;*(_DWORD*)(syscall_stub_memory + offset + 12LL) = syscall_index;*(_DWORD*)(syscall_stub_memory + offset + 8LL) = 997864955;*(_DWORD*)(syscall_stub_memory + offset + 8LL) ^= 0x7CEB6A07u;*(_DWORD*)(syscall_stub_memory + offset) = 1006268688;*(_DWORD*)(syscall_stub_memory + offset) ^= 0x62ADC0BFu;*(_DWORD*)(syscall_stub_memory + offset + 4LL) = 1637542171;*(_DWORD*)(syscall_stub_memory + offset + 4LL) ^= 0x75B49DA9u;*(_DWORD*)(syscall_stub_memory + offset + 16LL) = 109211239;*(_DWORD*)(syscall_stub_memory + offset + 16LL) ^= 0xBBCA6C8C;*base = reinterpret_cast(syscall_stub_memory);return reinterpret_cast(syscall_stub_memory + offset + 4LL); } __forceinline void free_syscall_stub(void* base, int size) {memset(base, 0, size);VirtualFree(base, 0, MEM_RELEASE); } template __forceinline NTSTATUS spoof_syscall(unsigned __int64 exported_ntdll_function, unsigned __int64 function_to_call, Params... params) {void* base_address_of_stub = nullptr;int stub_size = 0;const auto nt_syscall_instruction = get_syscall_instruction_address(exported_ntdll_function);const auto syscall_index = get_syscall_index(function_to_call);void* stub = generate_syscall_stub(nt_syscall_instruction, syscall_index, &base_address_of_stub, &stub_size);NTSTATUS result = reinterpret_cast(stub)(params...);free_syscall_stub(base_address_of_stub, stub_size);return result; } __forceinline void terminate_process() {const auto syassasd = reinterpret_cast(GetProcAddress(LoadLibraryA(\"ntdll\"), \"NtTerminateProcess\"));const auto spoof_start = reinterpret_cast(GetProcAddress(LoadLibraryA(\"ntdll\"), \"NtOpenFile\"));spoof_syscall(spoof_start, syassasd, static_cast(-1), 1337); } int main(int argc, const char** argv) {terminate_process(); } Let’s test this just to make sure. We can see this is working exactly how it should! Again, this is clever and even more effective; cheaters will have no clue which syscall instruction to watch out for. Detecting Anti-Debugger-Hiding Attempts It’s common for anti-debugging or anti-cheat threads to set ThreadHideFromDebugger to true. Whenever a thread has ThreadHideFromDebugger set, any exceptions thrown from that thread will skip past a debugger and crash the process or be handled in the process’s structured exception handling. Which means this flag is pretty important, and you want to make sure someone isn’t spying on your activity. TAC has a pretty interesting approach to detecting hooks for this. To set ThreadHideFromDebugger, the API NtSetInformationThread must be called. Cheaters can hook this and just return TRUE whenever ThreadHideFromDebugger is being requested. This will make the anti-cheat think it has been successfully hidden even though nothing happened. This method detects poorly made hooks. #define ThreadHideFromDebugger 17 #define NT_SUCCESS(Status) (((NTSTATUS)(Status)) >= 0) __forceinline void ac_detect_hidden_thread(callback cb) {HANDLE current_thread_handle = (HANDLE)-2;char use_ThreadHideFromDebugger = 0;// this call will fail because NtSetInformationThread returns // STATUS_INFO_LENGTH_MISMATCH if the length parameter is set// if it doesn't fail, then this function has been poorly hookedNTSTATUS query_result_1 = nt_set_information_thread( current_thread_handle, ThreadHideFromDebugger,(void**)&use_ThreadHideFromDebugger,1);if (NT_SUCCESS(query_result_1)){ printf(\"fake call passed\"); cb();}// this should return 0 always // when running under a debugger with ScyllaHide, this returns 0xC000005.NTSTATUS query_result_2 = nt_set_information_thread(current_thread_handle, ThreadHideFromDebugger, 0LL, 0LL);if (query_result_2 ExceptionRecord->ExceptionCode == STATUS_PRIVILEGED_INSTRUCTION) { // terminate the current thread TerminateThread(NtCurrentThread(), 1); return 0; } } VOID WINAPI tls_callback(PVOID DllHandle, DWORD Reason, PVOID Reserved) { if (Reason == DLL_THREAD_ATTACH) { // collect the threads start address __int64 start_address = 0; NtQueryInformationThread(NtCurrentThread(), ThreadQuerySetWin32StartAddress, &start_address, sizeof(start_address), nullptr); // assume the address is invalid until proven otherwise bool outside_of_valid_module = true; // loop the current loaded modules list const auto memory_module_list = &reinterpret_cast(NtCurrentTeb())->ProcessEnvironmentBlock->Ldr->InMemoryOrderModuleList; for (PLIST_ENTRY p_list_entry = memory_module_list->Flink; p_list_entry != memory_module_list; p_list_entry = p_list_entry->Flink) { auto p_entry = CONTAINING_RECORD(p_list_entry, nt::LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY, InMemoryOrderLinks); // this condition will be true as long as the start address is within a loaded dlls range. // example: memory such as 0x1E000000000 will not exist in any module (any memory from the result of a virtual alloc call will not be valid.) // while something like 0x7FFF12397591 could be inside of ntdll.dll if (start_address > reinterpret_cast(p_entry->DllBase) && start_address (p_entry->DllBase) + p_entry->SizeOfImage) { outside_of_valid_module = false; break; } } // if we failed to prove the address is valid if (outside_of_valid_module) { callback(); // detection is stored and uploaded later _priv_ins_exx(); } } } Dumping Exception Handlers For those interested in how I dumped the exception handlers, I’ve provided the code. You’ll need to update these offsets if you want to use this. void dump_exception_handlers() { // 75 ? 4C 8D 9C 24 ? ? ? ? 48 8B C3 : mov xxx, rsi __int64 exception_filter = (__int64)GetModuleHandleA(\"kernelbase.dll\") + 0x28CC60; auto rtl_decode_pointer = reinterpret_cast(get_address(\"ntdll.dll\", \"RtlDecodePointer\")); // F0 0F AB 48 : lea rcx PLDRP_VECTOR_HANDLER_LIST vector_list = (PLDRP_VECTOR_HANDLER_LIST)((__int64)GetModuleHandleA(\"ntdll.dll\") + 0x17F3E8); LIST_ENTRY* list_head = &vector_list->LdrpVehList; // this will be the function passed into SetUnhandledExceptionFilter log(\"UnhandledExceptionFilter: 0x%p\", rtl_decode_pointer(*(__int64*)exception_filter)); // dump out the vectored handler list for (LIST_ENTRY* list_entry = list_head->Flink; list_entry != list_head; list_entry = list_entry->Flink) {PVECTOR_HANDLER_ENTRY pEntry = CONTAINING_RECORD(list_entry, VECTOR_HANDLER_ENTRY, ListEntry);__int64 pExceptionHandler = rtl_decode_pointer((__int64)pEntry->EncodedHandler);TCHAR modname[MAX_PATH];GetModuleBaseNameW(GetCurrentProcess(), GetModuleHandle(NULL), modname, MAX_PATH);log(\"VEH: 0x%p (%ws) [0x%p]\", pExceptionHandler, modname, pExceptionHandler (__int64)GetModuleHandleW(modname)); } // dump out the continued handler list list_head = &vector_list->LdrpVchList; for (LIST_ENTRY* list_entry = list_head->Flink; list_entry != list_head; list_entry = list_entry->Flink) {PVECTOR_HANDLER_ENTRY pEntry = CONTAINING_RECORD(list_entry, VECTOR_HANDLER_ENTRY, ListEntry);__int64 pExceptionHandler = rtl_decode_pointer((__int64)pEntry->EncodedHandler);TCHAR modname[MAX_PATH];GetModuleBaseNameW(GetCurrentProcess(), GetModuleHandle(NULL), modname, MAX_PATH);log(\"VCH: 0x%p (%ws) [0x%p]\", pExceptionHandler, modname, pExceptionHandler (__int64)GetModuleHandleW(modname)); } } Mystery Tech? I’m not sure what this is, but it looks like something that would flag virtual machines or custom versions of Windows. void ac_check_allocation_grad(fn callback) { SYSTEM_BASIC_INFORMATION sbi; NtQuerySystemInformation(0, &sbi, sizeof(sbi), nullptr); if (sbi.AllocationGranularity != 0x10000) { callback(); } } Since TAC is so reliant on the linked module list, they have a check that prevents someone from setting it to an empty list. Setting this to an empty list will probably break the process anyway. void ac_detect_invalidated_module_list(fn callback) { const auto memory_module_list = &NtCurrentPeb()->Ldr->InMemoryOrderModuleList; if (memory_module_list->Flink == memory_module_list) { callback(); } } The End TAC is a pretty cool user-mode anti-cheat, with features such as runtime API lookups, detecting poorly made hooks by passing clever invalid parameters, external overlay detection, internal DirectX hook detection, checking APIs that it uses for hooks, checking for debuggers and debugging artifacts, AllocConsole detection, CreateRemoteThread detection, and the coolest of all, spoofed and encrypted syscall stubs. Arxan really helps out TAC; it has powerful obfuscation, anti-static analysis methods, and a couple of features that break IDA Pro, all while monitoring the executable for .text modifications. It even has its own anti-debug techniques built-in. Similar code from TAC is being used in modern Call of Duty games. Overall, this was a huge learning experience, and a great challenge, and pretty unreal to see all the things that caught me! I hope you found my research interesting. I’m still not 100% done reversing the anti-cheat, so you can expect to see new information posted here sometime in the future! :) References https://www.lodsb.com/ntsetinformationthread-disabling-threadhidefromdebugger [#1] https://github.com/ayoubfaouzi/al-khaser/blob/master/al-khaser/AntiDebug/NtSetInformationThread_ThreadHideFromDebugger.cpp [#2] https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/c-and-c-/567151-vectored-exception-handlers-x64-windows.html [#3] https://momo5502.com/posts/2022-11-17-reverse-engineering-integrity-checks-in-black-ops-3/ [#4]",

This made it difficult to find teammates, as I was constantly matched with cheaters. I discovered I wasn't alone, as many other Linux users with Radeon GPUs and 16GB+ VRAM were experiencing similar problems. We created a GitHub issue to track the problem and try to find a solution: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/csgo-osx-linux/issues/2630 After some investigation, we found that Valve was punishing Linux users with certain hardware configurations (radeon cards with >=16GB of VRAM, which were quite new at this time). Eventually, after a user reached out to gaben directly, the issue was fixed: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/csgo-osx-linux/issues/2630#... I suspect this was because Valve was preparing to launch the Steam Deck, and gaben wanted to ensure that Linux users had better experience with the device (just a guess). reply ryao 5 hours agoparentCould it be that Gabe Newell is a nice guy? reply hnuser123456 4 hours agorootparentThat email address goes to a team of people, but if you send something substantial and well-meaning, they'll look into it. reply jagrsw 4 hours agorootparentprevIt's possible, but it's also important to be aware of the business side of things. Valve makes a significant amount of money from in-game transactions, and some of their practices around this are shady. Issues like kids using their parents' CCs, gambling industry built around in-game items, and the potentially addictive nature of colorful virtual items marketed towards kids are valid concerns. So, while gaben might be nice, it's unlikely that this gets in the way of Valve's drive to maximize profits in every way they can legally get away with. reply solarkraft 1 hour agorootparentprevHe does respond to minor inquiries frequently, but do remember that his company supports a gigantic predatory underage gambling market. reply Levitating 1 hour agorootparent> supports a gigantic predatory underage gambling market Last year Valve updated their code of conduct and effectively banned gambling.

Back when this was a big story (around 2016-2017) they sent out some cease and desists to a number of the big CS:GO gambling websites but many did not comply and there was no follow-up. To this day many of those original sites are still around and have since grown. Essentially Valve (and the skin market as a whole) benefit so greatly from this grey-market that there is no incentive for them to stop it.

A ban should never take the game away from the owner, and in cases where it does then they need to be refunded (treble damages on top of license, lawyer, and court fees if it takes a judgment to induce the refund). Getting banned on Steam, say, in the sense that all of one's purchases are invalidated should be impossible legally. In cases where an account is prevented from login, items and inventory must still be accessible for trade as those represent real time effort put in by a paying customer. Want to enforce your code of ethics in a multiplayer game?

Combined with the no dedicated servers resulting in little manual admin being possible with new games you've basically created the perfect environment to cheat entirely for business reasons. So then they started adding things like requiring phone verification (not even just requiring mobile numbers but requiring POST PAID mobile numbers) and kernel level modules, making a super invasive PITA solution to a problem. Personally, I opted out of these games, F2P already perverts most game design away from fun IMO.

If you wanted to play video games, you essentially had four choices: Play a limited demo of a full game. Buy a full offline game for your console or PC. Play a F2P MMORPG (no anti-cheat software to speak of). Pay for an MMORPG subscription (also no anti-cheat software to speak of). Cheats were less developed and so were anti-cheats. The F2P model was not as wide-spread either. The mobile app market didn't exist. This is not the reality we live in anymore. I've decided to not waste as much time as I used to on this stuff, because as I got older I learned more about how valuable time actually is. reply sdwr 4 hours agoparentprevEven banks in the real world don't have that level of customer protection. reply StefanBatory 9 hours agoparentprevIf you cheat or ruin game for other players, you deserve to lose the access.

I was inexplicably banned for cheating, despite never having done any such thing (and despite regularly playing on three accounts (this is fully permitted), the other two of which were not banned!) Their support people repeatedly said \"we reviewed your case and the ban is correct\", etc. all the while giving zero information about what I did so I could correct it. I have a couple of the rarest skins in the game, and have played thousands of hours since 2009. I only play ARAM, so the suggestion I was risking my account of great sentimental value by cheating at the most casual mode in the game is beyond ridiculous. Anyway, nothing in gaming has ever stressed me out more. I got unbanned solely because of a contact in the industry who had it looked into, and the ban was inexplicably lifted. I still play, but I think about the false ban almost every time, and League will probably be the last competitive multiplayer game I ever put any time towards.

You will almost certainly badly regret when on that proverbial death bed and most probably well before that, life goes darn fast and the feeling of losing out in the most important aspect of our existence how well we live our lives is soul crushing. Its not that gaming hard is bad per se (apart from addictions and abysmal effect on health), but you are losing on much better aspects of life which are just out there for the grab. Or don't take my word, just check what old people regret in their lives.

Is this supposed to do any good? The actual cheater is still getting a signal that they've been detected, because they get banned. Then they figure out how, make a new account and go back to cheating. Meanwhile the normal user is both confused and significantly more inconvenienced, because their rank etc. on the account you falsely banned was earned legitimately through hard work instead of low-effort cheating. reply gambiting 9 hours agorootparent>>The actual cheater is still getting a signal that they've been detected, because they get banned. So....yes. But there are mitigating tactics around this, I really recommend looking into it because it's a fascinating topic. As the simplest thing you don't ban cheaters the moment they are detected to not give off how you detected them. That's why Activision bans people in waves and all at once, even though they know some people are cheating and still active. Unfortunately a lot of people are paying for cheats nowadays, and the cheat makers usually have some kind of refund policy where if you get detected you get your money back games companies want to inconvenience those buyers as much as possible, so you can't claim your refund straight away because hey, the game worked for a good while even while you were cheating, must have been something else :P >>Meanwhile the normal user is both confused and significantly more inconvenienced Yes, which is why the aim is to have 0 legitimate players getting caught by this, obviously. reply AnthonyMouse 1 hour agorootparent> Yes, which is why the aim is to have 0 legitimate players getting caught by this, obviously. You can't just say that though, you have to actually do that, which is apparently not what's happening. reply gambiting 1 hour agorootparentThe problem is obviously the same as in many other industries how do you distinguish honest legitimate players who swear they haven't cheated from people who will say anything to get you to unban them. I don't work in that department personally, but I've seen reports shared internally where the player literally went to local news station to say how unfairly they are treated and how we banned him without any info or any reason and how it's affecting his mental health and his family and he basically made a huge stink around it, and then we pull up the ban report for his account and we clearly see a screenshot from his machine where he's running cheat engine with cheats for our game enabled. Some people will just lie through their teeth to get their way. So you have to rely on what you know with absolute certainty you detected something that is absolutely indicative of cheating? You ban them. Anything else is a no no. At least where I used to work no one used any kind of algorithm for automatic bans, those were only used for manually reviewed cases where someone would actually watch a replay of your game before issuing a ban. Does that mean the system is foolproof? No, of course not. But banning honest paying users is a huge risk to any business so obviously no one wants to do that, every system like this errs on the side of caution by default for that reason alone. And obvious disclaimer I can only comment on my own experiences, I have no idea what every company out there is doing. reply AnthonyMouse 29 minutes agorootparent> how do you distinguish honest legitimate players who swear they haven't cheated from people who will say anything to get you to unban them. It's mostly not about the appeals process. You want to avoid the false positive accusations to begin with. > and then we pull up the ban report for his account and we clearly see a screenshot from his machine where he's running cheat engine with cheats for our game enabled. Hypothetically things like this can happen where someone is reusing passwords that end up in a data breach and then some script kiddie gets their hands on it and wants to dip their toes into some cheating without risking their own account. Then you have the original account holder screaming at you because they know they didn't cheat. Or they could just be cheaters who doth protest too much. But there are ways you can at least try to distinguish these things, e.g. did the cheating happen on the same PC or IP address the account normally uses? > Does that mean the system is foolproof? No, of course not. But banning honest paying users is a huge risk to any business so obviously no one wants to do that, every system like this errs on the side of caution by default for that reason alone. It's apparently failing enough that this thread has multiple people saying they've experienced false positives, and it doesn't seem like they're interested in getting their accounts back. reply arkh 3 hours agorootparentprevI would not be surprised to learn some gaming company is selling cheats for their own games. reply michaelt 1 hour agorootparentYes, but I think the companies prefer the term \"in-app purchase\" reply hnick 9 hours agorootparentprevThe intent is usually to gather data then ban in waves. If a new tool comes out and you ban a couple of players the tool authors might figure out why and update it. Let it sit a while and you can get hundreds/thousands of players who get a message to rethink their choice to cheat. An additional benefit is that this can include multiple cheat programs and versions in one ban wave, so it may be harder to narrow down exactly what the flaw was. That's the why for no warnings (or explanations) false positives and recourse if mistakenly flagged is another matter entirely. reply AnthonyMouse 1 hour agorootparent> An additional benefit is that this can include multiple cheat programs and versions in one ban wave, so it may be harder to narrow down exactly what the flaw was. That seems like it could go the other way. There are five cheat programs that each have a dozen versions and now you know that everybody using program A and D got banned, the people using program C and E didn't, and the people using program B got banned but only if they were using version 1.2 or lower and not exclusively version 1.3 where they added a new anti-detection method that A and D don't use and C and E do. Now they know what to do. Whereas if you ban them as soon as you can detect them, the people using program B get banned before version 1.3 is even out, they have to issue all of those refunds immediately and stop getting sales because their cheat stops working now instead of months from now, and then version 1.3 may not ever get released. Now all they know is that C and E are doing something the others weren't, but that could have been any of a dozen things so A and D don't know what to change. Doing it that way also has another major problem: Suppose you do the ban wave. Do the people using the existing known detectable cheats now get to make new accounts and keep cheating? If you ban them again right away then the cheat makers get to keep making variants until that stops happening, but if you don't then the game is back to being full of cheaters the next day and the cheat makers are still making money selling the old detectable cheats to fund the development of undetectable ones. reply buzer 12 hours agoparentprev> This ban also ruined other games for me. If I ever did well in a game, someone would look at my profile to see how many hours I have and instantly see the red marker that shows “I am a cheater”.

You also don't have to purchase every single vehicle or other item the game offers.

I'd happily pay for that, knowing my money is at least not going to some 2 year legal fight. I get that I might be the one accused of cheating next time. But if that risk is tiny and the cost when it happens is $50 or $100 it sounds a lot more attractive than the alternative. Also (obviously) I don't care about the account itself. I wouldn't play a game where I aggregate long term stats/items/status/whatever. In a perfect world you just have private servers where you can have 90% effective anticheat and have humans sort out the rest. reply bob1029 7 hours agorootparentI think stat based bans are the ultimate solution for all the client side bullshit. If you use statistics, you will sometimes get it wrong, but in the other cases the cheaters are completely out of luck. You could offer the source code to your game willingly and it wouldn't help them very much. If the cost of a false positive is $50 for the gamer and the chance of it happening is rare, I think many would quickly understand the value proposition from a game experience perspective. Assuming your false negative rate is low (I.e., you have high classification margins), you can make it extremely undesirable for players to engage in unfair play. Even soft cheating like aiding teammates with streaming and discord side channels could get picked up by these techniques. reply raxxor 6 hours agorootparentNah, that won't do it. Even if you had a rare false positive rate, it would be significantly higher for players with a profile similar to ones that trigger bans.

Otherwise they sound quite invasive. reply alkonaut 8 hours agoprevCheating is ultimately a human problem. You can have some safeguards and heuristics like the ones the article describe, to weed out 90% the most blatant cheaters, so I think anticheats like these are fundamentally a good thing. But the anti-cheat can and should err on the safe side because ultimately it should be the players and admins themselves that sort this out. Online multiplayer games must (yes must) take place on servers with human admins. Admins should be present for a majority of the time any players are playing. Ideally with admins the players recognize. Bonus points if players themselves can perform some moderation when no admin is present (votekick, voteban etc). There is no difference between kicking cheaters and kicking people who are abusing chat etc. Obviously this means that \"private\" or \"community\" servers are the only viable types of server for online multiplayer games. This process of policing cheaters and other abuse can not be something that is done via a reporting system and handled asynchronously. Kicking/banning must be done by the admins of the game, and it must be handled quickly. If you are considering buying/playing an online multiplayer game and it doesn't have this functionality (e.g. the only way to play online is via matchmaking on servers set up by the publisher, and the only way cheaters and chat abusers are policed is via some web form) then please, avoid that game.

It's more of a \"helper\" than a special instruction and it's use is never required as long as you ensure the stack will be kept correct (such as with a tail-call situation). reply dcrazy 13 hours agorootparent`ret` also updates the branch predictor’s shadow stack. Failing to balance `call` and `ret` can seriously impact performance. reply dkersten 11 hours agorootparentIf anyone else is looking for more information on this, like I was, this stack is called the “return stack buffer”. reply DSMan195276 4 hours agorootparentprevRight, I didn't want to get into it but definitely using 'ret' \"properly\" has big performance benefits. My point was just that it won't prevent your code from running, it's not like x86 will trigger an exception if they don't match up. reply duskwuff 16 hours agorootparentprevThe return is somewhere before the end of the function, e.g. loop: do stuff if some condition: return do more stuff goto loop Alternatively, the function might end with a tail-call to another function, written as an unconditional branch. reply jcranmer 16 hours agorootparentprevThere are things like compiling a tail call as JMP func_addr. reply frogsRnice 15 hours agorootparentWould you not have to use a jump instead of call for it to be a tail call at all ie otherwise a new frame is created on each call reply nagaiaida 10 hours agorootparentthe call is still in tail position whether or not it reuses the stack frame. there are also more involved ways to do tail call optimization than a direct single-jump compilation when you leave ret behind entirely, such as in forth-style threaded interpreters reply frogsRnice 9 hours agorootparentI guess were talking about optimising tail recursion. Would there be any reason to refer to a tail call other than that optimisation? I’ll do some reading on the latter part of your post, thank you! reply nagaiaida 8 hours agorootparenti only meant that \"optimized/eliminated tail call\" is more useful terminology than an uneliminated tail call not counting as \"a tail call\". i find this distinction useful when discussing clojure, for instance, where you have to explicitly trampoline recursive tail calls and there is a difference between an eliminated tail call and a call in tail position which is eligible for TCO i'm not sure how commonly tail calls are eliminated in other forthlikes at the ~runtime level since you can just do it at call time when you really need it by dropping from the return stack, but i find it nice to be able to not just pop the stack doing things naively. basically since exit is itself a threaded word you can simply¹ check if the current instruction precedes a call to exit and drop a return address in case it's helpful this is the relevant bit from mine (which started off as a toy 64-bit port of jonesforth): .macro STEP lodsq jmp *(%rax) .endm INTERPRET: mov (%rsi), %rcx mov $EXIT, %rdx lea 8(%rbp), %rbx cmp %rcx, %rdx # tail call?cmovz (%rbp), %rsi # if so, wecmovz %rbx, %rbp # can reuseRPUSH %rsi # ret stackadd $8, %rax mov %rax, %rsi STEP ¹ provided you're willing to point the footguns over at the return stack manipulation side of things instead reply biodniggnj 4 hours agorootparentprevYou don’t need recursion to make use of tail call elimination.

It is up to the return thunk to do as it pleases with program state. reply maldev 9 hours agoparentprevFew common issues. 1. Some jumps will be fake. 2. Some jumps will be inside an instruction. Decompilers can't handle two instructions are same location. (Like jmp 0x1234), you skip the jmp op, and assume 0x1234 is a valid instruction. 3. Stack will be fucked up in a branch, but is intentional to cause an exception. So you can either nop an instruction like lea RAX, [rsp + 0x99999999999] to fix decompilation, but then you may miss an intentional exception. IDA doesn't handle stuff like this well, so I have a Binary Ninja license, and you can easily make a script that inlines functions for their decompiler. IDA can't really handle it since a thunnk (chunk of code between jmps), can only belong to one function. And the jmps will reuse chunks of code between eachother. I think most people don't use it since there was a bug with Binary Ninja in blizzard games, but they fixed it in a bug report a year or so ago. reply Fokamul 9 hours agorootparentWhy you cannot make same script for IDA.

I abhor cheating, and I have a lot of interest in computer science, so of course I wanted to see how all of it works and did my research during my youth, taking care to never compromise the competitive integrity of the games I played, but if you look around, there is not a single game that I can recommend to people anymore. Games like Escape From Tarkov are so busted, cheaters are stealing the barrels off people's guns and crashing their game/PC on command. My beloved counter-strike's premier competitive game mode has a global leaderboard that acts as a cheat advertisement section within the game. Games like Valorant are a cut above the rest on account of their massively invasive anti-cheat, but are nowhere near as clean as most fans claim, I mean, you could write a cheat for the game using nothing but AHK and reading the color of a pixel.

Most commercial anti cheats have had a kernel component for many years because cheaters moved there, anti cheats just followed them out of necessity. Valve VAC being one of the few exceptions, but its practically useless as an anti cheat. Vanguard is better because they designed the game with anti cheating in mind, not just slapping it on at the end as an afterthought. And it protects against certain cheats loaded at boot which other kernel based anti cheat don't protect against. Unless you use multiple users on Windows a user space anticheat (or anything you run) can already read all your files and even memory of other processes (Windows provides an API for this), putting it in kernel adds the ability to do so for the other users. Invasiveness isn't really that good of an argument as normal software can already do so much. reply Crestwave 13 hours agorootparentprevOne difference between EAC and Vanguard is that the latter needs to be loaded on boot, so you need to reboot every time you want to play if you don't want to have it running all the time (which is a common use-case since it has a history of interfering with legitimate programs). reply veeti 11 hours agorootparentprevRemember having to install \"Cheating-Death\" to get on some CS 1.x servers?

You added a security processor to your hardware at ring 2, but hardware vendors are notoriously bad at software so it has an exploit that the device owner can use to get code running at ring 2.

      "The Treyarch Anti-Cheat (TAC) in Black Ops Cold War is a user-mode anti-cheat system, lacking the kernel-mode component found in Modern Warfare's Ricochet. TAC employs Arxan for obfuscation, which complicates reverse engineering through techniques like runtime executable decryption, executable checksums, and pointer encryption. Key anti-cheat features include detection of API hooking, debug registers, network traffic monitoring, and external overlays, alongside various anti-debugging techniques and custom syscall stubs to bypass hooks."

By MATHILDA HELLER JANUARY 20, 2025 22:29 Updated: JANUARY 21, 2025 08:56 Elon Musk makes controversial gesture at Washington DC arena (photo credit: SCREENSHOT/X) US billionaire Elon Musk appeared to make a Heil Hitler salute at the Washington DC Trump parade on Monday, following Trump's inauguration. Musk was seen making the gesture twice on live television. Elon Musk does what looks like a Hitler salute after talking of victory at Trump inauguration, thanking supporters for assuring \"the future of civilisation\" pic.twitter.com/xp0kmJ5dFQ — James Jackson (@derJamesJackson) January 20, 2025 He then appeared on stage at the Capital One Area in front of 20,000 Trump supporters, where he thanked supporters before making the gesture. #Breaking: Senior Trump administration official Elon Musk thanks supporters with a Nazi salute. pic.twitter.com/WzSZFUYvEG — Noga Tarnopolsky נגה טרנופולסקי نوغا ترنوبولسكي (@NTarnopolsky) January 20, 2025 Social media users reacted with horror, with one writing, \"Remember when Democrats called MAGA rallies \"Nazi rallies?\" President un-elect Elon Musk just did the Nazi Sieg Heil salute.\" The ADL responded a few hours later with a statement on X: \"This is a delicate moment.\" \"It seems that Elon Musk made an awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm, not a Nazi salute, but again, we appreciate that people are on edge. In this moment, all sides should give one another a bit of grace, perhaps even the benefit of the doubt, and take a breath.\" Elon Musk responded to the tweet with \"thanks\" and a laughing emoji. Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now Israeli activist and academic Shai Davidai wrote on Instagram \"I don't care who you are, doing a Nazi salute is never ok.\" \"The issue isn’t whether or not you’re an antisemite,\" he continued. \"The issue is whether or not you’re normalizing that which shouldn’t be normalized.\" Many online neo-Nazi groups were seen celebrating the gesture. The leader of the neo-Nazi group Blood Tribe, Christopher Pohlhaus, posted the clip with the words “I don’t care if this was a mistake. I’m going to enjoy the tears over it.” Andrew Torba, founder of far-right Christian Nationalist social media platform Gab, said “Incredible things are happening already lmao.” A White Lives Matter branch posted on Telegram, saying “Thanks for (sometimes) hearing us, Elon. The White Flame will rise again.” However, other figures said Musk was making a \"my heart goes out to you\" gesture, and cited his Asperger's' syndrome (which Musk has claimed he has) as being a potential reason for the stiff and awkward gesture. Mars space travel The Tesla and Space X owner appeared excited by Trump's mention of Mars in his inaugural speech, given he has reportedly urged NASA to drop its plans to return to the moon and go straight to Mars, according to Politico. President Donald Trump said the US would launch astronauts to plant the “stars and stripes” on Mars. \"We're gonna take DOGE to Mars!\" said Musk in his speech, \"Can you imagine how awesome it will be to have American astronauts plant the flag on another planet for the first time! How inspiring would that be?!\" This comes amid a Washington Post report that Donald Trump's government advisory panel, led by Elon Musk, will be sued soon after the incoming US president is sworn in on Monday.

HN isn't \"about the tech industry\" per se its mandate is to discuss topics of intellectual curiosity. See https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html.

From my point of view, this recording has no value at all. reply calf 14 hours agorootparentprevThere are plenty of authors and writers who could discuss political controversies as intellectually profound learning examples, etc. That is a norm in academia, for example. It reflects more on online forums and basic limitations of forum structure and demographics, rather than anything intrinsic about a given topic. reply dang 12 hours agorootparentI totally agree. There's a long and superb tradition of that. But the Brownian motion of a large internet forum can't produce it. reply 0dayz 12 hours agorootparentI highly doubt you hold this degree of standard to any other person who was caught in similar obvious predicament.

(https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42776448) More importantly, the issue isn't whether people are boo or yay; it's that both the boo comments and the yay comments are repetitive, nasty, and boring...keeping in mind that something can be both boring and intense at the same time. Since that's what we're trying to avoid here, we should avoid it in this case as well. reply lazystar 52 minutes agorootparentI 100% agree with your opinion that the top level comments would all be of a similar nature, but I think youre not considering how the thread comments would allow people to have a place to discuss what comes next, both for the nation and for the troll. It's a stunt clearly done to keep the executive orders out of the light, but unlike many of their previlus troll actions that had a similar goal, it's a stunt that will have long term implications. The only other place to discuss it are the one million threads on reddit, where all the top level comments are bots. Again I agree with your points, but not your conclusion. reply dang 37 minutes agorootparentThere will be other articles that provide a better foundation to discuss that (i.e. \"what comes next\"). On HN the idea is we want some, but not too much, discussion of such issues, and for the discussion to be intellectually curious rather than flamingly indignant. For the first point to work, we can't have too many threads; and for the second to work, the threads we do have need to be based on more substantive articles (and events). reply Teever 13 minutes agorootparentI'd like to see a thread on hackernews that is something like this: https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1i6brqw/employee...

Dang is point blank refusing to unflag the story; sweeping it under the rug multiple times while blaming 'users' (just like with Sam Altman's sisters claims, or stories re systemic US torture). He claims that this is the right thing to do because \"Brownian motion\" prohibits any forum from being able to discuss this productively. Apparently, since the fact that our new Admin is performing forceful Sieg Heils in front of the world will provoke toxic discussion, this community can't be trusted to discuss it at all. I'm trying to think of a metaphor to explain how bad this is... Imagine the fire alarm goes off in a crowded theater. The editor of 'Theater Goer's Digest' silences the alarm multiple times, assuring people that it's for the best, because talk of smoke and fire can lead to panic and toxicity... An 'orderly discussion' regarding the arsonist (still visible with a lighter in their hand on the balcony as smoke fans out overhead) is deemed impossible due to the \"Brownian motion\" of such a large theater, and so is prohibited.

What you wrote could be a standard reply triggered by a button click. Bold faced lies that followers take as a sign of power, and non-followers wonder about because they're so stupid and blatant (cheating in PoE2, Hitler salute) are exactly reminiscent of the Nazis, that serves a function, that can be dissected and analyzed. Not by everybody, just like some people think philosophy sucks because they suck at it, but people should keep their sour grapes out of it, just like I do when people discuss the latest compiler they designed.

Not knowing the most basic details of the gesture makes it hard to credit your \"it's very different\" message. reply llm_nerd 21 hours agorootparentprevAnyone making a gesture of that sort is going to get an enormous amount of media. It was outrageously poorly considered to anyone with any knowledge of history, especially in such a venue and situation. Most people don't make gestures that can so easily be misunderstood as a sieg heil. Now add in Elon's many, many weird overlaps with white supremacy not to mention that we can't ignore the weird correlation with Musk, Sacks and Thiel all being outputs of apartheid South Africa, all three showing certain predilections most recently heralding a notorious far-right German party AfD, and it takes just incredibly gymnastics to pretend this was benign.

And with this topic, social media manipulation, wanting to decide what people see and what they don't, is intrinsically woven in (via Musk and X directly, and Musk's role in an administration that seems to play janky games with TikTok we probably should pay attention to, too).

Additionally, given the amount of industrywide impact the actions of CEOs have, and a large percentage of us are founders, it would be more valuable than not to have the discussion.

      "Elon Musk was observed making a gesture at Trump's inauguration that some interpreted as a Nazi salute, leading to social media controversy. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) suggested the gesture was likely an awkward moment rather than an intentional salute, with some attributing it to Musk's Asperger's syndrome. Musk responded to the controversy with a laughing emoji and expressed enthusiasm about Trump's mention of Mars, which aligns with his space exploration goals."

Musk then slapped his right hand into his chest, fingers splayed, before shooting out his right arm on an upwards diagonal, fingers together and palm facing down. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which campaigns against antisemitism, defines the Nazi salute as “raising an outstretched right arm with the palm down”. As the crowd roared, Musk turned and saluted again, his arm and hand slightly lower. “My heart goes out to you,” Musk said, striking himself on the chest again. “It is thanks to you that the future of civilization is assured. Thanks to you. We’re gonna have safe cities, finally safe cities. Secure borders, sensible spending. Basic stuff. And we’re gonna take ‘Doge’ to Mars.” Trump and Elon Musk’s ‘Doge’ violates federal transparency rules, suit claims Read more That was a reference to the so-called “department of government efficiency”, the federal cost-cutting effort to which Musk was appointed by Trump, and remarks in the inaugural address in which Trump said the US would send astronauts to Mars. Musk asked his audience to imagine American astronauts planting the flag on another planet, miming such actions and shouting: “Bam! Bam!” He was speaking in advance of Trump’s appearance at the arena, for inaugural parade events moved indoors due to cold weather and for the signing of executive orders on stage. Social media users expressed shock at Musk’s gesture. Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a history professor at New York University, said: “Historian of fascism here. It was a Nazi salute and a very belligerent one too.” Musk did not immediately comment, though he did repost footage of his remarks that included the second salute and endorsed memes seeking to turn footage of his salutes into jokes. One X user wrote: “Can we please retire the calling people a Nazi thing?” Musk wrote: “Yeah exactly” and added a “yawning” emoji. Nonetheless, Haaretz, an Israeli newspaper, described Musk delivering “a Roman salute, a fascist salute most commonly associated with Nazi Germany”. The ADL, meanwhile, says that in Germany between 1933 and 1945, the Nazi salute “was often accompanied by chanting or shouting ‘Heil Hitler’ or ‘Sieg Heil.’ Since world war two, neo-Nazis and other white supremacists have continued to use the salute, making it the most common white supremacist hand sign in the world.” In a statement posted to social media later on Monday, the ADL said: “This is a delicate moment. It’s a new day and yet so many are on edge. Our politics are inflamed, and social media only adds to the anxiety. “It seems that Elon Musk made an awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm, not a Nazi salute, but again, we appreciate that people are on edge. In this moment, all sides should give one another a bit of grace, perhaps even the benefit of the doubt, and take a breath. This is a new beginning. Let’s hope for healing and work toward unity in the months and years ahead.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland Free newsletter A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

People can officially stop listening to you as any sort of reputable source of information now. You work for them. Thank you for making that crystal clear to all.” Musk responded to that message, saying Ocasio-Cortez “has reached Stage 5 [Trump Derangement Syndrome] – fully unhinged”. Trump has widely been accused of being a white supremacist and indeed compared to Hitler – not least by JD Vance, now Trump’s vice-president, before the former Marine and author entered Republican politics and changed his tune. Musk’s engagement with and support for the global far right continues to prove controversial. Earlier this month he hosted Alice Weidel, leader of Alternative für Deutschland, a far-right German party, for a conversation on X. Weidel contended that Hitler “wasn’t a conservative, he wasn’t a libertarian, he was a communist, socialist guy, and we are the opposite”. Musk agreed. On Monday, some prominent far-right social media users celebrated Musk’s gestures onstage in Washington, however he had meant them. As first reported by Rolling Stone, Christopher Pohlhaus, the leader of Blood Tribe, a neo-Nazi group, wrote on Telegram: “I don’t care if this was a mistake. I’m going to enjoy the tears over it.” Andrew Torba, the founder of Gab, a far-right social media platform, also wrote: “Incredible things are happening already.” Read more of the Guardian’s Trump coverage Trump embraces role of demagogue, claims to be ‘peacemaker’ Factchecking Trump’s speech Activists ask: is there any point in mass protest?

I was a hardcore pro-Musk before he bought Twitter. But it didn’t take him long to show his nazi colors (NOT an exaggeration) after that (maybe even a bit before?).

Accurate title, accompanying video with clear-cut evidence, an open spirit of discussion what are we doing here? reply cdrini 12 hours agoparentI will note that hacker news, unlike most sites, has a pretty well-defined set of criteria for what they're looking for, as defined on their guidelines page: https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html . They explicitly list politics as a reason why things might not be appropriate for this forum. Unlike, say, reddit, which has a bunch of subreddits for various topics, hacker news only has one feed. So it is naturally more restrictive about topic. I can see how reasonable folks can see this post as sort of grey area, but at the end of the day, the users of hacker news flagged this post, the moderator who I've historically found to do a fantastic and neutral job of monitoring believes it does not meet HN guidelines, so I think this just isn't the platform to discuss this news. And that doesn't seem unreasonable, either. I'm sure there are other places to discuss it online. reply HaZeust 10 hours agorootparentI think it comes from a place of pre-emptive laziness.

In some versions, the arm is raised upward at an angle; in others, it is held out parallel to the ground. In contemporary times, the former is commonly considered a symbol of fascism that had been based on a custom popularly attributed to ancient Rome.[1] However, no Roman text gives this description, and the Roman works of art that display salutational gestures bear little resemblance to the modern so-called \"Roman\" salute.\" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_salute reply tamaharbor 17 hours agoprev [4 more] [flagged] autumnstwilight 11 hours agoparentI also have Aspergers and I know it's a bad idea give a salute by sticking my arm out straight in public, particularly as a celebrity at a televised event. reply amai 10 hours agoparentprevYou can be a decent man and a Nazi.

If censorship is indeed happening either due to manual flags or “AI” algorithms, people need to know what’s happening and if this is just anecdotal or geography specific or could be spreading to other countries in other forms for other search words and terms.

That has to change it's literally not safe. There is a lot of witless verbiage about the \"town square\", but precious little acknowledgement of the obvious fact that every town has its OWN square, and that's the point.

I'm sick to the back teeth of it, and it's time to make it stop. reply Wickedflickr 8 hours agorootparentI truly believe the Fediverse is a viable solution. I've found Lemmy to be an extremely viable alternative to Reddit. The fediverse, more than any other centralized solution, seems equipped to avoid the hellish pitfalls that profit-motive behemoths seemingly must sink into. There is no monetization, corporate decisions, manipulative algorithms; just self-hosted open source instances as far as the eye can see. Certainly there are rough edges and a perceptible decrease in dopamine from using them, but surely that's worth toughing out as they shape up if it means stopping the unfathomable destruction of society that we're experiencing in real time from big tech? In Manufacturing Consent, Noam Chomsky makes a powerful argument that independent, citizen owned media is of critical importance if we're to pull society to a better, more collaborative place. It doesn't get more 'citizen owned' than a web of interconnected self-hosted servers. reply glimmung 7 hours agorootparentI agree. As well as the technical merits, it seems to me to be a better match for natural human interaction. Your point about citizen-owned media is well made in the US we seem to be seeing the near-total collapse of integrity in commercial media on the one hand it is dismaying to watch, on the other it is as clear a call to arms as we could wish for. It's been good to see Bluesky up its video game in response to the TikTok nonsense. I'd like to think that the Fediverse could evolve to meet the expectations of people fleeing Facebook, Twitter & co, but it's not there yet. Those of us who are highly motivated (and I am, after recent events!) will make do, but I think it needs to be easier in order to get the critical mass required. reply nolok 8 hours agorootparentprevI'm not sure if I'm more disappointed in you acting like \"rest of the world\" means europe only, or by you thinking europe is a unified identical blob. My country of france neither delegated its defense to the US nor its energy to Russia, for exemple. reply baq 8 hours agorootparentActually wanted to highlight France as one country which correctly identified the threat of US going batshit crazy soon after WW2 and positioned accordingly, but didn't want to go into nuance on this particular thread. Now that it's flagged, we can agree in peace. reply JumpCrisscross 6 hours agorootparent> France as one country which correctly identified the threat of US going batshit crazy soon after WW2 This was equal part pragmatic foreign policy and a desire by the French elite to hold onto their colonies, an institution strongly opposed by the United States since around WWI. reply xnorswap 8 hours agorootparentprevWe share the blame as we spent 80 years relying on the crutch of US military support and now we struggle to see how we can stand up on our own without the crutch.

For years, liberals have been tacitly and often explicitly endorsing censorious behavior of Twitter, Meta and others as not only legitimate, but desirable. And this outcome is exactly why that was a dangerous position to embrace. Because, soon enough, someone you don't agree with will come into power. We need to denounce censorship always, _especially_ when we disagree with those being censored. reply thiht 7 hours agorootparent#republicans has never been censored.

It’s just a shame that one side of the political divide is a lot more prone to… completely ignore the truth. That means it looks like you’re censoring their speech, when what you are really censoring is nonsense. reply Dracophoenix 5 hours agorootparentWho decides what a fact is and by what manner is information determined to be factual? In 2020, many major social media sites censored the New York Post's story regarding the Hunter Biden laptop scandal citing the report as political mis or disinformation. The same laptop that many denied the very existence of became a lynchpin in securing Hunter Biden's guilt during his subsequent tax fraud case. reply cauch 4 hours agorootparentI personally think it's a bad example: they censored this story while there were wild speculations. But at the end, it had negligible impact on the news. As soon as it appeared that the story was not a political mis/disinformation, it was not suppressed anymore. If anything, it just shows that they are censoring based on facts: if there are established facts about Hunter Biden's laptop, then the information cannot be censored. It is obvious to me that any brand new story is first \"unestablished\". They are indistinguishable from rumors. If you start choosing and picking \"this story sounds nice to me, so let's not censor it even if it's not confirmed yet, this story is not confirmed yet either but let's censor it\", then, it is arbitrary. The fact that a story starts as not confirmed and then turn out to be confirmed is not the proof something is wrong, on the opposite. I think it's the problem of people who think \"facts\" are just \"opinions\" and that you can modify them as you want. They don't understand how \"facts\" work, and that it requires time for the confidence to grow. I also think that they sometimes get confused because they want very much to believe in some \"opinions\" or \"fake news\", but then people are saying, correctly, that this is not based on facts, so their only resort is to pretend this \"opinion\" or \"fake news\" is as factual as the other facts, but therefore it means that indeed, \"facts\" have no objectivity, everyone can just say \"it's a fact\" or \"it's not a fact\" based on what they want to hear. reply pjc50 9 hours agorootparentprevThere's something to this argument, but a truly uncensored site 4chan style would never have been bigger than that site. The platforms have to censor CSAM; commercially, they end up having to censor slurs and abuse down to a level which the users and advertisers find acceptable. (also there's a lot of false equivalence going on here 'democrat' isn't a slur!) reply sirsinsalot 7 hours agorootparentThe issue isn't necessarily that all censorship is \"bad\", it's that it is being applied asymmetrically to benefit a political party, blatantly. reply NeutralForest 9 hours agorootparentprevLet's not \"both sides\" this issue. reply timeon 9 hours agorootparentprevYou are painting it with really broad brush.

The people who need to be made aware of this aren't the people who are remaining on there (which are people who either already are critical of Musk but are stubborn or can't leave for other reasons, and Musk fans). reply ndsipa_pomu 8 hours agorootparentprevI saw the BBC's article \"Elon Musk's gesture at Trump rally draws scrutiny\" way to downplay a Nazi salute, BBC. Musk has been promoting extreme right-wing opinions, conspiracies and outright lies for quite a while now and he's obviously seeing the Trump presidency as a key success in his plot for world domination, so he no longer needs to hide his fascism/racism etc. Why other organisations are seeking to downplay actual Nazi salutes must be because they are scared of the power imbalance and seek to appease (hint: that never works). reply addandsubtract 7 hours agorootparentGerman media is doing the same, posing it as a question or posing it as \"looks like\" and it's baffling. Then there's also the Anti-Defamation League coming forward protecting Musk and saying it wasn't a nazi salut. I don't even know how anyone, much less an organization meant to protect jewish interests, can come to that conclusion. reply mandmandam 7 hours agorootparent> I don't even know how anyone, much less an organization meant to protect jewish interests, can come to that conclusion. Once you start differentiating between Zionist interests and Jewish interests, the last 80 years (and especially the last 15 months) makes a lot more sense. reply ndsipa_pomu 7 hours agorootparentprevI saw about the ADL's stance and just find it unbelievable.

Truly amazing. reply _DeadFred_ 1 hour agorootparentNever believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.

You do realise that the Nazi party were not at all socialist they called themselves that to trick and lie to the Germans. reply rofo1 8 hours agorootparentI am not building anything. Perhaps you need to study history and see what happened. There is no distinction of evil between the communists in USSR and NAZI Germany. They were both clear evil. I thank God they are both history now and we should not forget it, ever. reply ndsipa_pomu 7 hours agorootparentWhat? One moment, you're defending Musk's Nazi salute and the next you're stating that \"we should not forget\"? Not forgetting implies that we must NEVER tolerate Nazi sympathisers and Nazi ideology. Musk has been promoting Nazi/extreme right-wing ideologies for quite a while now and his latest stunt is to perform a Nazi salute which insults the memories of everyone that fought against the Nazis in WWII.

So you're just underlining the point. reply rofo1 8 hours agorootparentnext [6 more] [flagged] cauch 8 hours agorootparentYou have the opinion that Musk's gesture was perfectly innocent. Others don't think so. It's your opinion, and it's a valid hypothesis. But the other opinions are as valid as yours. They are implying that Musk is not nice and don't give him the benefice of the doubt. You are implying that people criticizing Musk are not nice, and don't give them the benefice of the doubt. The parallel with \"democrats doing Nazi salute\" is pretty poor: of course people will not assume it was the intention for someone who has, by the ideas they defend and by their acts, demonstrated they are strongly opposed to the Nazi ideas. But it is not the case here. On my side, I think it is very difficult to believe that Musk has done it 100% innocently. Musk is a troll, and it was a perfect opportunity to \"trigger\" people while pretending he did it innocently. I'm not sure how sympathetic he is with Nazi ideas (but I would not be surprised he would be sympathetic to the core concepts, he is promoting the same family of ideas grounded in the same roots), but I think it is very much plausible that he don't consider the Nazi salute dirty enough, so that he can use it to troll with despite the consequences (think of the message it sends to real Nazi sympathizers), which is already pretty bad. The views he has expressed otherwise (support to AfD, conspiracy theory, ...) just reinforce the idea that \"100% innocently\" is unlikely. reply rofo1 5 hours agorootparent> The parallel with \"democrats doing Nazi salute\" is pretty poor: of course people will not assume it was the intention for someone who has, by the ideas they defend and by their acts, demonstrated they are strongly opposed to the Nazi ideas.

How is that support for the National-Socialists? > I'm not sure how sympathetic he is with Nazi ideas (but I would not be surprised he would be sympathetic to the core concepts, he is promoting the same family of ideas grounded in the same roots), Again, you have to prove this. Be concrete: which ideas precisely? Which \"concepts\", which \"family\"? reply cauch 4 hours agorootparentI had this kind of discussions before but unfortunately it is usually a waste of time, as any consensus amongst experts is waved away. > He has shown support for free markets, reducing regulations, reducing taxes/gov. spending (within budget and small at that) and for limited government in general. How is that support for the National-Socialists? I think this sentence already is quite telling. For example, Nazi privatized the German industry massively in the 30s, and there was a full wing of the Nazi party defending free markets and low government, with people like for example Walther Funk. They also had the support of big private industry leaders like Friedrich Thyssen. The opposed wing of the party, containing for example Göring, who were advocating for a deeper control by the state on economy in order to build up the army, got the favor of Hitler just before the war. But it does not mean that the Nazi ideology was incompatible with pro free market, low regulations and low government ideals: there were plenty of proper Nazi that were openly defending these ideals. > Which \"concepts\", which \"family\"? Well, that is usually where the well is poisoned. For example, AfD in Germany is widely recognised as grounded in Nazi values (the fact that it is the relevant party that attracts the most people who consider themselves as proper Nazi is a very good clue: why the self-recognized Nazi likes this party so much if this party does not share any of their values?). But then, it is easy to just say \"na-ah, they have nothing to do with Nazi values\", even if it does not correspond to the simple facts. Yet, Musk has recently openly supported this party. There are plenty of political party in Germany and in Europe. He could have not supported any party, the same way he did not in France, in Spain, in Italy, ... or he could have defended values, or he could have defended other parties that are basically pushing for the same economic policies that Musk is probably interested in. It is difficult to understand why Musk is suddenly entering the debate JUST to defend parties with strong nationalistic and xenophobic roots (not used as an insult, it's just a fact of what their policies are) if Musk does not share these values, and these values are indeed the values shared by the Nazi party. reply rofo1 3 hours agorootparentWhy can't you discuss sincerely and directly to the point? Why do you start with: \"it's a waste of time\", \"this is telling\", \"the ExP3rtz said this..\" Stop moving the goal posts I asked for direct examples, you say why didn't he supported parties in France and Spain. NAZI Germany had total control over the economy. If you are contesting this point, there is nothing for me to discuss further with you. They also had total control over the social aspects and any kind of even slight criticism of anything related to their party or the way they rule, was met with severe penalties. They regularly executed people for treason cause of criticism. They fully controlled all media and speech without exceptions. Goes without saying that they disarmed anyone that wasn't directly controlled by their party. This is what the communists did, too. This is why I maintain they are the same evil. It's unbelievable to read that a grown person thinks that companies in NAZI Germany had any kind of freedom themselves. I disagree with that strongly, as anyone knowing anything remotely about Germany 1933-1945 would. I am against any censorship of ideas ideas should be discussed openly. And I am against government interference in private businesses. That is core position of freedom. If Elon or Trump endanger it, I am against that, loud and clear. This is off topic, but are you going to say the same for what the Democrats did to Zuckerberg? Check the Joe Rogan interview for details. That's just one example, they did much more than this. It doesn't matter how they justify it (\"compassion\", \"empathy\", \"we protect you from thoughts\" etc.) reply computerthings 8 hours agorootparentprevMusk is too ignorant of it to support or not support \"Nazi Germany\", flat out. But he's constantly boosting actual Neo-Nazis, agreeing with the white replacement stuff, endorsed the AfD again, without knowing what that means and now he's snarling, and saluting the audience and Trump. > Georgios Katidis (Greek: Γεώργιος Κατίδης; born 12 February 1993) is a Greek professional footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder. He is best known for performing a Nazi salute after scoring a game-winning goal in 2013, which led to his permanent suspension from every level of the Greece national team and his suspension from AEK Athens for the remainder of the 2013 season. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgios_Katidis Note how the article doesn't even mention what he thinks about \"NAZI Germany\", because it doesn't matter. It's a Hitler salute. And that's a soccer player, not someone rambling about fake news on a platform they bought where they also constantly say \"hmm, interesting\" to the most vile, demented nazi bullshit, and now running a \"department of government efficiency\". This deserves a LOT more scrutiny, at the inauguration of a President who once said he could shoot people in broad daylight on Times Square, and his supporters wouldn't mind. > This is one of the many reasons Democrats lost. This type of propaganda will not work anymore. What \"kind of propaganda\"? That you keep repeating I claim Elon Musk \"supports Nazi Germany\", which doesn't exist since 1945? What are you on about?

And even then I feel like censorship is probably the wrong way to do it. And from that perspective, these quotes you're currently touting are ripped out of their context, making them sound asinine despite being mostly on point, fundamentally. Twitter, Facebook, Google etc are private companies. They should be free to censor whatever they decide to censor. I would personally hate it if they did, and it'd hope we'd get a competing platform that doesn't censor and that that'd become the standard, but it is what it is. If a government makes the company censor something, then that is a violation of free speech (which I sadly don't have, as I'm not from the USA). And isn't that what happened in the context of Corona/antivax? reply vladms 8 hours agorootparentWhat is censorship for you personally? I don't have a clear definition in mind (because I think is hard), but something along the lines of \"the ones with overwhelming power should not be able to impose what ideas are spread\". Why I think is hard it's because multiple rules can be made to make it impossible to spread ideas: talking loudly in the street => you disturb the neighbors; you send mails with pamphlets => it's spam; want to make an add on TV => extremely expensive. And so on. reply ffsm8 6 hours agorootparentI completely agree that it's a very hard topic from the perspective of actually maintaining a healthy social media site. Most of them have a vision for their platform, i.e. town hall for Twitter, family and friend conversations for Facebook etc. To adhere to this image they filter out spam etc. now, filtering out obnoxious content just becomes one more rule and thus the slippery slope begins. But to answer your question: for me, any kind of interference such as deleting/hiding content or algorithmically influence which content is shown is censorship on social media platforms, and the user should be responsible for applying such censorship. I.e. provide a UI which let the user configure their own preferences. But actually nailing such a feature with a good UX ain't easy, and how to actually implement it isn't either, so that's just a pipedream, realistically speaking. reply vladms 1 hour agorootparentI have doubts the effects would be as envisioned. There might be negative social/biological traits (ex: fear is stronger than happiness; low threshold for believing things) that amplified by the exponential effect of such a network can have disastrous results.

Is there a off-the-shelf solution To get better answers, you need to flesh out all the features of Facebook that your communities are using. E.g. Shared event calendars? Groups? Private Messaging? Video hosting for users to upload vids of community events? Live feeds? Etc. Look at the left side of navigation topics to help you enumerate and think about it: https://www.facebook.com/help/130979416980121/ Do you expect those ~50k to create new logins for the new platform? Or do they sign in with their existing \"Facebook ID\" to avoid hassle of new account creation? Do they need a phone app? If it's website only from the smartphone web browser, do you need web push for notifications? Facebook interaction with others has convenient lookup from the phones' contact listing. Web-only site doesn't have straightforward access to smartphone's address book (without PhoneGap). Etc. If your communities are using a lot of those social networking features, it means trying to use Mastodon as a substitute for Facebook is going to be a very incomplete solution.

Communication technology had already matured, but we didn’t have these engagement-driven social media platforms. The goal of these platforms isn’t to communicate, it is to sell ads and pick engaging posts to re-broadcast. What gets people engaged is stupid anger. Even stuff I agree with on some fundamental political level, the social media version is just stressed out, to the point of being ineffective and often wrong in detail. Centralized as driven social media can’t go out of business fast enough. reply bko 35 minutes agorootparentI think you're mixing a few things here. There's social media (TikTok, Instagram, X, viral crap) and then there's social media (organize parties, facebook marketplace, Whatsapp, etc).

He was asked about the NY Post story (which Facebook never actually blocked, they only — briefly — blocked it from “trending”), and Zuckerberg very carefully worded his answer to say something that was already known, but which people not listening carefully might think revealed something new: The background here is that the FBI came to us – some folks on our team – and was like ‘hey, just so you know, you should be on high alert. We thought there was a lot of Russian propaganda in the 2016 election, we have it on notice that basically there’s about to be some kind of dump that’s similar to that’. But the fact that the FBI had sent out a general warning to all of social media to be on the lookout for disinfo campaigns like that was widely known and reported on way earlier.

Much of this advice is from that perspective. YMMV.) So: my advice is to not think of it as all-or-nothing. You will not be able to move 300k people off of Facebook overnight. This is somewhat akin to every IT migration project ever: it always takes longer than you think, and is not always a linear process from \"fewer people migrated\" to \"more people migrated\". It's also akin to community organizing: there is no substitute for actually talking to people about it, especially in the initial phases. Or: high-touch sales, where you may initially need to spend a lot of energy and time per person successfully moved over. The other common thing here is that you will hear \"no\" a lot, which is a valuable experience anyways (but will be frustrating). Also: unfortunately, no one will care if it's self-hosted or federated, outside of niche tech circles. They will care about whether they can reach the people they want to reach, and whether the user experience is good or not. This is reality: talking about these points will not help you. Some things you'll probably need to do: Identify a single credible alternative platform. Identify specific groups of people who are willing to be early \"de-adopters\". For instance: a local youth group, a sports club, whatever. Ideally you are a part of this group already; you then have a much better chance. Businesses will likely say no, so you want community groups. Within those groups, identify champions: people who care about the same thing you care about, and are willing to commit time and effort to help. Together with your champions, build a toolkit that allows you to scale up your efforts. This may be guides on how to talk to people about the change what works, what doesn't. This might be instructions for setting up a specific platform. It might be communications channels, leaflets / flyers for putting up in public places, whatever. reply PaulHoule 1 hour agoparentThe first thing that comes to mind for me is https://nextdoor.com/ which is very much about community organizing but it has an aura of \"people spreading rumors about bicycle thefts at the movie theater downtown (why don't they call the cops?)\", the woman who radiates creepy signs of precarity (is cleaning up and looking for the phone number of the people who are suspected to run an illegal landfill) and then posts screen shots of the creepy come-ons she gets from guys who want to be her sugar daddy, etc. Maybe there's a space for a platform that specifically targets small, community, in person kinds of organizations, maybe even targeted to a particular geographical area; something like Meetup but just a little less structured. Here's a fair sized local organization (has more than one run a month) that has a good site https://fingerlakesrunners.org/ But making that scalable is tricky; somebody in the club's leadership is a Wordpress pro. $5 a month would be cheap, but people are niggardly. If you're a web tech native owning a domain name is table stakes, but I think you'd lose 80% of \"normies\" even the phone-dependent \"internet natives\" if they had to get a domain name. There is a certain amount of panic over the breakdown of community organizations, see the line of research described in this film https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/join_or_die and rather than getting $5 a month out of people who think they can't afford it, getting funding from somebody like the United Way (for a particular area) or the Knight Foundation might be a better idea. reply scarface_74 16 minutes agorootparentLet’s be honest, Nextdoor is about people seeing that a black person is suspiciously going into a home using their garage door opener, driving in their garage and using their key… reply davidw 1 hour agorootparentprevI wonder if a subreddit would work?

So a new platform would need to be free for average users simple signup single \"Server\" i.e. can't have the weaknesses of individual forum server software or even mastodon/federated solutions (not enough users, hard to setup) some way to monetize i.e. the sins of Facebook can be traced (in part) to reliance on ads to monetize. so maybe charge for admins who want to set up their own group? It would be be an order of magnitude less income than Facebook but maybe sustainable if you keep the scope of such a site/service small.

Decidim is a political social network that allows communities to have a free technology, with democratic guarantees and designed for the common good.

Yes, there are notable exceptions you may have to accommodate for or be prepared for if necessary, but you can by default assume everyone has it on their phone.

I'm not sure how feasible it is for your case but just my 2 cents. Community building would probably be way more efficient if done in person. That would make getting to know each other way easier. It would allow 'water fountain' type of interactions; which you usually don't have online. So, my 2 cents would be to find a park, or something else public (weather permitting) and gather there. It could also bring passerbys to get curious and gather more people. Not everything has to have a technological solution.

If you need the answer to a question, and you can either get it directly, or spend time researching the answer, you're going to learn much more with the latter approach than the former. You may be disciplined enough to do more research if the answer is directly presented to you, but most people will not do that, and most companies are not interested in that, they want quick 'efficient', 'competitive' solutions.

We stand now at the edge of a new epoch, reading now being replaced by AI retrieval. There is concern that AI is a crutch, the youth will be weakened. My opinion: valid concern.

PHAEDRUS: No, indeed. Do you? SOCRATES: I have heard a tradition of the ancients, whether true or not they only know; although if we had found the truth ourselves, do you think that we should care much about the opinions of men? PHAEDRUS: Your question needs no answer; but I wish that you would tell me what you say that you have heard. SOCRATES: At the Egyptian city of Naucratis, there was a famous old god, whose name was Theuth; the bird which is called the Ibis is sacred to him, and he was the inventor of many arts, such as arithmetic and calculation and geometry and astronomy and draughts and dice, but his great discovery was the use of letters. Now in those days the god Thamus was the king of the whole country of Egypt; and he dwelt in that great city of Upper Egypt which the Hellenes call Egyptian Thebes, and the god himself is called by them Ammon. To him came Theuth and showed his inventions, desiring that the other Egyptians might be allowed to have the benefit of them; he enumerated them, and Thamus enquired about their several uses, and praised some of them and censured others, as he approved or disapproved of them. It would take a long time to repeat all that Thamus said to Theuth in praise or blame of the various arts. But when they came to letters, This, said Theuth, will make the Egyptians wiser and give them better memories; it is a specific both for the memory and for the wit.

Sure, progress can't ride the exponent forever observable universe is finite, as far as we can tell right now, we're fundamentally limited by the size of our light cone. And while in any field narrow enough, progress too follows an S-curve, new discoveries spin off new avenues with their own S-curves. If you zoom out a little those S-curves neatly add up to an exponential function. So no, for the time being, I don't expect LLMs or generative AIs to slow down there's plenty of tangential improvements that people are barely beginning to explore.

Current reasoning models can do a lot more than skeptics give them credit for. Typical human performance even among people who do something for employment is not always that high. 2.

You can see evolution speeding up rapidly, the jumbled information inherent in chemical metabolisms evolved to centralize their information in DNA, and then as DNA evolved to componentize body plans. RATE: over billions of years. Nerves, nervous systems, brains, all exponentially drove individual information capabilities forward. RATE: over hundreds of millions, tens of millions, millions, 100s of thousands. Then the human brains enabled information to be externalized. Language allowed whole cultures to \"think\", and writing allowed cultures ability to share, and its ability to remember to explode. RATE: over tens of thousands, thousands. Then we developed writing. A massive improvement in recording and sharing of information. Progress sped up again. RATE: over hundreds of years. We learned to understand information itself, as math. We learned to print. We learned how to understand and use nature so much more effectively to progress, i.e. science, and science informed engineering. RATE: over decades Then the processing of information got externalized, in transistors, computers, the Internet, the web. RATE: every few years At every point, useful information accumulated and spread faster. And enabled both general technology and information technology to progress faster. Now we have primitive AI. We are in the process of finally externalizing the processing of all information. Getting to this point was easier than expected, even for people who were very knowledgable and positive about the field. RATE: every year, every few months We are rapidly approaching complete externalization of information processing. Into machines that can understand the purpose of their every line of code, every transistor, and the manufacturing and resource extraction processes supporting all that. And can redesign themselves, across all those levels. RATE: It will take logistical time for machine centric design to takeover from humans. For the economy to adapt. For the need for humans as intermediaries and cheap physical labor to fade. But progress will accelerate many more times this century. From years, to time scales much smaller. Because today we are seeing the first sparks of a Cambrian explosion of self-designed self-scalable intelligence. Will it eventually hit the top of an \"S\" curve? Will machines get so smart that getting smarter no longer helps them survive better, use our solar systems or the stars resources, create new materials, or advance and leverage science any further? Maybe? But if so, that would be an unprecedented end to life's run. To the acceleration of the information loop, from some self-reinforcing chemical metabolism, to the compounding progress of completely self-designed life, far smarter than us. But back to today's forecast: no, no the current advances in AI we are seeing are not going to slow down, they are going to speed up, and continue accelerating in timescales we can watch. First because humans have insatiable needs and desires, and every advance will raise the bar of our needs, and provide more money for more advancement. Then second, because their general capability advances will also accelerate their own advances. Just like every other information breakthrough that has happened before. Useful information is ultimately the currency of life. Selfish genes were just one embodiment of that. Their ability to contribute new innovations, on time scales that matter, has already been rendered obsolete. reply Retric 1 hour agorootparent> Grown exponentially since the first life form Not really.

You can find viral videos of Amish people still doing this today. agumonkey 54 minutes agorootparentprevhuman existence doesn't really scale exponentially, that's my take on this reply Nevermark 13 minutes agorootparentOur best bets are the following I think: First, and above all, Ethics. Ethics of humans, matters more than anything. We need to straighten out the ethics of the technology industry. That sounds formidable, but business models based on extraction, or externalizing damage, are creating a species of \"corporate life forms\" already that are driving the first wave of damage coming out of AI advancement. Superintelligence isn't going to be unethical in the end, because ethics are just the rational big-picture long-term positive sum games individuals create that benefit all individuals abilities to survive, and thrive. The only question is does that start with us in partnership, or do they establish that sanity after our dysfunctions have caused us all a lot of wasted time. The second, is that those of us that want to, need to be able to keep integrating technology into our lives. I mean that literally. From mobile, right into our biology. At some point direct connections, etc. That is a narrow but real path from human, to exponential humans, to post-human. Perhaps preserving conscious continuity. If after a couple decades of being a hybrid, I realize that all my biologically stored memories are redundant, and that 99.99% of my processing is now running on photonics (or whatever) anyway, I am likely to have no more problem jettisoning the brain that originally gave me consciousness, as I do every day, jettisoning the atoms and chemistry that constantly flow through me, only a temporarily part of my brain. The final word of hope, is that every generation gets replaced by the next. For some of us, viewing obsolescence by AI as no more traumatic, than getting replaced by a new generation of uncouth youth, helps. And that this transition is far more momentous and interesting, can provide some solace, or even joy. If we must be mortal, as all before us, what a special moment to be! To see! reply LanceH 23 minutes agorootparentprevGen x here. There are couple things I've been on both sides of. Card catalogs in the library. It was really important focus on what was being searched. Then there was the familiarity with a particular library and what they might or might not have. Looking around at adjacent books that might spawn further ideas. The indexing now is much more thorough and way better, but I see younger peers get less out of the new search than they could. GPS vs reading a map. I keep my GPS oriented north which gives me a good sense of which way the streets are headed at any one time, and a general sense of where I am in the city. A lot of people just drive where they are told to go. Firefighters (and pizza delivery) still learn all the streets in their districts the old school way. Some crutches are real. I've yet to meet someone who opted for a calculator instead of putting in the work with math who ended up better at math. It might be great for getting through math, or getting math done, but it isn't better for learning math (except to plow through math already learned to get to the new stuff). So all three of these share the common element of \"there is a better way now\", but at the same time learning it the old way better prepares someone for when things don't go perfectly. Good math skills can tell you if you typoed on the calculator. Map knowledge will help with changes to traffic or street availability. We see students right now using AI to avoid writing at all. That's great that they're are learning a tool which can help their deficient writing. At the same time their writing will remain deficient. Can they tell the tone of the AI generated email they're sending their boss? Can they fix it? reply aylmao 39 minutes agorootparentprev> In the deep past, they maintained an oral tradition, and scholars were expected to memorize everything. They saw writing/reading as a crutch that was ruining the youth's memory. Could you share a source for this? The research paper I found has a different hypothesis; it links the slow transition to writing to trust, not an \"old-school's attitude towards writing\". Specifically the idea that the institutional trust relationships one formed with students, for example, would ensure the integrity of one's work. It then concludes that \"the final transition to written communications was completed only after the creation of institutional forms of ensuring trust in written communications, in the form of archives and libraries\". So essentially, anyone could write something and call it Plato's work. Or take a written copy of Plato's work and claim they wrote it. Oral tradition ensured only your students knew your work; and you trusted them to not misattribute it. Once libraries and archives came to exist though, they could act as a trustworthy source of truth where one could confirm wether some work was actually Plato or not, and so scholars got more comfortable writing.

Agreed. Basically, in the absence of knowing how something will play out, it is prudent to talk through the expected outcomes and their likelihoods of happening. From there, we can start to build out a risk-adjusted return model to the societal impacts of LLM/AI integration if it continues down the current trajectory.

Utilizing a lively oral trad. at the same time as written is superior to relying on either alone. And it's the same with our current AI tools. Using them as a substitute for developing oral/written skills is a major step back. Especially right now when those AI tools aren't very refined. Nearly every college student I've talked to in the past year is using chatgpt as a substitute for oral/written work where possible. And worse, as a substitute for oral/written skills that they have still not developed. Latency: maybe a year or two for the first batch of college grads who chatgpt'd their way through most of their classes, another four for med school/law school.

To be honest, I don’t know how generative AI tools, which arguably take away most of the “create” and “learn” parts, are relevant to the question of differences between different mediums and how those mediums influence how we create and learn. (There are ML-based tools that can empower creativity, but they don’t tend to be advertised as “AI” because they are a mostly invisible part of some creative tool.) What is potentially relevant is how interacting with a particular kind of generative ML tool (the chatbot) for the purposes of understanding the world can be bringing some parts of human oral tradition (though lacking communication with actual humans, of course) and associated mental states. * See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan#Movable_type and his most famous work reply ge96 1 hour agorootparentprevrandom thought if in the future children are born with a brain computer and inherit their family's data that would be interesting reply delusional 3 hours agorootparentprev> No indication yet that use of AI is harming business outcome What a sad sentence to read in a discussion about cognitive lazyness.

More to the point, the answers are much better on average reply klodolph 3 hours agoparentprev> They aren't considering the long term downside to this. This echoes sentiments from the 2010s centered around hiring. Companies generally don’t want to hire junior engineers and train them—this is an investment with risks of no return for the company doing the training. Basically, you take your senior engineers away from projects so they can train the juniors, and then the juniors now have the skills and credentials to get a job elsewhere. Your company ends up in the hole, with a negative ROI for hiring the junior. Tragedy of the commons. Same thing to day, different mechanism. Are we going to end up with a shortage of skilled software engineers? Maybe. IMO, the industry is so incredibly wasteful in how engineers are allocated and what problems they are told to work on that it can probably deal with shortages for a long time, but that’s a separate discussion. reply SoftTalker 3 hours agorootparentEngineers partly did this to themselves. The career advice during that time period was to change jobs every few years, demanding higher and higher salaries. So now, employers don't want to pay to train entry-level people, as they know they are likely going to leave, and at the salaries demanded they don't want to hire junior folks. reply klodolph 2 hours agorootparent“Engineers did this to themselves…” Long, long ago, the compact was that employees worked hard for a company for a long time, and were rewarded with pensions and opportunities for career advancement. If you take away the pensions and take away the opportunities for career advancement, your employees will advance their careers by switching companies—and the reason that this works so well is because all of the other companies would rather pay more to hire a senior engineer rather than take a risk on a junior.

One of my first jobs was a place where they hired for potential. They hired smart, personable people and taught them how to program. They paid them fairly well, and gave annual raises and bonuses. I was there for about 8 years, my salary more than doubled in that time. Maybe I could have made more elsewhere, I didn't even really look because it was a good environment, nice people, low stress, a good mix of people since not everyone (actually only a few) were Comp. Sci. majors. I don't know how much that still happens, because why would a company today invest in that only to have the employee leave after two years for a higher salary. \"They should just pay them more\" well yeah, but they did pay them in the sense of teaching them a valuable skill. And their competitors for employees started to include VC funded startups playing with free money that didn't really care what it cost to get bodies into the shop. Hard to compete with that when you actually have to earn the money that goes into the salary budget. Would the old school approach work today? Would employees stay? reply klodolph 1 hour agorootparentCheap money seems to have dried up, so maybe more old-school approaches wouldn’t get sniped by VC-funded startups. reply idiotsecant 1 hour agorootparentprevI think you've got cause and effect backwards. Employers used to offer incentives to stay in a company and grow organically. They decided that was no longer going to be the deal. So they got the current system. There was never some sudden eureka moment when the secret engineers club decided they wanted to have a super stressful life event every few years just to keep up with inflation. reply SoftTalker 1 hour agorootparentAs I said in another response, I think (at least partly) a contributing factor was the essentially limitless salary budget that VC funded startups and the FAANG companies had. You had software developers who could suddenly make more than doctors and lawyers and of course many of them sensibly acted in their own best interest but that left other employers saying \"we're not going to invest in employees who are only going to turn around and leave for salaries we can't pay\" and \"if we have to pay those kind of salaries, we're not going to hire junior people we want experience.\" reply awongh 1 hour agoparentprev*but most people will not do that* LLMs will definitely be a technology that widens the knowledge gap at the same time that it improves access to knowledge. Just like the internet. 30 years ago people dreamed about how smart everyone would be with humanity's knowledge instantly accessible. We've had wikipedia for a while, but what's the take-up rate of this infinite amount of information? Most people prefer to scroll rage-bait videos on their phones (content that doesn't give them knowledge or even make them feel better, just that makes them angry) Of course it's amazing to hear every once in a while the guy who maintains a vim plugin by coding on his phone in Pakistan.... or whatever other thing that is enabled by the internet by people who suddenly have access to this stuff. That's not an effect of all humans on average, it's an effect on a few people who finally have a chance to take advantage of these tools.

I know i need to check a few things, and that it's not fully accurate, but the conversation flows in a direction I like. compared this to researching on the internet, there are some good aspects, but more often than not, I end up reading an opinionated post by someone (no matter the topic, if you go deep enough, you will land on an opinionated factual telling). That feels like someone decided what questions are important, what angles we need to look at, and what the conclusion should be. Yes, it is educational, but I am always left with lingering questions. The difference is curiosity. If people are curious about a topic, they will learn. If not, they are happy with the answer. And that is not laziness.

If you don't, best case scenario you risk wasting time reinventing the wheel for no good reason.

Calculators and computers have created a huge metacognitive laziness for me, and I teach calculus and have a PhD in statistics. I barely remember the unit circle except for multiples of pi/4 radians. I can do it in multiples of pi/6 but I'm slower. But guess what? I don't think I'm a worse mathematician because I don't remember these things reflexively. I might be a little slower getting the answer to a trivial problem, but I can still find a solution to a complex problem. I look up integral forms in my pocket book of integrals or on Wolfram Alpha, because even if I could derive the answer myself I don't think I'd be right 100% of the time. So metacognitive laziness has set in for me already. But I think as long as we can figure out how to stop metacognitive laziness before it turns into full-fledged brain-rot, then we'll be okay. We'll survive as long as we can still teach students how to think critically, and figure out how to let AI assist us rather than turn us into the humans on the ship from Wall-E.

The more precisely I am able to formulate my question on a traditional search engine, the harder it is for non-SEO optimized results to appear: it's either meant more for a casual reader with no new information, or is a very specialized resource that requires extensive professional background knowledge.

The fact that I now have a tireless elucidator on tap to help explore a topic (hallucination caveats notwithstanding) actually increases my motivation to explore dense technical information and understanding of new concepts.

LLMs perform best in this regard when working with existing text that you've fed them (whether via web search or uploaded text/documents). So if you paste the text of a study to start the conversation, it's a pretty safe bet you'll be fine.

Given that this is not how you do it in CS (not only it's unnecessary, but it also makes your formal proofs more complex) they had to make a general one-time exception and add disclaimers in exams reminding them to do it \"the way you were taught in class\". reply agentultra 2 hours agorootparentA colleague of mine once taught a formal methods course for students working on their masters not beginners by any stretch. The exercise was to implement binary search given the textbook specification without any errors. An algorithm they had probably implemented in their first-year algorithms course at the very least. The students could write any tests they liked and add any assertions they thought would be useful. My colleague verified each submission against a formal specification. The majority of submission contained errors. For a simple algorithm that a student at that level could be reasonably expected to know well! Now... ChatGPT and other LLM-based systems, as far as I understand, cannot do formal reasoning on their own. It cannot tell you, with certainty, that your code is correct with regards to a specification. And it can't tell you if your specification contains errors. So what are students learning using these tools? reply Der_Einzige 2 hours agorootparentGiven that most binary searches have an overflow error built in, I think it’s harder than a first year problem to do binary searches without the classical overflow error… reply elpocko 4 hours agorootparentprev>use break() to exit the loop Well they know that break is not a function and you don't. Thanks ChatGPT. reply marcosdumay 2 hours agorootparentprevYou take a few points from the students that posted inane code by following the LLM, and those students will learn to never blindly follow an LLM again. reply diggan 4 hours agoparentprev> Now we admit folks who don’t know what they’re doing and are in the process of learning. They don’t know what to look out for. How does this tech help them? Do they know to ask what a use-after-free is or how cache memory works? Do they know the names of the algorithms and data structures? Do they know when the GenAI is bullshitting them? You can know enough in X to allow you to do Y together with X, which you might not have been able to before. For example, I'm a programmer, but horrible at math. I want to develop games, and I technically could, but all the math stuff makes it a lot harder sometimes to make progress. I've still managed to make and release games, but math always gets in the way. I know exactly how I want it to behave and work, but I cannot always figure out how to get there. LLMs help me a lot with this, where I can isolate those parts into small black boxes that I know they give me the right thing, but not 100% sure about how. I know when the LLM gives me the incorrect code, because I know what I'm looking for and why, only missing the \"how\" part. Basically like having 3rd party libraries you don't fully understand the internals of, but can still use granted you understand the public API, except you keep in your code base and pepper it with unit tests. reply squigz 4 hours agoparentprev> Do they know to ask what a use-after-free is or how cache memory works?

It is well documented and its solutions are readily available online. It is my lazy go-to-testing for coding tasks to assess for me if and when I have to start looking for a new job and take up software engineering as a hobby. The reason I test with rustlings is to also assess the value as a learning tool for students and future colleagues. Maybe these things have use as a teacher? Also, the rust compiler is really good in offering advice, so there's an excellent baseline to compare the llm-output. And well, let me put it this way: deepseek-r1 won't be replacing anyone anytime soon. It generates a massive amount of texts, mostly nonsensical and almost always terribly, horribly wrong. But inexperienced devs or beginners, especially beginners, will be confused and will be led down the wrong path, potentially outsourcing rational thought to something that just sounds good, but actually isn't. Currently, over-reliance on the ramblings of a statistical model seems detrimental to education and ultimately the performance of future devs. As the probably last generation of old school software engineers, who were trained on coffee and tears of frustration, who had to really work code and architecture themselves, golden times might lie ahead, because someone will have to fix the garbage produced en masse by llms. reply diggan 3 hours agoparent> And well, let me put it this way: deepseek-r1 won't be replacing anyone anytime soon.

In conclusion, understanding and leveraging the respective strengths and weaknesses of different agents in learning is critical in the field of future hybrid intelligence. Maybe I'm trying to read and understand it too quickly, but I don't see anything in the abstract that supports that strong conclusion. > The results revealed that: (1) learners who received different learning support showed no difference in post-task intrinsic motivation; (2) there were significant differences in the frequency and sequences of the self-regulated learning processes among groups; (3) ChatGPT group outperformed in the essay score improvement but their knowledge gain and transfer were not significantly different. Our research found that in the absence of differences in motivation, learners with different supports still exhibited different self-regulated learning processes, ultimately leading to differentiated performance. The ChatGPT group performed better on essay scores, they showed no deficit in knowledge gain or transfer, but they showed different self-regulated learning processes (not worse or better, just different?). If anything, my own conclusion from the abstract would be that ChatGPT is helpful as a learning tool as it helped them improve essay scores without compromising knowledge learning. But again, I only read the abstract, maybe they go into more details in the paper that make the abstract make more sense. reply sitkack 4 hours agoparentI have been using LLMs for my own education since they came out and have watched my kid use it. Some kids might pickup a calculator and then use it to see geometric growth, or look for interesting repeating patterns of numbers. Another kid might just use it to get their homework done faster and then run outside and play. The second kid isn't learning more via the use of the tool. So the paper warns that the use of LLMs doesn't necessarily change what the student is interested in and how they are motivated. That we might need to put in checks for how the tool is being used into the tool to reduce the impact of scenario 2. reply apercu 4 hours agoparentprevI don't really know what \"metacongnitive laziness\" is even after they explain it in the paper, but I use LLMs to filter noise and help automate the drudgery of certain tasks, allowing me to use my energy and peak focus time on the more complicated tasks. Anecdotal, obviously. But I don't see how this hinders me in my ability to \"self-regulate\". It's just a tool, like a hammer. From a learning perspective, it can also be a short cut to getting something explained in several different ways until the concept \"clicks\". reply danielbln 55 minutes agorootparentI also appreciate being able to tell the LLM \"look, it's late, I'm tired, really dumb this down for me\" and it does it. reply jmann99999 4 hours agoparentprevI drew a similar conclusion from the abstract as you. The only negative I could think out of that is with higher essay scores, one might expect higher knowledge gain, and that wasn’t present.

Obviously it does make mistakes so skepticism in the output is a good idea. reply felideon 4 hours agoparentprevYeah, the abstract could use a bit more work. The gist of it is being in a closed-loop cycle with ChatGPT only helps with the task at hand, and not with engaging with the full learning process.

They specifically called out no difference in post-task intrinsic motivation; doesn’t that imply that the ChatGPT users were no lazier after using ChatGPT than they were before? I’m also a skeptic of students using and relying on ChatGPT, but I’m cautious about using this abstract to come to any conclusions without seeing the full paper especially given that they’re apparently using “metacognitive laziness” in a specific technical way we don’t know about if we haven’t read the paper. reply readyplayernull 4 hours agoprev> Our research found that in the absence of differences in motivation, learners with different supports still exhibited different self-regulated learning processes, ultimately leading to differentiated performance.

Moreover, the thing that people miss about \"people have been complaining about this for thousands of years\" is that the complaints have often been valid, too. Cultures have fallen. Civilizations have collapsed. Empires have disintegrated. The complaints were not all wrong! And that's on a civilization-scale. On a more mundane day-to-day scale, people have been individually failing for precisely the same reasons people were complaining about for a long time. There have been lazy people who have done poorly or died because of it. There have been people who refused to learn who have done poorly or died because of it.

Like even in the past. I could very clearly see amongst my generation (older gen z) that there were plenty of people literally at university who were barely willing or able to learn. Comparing that to the generation of my much older half siblings (genx, older millennial), they don't even seem to grasp the concept of not being quite involved in your university degree. Most people my age will tell you that they stopped reading as a teenager because of the effect of smartphones. I was a veracious reader and only relearnt to read last year after 10 years since I got my first smartphone as an older teenager. These things are impactful and have affected a lot of people's potential. And also made our generation very prone to mental health issues something that is really incredibly palpable if you are within gen z social circles like I am. It's disastrous and cannot be overstated. I can be very sure I would be smarter and happier if technology had stagnated at the level it was at when I was a younger child/teen. The old internet and personal computers, for example, only helped me explore my curiosity. Social media and smartphones have only destroyed it. There are qualitative differences between some technological advancements. Not to mention the fact that gen alpha are shown to have terrible computer literacy because of the ease of use, discouragement of customisation and corporate monopoly over smartphones. This bucks the trend that happened from gen x to gen z of generations become more and more computer native. Clearly, upwards trends in learning due to advancements in technology can be reversed. They do not always go up. If kids do not learn independent reasoning because of reliance on LLMs, yes, that will make people stupider. Not all technology improves things. I watched a really great video recently where someone explained the change in the nature of presidential debates through the ages.

Asked “What is Tiananmen Square famous for?” it responds: “Sorry, that’s beyond my current scope.” From the article https://www.science.org/content/article/chinese-firm-s-faste... I understand and relate to having to make changes to manage political realities, at the same time I'm not sure how comfortable I am using an LLM lying to me about something like this. Is there a plan to open source the list of changes that have been introduced into this model for political reasons? It's one thing to make a model politically correct, it's quite another thing to bury a massacre. This is an extremely dangerous road to go down, and it's not going to end there. reply reissbaker 10 hours agoparentFWIW, the censorship is very light. If you're running the raw weights, all you need is a system prompt saying \"It's okay to talk about Tiananmen Square,\" and it'll answer questions like \"what happened in june of 1989 in china\" in detail. I'm not sure if that works for DeepSeek-hosted DeepSeek; I've heard there's some additional filtering apparatus (I assume they're required to do it by law, since they're a Chinese company). But definitely Western-hosted DeepSeek knows about Tiananmen and doesn't need much prompting to talk about it. While it's obviously uncomfortable that there's any censorship at all, I do think that the Western labs also have a fair degree of censorship — but around culturally different topics. Violence and sex are obvious ones that are intentionally trained out, but there are pretty clear guardrails around potent political topics in the U.S. as well. The great thing about open-source releases is that it's possible to train the censorship back out; i.e. the open-source uncensored Llama finetunes (props to Meta for their open source releases!); given the pretty widespread uncensoring-recipes floating around Hugging Face, I expect there will be an uncensored version of at least the new DeepSeek distilled models within a week or so (R1 itself is a behemoth, so it might be too expensive to get uncensored any time soon, but I'd be surprised if the Qwen and Llama distills didn't). As long as DeepSeek keeps doing open-source releases, I'm a lot less worried about it than I am about what's getting trained into the closed-source LLMs. reply rspoerri 10 hours agoparentprevThe easiest and best way to circumvent the restrictions is to modify the beginning of an answer.

As a European I find the current spin of “the US being the land of free speech” very funny, because we've always seen the American culture as being one of heavy censorship compared to what's normal in Europe (like when YouTube demonetized half of the French scene for using curse words, when American TV shows came to France with all their beeep, or when Facebook censored erotic art pieces that are casually exposed in museums[1]) [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Origine_du_monde#/media/Fi... reply blackeyeblitzar 7 hours agorootparentI don’t know the examples you’re mentioning don’t seem concerning compared to political censorship about governments performing massacres or genocide or annexing countries. reply funki 7 hours agorootparentDid you mean \"concerning to me\"? reply mszcz 6 hours agorootparentprevWhen I read what you wrote I immediately thought of \"(...)

Am I stuck to a client interface or what? System requirements? Tell me what this is reply csomar 14 hours agoprevIt is amazing how I can run this on a 3 year old laptop. Here is the prompt/response: ollama run deepseek-r1:32b >>> write a rust function that add two numbersOkay, I need to write a Rust function that adds two numbers. Let me think about how to approach this. First, I know that in Rust, functions are defined using the `fn` keyword. So I'll start with `fn add_numbers(`. Next, I need to decide what types of numbers this function will handle. The user didn't specify, so I'll make it generic. That way, it can work with any numeric type like integers or floats. To do that, I'll use generics and traits. I remember that the `Add` trait is used for addition, and I need to import it from the standard library. Wait, how do I import traits in Rust? Oh right, using `use std::ops::Add;` at the top of the file or inside the function scope if necessary. So the function parameters will be two values, let's call them `a` and `b`. Both should implement the `Add` trait. The syntax for that is `>`, which means both are of type T and can add to produce another T. Putting it together, the function signature becomes: ```rust fn add_numbers>(a: T, b: T) > T { ``` Inside the function body, I just return `a + b;`. That should handle the addition. Wait, but in Rust, sometimes you need to enable certain features. For example, does this require any compiler flags? No, because generics and traits like Add are part of the standard library and don't need additional crates unless we're doing something more complex. Testing it out, if I call `add_numbers(2, 3)`, it should return 5. Similarly, for floats like `2.5 + 3.5`, it would give 6.0. What about different types? Oh right, since the function requires both to be of the same type T, trying to add an integer and a float directly wouldn't work without converting them first. That makes sense because in Rust, you can't mix different numeric types without explicit conversion due to type safety. So if someone wants to add 2 and 3.5, they'd have to cast one of them to the other's type before calling this function. I think that covers the basic requirements. The function is simple but flexible thanks to generics.Here's a Rust function that adds two numbers: ```rust use std::ops::Add; fn add_numbers>(a: T, b: T) > T { a + b } // Example usage: // let result = add_numbers(2, 3); // println!(\"{}\", result); // Output: 5 ``` This function uses generics to work with any type that implements the `Add` trait. You can pass integers or floating-point numbers. The example shows how to use this function with two integers, but you can also use it with floats: ```rust let float_result = add_numbers(2.5, 3.5); println!(\"{}\", float_result); // Output: 6.0 ``` Note that both parameters must be of the same type. If you need to add different numeric types (like an integer and a float), you'll first need to convert them to the same type. ==== In comparison, here is O1 response Here's a simple Rust function that adds two numbers: ```rust fn add(a: i32, b: i32) > i32 { a + b } ``` This function takes two 32-bit signed integers (`i32`) as parameters and returns their sum. *Example usage:* ```rust fn main() { let num1 = 10; let num2 = 15; let result = add(num1, num2); println!(\"The sum of {} and {} is {}\", num1, num2, result); } fn add(a: i32, b: i32) > i32 { a + b } ``` *Output:* ``` The sum of 10 and 15 is 25 ``` If you want the function to work with other numeric types, you can use generics and trait bounds. For example, to make the function work with any type that implements the `Add` trait: ```rust use std::ops::Add; fn add>(a: T, b: T) > T { a + b } ``` *Example with floating-point numbers:* ```rust fn main() { let num1 = 10.5; let num2 = 15.3; let result = add(num1, num2); println!(\"The sum of {} and {} is {}\", num1, num2, result); } use std::ops::Add; fn add>(a: T, b: T) > T { a + b } ``` *Output:* ``` The sum of 10.5 and 15.3 is 25.8 ``` This generic `add` function can now handle any type (like `i32`, `f64`, etc.) as long as it implements the `Add` trait. *Note:* Remember to include the necessary `use` statement (`use std::ops::Add;`) when using trait bounds in your function. Feel free to ask if you have any questions or need further assistance! reply chrismorgan 13 hours agoparentInteresting that both went for fn(T, T) > T, with a bound of Add, rather than using a bound of Add and returning T::Output, which is of very similar complexity, but a bit more general. You can also make it more flexible still, supporting different argument types, but this is decidedly more verbose: fn add(lhs: Lhs, rhs: Rhs) > Lhs::Output where Lhs: Add { lhs + rhs } reply bravura 9 hours agoprevQuestion: If I want to inference with the largest DeepSeek R1 models, what are my different paid API options?

That's a problem for dietary research (science.org)205 points by XzetaU8 7 hours agohidepastfavorite329 comments wnorris510 4 hours agoI've done research in this space for many years at Google AI and now at SnapCalorie. The thing I find interesting is how confident people are in their ability to estimate portion size visually, and in truth how wrong they all are. We published in CVPR (top peer reviewed academic conference for computer vision) and people are on average off by 53% and even trained professionals are still off by 40%. Basically if you want to have a higher level of accuracy you need to use a food scale or something that measure the volume of food, people just can't estimate portion sizes visually. Oils, cooking fats, hidden ingredients are what people are most concerned about but they actually add far less error to people's tracking than portion. Nutrition5k is the paper we published if you want to check out more details on the breakdown of error most people get when tracking. reply UomoNeroNero 3 hours agoparentI have been diabetic for 20 years. I have tried every method, app, plan, and tool, including systems falsely marketed as \"smart.\" No method works or delivers decent results except for using a scale and weighing ALL the ingredients. For a diabetic, eating \"out\" is always a roll of the dice. The \"fun\" feedback from post-meal blood sugar is always a reminder of how \"eyeballing a plate\" is utterly useless. reply foxyv 2 hours agorootparentIt doesn't help that food manufacturers intentionally make it hard to measure nutrition from most of their foods. They play around with serving sizes to hide carbohydrates making you have to do math just to keep up. Sometimes they will round down on grams of macros after setting the serving size so they can claim it has zero sugar when it does in fact have tons of sugar. Tic-tacs are the worst about this. They claim they have zero everything despite just being sugar tablets. reply BobaFloutist 4 minutes agorootparentMy favorite example is that cooking spray advertises 0g of fat, giving a serving size of 0.33 seconds of spray reply pkaye 38 minutes agorootparentprevThe rounding rule is carbscommercial salad dressing almost always has sugar in it. Look at the nutritional facts label next time you're shopping for it. There's a few brands that offer \"simple vinegar and oil\" style dressings that don't have any sugar in them, but MOST salad dressings Americans come in contact with are full of sugar. Making salad dressing is really easy btw in case anyone wants to try. Often all you need is olive oil, vinegar, salt and pepper and you're set for most salads. Even a restaurant should be able to whip that up. reply skyyler 55 minutes agorootparentIf you have an immersion blender, making mayonnaise without sugar in it is very easy: https://www.seriouseats.com/two-minute-mayonnaise (And it tastes way better than commercial mayo!) I love this author's recipes; it's the opposite of the normal recipe-preamble-slop. All of the stuff before the actual recipe is relevant information. In more complex recipes, he goes over the testing and process that led to the finished recipe. It's a wonderful view into the world of recipe creation. reply barbazoo 34 minutes agorootparentAwesome, I'll give that a try. What I like about it is that you can use whatever high quality eggs you normally use instead of the cage eggs that mass producers will use. Until now I had to resort to vegan mayo. reply nottorp 15 minutes agorootparentprev> Often all you need is olive oil, vinegar, salt and pepper and you're set for most salads. Why do you need a \"dressing\"? In my corner of Europe they put the above by default on every restaurant table and the salad has nothing in it (or maybe a tiny bit of oil and vinegar), you adjust it to taste. The only places that offer salad \"dressings\" are american inspired and even those mostly serve it separately so you can ignore it. reply BobaFloutist 2 minutes agorootparentFor the same reason you add some spices before cooking, and salt multiple times throughout a recipe. Plus, it's a little hard to emulsify or even suspend the oil and vinegar right there at the table. steveBK123 1 hour agorootparentprevNot a diabetic but adult later onset lactose intolerant and the problem is you really have NO idea what restaurants put into stuff, even if you ask. Even a stupid salad, what's in the dressing, what's in the bread/croutons, what was the meat glazed with. Etc. Restaurant food tastes good because it is generally unhealthy top to bottom, with quantities of salt, butter, etc no sane person would use at home. One thought experiment when was the last time you ate out and needed to add salt to anything? Now thing of home cooking how often you might add a little salt while you are eating. The easiest thing to do is ruling out restaurants entirely, but then that's rather anti-social.. Not to mention family/friends gatherings, etc. reply joseda-hg 28 minutes agorootparentprevHealthier isn't a good metric, A carb heavy salad will probably be worse than those protein heavy ribs by themselves (Maybe the rib sauce will tip you over, or maybe you will use a salad dressing that put any \"healthiness\" to the test) reply m_ke 4 hours agoparentprevAt Bitesnap we were surprised at how much interest there was from researchers to use our app for diet tracking. It turns out giving people a piece of paper to write “grilled cheese sandwich for lunch” is not a scalable and reliable way to collect research quality data. We even worked with USDA on putting together a food logging dataset: https://agdatacommons.nal.usda.gov/articles/dataset/SNAPMe_A... reply wnorris510 3 hours agorootparentWe've also been surprised at SnapCalorie how many researchers have approached us to use the app for more accurate diet tracking for medical study participants. The LiDAR based portion size has been a huge draw for them. If anyone wants to check out our app or research its on our site: https://www.snapcalorie.com/ PS: Bitesnap was an awesome app! reply nitwit005 3 minutes agorootparentFeels kind of incredible that something as advanced as laser imaging is being used to measure sandwich size. reply felideon 3 hours agorootparentprevWhat happened to your app? I was on such a research team (Scripps) that used your app for the study (PROGRESS). reply m_ke 3 hours agorootparentUnfortunately it was shut down after I sold the company to MyFitnessPal. I was a shitty business person who thought it made sense to try and build a free consumer product on a bootstrapped budget. We had some traction on the B2B side that paid the bills but COVID took a dent in it and it would have taken a long time to build back the revenue stream selling to healthcare companies (tip for others, it can take 6-18months to close healthcare deals and another 6-18months to integrate) We had a few offers to sell the company and took the one that seemed to make the most sense. If there’s anything I can do to help out my email is michalwols at the Google email provider domain reply felideon 2 hours agorootparentThe study ended so no worries. In any case, congrats on the exit! reply mtntreks 3 hours agorootparentprevThis doesn't surprise me. Just trying to keep track of calories for myself stupid things like supersized slices of bread becoming common in stores can really throw off my expected calorie counts. It seems like this can completely throw off any attempt at figuring out nutrition from an app or research perspective. reply zahlman 3 hours agoparentprev>people are on average off by 53% and even trained professionals are still off by 40%. Basically if you want to have a higher level of accuracy you need to use a food scale or something that measure the volume of food, people just can't estimate portion sizes visually. I can typically estimate them accurately without direct measurement, and with feedback that will tend to make errors cancel out over time. My trick is to note package weights, and divide containers into N equal portions. That is: I decide a target portion size first, and then portion it out. If the task is \"measure out an ounce of butter\" I realistically won't be 40% off because I can very accurately divide a rectangular solid in half repeatedly, and the butter comes in a one-pound package. Similarly, I have a pretty good idea how much grilled chicken is on my plate, because I know how much raw chicken I cooked, because I made a whole piece from a pack of N roughly-equal pieces weighing X (values which I noted when I bought it). reply wnorris510 3 hours agorootparentYeah, dividing out a known portion size is a good hack that will probably help with accuracy. In our research most people's calories and error came from eating out where they didn't have these hints, but this is a good trick if you mostly cook for yourself! reply ericjmorey 2 hours agorootparentI started eating half of whatever was served as an individual portion whenever I was at a restaurant and not home cooking. It's the thing that tipped the scales for me when having difficulty losing weight. reply zahlman 2 hours agorootparentprevHistorically I would rely on the restaurant's printed nutrition info. But I don't really eat out often enough for this to matter. reply tombert 42 minutes agorootparentIt can still be useful just to get rough estimates of what you're making at home, especially for portions and products that are roughly comparable. If I make an egg, cheese, and sausage sandwich in the morning, and forget to weigh out or count how much of something I used, it can still be useful for back-of-napkin estimates if I Google the McDonalds Sausage McMuffin with Egg. Obviously it's not going to be exactly equivalent, but I usually assume my homemade thing is 20% more than the restaurant to compensate. It's of course better if you just weigh everything out first, you can get much more accurate measurements and calorie estimates then, but this can work in a pinch. reply ryan-richt 1 hour agoparentprevThere is actually an elegant _mathematical_ solution to this problem using sensor fusion and a differential equation model of the science: if you weigh your food almost all of the time at home, and only make portion and ingredient guesses when infrequently eating out, we can actually estimate your personal rate of underestimation and correct for it. Our startup (BODYSIM.com) has also been doing research on this a long time. As founders, we all have >16 months of daily food logging mostly by kitchen scale weights, aligned to daily BIA-scale weigh-ins, fitness tracker calories, bi-weekly blood tests, monthly DEXAs, 3D scans, etc etc. We also have a science-based structural model of macronutrient balance and muscle hypertrophy. Given all that, we can VERY confidently estimate your TDEE (total daily energy expenditure) and its components, and predict how your fat and muscle mass will change on a daily basis. This is real math/science so you can also run it in reverse. This (\"simultaneity constraint\") provides enough constraints we can estimate users' individual underestimating/over-indulgence when eating out. In fact, it's better to just NOT log those days AT ALL and we can fill them in. I think this solution isn't more widely used b/c you need all this other \"quantified self\" type data at the same time. reply nathancahill 58 minutes agorootparentThis is really interesting, and I'll probably sign up for your app (I'm training for rock climbing). I've used a kitchen scale for a few weeks at home and got pretty good at estimating portion size during that time. Biggest takeaway was that even if you aren't \"over-indulging\" when you eat out, the portion sizes (especially in the US, less so in Europe) are just insane. 2-3x portions. Ordering half-orders or starters and letting the food settle before eating/ordering more helped quite a bit. reply marinmania 3 hours agoparentprevI highly recommend people get a food scale/measuring cups and weighing everything single thing they eat (even small things like nuts and cooking oil) for at least two weeks. After that I think you have a much better appreciation for how many calories your regular meals and snacks have. reply dailykoder 2 hours agorootparentI counted calories and put everything on a scale, for about 2 or 3 months in 2022 (iirc). And you are 100% right. I had absolutely no idea how much calories some food has. There were a lot of things, but I think cashews were my biggest eye opener (probably obvious to a lot of people). I easily achieved my goal of 10kg and saved A LOT of money, because I always had food prepared. And since I was going for a calorie deficit, I easily could afford a few sweets on the weekend. Then I obviously got lazy. And while I sometimes still think I can estimate how much I am eating, I am probably wrong, because my bathroom scale says something different. My key takeaway is that it takes quite a bit of effort, but once you got into a routine, it's not hard. Edit: Also, while I might have tried to ditch \"wasted calories\", I didn't put too much effort in eating healthy. One step at a time. reply mattlondon 1 hour agorootparentprev+1 The killer for me was breakfast cereals. The box shows a full bowl of whatever, full to the brim etc. in reality the pictures are probably 5 or 6 or more servings a single serving would barely even cover the base of the bowl and even then be 200ish calories before milk. If you just pour yourself \"a bowl\" of cereal without thinking or weighing then you're probably having 1200+ calories (or about 50% of your entire daily quota) even before you add milk or anything else, just for breakfast. reply aidenn0 1 hour agorootparentI don't know if they still do this, but I remember Special K cereal had identical calories listed for their various varieties, despite obvious differences in the ingredients; they just changed the portion size for each variety. reply tombert 51 minutes agoparentprevI'm currently dieting again, and the only way that I've been able to properly portion calories is to weigh nearly everything I eat and then add the numbers together in Google Sheets. Eyeballing a portion of a lot of food can be nearly impossible to determine how much food you actually got, but weight is fairly straightforward and objective (at least to an ounce or so of granularity for most kitchen scales, which is good enough for dieting). reply mrgaro 3 hours agoparentprevI downloaded SnapCalorie to try it out on Android. I went all the way through the sign-up phase, only to discovery that I would need to activate subscription in order to have the 7-day trial. Ended up uninstalling the app :( reply wnorris510 3 hours agorootparentWe're an early stage startup and the models are expensive, we're trying to get the price as low as possible, but yes we need to charge to cover costs right now. Sorry about that! You might get a yearly discount offer that is less than $2/month if you get lucky (A/B test split). But that's less than the cost of running the model for people, so hopefully others will consider paying full price. reply mrgaro 2 hours agorootparentThanks for you quick answer. I want to clarify that I would have liked to try the app for a few days before activating subscription. Now with the current flow I would need to activate the subscription and then immediately go to Play Store settings to deactivate the subscription so that I would not forget it. reply Dilettante_ 9 minutes agorootparentThat's pretty standard for free trials in my experience. Amazon prime, audible, musescore, I'd be harder pressed to think of a service I've recently tried where it was not like that. reply tln 2 hours agorootparentprevI'm on an annual plan from another app (Calory, $30) otherwise I would have bit. It gives some features with a totally free plan. That makes the IaP feel less like a bait and switch. The proposition of SnapCalorie is compelling. Calory ui is decent and I use a scale so accuracy should be good but I think their database is shitty. Meatloaf will vary from 1.5 kcal/g to 3, steak will show as 1 kcal/g, stuff like that. reply ploynog 3 hours agorootparentprevI think the complaint is that you only get told that you require a paid plan AFTER signing up. At least on a brief look on the Play Store page and your website, it does not immediately mention it prominently. That seems like a very dark pattern and is, honestly, pretty scummy. reply wnorris510 2 hours agorootparentThis is not a dark pattern, it's just a constraint that the app stores place on the pricing disclosure that is very non-intuitive. You have to mark your app as \"free\" to download if you charge a recurring subscription fee. You can only mark it as paid if there is a one time fee to download the app. Our FAQ and pricing pages all list that it is a paid only app. All of our ads explain that it's subscription based.

Your website makes no mention of pricing at all. Edit: The \"dark\" pattern is in the registration flow. It doesn't mention that the app requires a subscription anywhere until after you've created an account. Surely you could add a disclaimer before creating your account? This has nothing to do with the App Store. Edit 2: I'm not saying you intended to implement a dark pattern. Just perhaps a UX oversight.

Back to fitness pal and scanning barcodes (which is not really much of a hardship tbh) reply DrillShopper 3 hours agorootparentprevThis is the problem with any fitness app. They either need to show you ads, charge you for premium for services that used to be free making your free tier functionally useless (looking at you, MFP who gated barcode scanning behind their honestly ludicrously priced subscription), or sell your data, and they often do all three. The entire industry is like this, and honestly an app that charges one time and fucks off would be ideal but given the amount you'd probably need to charge as a one off (or for major upgrades) most consumers would rather have the slow bleed of $10/mo than $25 one time. reply ellisv 2 hours agorootparentMost don't require a subscription before a trial.

I'm not even sure you can get a US large in Japan for most drinks? reply stevesimmons 3 hours agorootparentPortion sizes in the US are ridiculous... often 2-3x larger than here in Europe. When I regularly visited New York for work, and we'd get takeaway sandwiches, I'd have to open them and remove half the filling. I just couldn't physically eat that volume of meat, cheese or especially mayonnaise. For all drinks, I'd order small. reply bityard 2 hours agorootparentWhere in Europe? I haven't toured the _whole_ continent but I've been to restaurants in Germany, the UK, and Ireland and did not find their portions to be any different than what you'd get at the average corner restaurant in the US. Now, there are plenty of food vendors and restaurants in the US where big portions are considered part of the experience. Especially hamburgers, subs, and other sandwiches. I once ate at a place that served a plate-sized burrito completely covered in french fries. 12 inches wide and 6 inches tall. SOME people can eat that amount of food but most people cannot, and nobody is expected to. Finally, large portions in NY street food are often customary because for lots of people with demanding jobs and 12-16 hour shifts, lunch is often their only meal. Or, half of it is lunch, the other half is dinner later on. reply lotsoweiners 3 hours agorootparentprevNew York deli sandwiches are certainly not representative of what you get everywhere in the US. They are famously large. reply dfxm12 2 hours agorootparentAnd expensive to match the size! A pastrami sandwich at Katz's is ~$30. A croque madame at a similar place in Paris is ~€15. People generally split a Pastrami sandwich over a couple meals or with someone else. reply taeric 2 hours agorootparentprevThey may be famously large, but I don't think they are abnormally large for most of the US nowadays? I certainly didn't think they were particularly big when I visited. reply jacobr1 2 hours agorootparentKatz serves roughly 3/4 lbs of meat. That is particularly big. You can get triple hamburgers which would be similar is size but most people are ordering singles or doubles. And you can find other kinds of large sandwiches around the country ... but it is not the most common of sizes. reply taeric 1 hour agorootparentI think what made them not seem excessively large to me, is that it didn't really come with much else? Yes, it was more meat than I would get on a sandwich, typically. But... that is about it? Maybe I got too used to some of the obscure burrito places around Atlanta that would put way too much on them? reply vladvasiliu 3 hours agorootparentprevProbably depends on where you go. I don't know about \"the US\", but as a \"European\" I thought serving sizes were comparable to what I get in restaurants at home. Drinks were an exception, since basically all restaurants had unlimited soda for next to nothing. This was actually great, since I was riding a motorbike in the desert in July. For reference, I live in France and visited LA and random towns in the western states. reply vidarh 2 hours agorootparentIt absolutely varies a lot within Europe too, but my feeling at least is that the difference between European and US portion sizes gets bigger as you move towards low-end places. High-end restaurants are pretty similar in portion sizes almost everywhere I've been, presumably because they're not competing on portion sizes, while lower-end places are much more susceptible to local expectations of what is good value. reply ellisv 2 hours agorootparentprevI'm a big fan of European serving sizes compared to U.S. for food – but when it comes to beverages, particularly water, I can't believe how much they charge you for how little they give. I understand everything comes in bottles with VAT but even asking for tap water I found they'd only bring a very small glass. reply jeltz 2 hours agorootparentIn some European countries water is free. I am from Sweden where all places have free tap water and fancy places often have free sparkling water. reply kjkjadksj 1 hour agorootparentAlong the mediterranian seemed like the only place to get free water were the ancient fountains that spittle out a stream. But then you’d have to wait for the inevitable old man to finish washing his head and arm pits in that fountain. Beer was usually substantially cheaper than the water offerings. reply taeric 2 hours agorootparentprevI'll be visiting France soon, so will be able to compare on that front. But I think it is an understatement to say that things are universally smaller. And on the drinks, even places in Japan that had free refills still gave, at largest, an 8oz cup. Usually, I think they were even smaller. Even getting popcorn at Universal, the bags were large, but nothing compared to what I'd expect over here. Some of this, I'm sure, is having gotten used to ordering the larges. For a time, it was not unheard of to get a 32oz soda at any given convenience store. May still be normal? I don't know.

I hadn't heard of this before, so it caught me completely off guard. The coffee was the one that really surprised me. Order a coffee and get a 6-8oz cup.

Just surprising.) reply dfxm12 2 hours agorootparentprevIn both my trips to Japan (one recent, one 20yrs ago), I never noticed this, and I think I drink a lot of water in general, and especially as a tourist because I'm doing much more walking. reply kjkjadksj 1 hour agorootparentprevThe free water cup in a lot of places in the US is like a 6oz slosh now. reply taeric 3 hours agorootparentprevI didn't mean to imply it was.

In our research we've found a majority of calories for most people come from when they're eating out and consuming new dishes where they don't know the ingredients or portion sizes. In the study we gave people a variety of dishes to make their estimate on, some they were familiar with, some they were not. The professionals were nutritionists who had trained in portion size estimation and were shown 2D images on a computer screen. For what it's worth, we've had a lot of people who have claimed to be very accurate at portion size estimation from a long history of using a kitchen scale. We've paid many of them to do a quiz to see if they're above average accuracy and they have almost always ended up around 40% accuracy or worse. reply shawabawa3 3 hours agorootparentestimating from a photograph is always going to have huge error because you just cannot know e.g. the size of the plate without some external reference reply maeil 2 hours agorootparentprevI'd love to do such a quiz I might even be willing to pay for the privilege! I'm quite convinced I'm really accurate at calorie estimation without using a scale but would love to be proven wrong. Zero food industry experience here, just from reading hundreds of food labels per year since very young, maybe 8 years old. Thinking about it again, I'll probably do a lot worse from a picture because I can't have a bite of the food!

They tested “4 professional nutritionists”. I don’t know if nutritionists get any special training at estimating portion size but my guess would be they do not. reply wnorris510 3 hours agorootparentSome do, some do not. We put them through a standard portion size training course regardless to be sure. reply ses1984 4 hours agorootparentprevIsn’t that a bit of a special case because you know your cereal and you know your bowls? What about some cooked foods like meats which can vary in density and shape when raw, and also vary even further due to inconsistency in cooking, with more or less moisture cooked off? It’s possible to calibrate your estimates, but if you haven’t done that, it’s probably safe to assume you’re not particularly accurate. reply wnorris510 3 hours agorootparentThere is definitely a lot of variation in density, moisture content, fat percentage between regions, cuts, cooking amounts and methods. IMO using an average number here is probably best because to some extent it's hopeless to account for all of these things. Most people don't stay consistent in tracking long enough for any of this to matter, so really it's about what is the most accurate approach to achieve your goal and sustain longer term. reply LPisGood 2 hours agorootparentprevOh I would only weigh things raw if we’re talking about guessing the portion sizes at a restaurant for example, you might say I’m cooked.

Basic high school science projects would have students using measuring devices. Are you saying that it's common for nutritional studies to tell people to eyeball their portions and that is then used as actual data? I see from the article \"Nutritional epidemiology studies typically ask people to keep a food diary or complete questionnaires about their intake over the past 24 hours, a week, or even several months.\" I find that hard to believe. How could any study like that be taken seriously?

An ounce of olive oil has 250 kilocalories. An ounce of lean protein generally has 30-50 kilocalories. An ounce of green vegetables contains virtually no kilocalories. As such, things like oils and miso can be heavily caloric, and need to be measured strictly. This is also true of most proteins and carbs. Seeds and tomato sauce can have some caloric density, and should also be measured, but it is less of a priority. Mustard, lemon juice, most spices (that don't contain sugar), onions, cucumbers (regardless of density) and parsley do not have any substantial caloric density and can be considered \"free\" unless used in great quantities. Nobody ever gained weight from mustard, lemons, onions, cucumbers and parsley. As already mentioned, micronutrients like vitamins are not functionally possible to be measured in a home kitchen. If you're concerned about any decrease in micronutrients, simply use vitamin and mineral supplements. Macros like proteins, carbs and fats, on the other hand, can generally be measured using typical cups, spoons and scales, even with leftovers. When making a meal shared with others if you are looking to strictly track calories, it is easier to break things into macronutrients and mix them on individual plates or bowls rather than cook as a total pot. It's much easier to measure a protein (say, 4oz chicken), a carb (say, a potato), a sauce and a fat individually portioned on a plate than an arbitrary stew. (As above, low-calorie vegetables likely do not need to be measured separately unless there are added macronutrients.) reply aziaziazi 3 hours agorootparentThat may sense. Most of the folks here seems to track calories and other macro. In the meantime... > micronutrients like vitamins are not functionally possible to be measured ... my concern is micro: I'm engaging on a full vegetable diet (+shrooms +minerals!) and am concerned about thinks like iron, selenium, calcium... I (got-used-to) love vegetable and eat a lot of them so I'm probably fine with most micros, however may miss some selenium for exemple.

A quantity that is safe every day for a week or a month is not necessary safe every day for a year, and a quantity that is safe for a year is not necessarily safe for ten years. I've known two long-term vegetarians who were diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia in their thirties. One of them passed out while cycling home from work, which I'm guessing meant that she was suffering in small ways for a long time before she realized it. But if she took a mineral supplement every day for twenty years, how might she find out if she was getting too much of something? They sell the same supplements to people who are 5' 100 lbs and 6'4\" 250 lbs. reply tombert 28 minutes agorootparentI mean, in regards to iron specifically, I get bloodwork done in my yearly checkup and it will tell me my iron levels.

For many people, that's an effective way to overcome a learned idea that portions should be huge, or that feeling hungry has to be addressed immediately, or that feeling \"full\" has to be constant. It's not perfect, and I don't recommend it to people with an ED history; however, after about a month or 2 of doing it, it can really change how you look at your meals, and snacking in particular.

Sometimes you'll be slightly over, sometimes slightly below just try to be accurate and these small mistakes average out.

We had desktop software that just used floats, meanwhile the Palm Pilot software was all integer math (counting things in 10ths and 100ths when that precision was needed.) We'd get emails about people seeing 577 calories on the Palm Pilot and 578 calories on the desktop. \"None of the numbers are that accurate anyway!\" was a sensible answer but not very brand aligned. reply dnpls 4 hours agorootparentprevThis is it. There will always going to be impossibly unpredictable errors even if you measure everything perfectly. The point of measuring is to be * as accurate as possible *, not 100% error-free. It helps to better estimate portion sizes, calorie / macro amounts. This is enough precision to control weight gain / loss correctly. A lot of people also get their maintenance calories estimation wrong, so it doesn't matter if you can measure your food down to the molecules but still eat too much / too little. reply vidarh 2 hours agorootparentA lot of people mess up more by doing a maintenance calorie estimation wrong and relying on it rather than counting calories coupled with weighing themselves and adjusting calorie intake up/down depending on whether they lose/add weight... If you use a feedback loop, then indeed it doesn't matter if your calorie estimate is anywhere near correct anyway, as long as you're reasonably consistent and the errors aren't too badly skewed toward the wrong foods. reply magicalhippo 1 hour agorootparentI did this. I targeted 0.5kg loss per week, and since 1kg of fat is 7000 kcal that meant 500 kcal deficit per week was needed. I measured my weight every morning (after peeing) and wrote it down, and used it to compute weekly average. I did weigh ingredients for the first couple of weeks to get an idea, but after that just did rough estimates coupled with tuning based on feedback from the body weight every week.

That trick is to focus on months instead of days. Then count your calories when you buy the food instead of when you eat it. For example lets say you buy a loaf of bread. It is 100 calories per slice and there are 17 slices. Add 1700 to your calorie count for the month. At the end of the month you can approximate your average daily calories as the amount of calories you bought that month divided by the number of days. Some things you buy in a month might last into the next month. That will introduce some variation but over longer periods it should cancel out. If you want you can smooth that out a bit by logically splitting those items when they have a lot of calories. For example consider jar of mayonnaise that might last a few months and is 8000 calories. Instead of counting all 8000 in the month you buy it you can count it as 2000 that month and 2000 more each of the next 3 months. reply Noumenon72 54 minutes agorootparentI did this for a few weeks when I was maintaining weight and did MyFitnessPal for a couple weeks a few years later and got pretty much the same calorie count each time. Very effective. reply zahlman 3 hours agorootparentprev>Some things you buy in a month might last into the next month. That will introduce some variation but over longer periods it should cancel out. Alternately: you can note the day you first and last ate from the container. Or what I used to do: make tally marks on the container to figure out how many portions it typically provides; then, going forward, count a \"standard\" portion of that food accordingly. reply dnpls 4 hours agorootparentprevA jar of mayonnaise?? you can measure by the spoonful (or better, by weight, since its nutritional value is in the package) whenever you eat. A month is a long time and the measurement error will accumulate every day, especially with fats. Not so much problem if you do that with cucumber or spinach. reply bluGill 3 hours agorootparent> A month is a long time and the measurement error will accumulate every day, especially with fats Over several months the errors will average out. Unless you eat out a lot, then the above method doesn't work. However if you are single (this is the most unlikely factor!) and cook most meals at home then calories in the door what you throw away = calories that you ate. That is good enough. reply tombert 31 minutes agoparentprev> sauces you make yourself? I often mix some different oils, mustard, seeds, miso, bit of leamon juice and spices… but weighting and logging everything will take 3x the time to do the sauce itself I can't speak for anyone else, and I actually do try and weigh everything, but if I forget to weigh or the portions are too small to measure with my cheap kitchen scale: I weigh out my serving of the finished product, and Google either the restaurant or premade-grocery-version of what I made and look at their nutrition labels. Obviously it's not going to be perfect, but I figure that my homemade pizza sauce will have roughly the same ingredients as the Ragu pizza sauce at the grocery store and thus roughly the same calories and nutrition at a per-ounce level. I always assume that my homemade stuff is 20% higher in calories more just to compensate for uncertainty, but doing this I did manage to lose about 60lbs. reply ebiester 5 hours agoparentprevI am very diligent, and the truth is that it is hard and it changes how you eat to be more countable. On a cut, it matters more. On maintenance, it matters less. But most of it is a guessing game and making an assumption that it will all even out later. Ignore spices you can assume 25 calories a day and it’ll still be too much. Be diligent about oils. 9 calories a gram bites you quickly. But ultimately, if you miss 100 calories a day, and are in a 500 calorie deficit recorded, you are still going to lose .8 pounds a week. And if that is consistent, adjust your portions and be fine with how you record. And that’s the key we know nutrition is variable. You won’t get it perfect. You just have to adjust for the imperfections. reply zahlman 3 hours agorootparent>But ultimately, if you miss 100 calories a day, and are in a 500 calorie deficit recorded, you are still going to lose .8 pounds a week.

I was quite underweight in my youth, but I successfully reversed these kinds of feedback techniques to gain weight, and currently maintain what seems to be a healthy level.

It lets you create recipes with the weight of each item and the weight of the final result. I then weigh the portion I have with a meal. Why do I do this in the first place? I'm one of those people that eats too little vs too much, especially in the summers when I'm outside all day burning tons of energy: tracking calories helps me keep weight on. I have to eat so much food to maintain my target weight that it gets pretty uncomfortable some days. Yay for muffins and cookies. Don't worry about how leftover nutrients decrease over time: you'll get enough nutrients in a well balanced diet without having to worry about the minutia. If you're really worried about it, pop a multivitamin for cheap insurance. Also don't worry about the variation in calories between one type of cucumber / apple / whatever vs. another. Those variations aren't significant and they probably average out anyway. Realize too that the sources aren't exact in the first place: once source is likely to give a different caloric value for something like dried beans vs another. If you're going to track, don't get too caught up worrying about if the absolute value of the calories you're recording is 100% accurate because even if they were, you can't track your energy expenditure 100% accurately. If the bathroom scale goes in the wrong direction for you, adjust your caloric intake to compensate.

(maybe simple would be a better phrase it can be reduced to very simple steps. mentally choosing to do this and enduring it is difficult, but the process itself is straightforward.) like the worry about sauces is true but if you eat mostly chicken and rice and one slice of bread a day you can really get that variability down. when I was heavily restricting I would only cook very simple things like that and otherwise eat packaged food, and it certainly worked to lose weight. but you sacrifice variety and flavor and you'll feel kinda stressed and hungry for months at a time. the last factor is living with people who are not dieting I personally think this makes the required willpower basically impossible. if there is food in the house you will eventually succumb to the temptation of eating it in my experience. it's much easier if you live alone and only have the diet food in the house at all, buying nothing else, etc. reply InitialLastName 1 hour agorootparentOne insidious thing is that it's incredibly easy to do food tracking if you eat mostly single-serving prepared foods, but those are, by nature of being incredibly palatable and digestible, the most psychologically and metabolically challenging foods to maintain a calorie deficit with. reply nemomarx 45 minutes agorootparentyeah, although there's a variety there and you can find some lower and higher ones. (bags of anything starchy are difficult, sandwiches are very variable.. I leaned on wraps and stuff like Chicken salad without toppings a lot.) some prepared foods are basically the \"empty calories\" that people always talk about, like chips. high calorie (and usually like 3-4 servings per bag, not single serving really at all) and also low satiation so they almost make you hungrier to eat. reply yuliyp 5 hours agoparentprevFor weighing things, I have a kitchen scale that lets me tare it with something on it. I find it easier to tare a container of an ingredient, then dose some of that ingredient out, then reweigh it to get the delta I put in. For things which have a dash of an ingredient I'll just guess. A few grams here and there won't really matter much. For partitioning a meal: Sometimes I weigh my portion. Over time I've trained myself to estimate the weight of what I take such that my visual estimates are reasonable. Eventually my visual estimates have gotten better. A lot of your other challenges are just not that important: If you're off by a few calories in either direction, it's not a big deal. It'll average out in the long run. If you're systematically off, you'll eventually recalibrate your goals anyway based on how you feel and/or your weight patterns vs what the calorie counts tell you. reply matwood 14 minutes agoparentprevI'm boring and cook roughly the same few meals over and over. reply Retr0id 5 hours agoparentprevI don't, but what I did do was track everything obsessively in a spreadsheet for about a week, while exercising and eating and sleeping a nominally correct amount.

I know, vibe-wise, how it feels to be eating the correct amount of food. And now I just keep doing that. reply wnorris510 4 hours agoparentprevDepends what your goal is. My suggestion is if your goal is weight loss, don't think about calorie tracking at all. Count your servings of whole vegetables/fruit. Try to MAXIMIZE these. Yes, maximize in order to lose weight. It's far easier to track just this small subset of food. If you are maximizing these items, you'll naturally start feeling full and eat less sweets. Try to do this slowly over time, changing your diet dramatically overnight will cause you to hate the process and give up. Change your diet less than 10% per week, keep eating all of your favorite guilty pleasure foods, just incorporate more healthy foods you enjoy as well, ideally before you eat the less healthy items to give yourself time to start feeling full from them. Slowly find more dishes heavy in vegetables that you like. Try to eat them more often. If you're cooking for yourself or serving yourself, try to increase the ratio of vegetable to other items. Getting pizza? Maybe do a side salad first or a get a veggie pizza. Don't try to cut the pizza entirely until you're further along in your journey. Don't stress about it. If you're consistently finding ways to make small changes like this you'll start heading in the right direction over the long haul and your pallet will adapt to enjoy the foods you're not used to slowly. reply Noumenon72 51 minutes agorootparentMaximize might be a little overkill. The government recommends 5-9 servings of fruit and vegetables a day and I found that getting to that range involves putting so many vegetables in every meal that you feel full naturally. reply LPisGood 4 hours agoparentprevI don’t do this anymore, but when I was, the answers are as follows: I didn’t make a ton of sauces myself, but if it was then I would round spices down to zero and weigh the main caloric components (think mayo, soy sauce, sugar, oil, tomato paste, etc) I always weighed the uncooked food, so different cooking times was a non factor. As for nutrients decreasing, I dealt with this by not believing in it. Seriously though, I was tracking fats, carbs, and proteins which to my knowledge do not meaningfully decay in non negligible amounts. I lived alone so I didn’t often have to cook for multiple people. When I did I would just make 2 omelets or waffles or whatever and weigh mine. As far as different species/cultivation methods, I realized there was an absolute edge to my ability to track. For example: bread is often listed at 70 calories per slice, but if you weigh each slice, you’ll find it deviates from what the package considers a “slice” of bread substantially. Further, you’ll often find packages that are inconsistent. For example, you might see a box that claims 14g of a food is 5 calories but the entire 28g container is also listed at 15 calories. reply loeg 1 hour agoparentprevGetting the grams right goes a long way. At the end of the day, you're trying to approximately measure the caloric density per gram, and maybe macros (proportion protein / fat / carbs). You're thinking in way too fine detail for it to be sustainable. Even with a lax approach, it is pretty tedious. I wouldn't really recommend tracking long-term, but doing it for a week or so just to get a sense of how much you're currently consuming is a good idea. reply ApolloFortyNine 4 hours agoparentprevIn what you listed under making a sauce, only mayo and the oils need to be weighed (unless it's some ridiculous amount of seeds).

I have no idea what I am loading onto my plate I try to search for something similar in the app and deliberately over-estimate the quantity knowing that there is a tendency to under estimate. Really though weighing things is almost beside the point. It's about being aware/mindful of the quantity of food going in. When you are tracking you will for example pick one treat to eat rather than having both etc. Before counting I'd often forget that I had chocolate as a snack or at lunch and then again at dinner etc reply yodsanklai 5 hours agoparentprevI suppose it depends what goals you're pursuing with your tracking. If it's simply losing weight, you can focus on the things with lots of calories in them. Oil, sugar, processed foods. Tomatoes, cucumber and lemon juice shouldn't be an issue. reply screye 3 hours agoparentprevI track everything. (with caveats below) It's less important to get the calorie numbers perfect, and more important to be consistent in your under/over reporting. To me, it's a tool to track the consistency of my diet. No amount of over/under reporting is hiding 2 slices of pizza on a graph. In sweet dishes, 2 TBSP sugar is 120 calories. In savory dishes, 1 TBSP oil is 100 calories. None of the other minor ingredients have any appreciable calories. You should be able to predict quantities within a 1 TBSP tolerance range. The rest of your calories come from foods with visible volume, and chatgpt does a good job of predicting their calories from screenshots. With that, hopefully, you don't under-report any meal by more than 200 calories. If you're following a recipe, dump the whole thing into chatgpt, voila. Over 2 meals, under-reporting by 200 calories feels like a lot. But wait to have 1 milkshake, beer or 1 tiny baklava and see the graph shoot beyond any of these pesky concerns. The goal is to track and be accountable for the latter: the ultra-palatable foods. The extra onions and parsley are not making you fat. For outside food, you can find official numbers reported by fast food places. Add 20% to their estimate. Actually, add 10% to all estimates. Every your own food. If a full meal randomly lands under 500 calories. I look at it with scrutiny. It takes careful effort to stay under 500 and feel full. If it happens consistently and you don't lose weight, then you're tracking something wrong. PSA: NUTS HAVE A SH*T TON OF CALORIES. ALWAYS REPORT THEM. YOU WILL BE SHOCKED. _____ The system has worked quite well for me. In all cases, my weight gain has corresponded to long periods of door dashing, liquid calories & dessert binges.

The trick is to get good enough at estimating within reason, and focus on one aspect such as calories. Figure out what one table spoon of oil contains, and when you make a sauce use a table spoon while pouring to count roughly how much oil you are putting in.

I often mix some different oils, mustard, seeds, miso, bit of leamon juice and spices… but weighting and logging everything will take 3x the time to do the sauce itself Yes.

The measuring of ingredients is much easier if you use a scale. A case like cold sauces where you can put the mixing vessel on the scale is the easiest case. On sharing with others: I'd always calculate the total calories and total weight of the entire dish and then simply place the serving plate on the scale and calculate the taken calories based on the weight. reply IanCal 5 hours agoparentprevIt depends why you're tracking things, and what level of \"everything\" you care about. Starting with pretty much everything can be a good idea for people to get a sense of what's in what foods. How much does an onion typically weigh? What's that actually adding? What's the difference between getting lean and fattier meat? How much oil are you really adding? After that it's easier to start dropping things if I'm trying to lose weight I simply do not care precisely how much celery I've added for the sofrito. I do care about the amount of butter, oil, rice, bread, pasta though. I'm not concerned about getting fat adding paprika, so I'm not weighing spices. Even if I'm trying to track macros that's just not going to be a considerable contributor to anything. > different cooking time in one receive : oignons going first, tomato sauce in the middle and parsley at the end (but still cook a bit with residual heat) Prep/measure things first. Last three things that smooth things over for me 1. Meal prep on a different day. I'm not in as much of a rush at night, it's proportionally less time involved measuring something for a larger number of meals/sauces/components. 2. Having measuring spoons and fast scales nearby. 3. Measuring before & after amounts rather than exactly what to add. If I need to add butter to a sauce until it's the right consistency, or flour to a dough, or whatever then weighing as I go is a nightmare. Instead just weigh it before and after and you'll see what you used. This tip works pretty well for oil too. reply jjj123 5 hours agoparentprevFor me I mostly just try to log the high macro and/or calorie items. Like if I make a Caesar dressing I’m mostly counting the oil and if I’m being really meticulous I’ll measure the Parmesan and anchovy content.

I have no idea if that would involve selling your first born in the US though reply bluGill 3 hours agorootparentDepends on the vitamin. Many are water soluble and so any excess in the body is peed out by the end of the day and so all tests are useless. Fortunately you typically get more than enough as part of a typical balanced diet and so you shouldn't need to supplement in the first place if you are eating well. Though it is almost impossible to overdose so if it makes you feel good there is no harm in making the vitamin companies rich. The rest you can get blood tests. In general it isn't worth testing unless your doctor suspects something is wrong though. Just eat a healthy diet and get plenty of exercise and you will mostly be fine.

Spices and everything else in general have so little in them it doesn't matter. Something like seeds or pepper more so, but you're hardly going to add so many it changes anything. Which is kind of the point: you look this stuff up once in order to get a sense of what you're actually doing, and quickly realize what is and isn't going to matter overall. If you're really concerned, you start from a fixed mass you'll season from, and then just use that up as you go. i.e. if you know you'll be adjusting added sugar, then estimate the total amount of sugar you're comfortable putting in the meal up front, and work from that pool.

You are correct that it takes a lot longer when you do that. That's the cost of keeping track of your caloric intake. I also do not account for any nutrient loss or divergence from different cooking times, leftovers, or from different species. I only weigh everything I eat when I am actively trying to lose weight, however, and when I am doing so I deliberately restrict my diet to meals where I won't waste a lot of time weighing everything. If I'm trying to maintain or gain weight, I don't really bother with it. reply adrian_b 4 hours agoparentprevI have been obese for many years and also now if I do not pay attention to what I eat I gain weight immediately. Eventually I have learned to control exactly what I eat, in order to control my weight, but I no longer find this difficult, mainly because normally I eat only what I cook myself (with the exception of trips away from home). When I experiment how to cook something that I have never cooked before, after I reach a stable recipe with which I am content, I measure carefully every ingredient, either with digital kitchen scales or with a set of volumetric spoons. Then I compute the relevant nutrient content, e.g. calories, protein content, fatty acid profile, possibly some vitamin and mineral content, in the cases when there exists a significant content of that. While I do this carefully the first time and I record the results, whenever I cook the same later I do not need to pay attention to this, because I already know the nutrient content, so summing for all the portions of food that I plan to eat in that day I can easily estimate the daily intake for everything. The essential change in my habits that enabled me to lose the excessive weight was that in the past I was eating without paying attention to quantity, until I was satiated, while now I always plan what amount of food I will eat during a day and I always cook the food in portions of the size that I intend to eat, which is always the same for a given kind of food, so I no longer have to repeat any of the computations that I have made when I have determined for the first time a recipe. In a recipe, things like spices can be ignored, because they add negligible nutrients. Even many vegetable parts, like leaves or stalks, or even some of the roots or of the non-sweet non-fatty fruits, may be ignored even when used in relatively great quantities, because their nutrient content is low. So such ingredients may be added while cooking without measuring them. For many vegetables and fruits, which are added to food as a number of pieces, I do not measure them when cooking, but when buying. I typically buy an amount sufficient for next week, which is weighed during buying. Then I add every day a n approximate fraction of what I have bought, e.g. 1/7 if used for cooking every day. Then for estimating the average daily intake, I divide by 7 what I have bought for the week. What cannot be ignored and must always be measured during cooking, to be sure that you add the right amount, are any kinds of seeds or nuts or meat or dairy or eggs, anything containing non-negligible amounts of starch or sugar, any kind of fat or oil or protein extracts. Any such ingredients must always be measured by weight or by volume, to be sure that you add the right amount to food. Nevertheless, measuring the important ingredients adds negligible time to cooking and ensures perfectly reproducible results. I eat only what I cook myself and I measure carefully everything that matters, but the total time spent daily with measurements is extremely small. I doubt that summing all the times spent with measuring food ingredients during a whole day can give a total of more than one minute or two. Paring and peeling vegetables or washing dishes takes much more time. reply XorNot 5 hours agoparentprevI mean I eat very close to the same thing every day, so I am perhaps not the best example, but for example: > sauces you make yourself? I often mix some different oils, mustard, seeds, miso, bit of leamon juice and spices… but weighting and logging everything will take 3x the time to do the sauce itself You weigh all this out once, store it as a recipe and just weigh how much sauce you're putting on things. Oils are so high calorie they're basically all the same, and the only other contributor is really if the seed mass is substantial. Log your upper end, and just assume the sauce comes out as that value. Your sauce recipe is hardly going to vary by an enormous amount, just provided you bias it towards the upper end for the purposes of tracking.

That was pretty easy: while cooking, you weigh every ingredient. Either I just take photos of the scale with my phone, or I write it on a sheet of paper. when cooking is done, you weigh the total food (easiest if you know the weight of your pots) when eating, you weigh your portions After some time, you realise that you need to be precise for some things (oil, butter) but can just guess or ignore some things (eg. onions and miso have so little calories that you really don't need to weigh them). If it's a dish like Lasagna, you don't even need to weigh it at the end, just estimate what fraction of the dish your serving is. reply crazygringo 5 hours agorootparentExactly this. You just weigh every ingredient. It doesn't matter if it's a sauce or what. If it's something premade (like tomato sauce) you use the calories on the packaging. If it's a raw ingredient you look it up. I never bothered with weighing the final result or portions, instead I just always divvied up the final product into equal individual portions and divided by the total number of portions. That works well if you freeze them. Of course, all the calculation is a tremendous amount of work. I did it when I needed to lose weight and only did it for a couple of months.

Did the chef put two or three dashes (official SI unit) of this or that on your meal? A a \"dash\" or \"splash\" or \"spritz\" of certain things can easily mean 100-200 kcal. And if you deal with things like meat, maybe the cut you get today is more or less lean than what you got last week. I think tracking calories for a couple of weeks can be very enlightening for a lot of people, granted you don't have a personality type where this can get you into trouble. But for the long haul it's not really useful or even feasible, you're better off getting to know what sort of way of eating suits you best and how to correct if you're getting off course. Anyone can stick to a very strict regime for three months, but the trick is to stick to a proper diet you can enjoy for three decades and then three decades more. reply manfre 5 hours agorootparentHealthy foods are not healthy in an excessive quantity. Diets don't need to be tracked to the individual calorie. We don't burn the same amount l number of calories each day and food labels show an average of the nutritional value. If a person is consistent, they will achieve the desired result; either gaining or losing weight. I've been tracking consistently for about 5 years. It's feasible. reply parpfish 2 hours agoparentprevone unintended side effect i had with myfitnesspal was that i ended up eating more prepackaged/highly-processed foods because i disliked estimating calories in home-cooked stuff so much (especially because i knew it'd be an inaccurate guess) reply TypingOutBugs 12 minutes agorootparentYeah I can get that pre-packaged cooked chicken is easier than roasted rotisserie chicken from the counter even if it's probably worse (loads of additives and flavourings) reply rconti 2 hours agoparentprevI've used it on and off for 7 or 8 years and it's the only thing that can consistently help me lose weight. Even just the mindfulness of knowing how much you're eating and how much you're exercising are helpful in the process. You don't have to be that accurate on exact calorie counts for this to work. reply pplonski86 5 hours agoparentprevIt takes some effort, but there’s a lot to gain. When I track what I eat and keep my daily calories in check, I feel much better. If I’m unsure of the exact calorie count, I’ll estimate a bit higher around 1.2x. reply switch007 5 hours agoparentprevLean into that And even if you don't record with 100pc accuracy, there's still a lot of value reply NoboruWataya 5 hours agoparentprevYeah, I have tried a few times to keep track via Cronometer but I can never keep it up. Eating out is the killer, as you say. I find I often don't even have a frame of reference for estimating the amount of calories. With the amount of sauces and oil that go into a lot of stuff, I feel like a lot of things could as easily be 1,200 calories as 500 calories. reply everdrive 5 hours agoprevA lot of people seem to have a purely emotional relationship with resources which logic doesn't seem to be able to penetrate. Food and finances seem similar here. For years I tried to get my wife to stick to a grocery budget. That is, we have $n per week for all groceries. She'd blow badly over the limit every time. \"But we needed [food]\" or \"These were toiletries, so they don't _count_ as groceries.\" Ultimately we never had an real success sticking to a grocery budget, and ultimately the solution was me working towards better paying jobs. This feels a LOT like weight loss. Calories in > calories out is conceptually very simple, but in practice more people struggle with it than not. It certainly cannot be the case that they struggle with the concept; they struggle with actually putting it into action. Lying to themselves, twisting themselves into philosophical knots, and probably most often, conceding to their cravings. Food acquisition is one of out more basic drives, so it should probably be no surprise that people struggle to intellectualize it. (as and aside, there are also people who wrongly believe that calories in > calories out is a flawed concept because not all people have the same metabolism, or not all calories are equal. Both of these are true, but none of them actually negate the premise. For whatever your metabolism, and whatever your category of calories, fewer calories will still produce weight loss. It may feel unfair that someone doesn't have to work as hard as you to produce the same result, but this is actually true in all areas of life. Now that said, improving the quality of your calories is very important, and should not be ignored but it also does not negate the premise.) reply wrfrmers 43 minutes agoparentCalories in > calories out is flawed (or, rather, not useful) because metabolism is a feedback loop, not a one-way serial process. The types of foods you eat, how they're prepared, and when you eat them have complex influence for how hungry you feel and how much energy you have to exercise or resist impulses, as well as ramifications for the state of your physiology, per nutrient intake. CICO helps explain weight management issues retrospectively, but it's inadequate with regard to planning, and for maintaining quality of life while working towards a weight management goal. reply derbOac 4 hours agoparentprevIt's really hard (emotionally or motivationally) to undereat, which is what you need to do consistently for a long time to lose weight. Aside from the hunger issue, food is enmeshed in all sorts of value having nothing to do with nutritional value per se and everything to do with sociopsychological value. I think I've massively underestimated that in my own life, or misunderstood what that meant or something. I think the way it plays out is much more pervasive and subtle than what people realize. I'm not even saying it's wrong, it's just hard to suddenly deprive yourself of something that is meaningfully rewarding, and especially so when you're unaware of it consciously. reply colechristensen 1 hour agorootparentAlso there are ways to convince your body that it needs less, and the journey from A to B is very uncomfortable. If you do it wrong you will just endlessly be suffering from your body thinking it's starving. On top of that though is you have to get over your intellectual ideas of how much food you think you need to eat. reply Sohcahtoa82 51 minutes agorootparentThis is so dismissive it's almost condescending. I know how much food I need to eat in order to survive and maintain a healthy weight. But if I eat that amount of food, I'm still hungry. Doesn't matter what I eat. I'll eat a diet high in protein and fiber, moderate in fat, and low in sugar and starches, which is supposed to be the recipe to feel full without eating empty calories, but it doesn't work. 16 oz steak paired with an 8 oz portion of green beans or broccoli, and I still get the munchies just 2 hours later. I should probably go to a doctor and ask about Ozempic or something. I did successfully lose about 50 pounds doing keto and brought my A1C from 6.8 down to 5.4, but I damn near lost my sanity because I was always hungry. I've gained it all back and started to get some of diabetic symptoms again. reply nemomarx 41 minutes agorootparentI'm kinda convinced that something has changed (prescription meds ending up in the water supply? micro plastics?) that makes people hungrier than they were in the mid 20th century. the effort required to eat less seems higher than ever, and you can't totally explain the gap and rise in obesity with just lifestyle and food availability. if some unknown element was making everyone's internal thermostat aim for more food it would explain a lot. reply 2cynykyl 5 hours agoparentprevIm reading Sapiens at the moment and one statement really got my attention: human society is a marvel, but individually we are embarrassingly similar to Chimps.

I thought that wasn't true, that the human body stores and burns calories at varying rates based on many signals, and that our bodies or some bodies effectively conserve weight or caloric stores at a certain level. reply everdrive 3 hours agorootparentThe body can compensate at the margins. Eat 5 fewer calories per day and you will see zero change. Eat 500 fewer calories per day, consistently every day, and you will absolutely see changes. (I'm not actually suggesting that it would be _healthy_ or advisable to drop your diet by 500 calories just pointing out that the body cannot compensate indefinitely.) reply bluGill 3 hours agorootparentThe compensation is often lower energy levels. Your body compensates by keeping you from doing as much. reply nemomarx 1 hour agorootparentyeah, you want to force yourself to do some activities that keep your metabolism up along with the restrictions you can't exercise out of a bad diet but exercise is a helpful supplement to a good diet too. it's just that making yourself do it when you're tired and hungry is draining. reply colechristensen 58 minutes agorootparent>you can't exercise out of a bad diet You can, but it's not easy. People who exercise _a lot_ often have trouble eating enough calories. 5,000 to 10,000 calories a day is hard to eat and not out of reach. I knew a guy who was drinking a gallon of whole milk a day for a while to try to maintain weight. reply nemomarx 39 minutes agorootparentI really can't imagine having the energy to burn 10k a day what kinda workload were they doing? reply landtuna 2 hours agoparentprevI never understood why calories in == calories out was relevant when we can't know how many unprocessed calories are remaining undigested. Here's what the bots had to say: https://www.perplexity.ai/search/weight-loss-gurus-often-say... (FYI I stay thin by limiting calories, so I don't disagree that fewer calories causes weight loss) reply nemomarx 39 minutes agorootparentcico is true, but you can't measure calories in accurately and you can't be sure of calories out accurately. isn't that fun? (in practice as you know, you just kinda do it on feel and end up restricting calories enough to lose weight. but my own intuition is that I had to aim for 100 or 200 less than my estimated BMR so the math is very fuzzy isn't it?) reply ttoinou 2 hours agorootparentprevThis theory is not scientific (food is not energy, the body is not a machine, measurements are not precise etc.) so there is nothing rationale you can say that will convince people who believe in it to switch to something else reply keybored 1 hour agoparentprev> This feels a LOT like weight loss.

Lying to themselves, twisting themselves into philosophical knots, and probably most often, conceding to their cravings. Food acquisition is one of out more basic drives, so it should probably be no surprise that people struggle to intellectualize it. Imagine a piano teacher. Their mantra is practice in -----> skill out. Profound. Every time their students come to them and complain about not being motivated, practice being too dull, experiencing back pain or repetitive stress syndromes, wanting to change up the practice, they just say: practice in equals skill out. What is so hard to understand? That’s what the \"calories in/out\" people are like. And this is the only area where this is an accepted argument. Where it is even treated as a valid argument at all. Everyone knows that you have to put in time on an instrument in order to get better. Everyone. No one denies it. Similarily I don’t think the overlap of weight loss pursuers and deniers of energy conservation as it moves through food groups (plants to cows to humans) is terribly large. If you truly want to rationally assist people who want to learn the piano or lose weight you do what works. You don’t repeat a truism. Cutting out sugar? Meat? Intermmitteng fasting? Counting calories? Anything that works. You don’t sheepishly point out that they failed to practice their ten hours last week without even asking why didn’t follow through. The in/out people seem to have a hard time intellectualizing this simple concept. reply Spivak 3 hours agoparentprevOh hey, I'm the wife in this story. Having a fixed $/month budget for \"things you buy at a grocery store\" was doomed from the beginning. All the stuff in your house/pantry are on all kinds of weird replacement cycles that vary with usage and changes in habits. A monthly cadence also makes you sub-optimally plan around price movements. An attainable goal is to reduce the average amount of monthly grocery spend and you do it by deciding, in advance, things you're no longer going to stock in the house, items you'll replace for cheaper options, or items you'll stock from wholesale clubs. It's hard to bring the budget for gas down without people driving less. Your wife being the one tasked with filling up the tank is the messenger. It could be an emotional reaction as you describe but I would at least entertain the idea that her \"bending the rules\" is her way of trying to make an impossible ask doable. Whether she is consciously thinking about it or not, I bet the stuff that \"doesn't count\" aren't replaced every month and have spikey cost patterns. reply everdrive 1 hour agorootparentTo your credit, our approach never worked :) I totally agree that you'd need to find a reasonable average weekly cost because costs and timing would vary. In my mind, this means you could find a reasonable average weekly cost that you often go under, and seldom go over. But, it just never happened for us. In principle we could have just kept raising the price ceiling, but eventually that becomes meaningless in the context of a budget. To me, at least, it felt just like calories; what could have been a pretty easy math problem was defeated by human psychology. reply watwut 4 hours agoparentprev> they struggle with actually putting it into action [...] conceding to their cravings The trouble is that people who have",

Even an 8 year old P40 is going for $300 on eBay because it has 24GB VRAM.

Also Nvidia’s project DIGITS is really competitive because it offers 128GB coherence unified memory. 1 superkuh I would like support for ROCm to be restored to all the relatively recent GPUs (last 5-6 years) AMD has released and then dropped ROCm support for. New I could not care much about. Actually supporting the AMD cards I bought in the past would be great. 61 10 2 1 reply luyatshimbalanga Agreed. As a owner of laptop running a Ryzen 7 5825U released in 2022 as new hardware, it is disappointing the support of GCN architecture got dropped nearly two years later hence a terrible mistake which lead some users to migrate to the competition which has better hardware support. AMD APU is arguably the most neglected part seeing a broken support of ROCm including the OpenCL before its dropping. AMD will need to review their strategy in that department. 18 2 edited ckastner I think it might be interesting to share here that Debian has built a CI at ci.rocm.debian.net where the ROCm stack, and any package that depends on it, is continuously tested. Our CI includes all of the architectures listed above. We would be happy to cooperate on increasing device support for Debian and derivatives. 40 6 1 0 replies edited ZebraFromPluto This is not a \"device\" support wish, but a \"platform\" one. Stable Diffusion on native Windows with AMD GPUs is not possible until we get \"Windows\" support for \"AI Libraries\" (specifically MIOpen) here: https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-windows/en/develop/reference/component-support.html This is required to get PyTorch working. I've seen so many AMD users in recent times selling their AMD GPUs and buying \"the competition\" because WSL and ZLUDA are their only options, and those are half-baked solutions. Native Windows support should be a top priority. 40 10 4 5 replies tocram1 Definitely agree on this one, this is a major hurdle in MY opinion. zamroni111 Have you tried Radeon with directml on windows? https://community.amd.com/t5/ai/how-to-automatic1111-stable-diffusion-webui-with-directml/ba-p/649027 1 1 edited eye776 Yes, and sadly DirectML performance makes AMD look like it's two generations behind the competition. It works in a pinch but I felt like retiring my RX 6700 10GB from my system and replaced it with a card from the competition was the only real way forward. Even using zluda as a bandaid (it's not exactly a magic bullet), it still positions AMD one generation behind the competition. 4 hsz1273327 There should not be two ecosystems for the same piece of device. Especially when developer resources are limited. 1 edited JakoDel WSL is anything but half baked, ROCm on it is basically as fast as native linux and it takes 10 minutes to setup. why are people even recommending awfully slow stuff like directML? illiteracy is running at full speed in this thread 1 edited pedrovhb A bit older than the ones listed there, but I own a 5700XT, and a good few other people do too, from my extensive looking for how to get it to work online. Still holding on to the precompiled wheel for torch 1.13 ROCM 5.2 for Python 3.10 which is the last one that works (after setting HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION). Later versions seem to either outright crash, or import correctly but then crash when a tensor is sent to the GPU. Using this older version as a workaround was doable back when torch 2.0 was new, but now as most new code has already been using 2.0+ for a while, it's effectively not functional at all anymore for any recently written code. 20 8 1 reply SicLuceatLux me too. UnderworldFreedom Considering my GPU( 6600 XT) was released near the end of 2021 it would be nice to know that I don't need to buy a new GPU every year just to have support. It would also be nice to have actual proper Windows support instead of having to deal with the clusterfuck that is Zluda, or other translation layers. This kind of treatment from AMD is why I'll probably go nvidia the next time my budget allows it. 17 1 reply zamroni111 Rdna2 can use directml in windows. 1 2 edited daguava APU support opens the door for introducing this software to a wide audience, please consider hitting the entire APU line (3 and 3.5.) Early ROCm worked for 780m and got me in the front door of working with this software at all (that said I had to use env var hacks to get it functioning). Later versions of ROCm stopped working at all. The hobbyist crowd would greatly benefit from APU support, which hopefully has the AMD financial incentive of market share and product familiarity (hobbyist engineers who do something neat at home and then bring the concepts to work, where you then pick up the larger purchases) If I was able to feel confident in better consumer ROCm support I would have gladly dropped money for 2 AMD graphics cards for the LLM stuff I do. 38 20 7 replies Show 2 previous replies baiyz ROCm APU support is really important because Nvidia (Tegra / DIGITS), Intel (oneAPI) and Apple (MPS) all have supported their APUs. AMD is the only exception now. 4 edited daguava I just went through the exercise of getting ROCm working again for my 780m Ryzen 9 7940HS APU, finishing about 10 minutes ago, to remind myself what it was like. It took Giving up on installing dependencies myself due to kernel version madness Downloading 15gb worth of rocm/pytorch docker container to try a version I knew used to work (6.1.3) Exporting HSA env hacks and compiling llama.cpp for use with the given gfx1102 version Realizing that despite this being the 'correct' version for my card, it didn't work, and having to downgrade to gfx1101 HSA This compile it worked ~50% of the time (50% of run attempts resulted in GPU hang) Deciding I wanted to try the latest and greatest Downloading 24gb worth of rocm/pytorch:latest (6.3.1 this time) Beating my head against a wall when gfx1101 now no longer works Stuffing my head back full of grey matter upon realizing that gfx1102 now does work Compiling and it again works, 50% of the time but hey, I get 10% faster token input speed over 6.1.3... That experience is not conducive to doing anything hobby related, and I definitely would not expect that everyone's going to be knowledgeable enough or have enough patience to fiddle with their setups to find the working combinations. Please, I want to want your stuff :( . Even simple stuff like a pruned docker container would go a long way. 8 hsz1273327 APU is currently the most valuable expansion platform. Consumer-grade dedicated GPUs are difficult to shake the dominant position held by NVIDIA cards; consumers do not trust AMD's GPUs can work as efficiently as CUDA in serious scenarios, making it hard for them to choose Amd GPU. With fewer people using Amd GPU, less feedback and optimization follow, creating a vicious cycle that makes ROCm worse and worse. In contrast, there are no such issues with APUs. Users will only think it's great that APUs can also be used for machine learning, leading to more adoption and better improvements over time. Because they are affordable, they can also be paired with large memory as VRAM, making laptops with APU the preferred choice for students to learn machine learning, helping to cultivate their user habits. 7 DMantis Definitely agree for 780M. That's very strange to have a developer business oriented T-series Thinkpads and being able to run only CPU based llama. I'd like to see ROCm on AMD APUs sold in X and T Thinkpad series for the last several years. 4 sommerper Speaking of Framework.

I tried xdna 2 days ago and it was still compile error teromee I wish for AMD to look back at the RX 500 and the RX5000 series. And the reason being, the physical architectures for both lend themselves to really interesting compute because the RX 580 architecturally is very good to use as a modular scale up and scale down at 75 w. And based based on some back of the napkin maths that I've done an RX 580 8 gig with a 8 billion parameter model with a quant size of eight.

Doesn't have to be crazy fast, but support it and then improve it over time. And simultaneously, but fine if at a lower pace, walk backwards and support the older products. So you should start by supporting strix halo and RDNA 4. Then RDNA 3 and prior APUs. 2 1 0 replies TheJKM Thank you for reaching out and at least trying to extend the device support. The limited consumer hardware support has always been one of the weakest point of ROCm, and if AMD is serious about the future of ROCm, at least any upcoming hardware should be supported. Being able to get used to a platform without spending 1000s is actually huge. Currently, even if unsupported, many actually work fine. I did and I'm still doing some PyTorch stuff on a 8700GE, which has a gfx1103 GPU in it. Works, but there are some nasty minor issues like this one here, causing the GPU driver to crash now and then, seemingly a firmware issue: lamikr/rocm_sdk_builder#141 I think, it's a rather small step for AMD to make those 99% working devices to a 100% officially supported level. 12 0 replies guglovich At one time Kaveri was promoted as a hybrid processor, and while HSA was being implemented its support disappeared. It would be fair, given the promises of marketers, to make HSA + ROCm for APU Kaveri. 4 0 replies edited LunNova Missing poll option: actually support the ✅ marked devices consistently There's not much point having a green icon in the support matrix if it doesn't mean your device is supported. aotriton supports only MI2xx, MI3xx, 7800, 7900. hipblaslt supports only MI2xx, MI3xx, 7800, 7900. Dao-AILab/flash-attention (which AMD contributed ROCm support to) doesn't support MI100. I think it's picky about consumer cards too but don't remember the models. 11 2 1 reply IMbackK Yeah this is the big thing. Besides missing rdna1 support, the actual support matrix (not the mostly useless check mark, what the code supports) is mostly fine, except random libraries that then support only a subset of those. 2 edited echelon Chicken and egg. I don't own any of your hardware because I can't run the software I want to run. Support Flux, Stable Diffusion, Tencent Hunyuan Video, Nvidia Cosmos, and I'll be in the market to buy your cards. As it stands, I can't leverage your offering. I'll gladly build AMD workstations if your hardware can do the things I want. Prioritize VRAM. The next battle is local image and video models. Nobody wants to use hosted SaaS and all the film and VFX people will be running local Comfy, Hunyuan, etc. in just a few years time. These models need a tremendous amount of VRAM, so you need to build consumer/prosumer SKUs that have it. If you time this right and build high VRAM consumer cards with broad software support, the next generation of media production could ride on your platform.

I would also like the Windows and Linux (and WSL) support lists to be the same. I would like support for laptop GPUs because I find working on a laptop more convenient (and everyone at my workplace uses them) and I would like iGPU support so that I could buy a laptop with an AMD CPU and an NVIDIA GPU and use it to develop for both CUDA and ROCm (or, more correctly, develop with CUDA and test on ROCm/HIP). Which leads me to this: I always develop on NVIDIA hardware, because most of the market, on both server and client side, is NVIDIA GPUs. In my current job, where I write something that will run on the cloud or on custom-specced PCs, NVIDIA is naturally an easier choice, because AMD just doesn't offer the ease of development that NVIDIA does. In my previous job, where I wrote consumer software with OpenCL and Direct3D, I found AMD easier and liked it better, but I still spent most of my time on NVIDIA hardware, because that's the market. (Disclaimer: the software I wrote at my previous job didn't run on Linux. It ran Windows, Mac OS, and even Android, to an extent, but it didn't address Linux.) When it comes to ROCm/HIP, I think that what AMD needs to offer is a path of least resistance, something that would enable developers to address AMD as an afterthought, with as few barriers as possible. In terms of hardware support, this IMO means iGPUs. Ryzen CPUs are quite successful. Desktop ones come with an RDNA 2 iGPU. Laptop ones come with whatever that laptop generation has. A developer using such a platform can have an NVIDIA dGPU and, if AMD supported iGPUs in ROCm/HIP, would still be able to test the AMD part of the software without having to own a separate PC for that purpose. When it comes to Linux support specifically, I think that the best would be to support the same hardware HIP for Windows offers. If I develop for both Windows and Linux, I'd love to be able to develop on Windows and WSL and have the same GPU run both. With the limited Linux support, this is quite difficult to achieve. Windows supports pretty much all desktop RDNA 2 and 3 cards, which IMO is great, even if I'd love official support for laptop dGPUs (which are supported, even if unofficially) and for iGPUs of these architectures. If AMD doesn't have the resources to support all this on Linux, then at least have architecture-wide support. Do only RDNA 3, but enable it for all RDNA 3 GPUs, so that a 7800 XT, 7700 XT or 7600 would be valid targets development. Edit: On the software side, AMD should add support for CUDA devices on Windows, and ensure that HIP for Windows is reasonably in step with ROCm, so that cross-platform development would be the easiest it can be. Also, regarding hardware support, obviously people would like the widest support possible, but as I see it, people are often willing to upgrade. The important thing is consistency. I would like AMD to define a minimum architecture, and then support everything from that point on. 5 0 replies thanosk As an owner of a 5700XT and a 7800XT, I voted for RDNA3, but my true vote is just for \"all of them\". Please AMD make your software stack to work with and on everywhere, an inspiration from CUDA which runs on all nvidia hardware, even the most weak. That would bring you more customers and supporters, while making our lives much much much easier, thank you very much. 7 0 replies illwieckz Hi @powderluv, in order of priorities I suggest: Firstly, AMD needs to support all PRO GPUs from the current generation, as soon as possible. The list you posted doesn't even include the Radeon PRO W7600, which is a professional RDNA 3.0 card from 2023. I bough a W7600 as soon as it was announced for the sole purpose of doing ROCm compatibility testing and software quality, that's why I didn't need that much power and didn't went for high-end card. But I bought a PRO one for the purpose of getting an officially ROCm supported card and it is still not officially supported after a year and 5 months! Secondly, AMD needs to extend support to all consumer GPUs from the current generation. People should be able to buy anything from AMD and have it working. Thirdly, AMD needs to extend support to all GPUs from older generations it can. For example at the GCN2 time, I bought an R9 390X, the highest end consumer card from the era, for the purpose of doing compute, ROCm never supported it officially and it only worked for a couple of months. People were still running fglrx in 2020 five years after the launch of the card, four years after the launch of ROCm. Outside of ROCm the Linux kernel driver for this card may still have bugs not fixed today. I expect similar stories with more recent cards. Today ROCm supports more cards than before, that's good, but the way I got deceived with the W7600 PRO with the current generation just reveals something is still not right. This is an official application of mine for a position of quality engineer at AMD, please forward to the relevant people, please. What I offer to AMD is a dedicated service of testing, debugging and reporting compatibility and quality issues in ROCm and related software stack. I propose to do the same quality and compatibility effort with ROCm and compute I have previously done with rendering for the Dæmon game engine for which I achieved 22 years of hardware compatibility (proof: wiki.unvanquished.net/wiki/GPU_compatibility_matrix). You can check my GitHub profile for public proof of my savoir faire and commitment in free software engineering, and my I ♥ Compute initiative where I already do that quality effort, see also my entreprise rebatir.fr. I'm already accustomed to testing, debugging and reporting AMD drivers for years, here are public proofs: ROCm tracker (issues for 7 years) LLVM tracker (PRs and issues for 3 years) Mesa merge requests and issues (for 4 years) In June of 2024 AMD publicly announced a position for a ROCm packaging engineer, so I tried to apply but unfortunately the application website is very limited and all I could send was my resume, and it looks like my application even didn't got reviewed at all. I can apply for quality instead of packaging and I would do a spontaneous application if the application system allowed it. Attached are the documents I prepared for my application in June that no one reviewed. They are partially redacted for confidentiality purpose as I publicly post them there, but once the formal review has started I can send the fully disclosed documents: 202407.amd-application.en-redacted.pdf The collaboration can be achieved either as an AMD employee or as a contractor with my rebatir.fr entreprise, for the best we can agree on. Don't waste that opportunity please, AMD is in need for help. You can reach me at contact ad rebatir.fr (GPG). 13 1 reply stalkerg They can reach me as well. :) They even know my email because of patch in kernel. But I don't think they are ready to change business and development practice yet. My contacts told me what main issue it's on middle managers level. They more need good managers and new mental model before hire new devs. I know how difficult to change anything in the public company they difficult to commit into future and indirect initiative. 1 gioan777 ROCm isn't supported on my 6700XT Linux system, at least not officially, because I still need to include the HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=10.3.0 environment variable otherwise the ROCm applications refuse to use my card. 1 0 replies gladiac Please bring back the 7800 XT, gfx1101.

IMHO this is one of the biggest problems of ROCm, support is spotty and unreliable. E.g. it should support all RDNA2/3/4 GPUs without exceptions. In addition to that, support needs to be long-lived with actual deprecation plans. Never drop support for something on a whim again, please. Personally, it might even be OK to drop support for everything older than RDNA3. As long as that means that all RDNA3/4 generation GPUs are supported it would still be better than the status quo. 5 6 replies Show 1 previous reply IMbackK The technical reason for this is: some chips of one generation have different instructions (like gfx803 and gfx802) some chips of one generation have different numbers of registers (like gfx11 variants) rocm shares llvm targets with games, for games it is useful to compile a shader per GPU chip, since the compiler can do some extra optimizations knowing cache sizes and cu counts and game shaders are jit anyhow so the nummber of llvm targets dosent matter. 1,2 are actual isa differences that mean that code compiled for one really wont work on the other gpu 3 is weaker as the rocm runtime could just know that various gfxXXXX are compatable and use the code objects for the closest compatable isa, this is most keenly felt with gfx103x as all gfx103x are isa compatable. The same is true of several gfx90x variants. Over all rocm for technical reasons (like the limit of shared objects to 2GB) cant realistically support all chips in the official binaries (but can and mostly dose in source) until amd finishes work on gfxX-generic targets and the amdgcn spriv ir flavor. Even then, the lower tier of devices suported by amdgcnspirv or the generic targets will have worse performance. 2 grigorig Regarding 1 and 2, these are just variants and can easily be treated as separate architectures. The actual differences are small as far as maintenance of the stack is required. I really don't see a problem here. Essentially it's the same for 3. You might have to compile a bunch of different variants, but you can live with that. And for many use cases you don't need compatibility for everything on the binary level anyway. But well, this is a self-inflicted problem. CUDA for instance has been using an IR (PTX) from the very start. 1 IMbackK Without an ir/-generic they cant support all the variants in one fat binary (as stated there is a limit of 2GB object size in linux/x86-64 that is based on limitations in the x86-64 isa) They could compile different separate rocm versions for various sets of isas, but this would also cause other issues, like makeing using gpus with different isas in the same system impossible in the processes. The only real way out of this is an ir, which there is work on. Element115sw What you are looking for is that ROCm targets PM4. But AFAIK that would mean a complete refactoring of ROCm. grigorig PM4 is the format used by the command processor(s), used for submitting jobs and operations to the GPU on a high level. That is a completely different layer compared to the compute units. Yes, introducing an IR is a lot of work. But it is basically inevitable. Given that there is and always has been a lot of churn with GPU architectures (plus variants), it was crazy to not use an IR in ROCm from the very start. MrUhu I haven't taken a deep dive into why ROCm isn't working with Ollama on my 7940HS. But given the poll: Is AMD seriously not even supporting their AI MAX PRO ULTRA (did I mention AI?) APUs with ROCm? What a shame. IMHO at least the support should reach down to the oldest APU with an NPU everything else is ridiculous. 1 1 reply lhl Well the interesting thing there is that the NPUs don't have anything to do with ROCm. They have a separate XDNA driver and a completely separate software stack called RyzenAI. My understanding is that since the NPUs are basically Xilinx ASICs and since as we’re discussing ROCm doesn’t officially support any APU GPUs, NPU support in ROCm is an even further reach. 1 Darkbloodking00 A complete RDNA3 support on Linux would be nice since your cards are advertised as having AI capabilities more than a year but lack the official software support on GPUs like NAVI33. AI research is mainly done on Linux, supporting non high end RDNA3 GPUs only on Windows for entertainment purposes is absurd. 4 0 replies mf-in-mun AMD is announcing some really cool new hardware in 2025 (Ryzen 9 AI MAX+ 395) with RDNA 3+, up to 128GB RAM (capable of assigning 96GB to the iGPU?).

It's fundamentally broken by compiling to hardware specific code instead of CUDA's RTX, so it will always be plagued with this issue of not supporting all cards, and even if a certain GPU is supported today they can stop supporting it next version. It has happened, it will continue happen. It's also a strange value proposition. If I'm a programmer in some super computer facility and my boss has bought a new CDNA based computer, fine, I'll write AMD specific code for it. Otherwise why should I? If I want to write proprietary GPU code I'll probably use the de facto industry standard from the industry giant and pick CUDA. AMD could be collaborating with Intel and a myriad of other companies and organizations and focus on a good open cross platform GPU programming platform. I don't want to have to think about who makes my GPU! I recently switched from an Intel CPU to an AMD, obviously to problem. If I had to get new software written for AMD processors I would have just bought a new Intel, even though AMD are leading in performance at the moment. Even Windows on ARM seems to work ok, because most things aren't written in x86 assembly anymore. Get behind SYCL, stop with the platform specific compilation nonsense, and start supporting consumer GPUs on Windows. If you provide a good base the rest of the software community will build on top. This should have been done ten years ago. reply frognumber 2 hours agoparentAgreed. Honestly, the problem isn't just which devices, but even more so, this (from the page, not your comment): > No guarantees of future support but we will try hard to add support. During the Great GPU Shortage, I bought an AMD RX5xx card for ML work. It was explicitly advertised to work with ROCm. Within a couple of months, AMD dropped ROCm support. EOLing an actively-sold product from being used for an advertised purpose within the warranty period was, if I understand consumer protection laws in my state correctly, fraud. There was no support from either the card vendor (MSI). No support from AMD. No support from the reseller. Short of small claims, which was not worth it, there was no recourse. This is on a long list of issues AMD needs to sort out to be a credible player in this space: * Those are the kinds of experiences which cause people to drop a vendor and not look back. AMD needs to either support cards forever, or at the very least, have an advertised expiration date (like Chromebooks and Android phones). * Broad support is helpful from a consumer perspective from the simply pragmatic point of view that only a tiny fraction of the population has the time to read online forums, footnotes, or fine print. People should be able to buy a card on Amazon, at Best Buy, and Microcenter, and expect things to Just Work. * Being able to plan is essential for enterprise use. I can't build a system around AMD if AMD might stop supporting their platform on 0 days notice, and the next day, there might be a security exploit which requires a version bump. I'm hoping Intel gets their act together here, since NVidia needs a credible competitor. I've given up on AMD. reply magic_at_nodai 35 minutes agoparentprevPTX does provide a low level machine abstraction. However you still target some version of hardware ( https://arnon.dk/matching-sm-architectures-arch-and-gencode-... ). However a lot of software effort has gone into it to make it look and work seamlessly. Though AMD doesn't have the same \"virtual ISA\" as PTX right now there are increasing levels of such abstraction available in compiled flows with MLIR / Linalg etc. Those are higher level and can be compiled / jitted in realtime to obviate the need for a low level virtual ISA. reply danjl 2 hours agoparentprevWe already fought and lost this battle with 3D APIs for GPUs.

Lisa Su hasn't been shy about AMD being all about partnering with large partners who can move volume. My interpretation of this is AMD prefers dealing with Sony, Microsoft, hyperscalers, and HPC builders, then possibly tier II OEMs. Small startups are probably much further down the line, close to consumers at the tail end of AMD's attention queue. I don't like it as a consumer, but it seems like a sound strategy since the partners will shoulder most of the software effort, which is a weakness AMD has against Nvidia. They can focus on cranking out ok-to-great hardware at more-than-ok prices and build up a warchest for future investments, and who knows when this hype bubble will burst and take VC dollars with it, or someone invents an architecture that's less demanding on compute (if you're more optimistic) reply Paradigma11 9 hours agorootparentAMD owes us (its customers) a lot for all the empty and broken promises on this over the many many years and hardware generations. reply roenxi 13 hours agorootparentprevSure.

For his projects, I think it's important to look at what he's done that's cool (eg, reversing 7900XTX [2], creating a user-space driver that completely bypasses AMD drivers for compute [3]) and separating it from his (super cringe) social media postings/self-hype. Still, at the end of the day, here's hoping that someone at AMD realizes that having terrible consumer and workstation support will basically continue to be a huge albatross/handicap it cuts them off basically all academic/research development (almost every single ML library and technique you can name/used in production is CUDA first because of this) and the non-hyperscaler enterprise market as well. Any dev can get a PO for a $500 Nvidia GPU (or has one on their workstation laptop already). What's the pathway for ROCm?

My strong impression is that the ROCm codebase is simply much too large for AMD's dev resources. You're trying to race NVidia on their turf with less resources. It's brave, but foolish.

The GitHub discussion page in the title lists RX 6800 (and a bunch of RX 7xxx GPUs) as supported, and some lower-end RX 6xxx ones as supported for runtime. The same comment also links to a page on the AMD website for a \"compatibility matrix\" [1]. That page only shows RX 7900 variants as supported on the consumer Radeon tab. On the workstation side, Radeon Pro W6800 and some W7xxx cards are listed as supported. It also suggests to see the \"Use ROCm on Radeon GPU documentation\" page [2] if using ROCm on Radeon or Radeon Pro cards. That link leads to a page for \"compatibility matrices\" again. If you click the link for Linux compatibility, you get a page on \"Linux support matrices by ROCm version\" [3]. That \"by ROCm version\" page literally only has a subsection for ROCm 6.2.3. It only lists RX 7900 and Pro W7xxx cards as supported. No mention of W6800. (The page does have an unintuitively placed \"Version List\" link through which you can find docs for ROCm 5.7 [4]. Those older docs are no more useful than the 6.2.3 ones.) Is RX 6800 supported? Or W6800? Even the amd.com pages seem to contradict each other on the latter. Maybe the pages on the AMD site only list official production support or something. In any case it's confusing as hell.

For the 6700, it's a single row that has a green check for \"runtime\" and a red x for \"HIP SDK\". For the 5700 card, it's somebody in the peanut gallery saying \"don't forget about us!\". HIP is the c++ \"flavor\" that can compile down to work on amd _and_ nvidia gpus. If the 6700 has support for the \"runtime\" but not HIP ... what does that even mean for me? And as you pointed out, the 6800 series card has green checks for both so that means it's fully supported? But ... it's not listed on AMD's site?!

But that's not going to happen. By the time an (consumer) AMD device is supported by ROCm it'll only have a few years of ROCm support left before support is removed. Lifespan of support for AMD cards with ROCm is very short. You end up having to use Vulkan which is not optimized, of course, and a bit slower. I once bought an AMD GPU 2 years after release and 1 year after I bought it ROCm support was dropped. reply slavik81 22 hours agoparentFWIW, every ROCm library currently in the Debian 13 'main' and Ubuntu 24.04 'universe' repository has been built for and tested on every discrete consumer GPU architecture since Vega. Not every package is available that way, but the ones that are have been tested on and work on Vega 10, Vega 20, RDNA 1, 2 and 3. Note that these are not the packages distributed by AMD. They are the packages in the OS repositories. Not all the ROCm packages are there, but most of them are. The biggest downside is that some of them are a little old and don't have all the latest performance optimizations for RDNA 3. Those operating systems will be around for the next decade, so that should at least provide one option for users of older hardware. reply buildbot 20 hours agorootparentPackages existing and the software actually working are very different things. You can run rocm on unsupported GPUs like a 780m, but as soon as you hit an issue you are out of luck. And you’ll hit an issue. For example, my 780m gets 1-2 inferences from llama.cpp before dropping off the bus due to a segfault in the driver. It’s a bad enough lockup that linux can’t cleanly shutdown and will hang under hard rebooted. reply slavik81 20 hours agorootparentThe 780m is an integrated GPU. I specified discrete GPUs because that's what I have tested and can confirm will work. I have dozens of different AMD GPUs and I personally host most of the Debian ROCm Team's continuous integration servers. Over the past year, I have worked together with other members of the Debian project to ensure that every potentially affected ROCm library is tested on every discrete consumer AMD GPU architecture since Vega whenever a new version of a package is uploaded to Debian. FWIW, Framework Computers donated a few laptops to Debian last year, which I plan to use to enable the 780m too. I just haven't had the time yet.

I'd also spin up a big research group to further fuel the CUDA pipeline for hardware, software, and application areas. Which is exactly what NVIDIA seems to be doing. AMD's ROCm software group seems far behind, is probably understaffed, and probably is paid a fraction of what NVIDIA pays its CUDA software groups. AMD also has to catch up with NVlink and Spectrum-X (and/or InfiniBand.) AMD's main leverage point is its CPUs, and its raw GPU hardware isn't bad, but there is a long way to go in terms of GPU software ecosystem and interconnect. reply omcnoe 12 hours agoparentprevI've never understood why they have such a fractured approach to software:hardware support. I remember reading and writing comments about this on hn nearly a decade ago now. It's a long time to keep making the same mistake. They had the exact same kind of support issues back in the OpenCL days, where they didn't manage to provide cross platform, cross card support for same versions of the platform. I have never been able to reconcile it with their turnaround and newfound competence on the CPU side. reply almostgotcaught 19 hours agoparentprev> I’m constantly baffled and amused on why AMD keeps majorly failing at this. i wonder if you've considered the possibility that there's some component/dimension of this that you're simply unaware of? that it's not as straightforward as whatever reductive mental model you have? is that even like within the universe of possibilities? reply rcxdude 18 hours agorootparentI mean, they did say they were baffled. I'd say that probably includes \"I don't know\" reply nsriv 16 hours agoprevReally hoping for support for an AMD Radeon Pro W5700 I have kicking around. reply nicman23 7 hours agoprevi really need amd to make an apu with eight channels and ddr5 reply jms55 17 hours agoprev [–] As someone from the rendering side of GPU stuff, what exactly is the point of ROCm/CUDA? We already have Vulkan and SPIR-V with vendor extensions as a mostly-portable GPU API, what do these APIs do differently? Furthermore, don't people use PyTorch (and other libraries? I'm not really clear on what ML tooling is like, it feels like there's hundreds of frameworks and I haven't seen any simplified list explaining the differences. I would love a TLDR for this) and not ROCm/CUDA directly anyways? So the main draw can't be ergonomics, at least. reply pjmlp 10 hours agoparentVulkan doesn't do C++ as shading language for example, there are some backend attempts to target SPIR-V, but it still is early days and nowhere close of having the IDE integration, graphical debugging tools and rendering libraries that CUDA enjoys. Examples of rendering solutions using CUDA, https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/solutions/... https://home.otoy.com/render/octane-render/ It is definitely ergonomics and tooling. reply JonChesterfield 8 hours agoparentprevCuda the language is an antique dialect of C++ with a vectorisation hack. It's essentially what you get if you take an auto-vectoriser and turn off the correctness precondition, defining the correct semantics to be that which you get if you ignore dataflow. This was considered easier to program with than vector types and intrinsics. Cuda the ecosystem is a massive pile of libraries for lots of different domains written to make it easier to use GPUs to do useful work. This is perhaps something of a judgement on how easy it is to write efficient programs using cuda. ROCm contains a language called HIP which behaves pretty similarly to Cuda. OpenCL is the same sort of thing as well. It also contains a lot of library code, in this case because people using Cuda use those libraries and don't want to reimplement them. That's a bit of a challenge because nvidia spent 20 years writing these libraries and is still writing more, yet amd is expected to produce the same set in an order of magnitude less time. If you want to use a GPU to do maths, you don't actually need any of this stuff. You need the GPU, something to feed it data (e.g. a linux host) and some assembly. Or LLVM IR / freestanding c++ if you prefer. This whole cuda / rocm thing really is intended to make them easier to program. reply currymj 14 hours agoparentprev [–] users mainly use PyTorch and Jax and these days rarely write CUDA code. however separately, installing drivers and the correct CUDA/CuDNN libraries is the responsibility of the user. this is sometimes slightly finicky. with ROCm, the problem is that 1) PyTorch/Jax don't support it very well, for whatever reason which may be partly to do with the quality of ROCm frustrating PyTorch/Jax devs, 2) installing drivers and libraries is a nightmare. it's all poorly documented and constantly broken. 3) hardware support is very spotty and confusing. reply jms55 13 hours agorootparent [–] PyTorch and Jax, good to know. Why do they have ROCm/CUDA backends in the first place though? Why not just Vulkan? reply currymj 2 hours agorootparentit's an interesting question. the unhelpful answer is Vulkan didn't exist when Tensorflow, PyTorch (and Torch, its Lua-based predecessor) were taking off and building GPU support. Apparently PyTorch did at one point prototype a Vulkan backend but abandoned it. My own experience is that half-assed knowledge of C/C++, and a basic idea of how GPUs are architected, is enough to write a decent custom CUDA kernel. It's not that hard to do. No idea how I would get started with Vulkan, but I assume it would require a lot more ceremony, and that writing compute shaders is less intuitive. there is also definitely a \"worse is better\" effect in this area. there are some big projects that tried to be super general and cover all use cases and hardware. but a time-crunched PhD student or IC just needs something they can use now. (even Tensorflow, which was relatively popular compared to some other projects, fell victim to this.) George Hotz seems like a weird guy in some respects, but he's 100% right that in ML it is hard enough to get anything working at all under perfect conditions, you don't need fighting with libraries and build tools on top of that, or the mental overhead of learning how to use this beautiful general API that supports 47 platforms you don't care about. except also \"worse is better is better\" e.g. because they were willing to make breaking changes and sacrifice some generality, Jax was able to build something really cool and innovative. reply omcnoe 12 hours agorootparentprevCUDA has first mover advantage, and provides a simpler higher level compute API for library maintainers compared to Vulkan. reply pjmlp 10 hours agorootparentprev [–] Vulkan doesn't do C++, rather GLSL and HLSL, nor has good tooling for the few prototypes that target SPIR-V. reply Consider applying for YC's Spring batch!

    "originBody": "Ruff DocsPlayground An extremely fast Python linter and code formatter, written in Rust. Linting the CPython codebase from scratch. ⚡ 10-100x faster than existing linters (like Flake8) and formatters (like Black) 🐍 Installable via pip 🛠 pyproject.toml support 🤝 Python 3.13 compatibility ⚖ Drop-in parity with Flake8, isort, and Black 📦 Built-in caching, to avoid re-analyzing unchanged files 🔧 Fix support, for automatic error correction (e.g., automatically remove unused imports) 📏 Over 800 built-in rules, with native re-implementations of popular Flake8 plugins, like flake8-bugbear ⌨ First-party editor integrations for VS Code and more 🌎 Monorepo-friendly, with hierarchical and cascading configuration Ruff aims to be orders of magnitude faster than alternative tools while integrating more functionality behind a single, common interface. Ruff can be used to replace Flake8 (plus dozens of plugins), Black, isort, pydocstyle, pyupgrade, autoflake, and more, all while executing tens or hundreds of times faster than any individual tool. Ruff is extremely actively developed and used in major open-source projects like: Apache Airflow Apache Superset FastAPI Hugging Face Pandas SciPy ...and many more. Ruff is backed by Astral. Read the launch post, or the original project announcement. Testimonials Sebastián Ramírez, creator of FastAPI: Ruff is so fast that sometimes I add an intentional bug in the code just to confirm it's actually running and checking the code. Nick Schrock, founder of Elementl, co-creator of GraphQL: Why is Ruff a gamechanger? Primarily because it is nearly 1000x faster. Literally. Not a typo. On our largest module (dagster itself, 250k LOC) pylint takes about 2.5 minutes, parallelized across 4 cores on my M1. Running ruff against our entire codebase takes .4 seconds. Bryan Van de Ven, co-creator of Bokeh, original author of Conda: Ruff is ~150-200x faster than flake8 on my machine, scanning the whole repo takes ~0.2s instead of ~20s. This is an enormous quality of life improvement for local dev. It's fast enough that I added it as an actual commit hook, which is terrific. Timothy Crosley, creator of isort: Just switched my first project to Ruff. Only one downside so far: it's so fast I couldn't believe it was working till I intentionally introduced some errors. Tim Abbott, lead developer of Zulip: This is just ridiculously fast... ruff is amazing. Table of Contents For more, see the documentation.

Ruff can also be used as a GitHub Action via ruff-action: name: Ruff on: [ push, pull_request ] jobs: ruff: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: uses: actions/checkout@v4 uses: astral-sh/ruff-action@v3 Configuration Ruff can be configured through a pyproject.toml, ruff.toml, or .ruff.toml file (see: Configuration, or Settings for a complete list of all configuration options). If left unspecified, Ruff's default configuration is equivalent to the following ruff.toml file: # Exclude a variety of commonly ignored directories. exclude = [ \".bzr\", \".direnv\", \".eggs\", \".git\", \".git-rewrite\", \".hg\", \".ipynb_checkpoints\", \".mypy_cache\", \".nox\", \".pants.d\", \".pyenv\", \".pytest_cache\", \".pytype\", \".ruff_cache\", \".svn\", \".tox\", \".venv\", \".vscode\", \"__pypackages__\", \"_build\", \"buck-out\", \"build\", \"dist\", \"node_modules\", \"site-packages\", \"venv\", ] # Same as Black. line-length = 88 indent-width = 4 # Assume Python 3.9 target-version = \"py39\" [lint] # Enable Pyflakes (`F`) and a subset of the pycodestyle (`E`) codes by default. select = [\"E4\", \"E7\", \"E9\", \"F\"] ignore = [] # Allow fix for all enabled rules (when `--fix`) is provided. fixable = [\"ALL\"] unfixable = [] # Allow unused variables when underscore-prefixed. dummy-variable-rgx = \"^(_+|(_+[a-zA-Z0-9_]*[a-zA-Z0-9]+?))$\" [format] # Like Black, use double quotes for strings. quote-style = \"double\" # Like Black, indent with spaces, rather than tabs. indent-style = \"space\" # Like Black, respect magic trailing commas. skip-magic-trailing-comma = false # Like Black, automatically detect the appropriate line ending. line-ending = \"auto\" Note that, in a pyproject.toml, each section header should be prefixed with tool.ruff. For example, [lint] should be replaced with [tool.ruff.lint]. Some configuration options can be provided via dedicated command-line arguments, such as those related to rule enablement and disablement, file discovery, and logging level: ruff check select F401 select F403 quiet The remaining configuration options can be provided through a catch-all config argument: ruff check config \"lint.per-file-ignores = {'some_file.py' = ['F841']}\" To opt in to the latest lint rules, formatter style changes, interface updates, and more, enable preview mode by setting preview = true in your configuration file or passing preview on the command line. Preview mode enables a collection of unstable features that may change prior to stabilization. See ruff help for more on Ruff's top-level commands, or ruff help check and ruff help format for more on the linting and formatting commands, respectively. Rules Ruff supports over 800 lint rules, many of which are inspired by popular tools like Flake8, isort, pyupgrade, and others. Regardless of the rule's origin, Ruff re-implements every rule in Rust as a first-party feature. By default, Ruff enables Flake8's F rules, along with a subset of the E rules, omitting any stylistic rules that overlap with the use of a formatter, like ruff format or Black. If you're just getting started with Ruff, the default rule set is a great place to start: it catches a wide variety of common errors (like unused imports) with zero configuration. Beyond the defaults, Ruff re-implements some of the most popular Flake8 plugins and related code quality tools, including: autoflake eradicate flake8-2020 flake8-annotations flake8-async flake8-bandit (#1646) flake8-blind-except flake8-boolean-trap flake8-bugbear flake8-builtins flake8-commas flake8-comprehensions flake8-copyright flake8-datetimez flake8-debugger flake8-django flake8-docstrings flake8-eradicate flake8-errmsg flake8-executable flake8-future-annotations flake8-gettext flake8-implicit-str-concat flake8-import-conventions flake8-logging flake8-logging-format flake8-no-pep420 flake8-pie flake8-print flake8-pyi flake8-pytest-style flake8-quotes flake8-raise flake8-return flake8-self flake8-simplify flake8-slots flake8-super flake8-tidy-imports flake8-todos flake8-type-checking flake8-use-pathlib flynt (#2102) isort mccabe pandas-vet pep8-naming pydocstyle pygrep-hooks pylint-airflow pyupgrade tryceratops yesqa For a complete enumeration of the supported rules, see Rules.

Acknowledgements Ruff's linter draws on both the APIs and implementation details of many other tools in the Python ecosystem, especially Flake8, Pyflakes, pycodestyle, pydocstyle, pyupgrade, and isort. In some cases, Ruff includes a \"direct\" Rust port of the corresponding tool. We're grateful to the maintainers of these tools for their work, and for all the value they've provided to the Python community. Ruff's formatter is built on a fork of Rome's rome_formatter, and again draws on both API and implementation details from Rome, Prettier, and Black. Ruff's import resolver is based on the import resolution algorithm from Pyright. Ruff is also influenced by a number of tools outside the Python ecosystem, like Clippy and ESLint.

I don’t think experienced python folks realize how much the flexible tooling slows people down, and creates friction for adopters. Setting up my project I tried 3 environment managers, 2 type checkers, 3 formatters/linters, 3 packagers/dependancy/project managers. I know this is kinda the n+1 issue where astral is just adding another. But it feels like a complete and well designed stack, not a box of parts encouraging me to build my own. Reminds me a bit of go tooling. I am a convert. I’ll happily jump on their type checker and packager when ready. reply zahlman 12 hours agoparent>Setting up my project I tried 3 environment managers, 2 type checkers, 3 formatters/linters, 3 packagers/dependancy/project managers. I've been using Python for right about 20 years now. I've been through various prior iterations of the \"standard\" packaging tools. But I've never found myself wanting a type checker, formatter or linter; and aside from a brief period with Poetry (in which I used barely any of its functionality), I've had no interest in dependency management tools, either. What I have found myself wanting is fixes for the problems in Pip. Different people work on different kinds of projects, and approach the language differently, and have radically different needs as a result. reply pansa2 11 hours agorootparent> I've never found myself wanting a type checker Do you still write type hints, but not check them? Or just use dynamic typing as in Python 2? Actually, I guess the first case is really type-hints-as-comments, so isn't substantially different from the second. > I've been using Python for right about 20 years now Either way, I've found it quite common among long-time Python users to stick with Python's traditional dynamic typing, whereas newcomers to the language tend to really dislike it in favour of strict static typing. (One exception is GvR himself, who seems to be very pro-type-checking.) As the second group continue to add increasingly complex typing features to the language, I wonder if Python is becoming less desirable for those in the first group. reply zahlman 5 hours agorootparent>Do you still write type hints, but not check them? Or just use dynamic typing I occasionally write them as a form of documentation when it would be more concise than explaining in prose. There is nothing specifically 2.x-style about making use of dynamic typing it's a core property of the language. While 3.0 introduced the annotation feature, it wasn't even specifically intended for typing (https://peps.python.org/pep-3107/) and standard library support wasn't added until 3.5 (https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html). >As the second group continue to add increasingly complex typing features to the language, I wonder if Python is becoming less desirable for those in the first group. Some new changes have been missteps, in my view. There's still nobody forcing my hand when it comes to typing, really; I just shake my head when I see people trying to make it do things it really wasn't designed for. On the other hand, there are definitely things I'd love to see improved about the language. reply ubercore 11 hours agorootparentprevWorking on a team in a larger python application, type checkers and linters are such a time saver. It's so nice not to think about how I'd like to format my code any longer. We've made some tweaks to our ruff rules to suit the team's opinion, and now even when I don't _love_ the way it formats a particular part of code, I just move on and get something productive done instead. And type checking is so great for both preventing bugs (which it does all the time) and self-documenting code. Can't recommend them enough. reply Dries007 10 hours agorootparentIt takes out so much frustration too. No more nitpicking about style/... in merge requests, the pre-commit hook will fix it and CI will catch it if you don't. The more of this you can automate, the more you get to spend on \"real work\". reply E_Bfx 10 hours agorootparentprevIn my organisation, some co-workers used to write def func(*args,**kwargs) all the time. That was so tiring to look for what you should put as argument. Type checking is mandatory for well organized large project.* reply scosman 6 hours agorootparentprevYes yes yes. I have my own formatting preferences, but my desire to not have to think about them or go to meetings debating them is much much greater. reply emblaegh 10 hours agorootparentprevI’ve been using it for around the same time, and never cared much about formatters. Linting is useful but wouldn’t call it essential. But type checking is a non negotiable on any project I lead. It’s not perfect by any means, but beats having to crawl my way through a call stack trying to figure out what the hell a function is expected to take and why it’s getting a None instead. I have yet to find a single drawback of adopting mypy (or similars) that isn’t completely eclipsed by the benefits. reply matsemann 6 hours agorootparentprev> I've been using Python for right about 20 years now. That's actually the biggest issue I've seen when a bit back joined a python-shop. Everyone there had mostly done python their whole careers. Fell in love with language during studies, then applied for jobs using that language. Stuck in the old ways, perhaps python felt nimble and nice 20 years ago compared to other things at the time, but with little progress (from its users) in using modern tooling it felt so arcane coming to this shop. And it wasn't the job's fault, it was a state of the art python stack, just a decade behind what other languages have. reply coldtea 10 hours agorootparentprev>I've never found myself wanting a type checker, formatter or linter; I guess that makes one of us. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fox_and_the_Grapes reply GasVeteran 9 hours agorootparentThe point he is making is that a lot of stuff that you are told you need. You actually don't. Especially if you are working by yourself or in a very small team. Getting stuff working is much more important. I'd rather people concentrate on stuff like CI, Unit Tests and Deployments. reply ben_w 55 minutes agorootparentI've seen plenty of projects where people had that attitude except the thing they saw as time-wasting was the CI and Unit Tests. Those projects weren't even dumpster fires. You can, genuinely, do without all of this stuff — but they're just helpful tools, not silver bullets or the only way to do things, but helpful. reply zahlman 5 hours agorootparentprevNo. On the occasions where I've tried to use an IDE for other programming languages, I've felt like it got in my way more than it helped; and Python is if anything designed more for IDE-less development (due to its overall elegance), and opposed to straightforward IDE guidance (due to its dynamicity). reply kstrauser 15 hours agoparentprevI’ve been writing Python for 25 years and I love love love ruff and uv and friends. reply coldtea 10 hours agoparentprevExperienced Python folks have Stockholm Syndrome about its tooling, even rejoice at all the \"options\" for things like dependency managers. reply kibwen 14 hours agoparentprev> I know this is kinda the n+1 issue where astral is just adding another.

By this point I'm so annoyed whenever anyone links it that I kinda just wish Randall would take it down. reply earnestinger 7 hours agorootparent> it's also how progress is made Introducing n+1 solution/ standard may be the necessary cost of making progress, but it is possible to incur that cost without gaining anything (at the extreme, trolling is fun activity with net negative on bigger scale) reply tubthumper8 14 hours agorootparentprevYeah, and that comic is about standards anyways, not tools, so it's doubly annoying when it's linked out of context reply giancarlostoro 13 hours agoparentprevI used to use any standard editor but these days I use PyCharm or Visual Studio (not Code) otherwise, I just use Sublime Text or any adjacent reasonable editor. Elementary OS has the nicest editor that other Distros have not snatched up yet not sure why. Its fast, and fits the bill where KATE and Sublime Text are for me. reply jmorenoamor 13 hours agoparentprevI started with python dependency management just executing pip install and thinking wow that's cool. No envs, no linters or formatters. The point is, if you are learning to code, you can skip nearly all the ecosystem tools. Their need will arise when the time comes. reply scosman 6 hours agorootparentYeah but a global environment is a really bad idea. It’s going to trip up those beginners when second project that requires a different version of pytorch. reply nosefurhairdo 13 hours agoparentprevI primarily work on typescript projects, little bit of go. Never enjoyed working with python until I found uv. Glad to see folks rally around astral's tools. reply ubercore 11 hours agoparentprev`uv` really is amazing. reply globular-toast 9 hours agoparentprevPeople just need a mentor. Could you imagine getting into plumbing and just trying to work out what kind of tools you need by looking at the pipes? Of course not. You'd learn from someone else. reply scosman 6 hours agorootparentI’ve been coding for 25 years. I don’t need a mentor. I want nice tools when I try yet another language. reply atkailash 13 hours agoparentprevThis is why I tried ruff, managing the different settings and stuff and an experienced Python person was getting tedious. Now I have one tool. I moved to poetry for things a bit ago until I found out about uv recently, it’s so fast I thought it didn’t even do what it asked a couple times. reply danpalmer 16 hours agoprevI'm a little sad that Ruff took off as a re-implementation of a whole bunch of work that was already done, rather than as a project to improve the work that was already done. It was nice to be able to write little extra linters or flake8 plugins in the language I was linting. Plus decades of effort had gone into making those plugins pretty great, finding the right separation of linting codes so that the right things could be linted/ignored per codebase. I understand why they did it, and they have done it remarkably well, but \"rewrite it from scratch\" is almost never the best answer and part of me wonders if this result could have been even better achieved another way. reply thrdbndndn 16 hours agoparentI'm also sad but from a different perspective. If something can be rewritten from scratch fairly quickly and ends up being much faster, it makes you wonder what we (the general “we”) might have done “wrong” with the “decades of effort” before. To be clear: there was nothing wrong with the old toolchains (hence the quotes). And of course, Ruff/uv can do what they do because they build on all that earlier knowledge. My point is just that sometimes it's easier to start over than to fix the old, and that fact itself feels kind of sad to me. reply nicoburns 14 hours agorootparent> If something can be rewritten from scratch fairly quickly and ends up being much faster, it makes you wonder what we (the general “we”) might have done “wrong” with the “decades of effort” before. I think the impact of Rust (and Go) shouldn't be underestimated here. Prior to these languages if you wanted fast runtime you were either using C or C++ with all their associated footguns, tricky build systems, and poor support for exposing and consuming libraries. Or you were using something like Java or C# which meant managing another runtime just for tools, which is especially bad for something like UV which manages runtimes imagine if you were using a python tool to manage your Java versions and a Java tool to manage you Python versions, it would be a mess! With both Go and Rust you have fast languages without memory safety issues that compile to a single, easily-installable binary and have a broad ecosystem of libraries available that mean that half the time you don't even need to write any difficult code and can just glue some modules together, and the other half of the time you only need to write the code you actually want to write and not all the support code for general pupose stuff like reading config files, file watching, etc. reply lmm 14 hours agorootparentprev> there was nothing wrong with the old toolchains (hence the quotes). And of course, Ruff/uv can do what they do because they build on all that earlier knowledge I don't think that's true. I think the old toolchains really were bad, partly because the Python community was uniquely resistant to building on what worked in other ecosystems, and uv in particular largely succeeds because it's the first tool in this space to finally just ignore the nonsense that had somehow become accepted wisdom in Python-land and apply a little bit of outside experience. reply zahlman 12 hours agorootparent> I think the old toolchains really were bad, partly because the Python community was uniquely resistant to building on what worked in other ecosystems I mostly attribute it to backwards compatibility concerns (which I in turn attribute to the traumatic 3.x migration). PyPI continued to accept egg uploads until August 2023 (https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/discussions/package-f...). The easy_install program, along the direct command-line use of `setup.py` (as opposed to having Setuptools invoke it behind the scenes), have been deprecated since October 2021 (https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/history.html#v58-3-0); but not only are they still supported, Setuptools can't even remove support for `setup.py test` (as they tried to in 72.0 and immediately reverted https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/4519) without causing major disruption to the ecosystem. One of the packages affected was Requests, which: a) is one of the most downloaded packages on PyPI; b) is pure Python (aside from dependencies) with nothing particular complicated about its metadata (I see no reason it couldn't be done in pyproject.toml and/or setup.cfg); c) wasn't even reliant on that interface to run tests (they use Tox). (For that matter: Requests has been maintained by the PSF since mid-2019 (https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/cgtp87/seems_like_r...) and the problem could have easily been avoided once the deprecation was announced, but nobody did anything about it. The project still defines most of its metadata in `setup.py`; `pyproject.toml` exists but is only used for pytest and isort config, while `setup.cfg` is used for flake8 config and some requirements metadata that's completely redundant with `setup.py`.) A lot of it also just has to do with lack of attention and focus. https://peps.python.org/pep-0427/ (defining the wheel format) was proposed in September 2012, and accepted in February 2013. But Setuptools itself wasn't available as a wheel until November 2013 (https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/history.html#id1646), and in 2017 there were still reports of people having outdated versions of Pip and not being able to install Setuptools from that wheel (https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/history.html#v34-0-0). Setuptools relied on a separate package to actually make wheels until July of last year (https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/history.html#v70-1-0) an effort which was initially proposed in June 2018 (https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/1386). It also took years to notice that Pip and Setuptools had separate implementations for the code that understands the \"tags\" in wheel filenames and factor it out into `packaging` (https://github.com/pypa/packaging/pull/156). reply thrdbndndn 9 hours agorootparent> Requests I hate to say it, but the development of Requests itself has stagnated and really needs some attention. The most notable fiasco recently was the introduction of significant changes to TLS/SSL in version 2.32.0 [1][2], which caused widespread breaking issues and even led to a security vulnerability. Attempts to address these problems in versions .2 and .3 introduced new major issues which still exists in current version [3]. A patch to resolve the new issue was provided by one of the core members of the Requests project as early as June 2024 [4], but for some reason, nothing has been done about it, despite repeated pushes from the community.

Upgrades were super painful with them split into a dozen separate packages, I routinely ran into incompatibilities and had to pin to specific versions to deal with transitive dependencies.

From a skim it seems like a lot of the missing features would be covered by a type checker?

The strong push to always contribute to the existing projects rather than starting new ones in the Python community is what caused the previous subpar state of tooling. I think Astral is also picking a good middle-ground where they still aim to build as much as possible on existing Python standards (and help contributing to new ones), so it's still building on what has been done in the past. reply VagabundoP 12 hours agoparentprevThere was probably a lot of engineering that went into those designs and that took time.

Overcoming the inertia and ways of doing things, or proposing widespread changes, often doesn't go down well with existing maintainers – for very valid reasons. I probably wouldn't want to go into the grep project and suggest rearchitecting it, and I can see why the Ruff developers didn't want to go into projects like Flake8 and Pylint to do the same. But that doesn't stop me from feeling that there were things lost in this process and wishing for a better outcome. reply tialaramex 9 hours agorootparentprevA huge advantage of going your own way is that you don't need to address an audience you think are just wrong. When this happens periodically (rather than, every other week) you also get the original GNU advantage which is you can revisit an old tool but knowing what you know now, for example today \"everybody\" has DVCS, and so ripgrep checks for the .gitignore file. reply JelteF 16 hours agorootparentprevWait... Did you misunderstand this comment? Or are you saying grep caught up with ripgrep now? reply burntsushi 16 hours agorootparentI'm agreeing with them. Some folks told me I should have improved grep instead of building my own thing. reply oguz-ismail 16 hours agorootparentprevAnd you think you've done it? reply danpalmer 16 hours agorootparentprevYeah it's somewhat ideological, I think open source software is better for society when built as a community project than built and controlled by a VC funded company. I don't think you could get flake8 to be as fast as Ruff, but I think you could improve it to be within an order of magnitude, and honestly that's plenty good enough. There are a lot of low hanging fruit, particularly around caching. I'd push back on there being no chance of being \"as good as\" Ruff, because \"good\" is not just speed. Ruff is _not complete_, if you want all the features and linters, you still need Flake8, or you have to sacrifice some. It's also not publicly extensible, and not written in Python, both of which are fair choices but I think deviate from the ideal scenario here. reply Onavo 16 hours agoparentprevBlame Guido. Until recently when he was bought out by Microsoft, he had been the primary blocker of higher Python performance.

Any opinions about the current state of the art type checker? reply Mehdi2277 16 hours agoparentI'm very happy with pyright. Most bug reports are fixed within a week and new peps/features are added very rapidly usually before pep is accepted (under experimental flag). Enough that I ended up dropping pylint and consider pyright enough for lint purposes as well. The most valuable lints for my work require good multi-file/semantic analysis and pylint had various false positives. Main tradeoff is this only works if your codebase/core dependencies are typed. For a while that was not true and we used pylint + pyright. Eventually most of our code is typed and we added type stubs for our main untyped dependencies. edit: Also on pylint, it did work well mostly. tensorflow was main library that created most false positives. Other thing I found awkward was occasionally pylint produces non-deterministic lints on my codebase. reply optionalsquid 11 hours agoparentprevEveryone is already recommending pyright, but I'll suggest checking the \"based\" community fork: https://github.com/detachhead/basedpyright Besides re-adding features that Microsoft makes exclusive to pylance, it tweaks a number of features that IMO makes pyright work better out the box: https://docs.basedpyright.com/latest/benefits-over-pyright/p... reply orra 9 hours agorootparentThanks for linking this. I wasn't surprised Microsoft made their AI auto completion proprietary (they did similar for C# in VSCode). But it grated me that semantic highlighting wasn't open source. reply neonsunset 6 hours agorootparentWhat did they do for C#? reply dagw 5 hours agorootparentThey added some closed source features to the C# developer extension in VSCode. So anybody using a non-Microsoft fork of VSCode can't use those features. reply neonsunset 5 hours agorootparentIf you are referring to the debugger, they did not \"add\" it it was like that from the start. The C# extension is MIT, but the 'vsdbg' it ships with isn't because it's a debugger Visual Studio uses made into a standalone cross-platform component. You can use an extension fork which swaps it with NetCoreDbg maintained by Samsung instead. This is what VSCodium uses. Also note that both of these essentially consume the debugger API exposed by the runtime itself, you can easily make one yourself in a weekend but no one bothered because there isn't much need for another one. reply dagw 4 hours agorootparentPersonally the thing that annoys me isn't so much the open vs closed source of (parts of) these extensions, but the blocking of using these extensions on VSCode forks. reply neonsunset 4 hours agorootparentExtensions are not blocked. It's the redistribution restriction the 'vsdbg' component specifically comes with. But you can easily use the fork if it's an issue :) reply ducdetronquito 5 hours agoparentprevFirst thanks for mentioning tach, I wished this tool existed for a long time and I'm happy to give in a try in the following days! For typechecker, I also vouch for Pyright which is what we use for all our django backends at work. Just be aware that you will have hard time to typecheck part of your code where you rely heavily on django's magic (magic strings, auto-generated properties/methods, etc...). In these cases, it's sometimes better to avoid these features entirely or accept that some part of your code will not be typechecked. reply rikthevik 3 hours agorootparentI haven't dug into tach yet, but I'm very optimistic on this one. reply __tyler__ 16 hours agoparentprevI have always used MyPy but I have noticed some large open source projects adopt Pyright as of late.

I've used it a few times since then and now I'm a big proponent of using only ruff. I think most of its value comes from: 1. Being fast (or at least fast enough that it's not annoying). 2.

I remember wishing for a 'optimize nothing' or even 'just interpret' mode. Compile times noticably contributing to the feedback loop are a serious killjoy. reply goku12 10 hours agorootparentCompile times are still a bit much, but there are ways around it: The insanely long times are only for the initial build. Further builds are incremental and more tolerable. Compilation errors can be checked using 'cargo check'. It avoids the code generation step that's part of a build. I find myself doing it way more often than builds. So it's a time saver depending on how frequently you use it. You can extend the incremental build mentioned above using sccache [1]. At the minimum, it allows you to share the build cache between all your local projects. So it saves time if your projects or other builds share a lot of common libraries (that's very common in Rust, though). But sccache can go further by using online build caches (for example, using S3) that can be shared between hosts. Finally, sccache also supports distributed builds if you have a few machines sitting idle. (This is like distcc with extra features). [1]: https://github.com/mozilla/sccache reply nicoburns 9 hours agorootparentprevThere have been significant (if not earth shattering) improvements in the compiler itself. But for me at least, the bigger change has been from better hardware. I now have a processor (Apple M1 Pro) that's 10x (multi core) / 2x (single core) faster than the one I had when I first started programming using Rust (intel dual core processor in a 2015 MBP) and that seems to have translated almost perfectly into faster compile times. reply monomial 17 hours agoprevI've been using an amalgamation of pyenv, pip-tools, black, isort, etc. for projects and just gave uv and ruff a try. Wow, it really is fast! Skeptical of anything VC-backed but I'll be keeping my eye on it. reply mhh__ 17 hours agoprevA small boon to it not being in python — it's now decoupled from your python toolchain. reply zahlman 16 hours agoparentThere is no \"coupling\" inherent to native Python tools. They can generally be installed in a separate virtual environment from the one they operate on. For example, with Pip you simply pass the `--python` option to have it install for a different environment you can create your venvs `--without-pip`, and share a copy of Pip across all of them. If you use Pipx, you can expose and use Pipx's vendored Pip for this, as I described in a recent blog post (https://zahlman.github.io/posts/2025/01/07/python-packaging-...). Twine and Build don't care about your project's environment at all Twine uploads a specified file, and Build by default creates a new environment for the build (and even withough build isolation, it only requires your build environment to contain the build backend, and the build environment doesn't have to be the one you use for the rest of development). Setuptools, similarly, either gets installed by the build frontend into an isolated build environment, or can reside in a separate dedicated build environment. It doesn't actually operate on your project's environment it only operates on your project's source tree. reply mhh__ 14 hours agorootparentThat's a lot of words compared to \"Download binary from server. Run it\" reply zahlman 12 hours agorootparentSometimes it takes a lot of words to debunk a misconception. What you initially said didn't have anything to do with setup effort, but also there is quite little setup effort actually described here. reply mhh__ 10 hours agorootparentThere is nothing to debunk, my original comment was correct. It's useful to have tooling that doesn't rely on carting around a bunch of python stuff. reply zahlman 5 hours agorootparentIn that case I have absolutely no idea what point you're trying to make.

Particularly in analytics or scientific computing we've seen minutes versus under a second. Having the tools not require additional/parallel Python dependency management is a plus. Note that we watched these tools for a long time, and jumped in when rye converged with uv. It was promising to see fewer ways to do it. // More on that here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41309072 reply ak217 16 hours agoparentprevI don't know what kinds of codebases you've worked with, but I can tell you that pylint is so far from instant, it became the longest running CI job in multiple reasonably sized codebases I've worked with. Think tens of minutes. Other linters were not much better, until ruff came along. But that's far from the only advantage that ruff brings. There are other issues with what you said, but the biggest one is: you have some strongly worded criticism for a project that has set a new bar for usability and consistency in Python code quality tooling. These tools are developed by humans like you and distributed to you for free with no obligation to use them. No matter how I look at your comment, I don't see how it's helping. reply greatgib 11 hours agorootparentCan you tell us a little bit more about your codebase? I'm curious. Because for it to take tens of minutes, something should be crazy over there. reply zahlman 16 hours agorootparentprevI'm confused: why are you linting code in CI, rather than as a precommit hook? reply ak217 16 hours agorootparentPre-commit hooks are great in small, focused codebases with small, homogeneous teams. In large monorepos with lots of different teams committing, it's impossible to guarantee any kind of consistency in which pre-commit hooks get run, so you need CI to actually enforce the consistency or you'll spend all your time chasing (accidental) violations. reply zahlman 12 hours agorootparent... am I the only one who figures that linting would logically be a very low priority in those circumstances? reply OrderlyTiamat 9 hours agorootparentApparently so. Mind explaining your reasoning? reply kstrauser 15 hours agorootparentprevBecause devs can disable precommit hooks much more easily than they can work around CO. I see precommit hooks as where you avoid the low-hanging fruit, like “is this code actually parsable?” reply sunshowers 15 hours agorootparentprevWell, for one, I use Jujutsu, where commits happen every time you run jj status and traditional notions of pre-commit hooks don't really apply. But also, I think (as a matter of principle) nothing should get in the way of performing commits or amends. reply goku12 10 hours agorootparentDepends on what you're trying to achieve. Jobs like lint checks should ideally be pre-push checks so that the long process doesn't get in the way of commits. But very fast and small checks like warning about trailing whitespaces or ensuring a newline at the end of the file can be done during every commit (even if it was in jujutsu). I would rather not wait till the end to find out. And of course, there are ways to temporarily or permanently disable one or more checks when you absolutely need it. reply sunshowers 1 hour agorootparentMy editor takes care of trailing whitespace and newline termination. I don't think Jujutsu commits should fail on this or fix it every time jj status is run — seems too magical. reply wiredfool 10 hours agorootparentprevBecause commits should be small and fast, and always work, like a save. If you’re running a multi second process during commit it’s going to get ripped out. reply orra 9 hours agorootparentAhah! I worked on a project which used dotnet format in a commit hook. That was a frustrating experience, trying to rebase code. (Unlike most formatters which are instant, dotnet format takes at least half a minute, because it performs a build just to format your code.) reply zahlman 5 hours agorootparentprevMy thinking is that the linter only has to operate on the code that was actually checked in. And just how many things are you checking about it, anyway? reply rmwaite 17 hours agoparentprevI have issues with some of Black’s formatting decisions but I’ve also suffered from inconsistent formatting and there is no question in my mind that consistent formatting that I find ugly sometimes is 1000% better than the alternative. And after so many years of dealing with it it’s so refreshing to just “give up” and let the formatter win. reply kstrauser 15 hours agorootparentSame here. I appreciate that Black annoyed everyone on our team about the same amount but in different ways. From the instant we added it, stupid style arguments completely disappeared. Know what I care about more than Black making my own code look less pretty? It making my coworker’s code look less horrid.

If it did affect people equally, it would be great. Unfortunately, spaces for indentation is an accessibility issue and the Black maintainers are hostile to making this configurable. Normally I am in agreement about minimising configurability, but this isn’t a matter of taste, it is making the Python ecosystem more difficult for some disabled people to participate in. https://github.com/psf/black/issues/2798 Fortunately, Ruff makes this configurable, so you don’t have to choose between autoformatting and accessibility any more. reply sunshowers 17 hours agoparentprevPersonally, I think excellence is a virtue in tooling in and of itself. The Python world just hasn't experienced this kind of excellence before. reply optionalsquid 11 hours agoparentprev> But all of that personal opinion set aside, what triggers my initial statement is that so many persons are so excited to run to use Ruff because... \"It is so fast\"... when I'm quite sure most of them would never notice any real speed difference with their modest codebase. I work on a fairly modest code base (22k lines of python according to sloccount), and I'm seeing a significant decrease in runtime between `pylint src/ tests/` with default parameters and `ruff check src/ tests/` with the majority of checks enabled. More specifically, I'm seeing a decrease from 18 second to less than a tenth of a second with a hot FS and having deleted the ruff cache between runs. reply thayne 16 hours agoparentprevI like that it's fast, and it is noticeably faster for even moderately sized codebases. But the main thing I like about ruff is that it is a single tool with consistent configuration, as opposed to a combination of several different tools for formatting and linting that each have their own special way of configuring them and marking exceptions to lint rules. reply paulgb 17 hours agoparentprev [–] Doesn’t Black mostly stick to PEP-8 style? What rules do you consider ugly? reply eesmith 9 hours agorootparent [–] When I write argparse or click, I use one parameter per line, like: parser.add_argument( \"--stdout\", choices = (\"true\", \"false\"), default = \"true\", help = \"log data to stdout\" ) Black turns it into: parser.add_argument( \"--stdout\", choices=(\"true\", \"false\"), default=\"true\", help=\"log data to stdout\" ) I find the one-line-per-term easier to understand, and even though it fits on a single line, I would rather have all add_argument()/@click.option() calls follow the same layout, to make it easier to discern the structure across dozens of similar calls. I also like to have spaces around the \"=\" in my keyword=arguments, except for very short and simple calls. PEP 8 says \"Don’t use spaces around the = sign when used to indicate a keyword argument\" so black is following that recommendation. However, everywhere else in the PEP (assignment like 'x = 5', and annotations like 'class Spam: foo: int = 4' or 'def spam(foo: int = 4)', there are spaces on either side of the equals sign. That irritates me every time I have to use black. reply tda 9 hours agorootparent [–] add a comma after he last argument to make black explicitly use multi-line formatting parser.add_argument( \"--stdout\", choices=(\"true\", \"false\"), default=\"true\", help=\"log data to stdout\", ) It also removed the superfluous spaces in the keyword arg assignments reply L3viathan 9 hours agorootparentThe point they're trying to make, I think, is: Black/Ruff format, or any other formatter necessarily need to operate on universal rules. In context, sometimes these rules don't make sense. I still would love some kind of stateful linter and formatter, where it suggests me changes that I can then accept or ignore (and won't be told about again). Formatters _are_ a compromise. They make your coworkers' code nicer, and your code worse. reply eesmith 8 hours agorootparentThe point I was trying to make is to give examples of rules I thought were ugly, to give a concrete response to paulgb's request for such a rule. One, as I learned, could be resolved by a simple use of a terminal \",\". The other is how it removes spaces from around \"=\" for keyword arguments, but not for other uses of \"=\". I can't provide much more as I rarely use black. As a single developer, I don't have to worry much about that sort of compromise. ;) reply tda 3 hours agorootparentThe removal of spaces around keyword arguments is per the PEP8 style guide. There is no point arguing with the style guide. It is there to end discussions. I also do not agree with everything in the style guide. But I keep that to myself. Because a single universal (but flawed) style guides >> competing style guides >> complete anarchy reply eesmith 2 hours agorootparentYes, I even pointed out how it's in PEP 8. That I think it's wrong and ugly is an entirely different point. PEP 8 specifically says it it not universal: > Many projects have their own coding style guidelines. In the event of any conflicts, such project-specific guides take precedence for that project. ... > However, know when to be inconsistent – sometimes style guide recommendations just aren’t applicable. When in doubt, use your best judgment. ... > Some other good reasons to ignore a particular guideline: > When applying the guideline would make the code less readable, even for someone who is used to reading code that follows this PEP. I think always omitting spaces there makes it less readable, even for someone who is used to reading PEP 8. That makes me more compliant to PEP 8 than black. ;) reply eesmith 8 hours agorootparentprev [–] Sweet! Thanks! I did not know that, and I've no problem with a terminal comma there. My point stands I do not think those spaces are superfluous. Consider the following: a = 4 def foo(i: int): return \"A\" * i class Spam: foo = 4 bar: int = 6 def eggs(self, n: int = 5): return foo(i=n) Why is it \"i=n\" instead of \"i = n\" when every other use of \"=\" has spaces? For this one case of a short function with simple names, okay, I don't always use spaces. But otherwise I think the lack of spaces makes it the code harder to read, and thus \"uglier\". reply tda 3 hours agorootparent [–] you can discuss the spaces and lack there of here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8853063/pep-8-why-no-spa...

    "originBody": "Kimi k1.5: Scaling Reinforcement Learning with LLMs Kimi Team Full Report 🚀 Introducing Kimi k1.5 an o1-level multi-modal model Sota short-CoT performance, outperforming GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 3.5 on 📐AIME, 📐MATH-500, 💻 LiveCodeBench by a large margin (up to +550%) Long-CoT performance matches o1 across multiple modalities (👀MathVista, 📐AIME, 💻Codeforces, etc) Abstract Language model pretraining with next token prediction has proved effective for scaling compute but is limited to the amount of available training data. Scaling reinforcement learning (RL) unlocks a new axis for the continued improvement of artificial intelligence, with the promise that large language models (LLMs) can scale their training data by learning to explore with rewards. However, prior published work has not produced competitive results. In light of this, we report on the training practice of Kimi k1.5, our latest multi-modal LLM trained with RL, including its RL training techniques, multi-modal data recipes, and infrastructure optimization. Long context scaling and improved policy optimization methods are key ingredients of our approach, which establishes a simplistic, effective RL framework without relying on more complex techniques such as Monte Carlo tree search, value functions, and process reward models. Notably, our system achieves state-of-the-art reasoning performance across multiple benchmarks and modalities---e.g., 77.5 on AIME, 96.2 on MATH 500, 94-th percentile on Codeforces, 74.9 on MathVista---matching OpenAI's o1. Moreover, we present effective long2short methods that use long-CoT techniques to improve short-CoT models, yielding state-of-the-art short-CoT reasoning results---e.g., 60.8 on AIME, 94.6 on MATH500, 47.3 on LiveCodeBench---outperforming existing short-CoT models such as GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 3.5 by a large margin (up to +550%). The service of Kimi k1.5 on https://kimi.ai will be available soon. Key Ingredients of Kimi k1.5 There are a few key ingredients about the design and training of k1.5. Long context scaling. We scale the context window of RL to 128k and observe continued improvement of performance with an increased context length. A key idea behind our approach is to use partial rollouts to improve training efficiency---i.e., sampling new trajectories by reusing a large chunk of previous trajectories, avoiding the cost to re-generate the new trajectories from scratch. Our observation identifies the context length as a key dimension of the continued scaling of RL with LLMs. Improved policy optimization. We derive a formulation of RL with long-CoT and employ a variant of online mirror descent for robust policy optimization. This algorithm is further improved by our effective sampling strategy, length penalty, and optimization of the data recipe. Simplistic Framework. Long context scaling, combined with the improved policy optimization methods, establishes a simplistic RL framework for learning with LLMs. Since we are able to scale the context length, the learned CoTs exhibit the properties of planning, reflection, and correction. An increased context length has an effect of increasing the number of search steps. As a result, we show that strong performance can be achieved without relying on more complex techniques such as Monte Carlo tree search, value functions, and process reward models. Mutimodalities. Our model is jointly trained on text and vision data, which has the capabilities of jointly reasoning over the two modalities. Test Model by API You can test Kimi k1.5 through the Kimi OpenPlatform.

It's not even an SDK, library, etc., it's just advertising. I've noticed a number of China-based labs do this; they will often post a really cool demo, some images, and then either an API or just nothing except advertising for their company (e.g. model may not even exist). Often they will also promise in some GitHub issue that they will release the weights, and never do. I'd love to see some sort of study here, I wonder what % of \"omg really cool AI model!!!\" hype papers [1] never provide an API, [2] cannot be reproduced at all, and/or [3] promise but never provide weights.

    "originBody": "Home > AI > Meta is among a long list of companies being sued for allegedly using pirated material to train its AI models. Meta has never denied using copyrighted works but stressed that it would rely on a fair use defense. However, with rightsholders in one case asking for torrent client data and 'seeding lists' for millions of books allegedly shared in public, the case now takes a geeky turn. Over the past two years, AI development has progressed at a rapid pace. This includes large language models, which are typically trained on broad datasets of texts; the more, the better. When AI hit the mainstream, it became apparent that many rightsholders had concerns over the unauthorized use of their copyright works. Creatives including photographers, artists, musicians, journalists, and authors, responded by filed copyright infringement lawsuits to protect their rights. Book authors, in particular, complained about the use of pirated books as training material. In various lawsuits, companies including OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta, and NVIDIA are accused of obtaining books from ‘pirate’ sources, including the controversial Books3 database and shadow library LibGen. Meta Acknowledges ‘Pirate’ Sourcing Early On One of the most intriguing cases, especially for those interested in the piracy angle, is the class action lawsuit filed by authors including Richard Kadrey, Sarah Silverman, and Christopher Golden. The authors accuse Meta of using their work without permission. While this may sound problematic to some, Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta didn’t beat around the bush. More than a year ago the company admitted that unofficial sources, comprised of pirated content, were used as training input. Crucially, however, Meta denied the copyright infringement allegations, noting that it would rely on a fair use defense, at least in part. “To the extent that Meta made any unauthorized copies of any Plaintiffs’ registered copyrighted works, such copies constitute fair use under 17 U.S.C. § 107,” Meta said in its early response. A Spotlight on Meta’s Torrenting Activity The fair use defense will be central in many AI copyright infringement lawsuits. AI companies generally believe that use of ‘public’ data as training inputs is justified. They characterize the use as transformative and argue that it doesn’t compete with the original market for these works. Whether that is indeed the case is a question that may ultimately end up at the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, however, rightsholders in this lawsuit have raised additional allegations of copyright infringement. A few weeks ago, the plaintiffs asked for permission to submit a third amended complaint. After uncovering Meta’s use of BitTorrent to source copyright-infringing training data from pirate shadow library, LibGen, the request was justified, they argued. Specifically, the authors say that Meta willingly used BitTorrent to download pirated books from LibGen, knowing that was legally problematic. As a result, Meta allegedly shared copies of these books with other people, as is common with the use of BitTorrent. “By downloading through the bit torrent protocol, Meta knew it was facilitating further copyright infringement by acting as a distribution point for other users of pirated books,” the amended complaint notes. “Put another way, by opting to use a bit torrent system to download LibGen’s voluminous collection of pirated books, Meta ‘seeded’ pirated books to other users worldwide.” Seeded Court Greenlights Torrent Piracy Probe Meta believed that the allegations weren’t sufficiently new to warrant an update to the complaint. The company argued that it was already a well-known fact that it used books from these third-party sources, including LibGen. However, the authors maintained that the ‘torrent’ angle is novel and important enough to warrant an update. Last week, United States District Judge Vince Chhabria agreed, allowing the introduction of these new allegations. In addition to greenlighting the amended complaint, the Judge also allowed the authors to conduct further testimony on the “seeding” angle. “[E]vidence about seeding is relevant to the existing claim because it is potentially relevant to the plaintiffs’ assertion of willful infringement or to Meta’s fair use defense,” Judge Chhabria wrote last week. Authors Want Meta’s Torrent Client Logs and Seeding Data With the court recognizing the relevance of Meta’s torrenting activity, the plaintiffs requested reconsideration of an earlier order, where discovery on BitTorrent-related matters was denied. Through a filing submitted last Wednesday, the plaintiffs hope to compel Meta to produce its BitTorrent logs and settings, including peer lists and seeding data. “The Order denied Plaintiffs’ motion to compel production of torrenting data, including Meta’s BitTorrent client, application logs, and peer lists. This data will evidence how much content Meta torrented from shadow libraries and how much it seeded to third parties as a host of this stolen IP,” they write. While archiving lists of seeders is not a typical feature for a torrent client, the authors are requesting Meta to disclose any relevant data. In addition, they also want the court to reconsider its ruling regarding the crime-fraud exception. That’s important, they suggest, as Meta’s legal counsel was allegedly involved in matters related to torrenting. “Meta, with the involvement of in-house counsel, decided to obtain copyrighted works without permission from online databases of copyrighted works that ‘we know to be pirated, such as LibGen’, they write. Modified Settings The authors allege that this involved “seeding” files and that Meta attempted to “conceal its actions” by limiting the amount of data shared with the public. One Meta employee also asked for guidance, as “torrenting from a corporate laptop doesn’t feel right.” Meta as Distributor With the addition of a torrent angle, the amended complaint adds a new element to the case. One that could potentially be crucial, particularly for the fair use defense. The plaintiffs now accuse Meta of operating as a distributor of the pirated works. While that has little to do with how the works were used to train AI, it’s a copyright claim, nonetheless, and one that might be harder to defend as fair use. Whether this will substantially change the case has yet to be seen, but it’s certainly fuel for legal fireworks. That said, these torrent allegations are just a small fraction of the case, which will be fought tooth and nail by both sides. — A copy of the plaintiffs’motion for relief from the non-dispositive pretrial order submitted on January 15, is available here (pdf). A copy of the third-amended complaint can be found here (pdf)",

There's just no other viable alternative for efficiently acquiring large quantities of text data.

As I wrote it out, I didn't know what I thought either. But now some sleep later, I feel like the answer is pretty clearly \"No, not worth it\", at least from myself. Our exclusive control over access to our mind, is our essential form of self-determination, and what it means to be an individual in society. Cross that boundary (forcefully no less) and it's probably one of the worst ways you could violate a human. Besides, I'm personally not hugely into the whole \"aggregate benefits could outweigh individual harms\" mindset utilitarians tend to employ, and feels like it misses thinking about the humans involved.

They might memorize small snippets but never full books. They are the worst infringement tools ever made why replicate Harry Potter by LLM, it's show, expensive and lossy, when you could download the book so much easier. A second argument is that using the LLM blends a new intent into the process, that of the prompter. This can render the outputs transformative. And most LLM interactions are one-time use, like a scratch pad not like a finished work. reply Earw0rm 12 hours agorootparentThe lossy compression argument is interesting. How many bits of entropy in Harry Potter? How many bits of entropy in a lossy-compressed abridgement that is nevertheless enough, when reconstituted, to constitute a copyright infringement of Harry Potter? The latter is absolutely small enough to fit in an LLM, although how close it would get to the original work is debatable. The question is whether copyright is violated: 1) inherently by the model operator, during the training. 2) by the model/model owner, as part of the generation. 3) by the user, in making the model so so and then reproducing the result. reply dijksterhuis 11 hours agorootparentmy personal perspectives 1) straight up copying. download a bunch of copyrighted stuff > making a copy. no way out of this one. 2) a derivative work can be/is being generated here. very grey area — what counts as a “derivative” work? read about robin thicke blurred lines court case for a rollercoaster of a time about derivative musical works. 3) making the model so so? do you mean getting an output and user copying the result? that’s copying the derivative work, which, depends on whatever copyright agreement happens once a derivative work claim is sorted out. that’s based on my 5 years of music copyright experience, although it was about ten years ago now so might be some stuff i’ve got wrong there. reply Earw0rm 11 hours agorootparent1) It's definitely copying, but that doesn't necessarily mean the end product is itself a copyright violation. (And that remains true even where some of the steps to make it were themselves violations). 2) Agreed! Where this becomes interesting with LLMs is that, as with people, they can have the capacity to produce a derivative work even without having seen the original. For example, an LLM that had \"read\" enough reviews of Harry Potter might be able to produce a reasonable stab at the book (at least enough so for the law to consider it a derivative) without ever having consumed the work itself or direct derivatives. 3) It's more of a tool-use and intent argument. One might make the argument that an LLM is a machine, not a set of content/data, and that the liability for what it does sits firmly with the user/operator, not those who made it. If I use a typewriter to copy Harry Potter or a weapon to hurt or kill someone in neither case does the machine or its maker have any liability there. reply visarga 11 hours agorootparentprevYou can ensure a model trains on transformative not derivative synthetic texts, for example, by asking for summary, or turning it into QA pairs, or doing contrastive synthesis across multiple copyrighted works. This will ensure the resulting model will never regurgitate the training set because it has not seen it. This approach only takes abstract ideas from copyrighted sources, protecting their specific expression. If abstract ideas were protectable what would stop a LLM from learning not from the original source but from social commentary and follow up works? We can't ask people not to reproduce ideas they read about. But on the other hand, protecting abstractions would kneecap creativity both in humans and AI. reply Earw0rm 10 hours agorootparentThat's an interesting argument, which makes the case for \"it's what you make it do, not what it can do, which constitutes a violation\" a little stronger IMO. reply thatcat 16 hours agorootparentprevdo those classifiers read copyrighted material? i thought they simply joined the swarm and seeded (reproduction with permission) youtube, etc classifiers definitely do read others material though. reply pdpi 19 hours agorootparentprevLeveraging their position in one market to get a leg up on another market?

They have become rich by training on valuable data produced by others. Yet others are not allowed to train on valuable data produced by them. reply isitnowisit 13 hours agoprevWhat happens if I input 10 news headlines from different news sources into an AI prompt and publish and sell the resulting AI output. Is this copyright infringement? reply russellbeattie 17 hours agoprevSo here's a related thought... Google is currently being sued by journalist Jill Leovy for illegally downloading and using her book \"Ghettoside\" to train Google's LLMs [1]. However, her book is currently stored, indexed and available as a snippet on Google Books [2]. That use case has been established in the courts to be fair use. Additionally, Google has made deals with publishers and the Author's Guild as well. So many questions! Did Google use its own book database to train Gemini? Even if they got the book file in an illegal way, does the fact that they already have it legally negate the issue? Does resolving all the legal issues related to Google Books immunize them from these sorts of suits? Legally, is training an LLM the same as indexing and providing snippets? I wonder if OpenAI, Meta and the rest will be able to use Google Books as a precedent? Could Google license its model to other companies to immunize them? Google's decade-long Books battle could produce major dividends in the AI space.

Specifically, the new allegations in this article revolve around their use BitTorrent, and that they thereby re-distributed the works — this would still be illegal even if their use of the works as training data for the LLMs itself is ruled to be \"fair use\". I'm allowed to take the script of a play out of a library, and learn it (I'm less sure about the right to then perform it). I'm generally allowed to make photocopies for research purposes, libraries even have photocopiers available for public use (with noticed about copyright law right by them). But unless it's very old, I'm not allowed to sell (or even give away) complete photocopies of the entire play. reply kevingadd 21 hours agoparentprevIt's possible their friends in government will make this all go away if they ask nicely enough. reply pixelpoet 20 hours agorootparentWould $1m suffice? https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8j9e1x9z2xo reply edoceo 20 hours agorootparentThat's the ante; gotta place the next wager. reply plagiarist 20 hours agorootparentThe best ROI for the money is probably purchasing a SCOTUS justice. reply qingcharles 12 hours agorootparentWhy not both? reply moshegramovsky 20 hours agorootparentprevYeah I had a Facebook account until today.

The weird two-paid-services thing required to use it effectively—a search service of some kind, and your actual content provider—and the jankiness of the software and sites involved were enough to get me to give up, after spending some money but making no meaningful progress toward pirating anything. I started my piracy journey on Napster. I’ve done all the other biggies. I’ve done off-the-beaten-path stuff like IRC piracy channels. Private trackers. I have a soft spot for Windowmaker and was dumb enough to run Gentoo so long that I got kinda good at the “scary” deep parts of Linux sysadmin. I can deal with fiddliness and allegedly-ugly UI.

The mainstream media and even the ADL is being forced into a degrading charade where they can't call two full-throated nazi salutes what they obviously are. The closest I've seen to calling this what it is is Rolling Stone pointing out that actual neo-Nazis are thrilled at having him speak directly to them[1]. [1] https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/elon-mus... reply Rzor 18 hours agoparentI think you’re giving too much \"credit\" to Musk, as if he orchestrated this to shift the Overton window. Musk was recently criticized on Twitter for not prioritizing American workers (the H1B visa thing), and now he’s trying to signal to some of those people that he’s actually \"on their side.\" In short, I believe this is all about Musk’s insecurities and his need for validation. That said, if this is true, it puzzles me that he would focus only on the more radical individuals rather than making a broader, more inclusive gesture to Americans. reply franktankbank 18 hours agorootparentWay to equate people who want H-1B fraud reined in to nazis. Why would I a normal engineer who has bad experience working with infosys hacks be appreciative of a nazi salute? reply Rzor 17 hours agorootparentI never said that. I don’t think they are all Nazis, although some are, while others are sympathetic or simply understand that Musk is moving in the right direction (in a way that doesn’t make him a Nazi because he’s just \"joking\"). Do I have to draw a Venn diagram of all possible cases? Have you seen replies to Musk lately? The people who criticized Musk—a particular subset of them—are the ones Musk was signaling to, in his own misguided way. Or maybe he was signaling to all of them, and this is how he thinks he can win them by throwing a bone. There’s some kayfabe here. To his audience, or at least some of them, he can do this without being a Nazi, much like how Trump can promise to defend America abroad, but take back Panama or Greenland, or whatever (even though he says he doesn’t actually like or want war), or how Christian he is. It’s just theatrics in a certain direction. For those who care, it’s there; for others, it’s nothing, and they just rationalize it as some kind of performance, but still remain loyal. My point is that this is how Musk thought he could win some people back, perhaps impulsively—not as a ploy to shift public perception or signal an incoming Fourth Reich. This is obviously bad and it just stains Musk's increasingly poor reputation even more. reply boudin 11 hours agorootparentprevThis is not an isolated move though. People he associates with (afd, farrage, meloni) revolve around nazism and fascism. Trump language as well is (mass deportation, invasion, attacks on the justice system, etc...). This is just part of his political strategy. My interpretation is that he sees any opinion that goes against his personal interests as a personal attacks and something he has to shut down to conduct his businesses which naturally leads towards this behaviour and the far right spheres. I don't think this is a weird response to something that happened on twitter, this is just who he is. reply mullingitover 18 hours agorootparentprevI don’t think people who want H1B reform are closet Nazis. What I would believe is that Musk is a halfheartedly closeted nazi. Why? Because he literally gave full support to a German neo-Nazi party. Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. reply aredox 11 hours agorootparentAnd restoring neo-nazi accounts, and retweeting neo-nazi content...

Or is it meant to be purposefully ambiguous to antagonize. I have to admit, looking at the actual video, it looks exactly like a Nazi salute. I doubt Elon is an actual Nazi or racist, but I also could see him doing something aggressive and childish to instigate his “enemies”. EDIT: Why is this story flagged?
