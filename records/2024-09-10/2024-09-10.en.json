    "originBody": "Home Film News Sep 9, 2024 1:42pm PT James Earl Jones, Distinguished Actor and Voice of Darth Vader, Dies at 93 By Adam B. Vary, Carmel Dagan Getty Images James Earl Jones, the prolific film, TV and theater actor whose resonant, unmistakable baritone was most widely known as the voice of “Star Wars” villain Darth Vader, died Monday morning at his home in Dutchess County, N.Y., his rep confirmed to Variety. He was 93. After overcoming a profound stutter as a child, Jones established himself as one of the pioneering Black actors of his generation, amassing a bountiful and versatile career spanning over 60 years, from his debut on Broadway in 1958 at the Cort Theatre — renamed the James Earl Jones Theatre in 2022 — to his most recent performance in 2021’s “Coming 2 America.” For that film, Jones reprised his role as King Jaffe Joffer from the 1988 Eddie Murphy comedy “Coming to America” — one of several roles, along with Darth Vader, that Jones revisited, including the voice of King Mufasa in Disney’s animated feature “The Lion King” in 1994, the 1998 direct-to-video sequel and the 2019 remake, and CIA deputy director Vice Admiral James Greer in three Jack Ryan movies, 1990’s “The Hunt for Red October,” 1992’s “Patriot Games” and 1994’s “Clear and Present Danger.” Related Stories VIP+ ‘Star Wars Outlaws’: Disney Tests Gamers’ Appetite for Hollywood IP Uzo Aduba Says Attending the DNC and Watching Kamala Harris Accept Nomination Felt Like an 'Outstanding Check Had Finally Been Paid on the American Dream' JAMES EARL JONES REMEMBERED BY ‘STAR WARS’ CO-STAR MARK HAMILL AND MORE Popular on Variety Among his more than 80 film credits, Jones’ other notable movies include as a B-52 bombardier in Stanley Kubrick’s 1964 Cold War satire “Dr. Strangelove” (his feature film debut), as the first Black president of the United States in 1972’s “The Man,” as the fearsome villain in 1982’s “Conan the Barbarian,” as a reclusive author in 1989’s “Field of Dreams,” as a blind former baseball star in 1993’s “The Sandlot,” and as a minister living in apartheid South Africa in 1995’s “Cry, the Beloved Country.” Jones was nominated for four Tony Awards, and won two, in 1969 for playing boxer Jack Johnson in “The Great White Hope” (which he reprised on film in 1970, receiving his only Oscar nomination), and in 1987 for originating the role of Troy Maxson in August Wilson’s Pulitzer Prize-winning drama “Fences.” He was nominated for eight primetime Emmy awards, winning twice in 1991, for supporting actor in the miniseries “Heat Wave,” about the 1965 Watts riots, and for lead actor in the drama series “Gabriel’s Fire,” about a wrongfully imprisoned ex-cop who becomes a private detective. It was the first time an actor won two Emmys in the same year. Jones earned a Kennedy Center Honor in 2002, the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement award in 2009, an honorary Oscar in 2011 and a lifetime achievement Tony Award in 2017. His Grammy award in 1977 for spoken word album makes Jones only one a handful of actors to receive an EGOT. Jones’ looming yet ultimately affable presence and rich speaking voice made him a natural for Shakespeare, and he played some of the great roles, such as Macbeth and Othello, for Joseph Papp’s American Shakespeare Festival. Jones narrated several documentaries, from 1972’s “Malcom X” to the 2007 Disneynature doc “Earth,” and, famously, he intoned the tagline “This is CNN” for the cable news channel. His television credits, which number over 70, including many movies and miniseries such as “Roots” and “The Atlanta Child Murders,” recurring roles on “L.A. Law,” “Homicide: Life on the Street” and “Everwood,” and guest roles on shows like “The Simpsons,” “Picket Fences,” “Law & Order,” “Frasier” and “House.” As for his most famous role, Jones was paid $7,000 to lend his voice to Darth Vader in 1977’s “Star Wars: A New Hope,” but he declined screen credit for that film and its sequel, 1980’s “The Empire Strikes Back,” out of deference to the actor who played the role on screen, David Prowse. By 1983’s “Return of the Jedi,” however, Jones had become fully synonymous with one of the most memorable and terrifying villains in cinema history, and received credit for his work. He returned to Vader’s voice again for 2005’s “Episode III — Revenge of the Sith” and 2016’s “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,” but for the 2022 Disney+ series “Obi-Wan Kenobi,” Jones instead authorized Lucasfilm to use archival recordings and AI technology to recreate Vader’s voice. When asked in 2014 by the New York Times about how he’d kept his career alive for so long, Jones’ response evoked the kind of plainspoken humility that he had so often brought to his performances as well. “The secret is never forgetting that you’re a journeyman actor and that nothing is your final thing, nothing is your greatest thing, nothing is your worst thing,” Jones said. “I still consider myself a novice.” James Earl Jones was born in 1931 on a farm in in Arkabutla, Miss. His father, Robert Earl Jones, left home soon after to pursue his own acting career (the two more-or-less reconciled when the younger Jones was in his 20s, and they even performed together). When Jones was 5, he moved with his maternal grandparents to Michigan. The shock of the relocation induced a stammer so severe that he often could communicate only in writing. It wasn’t until high school when he started to overcome his stutter, when his English teacher, upon learning that Jones composed poetry, encouraged him to read his writing aloud in class. As an undergraduate student at the University of Michigan, Jones initially set out to study medicine, but wound up more interested in drama. His first stage role was a small part in the 1957 Off Broadway production “Wedding in Japan.” He took side jobs to supplement occasional theater work in Broadway’s “Sunrise at Campobello,” “The Cool World” and “The Pretender.” He also appeared in summer stock. In 1960, Jones joined Papp’s New York Shakespeare Festival. The following year he made his first serious impact in a landmark Off Broadway production of Jean Genet’s “The Blacks” as the protagonist Deodatus. Afterwards, for Papp, he played Oberon in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” the first of many heralded Shakespearean turns. His masterful 1964 performance as Othello for Papp was moved Off Broadway, where the production ran for almost a year. Jones’ first big break into cinema came by way of Papp’s production of “The Merchant of Venice,” in which Jones played the Prince of Morocco to George C. Scott’s Shylock. When Stanley Kubrick came to see Scott, whom he was considering for one of the leads in “Dr. Strangelove,” the film director was so impressed that he cast Jones in the film, too. In 1966, Jones had the title role in “Macbeth” at the New York Shakespeare Festival, again to great acclaim. He also booked a recurring role on “As the World Turns” in 1966, marking the first time a Black actor had a continuing role on a daytime soap opera Still, he was almost one of Broadway’s best-kept secrets until 1968 with his performance in Howard Sackler’s “The Great White Hope” as Jack Johnson, the first Black man to win the world heavyweight boxing championship. The Tony, the acclaim and its timing in the late ’60s propelled Jones into the spotlight at a time when it was difficult for Black actors to secure quality roles. The actor, however, has said that the accolades he received for for both the play and its film adaptation did not do that much for his career. It wasn’t until 1977, when Jones’ voice terrified audiences for the first time as Darth Vader, that things truly began to shift for him. That same year, Jones also appeared in ABC’s “Roots” playing the author Alex Haley, whose genealogical novel of the same title inspired the groundbreaking miniseries. He never quite became an outright star in the classic sense of the word, but the back-to-back successes that year did ultimately make Jones a household name, whose presence connoted a stature and gravitas to projects that might otherwise be lacking. Theatre is where Jones most frequently was a box office draw in his own right — and well into his 80s. He returned to Broadway in 2005 for a production of “On Golden Pond” opposite Leslie Uggams, drawing another Tony nomination. In 2008, he played Big Daddy in a production of Tennessee Williams’ “Cat on a Hot Tin Roof” that featured an all-Black cast including Terrence Howard, Anika Noni Rose and Phylicia Rashad. Two years later, he returned to Broadway in a revival of “Driving Miss Daisy” opposite Vanessa Redgrave; the production’s move to London in 2011 meant he had to miss the Honorary Oscars ceremony in Los Angeles. Instead, Sir Ben Kingsley surprised Jones with his statuette in person after he’d concluded a matinee performance of the show. Jones was first married to actress-singer Julienne Marie. His second wife of 34 years, actress Cecilia Hart, died in 2016. He is survived by his son, Flynn Earl Jones.

I didn't spend a lot of time in the fleet, but what I did was rather boring and/or annoying; the idea that something exciting would happen in the CIC is probably why I often think of the line \"Now, understand, Commander, that torpedo did not self-destruct.

I live right near that plaza in SF where Sydney Poitier yells at Martin \"its your Mother\" with the Car phone in his hand. Great movie reply nocoiner 18 hours agorootparentI love that movie too. It’s amazing how well it holds up for it being, in many ways, a tech-focused movie - I mean, yeah, the tech is very much dated and completely a product of its time, but it doesn’t look at all ridiculous. Undoubtedly probably helps that it was pre-WWW/popular internet. reply sjburt 16 hours agorootparentI think it helps that the technical concept that drove the main plot was a very real and still-present risk to public key encryption systems. reply ManuelKiessling 13 hours agorootparentprevWhenever the line „they don’t make them like this anymore“ comes up wrt movies, I think of „Sneakers“ and „The Hunt for Red October“. reply UberFly 12 hours agorootparentprevSneakers is climbing into cult classic year by year.

Aside from James Earl Jones it had the following actors who at one point or another had Academy Award nominees (or won) for acting: Robert Redford Sidney Poitier David Strathairn River Phoenix Ben Kingsley Mary McDonnell And In addition to those it had Dan Aykroyd and Stephen Toblowsky reply hinkley 19 hours agorootparentprev\"...

I was told by an industry insider (taken at face value), that he almost never turned down a part, which drove his agent nuts. That's why he was in these kind of oddball movies. I suspect that Nicholas Cage is similar. reply hinkley 19 hours agorootparentAh, the 'working actor'. Gary Oldman (who also calls himself a working actor) kinda tanked his career for a while by getting typecast as a villain. Playing Sirius Black was basically autobiographical, and kind of got him unstuck. reply ChrisMarshallNY 18 hours agorootparentGary Oldman is one of the best actors I've had the privilege of seeing. Consider that Mr. Zorg, Winston Churchill, and George Smiley, are played by the same person, is amazing. reply hinkley 16 hours agorootparentRosencrantz and Stansfield made him my favorite actor for the first decade of my adulthood. Zorg is okay. That terrible Lost in Space movie lowered his trajectory for a while. He’s been hitting home runs a lot since. But if you hear him in interviews he thinks of himself as a working actor. He’s doing the job. But the right people think he can do a good job so he’s getting better roles. reply alexjplant 12 hours agorootparent> That terrible Lost in Space movie I'll never defend \"Lost in Space\" as a cinematic tour-de-force in the traditional sense but I'll be damned if it isn't one of the most quintessentially-90s films ever made. It has Silicon Graphics logos and bubble-shaped silver electronics everywhere. William Hurt managed to find time to slip away from the \"Dark City\" set to make an appearance. Pre-Felicity Shagwell/post-Rollergirl Heather Graham fends off advances from Joey Tribbiani while the crazy guy from \"Leon: The Professional\" makes a bunch of bizarre wisecracking non-sequiturs. A brash Big beat remix of the original TV theme blares over the credits immediately following a fight involving a giant CGI (SGI?) spider. I disliked it intensely as a kid but enjoy it a lot in retrospect because of my high-resolution nostalgia goggles. reply ChrisMarshallNY 8 hours agorootparent> high-resolution nostalgia goggles.

Amazing actor. reply okwhateverdude 7 hours agorootparentHe really disappears into whatever character he is playing. Truly one of the exceptional actors of our time. That show in particular highlights this very well. reply michaelhoney 9 hours agorootparentprevExcellent show, fourth season just started reply mathgeek 20 hours agorootparentprev> I suspect that Nicholas Cage is similar. Probably, although it’s also well documented that Cage took a lot of roles to pay off his extensive debts after blowing through nine digits of his wealth. reply hinkley 19 hours agorootparentTurns out real estate is what did him. And he refused to file for bankruptcy. Given his behavior there for a while I was trying to do the math on how you blow through $65 million worth of... well, blow. reply jdougan 19 hours agorootparentprevMichael Caine apparently is similar.

It was one of the best movie experiences of my life. reply steve_adams_86 15 hours agorootparentMan, what I’d do to have a theatre experience like that again. I feel like I’ve already seen just about every movie I see these days. I watch them to just tune out occasionally, like a safer version of alcohol. I don’t watch them because it’ll be moving, insightful, exciting, etc. It’s just coarse stimulation. I really miss movies that left me feeling like I had a significant experience. It happens occasionally, but I feel like it used to be more common. The lion king was amazing. The remake was a kick in the pants. reply nonameiguess 1 hour agorootparentprevMy aunt used to take me and my sister to the El Capitan theatre to every big Disney tentpole that premiered there in the late 80s and early 90s. I think Lion King is probably still the best movie-going experience I have ever had and ever will have. It was the first one where I was a teenager and that was probably the end of my true childhood and when I started losing interest in stuff like that. I don't think any scene will ever again touch me like James Earl Jones voice booming from the clouds telling Simba to remember who he is.

For some reason, and maybe because I have a hard time telling the difference between art and reality, I was fairly certain, for a long time, that the actor himself had died, and I would be regularly surprised when he would appear in new movies.

The B-52 was state-of-the-art in the 1960s, and its cockpit was off-limits to the film crew. When some United States Air Force personnel were invited to view the reconstructed B-52 cockpit, they said that \"it was absolutely correct, even to the little black box which was the CRM.\"[17] It was so accurate that Kubrick was concerned about whether Adam's team had carried out all its research legally.[17] Also IIRC it was the inspiration for the Situation Room.

There's no excuse for an appliance to brick itself or lose functionality just because of the manufacturer's remote action. When I buy a device, I don't want a perpetual, tethered relationship with the manufacturer in order to work the device. I don't want it to ask the manufacturer for permission to run every day. I don't want it to be dependent on the manufacturer to keep it alive. I don't want to create an account. I don't want to log in to the manufacturer's servers. I don't want them to know my IP address or my home address. Leave me alone, I'm just not that into you! A hardware device should work on day 10,000 just as it worked on day 1. If you as a company can't do that, you should not be able to sell the device (EDIT: OR at least you should be required to prominently mark the devices as \"dependent on the manufacturer's servers\") reply apatheticonion 14 hours agoparentCouldn't agree more. A recent example - you buy a $1600 virtual reality headset (HP G2, specifically). A couple of years later the manufacturer drops support and Microsoft disables WMR capabilities. This bricks a perfectly functional, expensive, device. Personally, I feel the \"right to repair\" should extend to software. Why am I not allowed to revive an old mobile phone with a new OS version? Why am I not allowed to revive an old device by modernizing its hardware driver? Why can I not bring an old video game back to life? Yes source code is IP - but maybe an expiration system similar to pharmaceuticals should apply where, for instance, a regulator compels a companies to release the sources of their drivers & services when a product or service is no longer officially supported. reply raxxorraxor 10 hours agorootparentThe current VR generation was destroyed by the manufacturers themselves with the exception of Valve. Oculus did develop nice devices as well, but you never could get a single replacement part if anything broke. Want to exchange a heavily used controller? Tough luck, maybe you find a used one that is heavily overpriced. Using any other controller isn't possible. This isn't acceptable, especially not for devices in that price range. I recommend to try it once as it is an experience, but otherwise VR is pretty much dead again. But don't buy Facebook or something similar, they simply don't offer support for their hardware. Smartphones are a tragedy itself. Security theatre destroyed it. I could have a safer phone that is on a current patch level instead of using the OEM OS. But my digitally incompetent bank doesn't allow me to use a good phone to run a banking app, because it doesn't allow rooting devices. Even without giving you any source, manufacturers could at least provide binaries and a mechanism to flash it to devices. There is no technical reason to not allow this. reply monkeyfun 6 hours agorootparentGod, I just have to share a little experience that not too long ago happened to me, relating with what you said about oculus and repairability. So, ol' monkeyfun had a quest 2 controller grip button break. From gentle, ordinary gripping. And on the same day as fixing an unrelated problem in another controller. Tragedy! Naturally this loser went to fix it. No guides? Oh well, at least she could see 3rd party 3D printed parts online for sale. Might as well disassemble it to see how broken the part is, to know what to order. Whipped out tools, started disassem-- aaaaaaand it broke. Not only was there a terribly placed ribbon cable made very difficult to access, not only were tons of parts inconsistently either held in by the lightest friction or intense nearly glued-together forces or strange catches, but the precise intersection of these aspects (and a ribbon cable that was seemingly stuck to the connector on just one pin) meant that when a disassembly step caused the controller to spontaneously fall apart into a few pieces, it was so forceful that it damaged that ribbon cable. AAAAAAAAAAA!!!! ================ For what it's worth, I anyway discovered that the way the part broke would need me to extract an embedded piece of metal anyway and make some repairs to another piece of plastic, so it was never going to end in success. But it really made me appreciate just how terribly designed those controllers are for repair. Even the component that broke was... designed to bend a piece of plastic repeatedly from what I could tell, rather than say just having a small metal spring. So user-hostile. reply trissi1996 5 hours agorootparentprevRegarding rooted android, it is possible to bypass the root checks of most banking apps: - 1. use MagiskSU for rooting - 2. add some modules to bypass SafetyNet/PlayIntegrity (https://github.com/chiteroman/PlayIntegrityFix/releases) - 3. For especially annoying apps add some modules to hide well-known \"root apps\" from the applist, so these apps don't know they're installed (https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPosed.github.io/releases + https://github.com/Dr-TSNG/Hide-My-Applist/releases) [I only needed it to get Pokemon-Go to work, banking worked without it] My local banking apps and even google wallet work mostly fine with these workarounds. Though it breaks every few months, which is then usually quickly fixed with a magisk+module update. reply trissi1996 5 hours agorootparentprevWhile I would agree that overall repair-ability isn't great, you're wrong. Replacement controllers are available without an issue directly from meta: - https://www.meta.com/us/en/quest/accessories/quest-2-control... - https://www.meta.com/us/en/quest/accessories/quest-touch-plu... On the software side they have been pretty great with support IMO, e.g. by adding 120Hz to the Quest 2 quite some time after release and opening up the Oculus GO, after they discontinued it. Maybe not valve-level but definitely much more than I expected from meta, and their hardware was a third of the price of valve's, despite having an actual APU in them! reply raxxorraxor 4 hours agorootparentI don't believe I am wrong. Try to find a controller for the Rift or Rift S. You may now want to argue that these devices are older. That is true, you mostly need replacement parts for older devices. And software support? I do remember where Facebook forced me to make an account or the hardware would be unusable. For me that was the argument to never buy hardware from Facebook again. Sure, it was Oculus at the time and even if technically the Rift and Rift S were solid products, I would thoroughly recommend to not become a private customer of Facebook for now. Maybe things have improved, because they certainly should. reply nicholasjarnold 4 hours agorootparentprev> Smartphones are a tragedy itself. Security theatre destroyed it. If you're willing to buy a new device, then I recommend getting a Pixel on sale and flashing it with GrapheneOS[0]. No rooting required. Read up on it when you have a chance.

Same as we need copyright maximums in the range of a generation (20 years). Having something come out of copy right 100 years later removes the cultural impact that putting a copyright into the public domain has. Primarily because everyone who was impacted by the original copyright is no longer alive. A prime example is steamboat Willie, aka Micky mouse og, really doesn't have any interest in doing much with it because it is culturally stale/mummified/dried out. reply vjk800 10 hours agorootparentI think this would seriously tank the smartphone business. The reason why I have to buy a new phone every few years is basically sugarcoated planned obsolescence. If the software running my five year old Android phone was public domained, likely the community would keep my phone running for at least five more years. Not saying that this shouldn't happen, though. Just saying that people suggesting this sort of stuff should realize that the economic consequences for some businesses would be major. reply citrin_ru 37 minutes agorootparentLack of software updates is definitely a factor why people have to trash a working smartphone but there are two more: software bloat and battery degradation. Newer apps tend to use more and more RAM an CPU so one have to upgrade or use slower and slower apps. Li-Ion batteries have limited life time. Even if you are ready to spend time and money on a battery replacement, spare batteries are available only for still widely used models. reply iSnow 10 hours agorootparentprev>I think this would seriously tank the smartphone business Not so sure in reality. There's a lot to dislike about Apple and I won't go into it, but as an example, I like their support policy. They promise 5y and usually it's 7y. They do disable features on older phones via feature flags where the performance would not be up to it (like on-device AI lately), but this rather long support does not seem to impact their sales negatively. Arguably it works for them b/c people know they can resell their phones after 2y and still get a good price as buyers know they will get support. I am one who switched from Android/Sony precisely because of this. The same could be true for opening older phones as some Android makers do unlocking the boot loader and leave it to enthusiasts to port newer Android versions. Many phones get recycled to something different this way (controller for home automation) and would never reduce sales. reply danaris 3 hours agorootparentprevPeople talk a lot about how phones are built with \"planned obsolescence,\" but different people mean wildly different things when they say that. On one end of the spectrum are people who insist that the reason phones only last as long as they do is a 100% deliberate decision on the part of smartphone manufacturers to hamstring their own hardware, often going all the way into full conspiracy-theory-level thinking, with timed kill switches and the like. Frankly, I find this line of thought to be bullshit. On the other end are the people who are talking about smartphone manufacturers using components that are chosen for being small, light, and/or cheap, rather than being durable and user-repairable, purely for reasons of design, practicality, and cost savings. Personally, I know which side of this I come down on; Hanlon's Razor[0] applies here, as well as the fact that, to the best of my knowledge, no actual timed kill switches in hardware or software—nor anything in the same general vein—have ever been proven to exist. And if not even the lowest-grade independent Android phone manufacturers are putting those things in their phones, why on earth would the likes of Samsung, Xiaomi, or Apple feel the need to do so? [0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor reply 0xEF 9 hours agorootparentprevI agree, but I also give the company the concession of being able to open-source the product when support ends. If they do that, I'm okay with it. As soon as they're done making whatever money they could from the thing and it becomes a burden to their pocketbook, hand the source code and schematics over to the community and let them take the wheel. Not sure about others, but I am more likely to respect a company that does that and buy future products from them. reply bzzzt 12 hours agorootparentprev> Why am I not allowed to revive an old mobile phone with a new OS version? Why am I not allowed to revive an old device by modernizing its hardware driver? Why can I not bring an old video game back to life? Hardware is complicated and there are just not enough people with the deep understanding to fix it. I've got lots of old 'open source' devices that lost traction in their developer community. Nobody ever managed to recreate a usable OS for the old Sharp Zaurus PDA until the device itself was completely obsolete. New OS versions rely on new hardware functions (or just a higher amount of memory or I/O to be usable) so patching to run on old hardware won't deliver something running well. Video games are a bit of a special case because there's the media copyright as well.

Unfortunately, for a lot of devices that's inherently required to get through the firewall--for example, my garage door opener. Since it's not accessible from the internet the app has to communicate with the company server, the same server the opener opened a connection to to listen for commands. There's also the grey area of remote kill. It should be required to be disclosed up front and the company should be required to put up a deposit with the FTC for a simple you-can-live server. If the company shuts down the FTC's copy is spun up and anything that hasn't been killed continues to operate. reply ryandrake 15 hours agorootparentGarage door opener is a perfect example of a device that should NOT require a cloud service in order to operate. Think about how it works. I'm sitting in my house on my LAN, the same LAN that the garage door opener is on. I open the app to close the garage door. It sends a command out to some server on the Internet. Then the garage door, which is presumably polling the server at all times, receives the command to close from the server, and closes. Why on earth can't I just send the command directly to my garage door opener over my LAN? That should be the simplest mode of operation possible. I only need Internet connectivity if I somehow want to close my garage door from miles away! reply shiroiushi 11 hours agorootparent>Why on earth can't I just send the command directly to my garage door opener over my LAN? Because of NAT. Your door opener isn't connected to the internet, it's connected to your router, which uses network address translation to make all your devices share a single internet connection. So your door opener can send outgoing messages no problem, and the NAT router will route those outside, and then route responses to those messages back to the opener, but there's no (easy) way for a device outside your home network to access your opener. Of course, your phone or PC is on your home network, but only when you're at home. Presumably, you also want to be able to control your door opener when you're not at home, and at those times, you have to get through the NAT. Doing that requires the company's server, or something like Tailscale which sets up a virtual private network (VPN) between your opener and selected devices. But even Tailscale requires some type of server on the internet to work, even though the main traffic goes direct. Basically, what you're asking for could have been a reality if 1) we had IPv6 (or just not IPv4 with its very limited number of unique addresses), and 2) we didn't have to worry about security so we could feel safe putting random crappy IoT devices directly on the internet and not worrying about hackers opening our garage doors or houses so thieves could enter and take stuff. reply fragmede 11 hours agorootparentOver LAN.

If the manufacturer goes out of business, their cloud service will be shut down 90% of the time (exception is if some entity buys the bankrupt company to restructure it). No one has any incentive to keep a service running that makes no money. And I believe (not totally sure though) that IP is always part of the bankruptcy assets so probably insolvent companies are not even allowed to just open-source their stuff and allow configuration of the backend so users could set up community-servers and keep things running. Completely different are cases where companies continue to live but lock features behind new paywalls like Happiest Baby with their Snoo bassinet, invent fees to hinder re-sale like Peloton or cripple working hardware like Sonos did.

This QR apparently begins Bluetooth handshake between the light bulb and the pocket computer, wherein things like WiFi information seem to be exchanged. After that, Matter devices (in my application at least) just live on WiFi. This all happens without needing weird(er) apps, overseas clown accounts, or manufacturer-specific hardware. It is local. (Well, Home Assistant is local. The others...are whatever hybrids they are.)

The problem is that end users suuuuuuuck. Oh, by the way iOS and Android do everything in the universe to make using Bluetooth absolutely miserable. Which Android or iOS version are you running? Which buggy Bluetooth stack did Samsung saddle you with? Oh, we retired that version of the app 18 months ago, please, for the love of God, update it. And, oh, you're using a shitty cracked Chinese version of the app . If I make the users connect to the \"cloud\", I can control the device, the backend talking to the device, and the front end talking to the user. I now know exactly what the versions are, and the Chinese can't pirate the app. The customer support is orders of magnitude easier. From the perspective of the device developer, the \"cloud\" is simply a no-brainer on every single front. You, as a local-only user, simply won't pay anywhere near enough money to make supporting you worthwhile. reply AyyEye 21 hours agoparentprevIf you want to cloud delete you may be able to install valetudo on your roborock.

There are systems like esphome that are best in class. The other part is getting a decent router and Wi-Fi infrastructure to support them. Most consumer routers crap their pants after 30 or so devices I used to be vehemently against Wi-Fi. Internet of things stuff, but when I got my new house, my current house I've been building it out in a hybrid approach. Approach. Lighting loads are controlled via lutron, and then non-lighting loads are a mixture of Z-Wave, zigbee, and Wi-Fi devices running ESPhome. My Network infrastructure is a unifi system. It's been more or less bulletproof reply thebasic 20 hours agoparentprevAgreed - can't tell you how many cloud connected devices I've had that completely stopped working. Like my Mellow Sous Vide. Most of my house now is Z-wave and Zigbee. reply MisterTea 21 hours agoparentprevI just bought a bunch of Shelly wall switches and US outlets. They are very affordable and use an open source OS on what I think is an ESP32 enabling Bluetooth and WiFi. They have an IoT cloud thing paired with their app BUT you can disable their cloud or use your own cloud URL, enable RPC over http or UDP and write your own code, use MQTT, local web server in the switch, etc. The outlets are just relays though they measure load current and voltage. Bonus is they do not need to be commissioned through an app - you can do everything over a browser or http calls via curl so you can use whatever OS and even script it. My only gripe is the wall switches do not have any ability to accommodate retrofitting a 3/4-way setup which is quite common for stairwell and hallway lighting.

Buying something and then having the manufacturer take features away is a major bait and switch in the best case. It's fraud. Turning off cloud servers and abandoning hardware leaving it useless when it could be made useful if source code was released should be just as illegal. They need to start cracking down on these horrid business practices. reply EvanAnderson 18 hours agoprevMake blowing eFuses in devices illegal. The device no longer belongs to the manufacturer and they should have no power to physically damage it, nor to compel me to allow them to physically damage it as a condition for use. EFuses enable awful anti-consumer \"features\" like preventing firmware downgrades, blacklisting compromised cryptographic keys, and bricking devices remotely. reply shiroiushi 11 hours agoparent>Make blowing eFuses in devices illegal. Do you mean before or after manufacturing? Afterwards, I agree. Before, no way: that's how most modern CPUs work. They put a bunch of crap on the chip and make them all the same way, but due to defects, different chips have different parts that don't work, so they blow efuses inside the chip to disable the broken parts, and then sell the chip as the variant that doesn't include that function. reply EvanAnderson 5 hours agorootparent> Do you mean before or after manufacturing? After the sale-- that's why I qualified who the device belongs to in my post.

I'd kind of like it if manufacturers would stop selling me V-12-shaped engines that can only be run as inline-4s, too. (No, that's not a thing. But I'm not sure what qualitative differences might exist, and which would actually survive debate, betwixt a fully-built silicon chip with parts disabled forever and a fully-built engine assembly with parts disabled forever.) reply nebula8804 16 hours agoparentprevThey also enable things like resettable fuses in a car (ie Tesla) such that you don't need to have some dumb fuse in the fusebox blow and then waste money/time buying replacements. Instead make them software resettable after a fault has been resolved and now you have eliminated a cost and made the system more efficient. reply EvanAnderson 14 hours agorootparentI don't think we're talking about the same kind of eFuses. The ones I'm talking about don't serve a current-limiting function like a traditional fuse.

At whatever time they reduce features or increase cost beyond a faster level of inflation, they are required to release all related current source code, comments, documentation, test suites, etc. required to make usable all product features, into the public domain. At that point, all parties are also fully permitted to use any measures to reverse engineer or otherwise hack the source code and firmware. Simple: You maintain it, it's yours as long as you want. You stop maintaining it, everyone else can do it for you. Let the bean counters trying to cut this month's bottom line costs fight with the IP lawyers trying to hide everything forever. [edit: typos] reply janalsncm 21 hours agoparentI think this gets tricky if their source code uses other proprietary software that can’t be open sourced. So in practice open sourcing would not be an option. I could also imagine a common situation where there was some complex integration with various third party like OpenAI where it wouldn’t be that easy for users to handle themselves. reply datadrivenangel 20 hours agorootparentThe classic example is deep use of cloud services. If the whole thing is built on AWS services, you won't have a meaningful app to deploy. Or if they use proprietary assets from somewhere like unity. reply toss1 20 hours agorootparentprevFor sure, there will be edge cases and such as you describe. That is no reason to not do it. 1) resolve them in favor of the customers/users. If it is required to use it, release it, and anyone is free to hack. If it integrates with some 3rdPty service, they'll pretty quickly update their TOS to prevent such risks to their codebase, so it won't be an option. 2) it'll encourage corporations selling products to use modular and local-first design. If the product works by itself, local-first, and using a software package delivered with the product, and they sell an ADD-ON cloud-based service, they'll have zero problems. They can discontinue the ADD-ON cloud service at will, and people can still use the original product as sold. reply stale2002 18 hours agoparentprevThis is a surprisingly good recommendation.

Bought a 43\" 4K display for my desk and it failed after barely 2 months of use. Contacted ASUS and their support said they'd be happy to fix it under the warranty, after I sent the item to their repair facility in Texas, on my own dime. A 43\" monitor. Would've costed me $180. Fucking ridiculous. I ordered a second if for no other reason than to get back to work, and that one arrived broken! But, fortunately, the power supply was in-tact so I took them both apart, constructed a working one, kept it and returned the broken parts. If whoever's fulfillment can't even be fucked to check the ones they're shipping out to see if they're shattered, I figured it was long odds anyone would even care if I did it. And I never heard a thing about it. And an interesting side note, I received refunds for both purchases. I have no idea why, but clearly some folks working at either Amazon or ASUS aren't too on the ball.

Appealing to common sense, or morality/ethics, or a sense of professional responsibility or pride in the work, won’t help.

    "originBody": "Just for Fun. No, Really. We like to write software! Coding is a zigzag journey of problem-solving, and the destination is less important than some might think. We often get asked questions like: “Why are you doing this?” “What is the purpose of this project?” “What does this project do better than X?” Silicon Valley Cutthroat If one spends a lot of time on Hacker News, or other startup-oriented news sites, they might believe that everyone is working on their next multi-million-dollar startup and/or exit strategy. It may be hard to imagine that people work on open source code purely for the fun of it. There are hackers who just love the art of building software. They do it for the challenge, for the fun of it. They aren’t trying to make a million dollars. Consumer Culture Or, if one is used to consuming other software only, and rarely creating any, they might get stuck in a mindset of thinking “what can this project do for me?” (And if the project isn’t relevant to them, they wonder why it exists.) There are hackers who don’t need lots of people to consume their software. Of course, they would love it if others enjoyed/admired/appreciated their work, but that's not strictly necessary. It's just fun to create. We do it just for the fun of it. No, really. Lastly, if one has learned enough programming technique to do their day job and not a lot more, then they might not appreciate programmers who are always trying new things. There are hackers who live and breathe code, and the idea that every line of code must prove its monetary value, that every hour spent toiling away at the keyboard must be accounted for, is a damn shame. The process itself, flaws and all, has value—not just the final product. I'll end with my favorite quote about programming: The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures.... Yet the program construct, unlike the poet's words, is real in the sense that it moves and works, producing visible outputs separate from the construct itself. —Fred Brooks, The Mythical Man-Month Try it! If you, dear reader, think you may have lost your way—that coding used to be fun for you, but now it's just a slog of clocking in and out to get a paycheck, then allow us to invite you back! Or, if you were conditioned to think that wild-idea programming is only for professionals and academics, this page is for you. You have the right to tinker, and have fun doing it!

He kept questioning me \"why\" I made the project after I repeatedly told him it was just for fun and learning. He just could not imagine why I would spend a decent amount of time outside of work where I worked on something just for fun. reply strken 9 hours agoparentI write stuff for fun, but there's always some reason why I chose to build e.g. an in memory inverted index with a gRPC CLI client instead of anything else. Usually it's a simple non-business reason like \"I wanted to see how gRPC worked\" or \"I read a blog post about Elastic and thought it sounded fun\" but there's still an underlying story to tell about why exactly word stemming was interesting, fun, and a good learning opportunity. reply lifthrasiir 13 hours agoparentprevI believe that's the majority view in general, and as the number of programmers continues to increase, the majority view eventually also affects the average view of programmers as well. Okay with that as long as they don't deem such thing unacceptable (people are different for different reasons, aren't they?). In fact I think a healthy mix of both kinds of people is needed for many cases. reply xandrius 13 hours agoparentprevTo be fair, bringing up a personal project done for fun and learning is just asking for trouble: they are clearly interested in seeing how you perform and talk about a project, maybe how you work with other people, other departments, users, etc. A home project maybe covers the how you perform but that's it; if you had made it a product then it would be a good example but strictly for fun/learning doesn't seem something I'd bring up in such a context. I want to be clear that I'm not shunning home projects, just bringing them up at an interview, unless the interviewer specifically asked for this kind of projects. reply matheusmoreira 1 hour agorootparentI wouldn't bring up my personal projects either. This is stuff I do with zero obligation to anyone other than myself, and with no deadlines to worry about. I walk away from projects the second I stop having fun. Many of them are unfinished. I usually have huge bursts of productivity followed by burning out which leads to weeks of inactivity. It may be evidence of enthusiasm for computers and the craft but it is not really representative of job performance. reply sigmaml 13 hours agoparentprevWhen I interview people, I ask them to describe one of their difficult work projects. I also ask them if they ever developed anything just for fun. I take their responses to both the questions into account when making a decision on taking them to the next round. reply Arisaka1 10 hours agorootparent>When I interview people, I ask them to describe one of their difficult work projects This only leads to a \"rich get richer\" kind of situation, where people who happened to get jobs that provides them with the kind of impressive difficult projects will keep working on difficult projects. reply joenot443 5 hours agorootparentThis is just a reality of hiring, I think. People with more experience tend to find it easier to get hired, thus granting them even further experience. IMO, the best way to avoid this chicken/egg is with government subsidized technical internships like we have in Ontario. It's a great deal, businesses get junior technical labor at 50% on a fixed contract, and the students get access to learning they'd never have during school. reply klez 9 hours agorootparentprevThat's not meant to see who works on impressive projects. It's meant to see how you work in projects you find difficult and how you face that kind of difficulty. reply fragmede 12 hours agorootparentprevwhy is that signal on how well they'll perform at the job? If someone doesn't code for fun but is a great programmer you don't want to hire them? Why is that considered acceptable? reply sigmaml 11 hours agorootparentYou parsed it incorrectly. It is the other way, in fact. Several times, people do very interesting personal projects, but fail to perform at the same level at work. That gives a clue that it may have been an unsuitable work environment that impeded their performance. It could also be a difference pertaining to their orientation to structured vs. unstructured working conditions. It could be related to explicit objectives with tight deadlines vs. exploratory development with open deadlines. And, more. Knowing what my work environment is, I usually could understand their medium-to-long term fitness. Hope this clarifies what I meant. reply weinzierl 10 hours agorootparentSo, if you have a candidate that thrives at fun projects but not at work you put them to the next round, because you think your work environment is sufficiently different to make them thrive at work instead of their fun project? reply sigmaml 6 hours agorootparentDid you mean to say \"in addition to\" rather than \"instead of\"? If yes, then the answer is: sometimes, depending on the other factors. reply lupire 5 hours agorootparentprevThey didn't parse incorrectly. They made a guess about what your poorly worded communication meant. reply sriram_malhar 10 hours agorootparentprevThe fact that someone builds something of their own volition is an excellent marker of initiative, of breadth. If there is a choice of potential hires, this signal factors in. reply lupire 5 hours agorootparentThat's only true if they have the same work experience and other hobbies, which you can't know. reply JumpCrisscross 13 hours agoparentprev> He kept questioning me \"why\" I made the project after I repeatedly told him it was just for fun and learning This sounds like a miscommunication on both sides versus anybody failing (or being correct). Assuming you weren't interviewing for a research or entry-level role, picking--and then sticking to--a home project doesn't answer the implicit question: can you manage a relevant project. On the interviewer's side, instead of doubling down on asking you about the project you chose, they could have nudged you into highlighting relevant experience. reply aliasxneo 14 hours agoprevI've often described my motivation for building software to others using imagery: I like to go find a secluded beach, build a large, magnificent sand castle, and then walk away. Will anyone notice? Probably not. Will the waves eventually destroy it? Yep. Did I still get immense satisfaction? Absolutely. reply xandrius 12 hours agoparentI love that! The way that I create software is more akin to a hobbyist woodworker: I encounter something which doesn't exist exactly as I want it yet (or I'm aware of any else) and I build it for myself.

I personally didn't like the long research process and tool setup just to begin to do something basic. Now a lot of friction is gone and I can prompt a silly idea and get a super simple prototype running and then from there, tinker on my own. I made this geolocation music web app that plays a little tune based on your precise location. It's just a little fun toy that serves no purpose but I regularly use it when I go for walks just to hear the variation in tunes in different parts of my city. https://geo-tune.vercel.app/ reply dailykoder 12 hours agoparent>I personally didn't like the long research process and tool setup just to begin to do something basic. I am the exact opposite of that. I love to do the basics and dig myself through it to understand the fundamentals of everything. I love to rebuild stuff. Though I don't research too much. I get some ideas, but basically just read about the functionallity (and theory) about what to build (a CPU, a Compiler, an OS, some webapp, you name it) and then try to come up with a solution by myself. If it kinda works, then ill reavaluate my implementation with looking at others and iterate from there. Somehow I refuse to use big libraries or frameworks (yes, you could argue the compiler is big too etc etc, but you know what I mean). This makes it unlikely to build the next million-dollar project, but I enjoy it. For a few years I had a negative self-talk and told myself that this is a bad approach. But nowadays I just love it. It's fun. I do enough serious stuff on my job and I don't need a million dollars really (even tho it'd be nice). I rarely use LLMs or SO. I try to stick through reference sheets or read through git repos myself reply famahar 11 hours agorootparentThat's really great that you enjoy the learning process. I feel like curiosity is such a key to being a creative developer. I do fear LLMs will add more of a black box to projects for better and worse. Nice reminder to always ask \"why\" something works. reply bansuian 13 hours agoparentprevThis is so cool. I had a similar idea that I did except this one was akin to virtual geocache.

This note is generated using the Web Audio Api. It's quite simple and there's so many ideas I have to build other musical patterns. But I do like the simplicity. reply sph 13 hours agoprevIn my personal career path, I went from being too tired to work on personal projects, to only working on stuff which might have monetary value, to lately deciding I'd rather live somewhere cheaper so I can afford time between contracts to work on whatever I want, especially the moonshot projects. You know, those kind of projects you have dreamt about for years, that might take 10 years to achieve. The goal is to work in weekly sprints. Like one or two weeks a month might be contract work, and 2 or 3 weeks a month dedicated to those projects that keep me up at night. Basically yes, do it for fun, but also set serious time aside for it. It is so sad having dreams that have no time to be explored. reply Arisaka1 12 hours agoprevThis aligns well with a discussion I had with some colleagues yesterday, and how good artists, authors, programmers, painters, etc. focused on pumping volume. My example was John Carmack's days in Softdisk who was forced to make games that they were nothing to write home about, but according to himself \"the time constrains and need to build monthly played a great role in developing our skills that would be later used to make something like Doom\". That's when I realized the root of my own procrastination: I was trying to choose \"the right language\", to build \"the right portfolio project\", in order for me to get \"the right job\". And I thought to myself \"no kid ever starts playing with a computer for something as shallow as getting a job\". It's not that there's something wrong with getting a job - I still need to pay the bills. But for the journey of self-improvement in any craft has to have yourself creating, as Carmack aptly puts, \"hundreds of programs\". Serial startup developers know this, because jumping from startup to startup will have you build stuff fast, fail fast, and learn from it. reply gustavopezzi 2 hours agoprevThat's a great thing.

To that end I created a freestanding C programming system of sorts. My own libc, essentially. Without all the legacy of C like errno and locales, and with no portability requirements. Then I implemented a lisp interpreter on top of it. I needed to implement some ELF stuff and eventually I realized I was recreating the linker well. I suppose that'll be the foundation of the lisp's foreign interface. It's in my plans to create a freestanding Linux VFS for SQLite and integrate the database directly into the system as a module.

How can you justify coding \"for fun\" when realistically that time could be spent billing to a client? Even if it's just a couple hundred extra bucks a week, if you invest it wisely, come retirement that could be non-insignificant increase in your quality of life! Or maybe the extra cash saves your ass when you get an unexpected high medical bill, if you're an American. Why would you build a FOSS project when Google or someone is just going to take your project and integrate it into something they're building, monetize their product, and you'll never see a cent of it? Or why work on your own FOSS project when you could do the more optimized thing of trying to get a commit in on react or vue or whatever which will blow the socks off your interviewers during your next job hunt? Maybe we're all quite ill right now or maybe just I am if nobody else thinks like that. I don't have a solution it just makes me sad that that's how things seem to be right now, and that's just as a relatively well off American developer.

    "originBody": "\"One monopoly is bad enough\" — DOJ claims Google has “trifecta of monopolies” on Day 1 of ad tech trial Ad tech monopoly trial may hurt Google more than DOJ’s search case, experts say. Ashley Belanger - 9/9/2024, 9:08 PM Enlarge / Karen Dunn, one of the lawyers representing Google, outside of the Albert V. Bryan US Courthouse at the start of a Department of Justice antitrust trial against Google over its advertiing business in Alexandria, Virginia, on September 9, 2024. SAMUEL CORUM / ContributorAFP reader comments 114 On Monday, the US Department of Justice's next monopoly trial against Google started in Virginia—this time challenging the tech giant's ad tech dominance. The trial comes after Google lost two major cases that proved Google had a monopoly in both general search and the Android app store. During her opening statement, DOJ lawyer Julia Tarver Wood told US District Judge Leonie Brinkema—who will be ruling on the case after Google cut a check to avoid a jury trial—that \"it’s worth saying the quiet part out loud,\" AP News reported. \"One monopoly is bad enough,\" Wood said. \"But a trifecta of monopolies is what we have here.\" In its complaint, the DOJ argued that Google broke competition in the ad tech space \"by engaging in a systematic campaign to seize control of the wide swath of high-tech tools used by publishers, advertisers, and brokers, to facilitate digital advertising.\" The result of such \"insidious\" allegedly anti-competitive behavior is that today Google pockets at least 30 cents \"of each advertising dollar flowing from advertisers to website publishers through Google’s ad tech tools ... and sometimes far more,\" the DOJ alleged. Meanwhile, as Google profits off both advertisers and publishers, \"website creators earn less, and advertisers pay more\" than \"they would in a market where unfettered competitive pressure could discipline prices and lead to more innovative ad tech tools,\" the DOJ alleged. On Monday, Wood told Brinkema that Google intentionally put itself in this position to \"manipulate the rules of ad auctions to its own benefit,\" The Washington Post reported. “Publishers were understandably furious,” Wood said. “The evidence will show that they could do nothing.” Wood confirmed that the DOJ planned to call several publishers as witnesses in the coming weeks to explain the harms caused. Expected to take the stand will be \"executives from companies including USA Today, [Wall Street] Journal parent company News Corp., and the Daily Mail,\" the Post reported. The ad tech trial, which is expected to last four to six weeks, may be the most consequential of the monopoly trials Google has recently faced, experts have said. That's because during the DOJ's trial proving Google's monopoly in search, it remained unclear what remedies the DOJ sought. Some ways to destroy Google's search monopoly could be \"unlikely to create meaningful competition\" or hurt Google's bottom line, experts told Ars, but a more drastic order to spin out its Chrome browser or Android operating system could really impact Google's revenue. It won't be until December that the DOJ will even provide a rough outline of proposed remedies in that case, Reuters reported, with the judge not expected to rule until next August. But the DOJ has been very clear about the remedies needed in the ad tech case, \"asking Brinkema to order a divestment of Google’s Ad Manager suite of services, which is responsible for many of the rectangular ads that populate the tops and sides of webpages across the Internet,\" the Post reported. Because the most \"obvious\" remedy would be to require Google to sell off parts of its ad business, experts told AP News that the ad tech trial \"could potentially be more harmful to Google\" than the search trial. Perhaps at the furthest extreme, antitrust expert Shubha Ghosh told Ars that \"if this case goes against Google as the last one did, it could set the stage for splitting it into separate search and advertising companies.\" In the DOJ's complaint, prosecutors argued that it \"is critical to restore competition in these markets by enjoining Google’s anticompetitive practices, unwinding Google’s anticompetitive acquisitions, and imposing a remedy sufficient both to deny Google the fruits of its illegal conduct and to prevent further harm to competition in the future.\" Ghosh said that undoing Google's acquisitions could lead to Google no longer representing both advertisers' and sellers' interests in each ad auction—instead requiring Google to either pick a side or perhaps involve a broker. Although the Post reported that Google has argued that \"customers prefer the convenience of a one-stop shop,\" the DOJ hopes to prove that Google's alleged monopoly has shuttered newspapers across the US and threatens to do more harm if left unchecked.

They do mention one negative societal effect in passing: > “The result is less news where it is needed most,” Gannett’s lawsuit said. “Communities throughout the United States now do not have a suitable local paper to advise on local events.\" Their issue is that there are not enough newspapers(!), which as we all know are the primary source of modern information... Not that the advertising business has corrupted every form of media it touches, to the point where news outlets don't even report events that don't get them views. Advertising has been instrumental in killing journalism as we knew it, and we're all letting it continue to wreak havoc to our other institutions, because, hey... profit. > Google has accused the DOJ of having a \"narrow view of the ad tech market\" that's outdated and \"doesn’t reflect reality.\" Hilarious take, considering adtech has consistently kept the ways it conducts its business hidden from public view. When users of their services are kept in the dark when their data is being collected and how value is extracted from it, is it really surprising that governments have a wildly inaccurate sense of what's going on? \"Senator, we run ads.\" reply HWR_14 15 hours agoparentThe harms to publishers are more quantifiable than privacy violations, so it should be an easier case.

That someone who steals the bread from your table can't be convicted of anything? We tried something like that recently and the results were pretty toxic. reply monkeyfun 4 hours agorootparentYou're missing the essence. That those who are desperate and poor can be punished easily, swiftly, harshly, but those who are wealthy tend to avoid punishment and when it even occurs it is with herculean effort, sluggish, and limp. An easy comparison of sorts is that often the penalty for stealing millions or even billions as a white collar criminal will be lower (or functionally lower) than that for stealing hundreds, or the punishments for nonviolent drug crimes (to remove the aspects of possible violence). Or, to focus on the quote's notion about sleeping under a bridge -- it's often that penalties exist exclusively harming the poor and uninfluential, but which are trivial to get around if you have resources. A desperate rich person laments they had to pay for an overpriced room and were so robbed -- A desperate poor person may sleep in wretched conditions only to be penalized by a law that was virtually never going to affect the rich person to begin with. (I don't mean to open up any debate about e.g. homelessness either, as there's nothing noble about most modern mentally-ill homeless severe-addicts; i implore you to look at the deeper structure of the quotation / expression) reply sfn42 9 hours agorootparentprevIf someone needs to steal food and sleep under a bridge I think we can do better than convicting them. reply AnthonyMouse 9 hours agorootparentThat's a proposal not to change the policy that theft is uniformly illegal. reply inglor_cz 9 hours agorootparentprevYeah, but people who shoplift expensive non-edible items don't neatly fall into the \"poor paupers\" category. I would even call them predators preying on small shops and their owners. At the end of the day, most theft in the developed world is not motivated by mere poverty, but harder-to-address things like having a drug habit. I don't really see the case for decriminalization of theft in general. I do see a case for financing research into drug dependence and treatment thereof - the current (unexpected) results around GLP-1 agonists seem to indicate that there is a pharmacologic way to treat addiction. But that is somewhat orthogonal to the original criminal law problem. reply OKRainbowKid 6 hours agorootparentprev> In its majestic equality, the law forbids rich and poor alike to sleep under bridges, beg in the streets and steal loaves of bread.

I could imagine a much better world where the playing field is levelled for everyone by outlawing tracking entirely, but I'll just keep on dreaming. reply karmakaze 5 hours agoparentprevI don't find it at all wild. Trials determining monopolies are about fair and healthy competition which is good for consumers.

Now there's a problem that advertising doesn't care to support journalism because their industry believes there are superior methods. reply vasco 12 hours agorootparentBy that logic businesses that buy advertising have supported nascent technologies as they develop. When newspapers were new and the main way of disseminating information that's what they used and happened to \"support\" as a byproduct. If you read an old scientific american from 1845 the last page was all ads. That's where eyeballs were. As the internet developed now they support millions of websites as byproducts, many that would never exist otherwise. The ad industry has many bad things but it has for example allowed me to pay for my expenses during university because as a highschool student making small free tool-like websites to learn, and with traffic it ended up allowing me to go to a good university in the country's capital instead of a shitty one in my hometown. And there's probably millions of such stories. This to me is way more democratic than \"just\" supporting newspapers which by now are just part of huge conglomerates. Even your \"local\" newspapers and news stations are all just part of a couple of conglomerates. https://localnewsinitiative.northwestern.edu/posts/2022/07/1... reply justinclift 9 hours agorootparentprevMaybe there should be a distinction between online advertising and print advertising?

Why do you say that? reply xp84 13 hours agoparentprev> monopolistic practices and the harms it is having on publishers, rather than its privacy violations and harms to the general public 1. We have a few modest protections in law against monopolistic practices that address its harm to businesses, such as those used to slap MS on the wrist for bundling MSIE as a tactic to kill its competitors, and such as the laws used to force a breakup of AT&T (during times of far more ambitious government regulators). We have a very few absolute jokes of federal and state privacy laws, mostly focused on the complete wrong things. - CAN-SPAM? Let's demand that you have a physical address on your emails, and that you provide an opt-out link, but all political email is exempt, iirc? and feel free to sell your list to the next guy. - CCPA? Let's focus on cookies and maybe on how people get annoyed by retargeting ads, and do other stupidity to emulate GDPR but not do anything that changes the actual landscape like maybe mandating an ad-free experience of social networks be offered for money, allowing you to be a customer and not a product. - Do-not-call list: Let's not force telcos to know where calls originate and allow filtering of spoofed VOIP calls coming from offshore. Or at least, let's let them take 2 decades to fumble around attempting that. Instead let's allow a tiny fine -- and let's exempt the biggest offenders: Political robocalls. > \"and to society at large\" 2. Our legal (and political) system really has virtually zero ways of addressing even severe harms to society, whether it's school shootings, thinly-veiled bribery of public officials via 'campaign finance,' or a pervasive corporate culture of extortion, exploitation and cheating that companies like Google and Apple love to engage in. It seems to me like the DOJ is playing the hand it's dealt -- there's little they can do, but this is something. reply waveBidder 13 hours agoparentprevprivacy isn't really a market power problem though, because you can have a market in such data. We need comprehensive laws protecting privacy before an agency can enforce them. reply AnthonyMouse 9 hours agorootparent> privacy isn't really a market power problem though, because you can have a market in such data. If social networks are centralized then the operators can do anything the law allows, including invade your privacy, and you can't get out of it because of the network effect. If they're federated/decentralized then you can choose a node (or operate one yourself) that contractually or technologically guarantees that it respects your privacy, and then people would pick those because they don't want their privacy invaded and they would have the choice. reply nonrandomstring 9 hours agoparentprevMonopoly is defined differently in the US and Europe. In Europe a monopoly is permitted so long as the ability to exert dominance in one area does not allow gaining dominance in another. In the US a monopoly is disallowed if it leads to an inefficient market that makes customers pay more. Imho both are unworkable and useless definitions for different reasons. But, since this is a US trial, it must be shown that Google make customers pay more for goods and services than they could under fair market conditions. The problem is that Google (and most of its competitors) offer services \"for free\". As we know, it's not \"free\", but customers pay with data taken as payment in lieu. This means the justice system must redefine \"free\" to incorporate the market price of that data. This is the real cost the customer is paying. Nobody wants to do that, because nobody (including government) wants an overt acknowledgement of the economics of surveillance capitalism and the entire modern surveillance industry. It is an entire economy set up in parallel to the visible monetary one. So the proceedings are being cast in all kinds of unusual distortions to avoid this happening. reply euroderf 10 hours agoparentprev> It's pretty wild that the case against an adtech giant is based on its monopolistic practices and the harms it is having on publishers, rather than its privacy violations and harms to the general public and to society at large. But then again, \"The business of America is business.\" reply otabdeveloper4 12 hours agoparentprevThat's because the privacy violations are driven by government and deep state interests. Advertisers don't need or want the personal data. They're just taking the blame for it because knowing the truth is not comfortable for the public. reply StressedDev 11 hours agorootparentAdvertisers absolutely do want people’s personal data. It helps them build better dossiers on individuals. This helps them target ads. Improving ad targeting improves publishers and advertisers profits because consumer responses to advertisements increase as advertisement relevance increases. reply otabdeveloper4 1 hour agorootparentAdvertisers want broad demographic groups (\"English-speaking zoomer from a middle income family\"), or anonymized cohorts with known statistical distributions. (\"Cohort DFHY12 has 13 clicks versus cohort KHFD35's 145 clicks.\") Personal data (\"A John Connor from Stockton, CA has bought 359 FPV drone parts last month\") is the purview of law enforcement and state-level actors. reply 0xEF 10 hours agorootparentprev> deep state Lol.

You can turn personal data into statistical distributions with enough effort, but that's expensive and fraught with legal perils when you can get the same statistical distributions easier and cheaper with conventional statistical methods. reply jordigh 16 hours agoprev> On Sunday, Google posted a blog warning that any attempt to break up its ad business could rattle customers who choose to use Google's ad tech because it \"is simple, affordable, and effective.\" Has that ever been true? Every instance I know of monopolies being broken up has been good for customers. reply paulgerhardt 15 hours agoparentIt’s a spectrum not a binary. 1970’s Airline breakups were very beneficial to customers with lower prices and more routes popping up virtually overnight (though read “Hard Landing” if you want a more nuanced take), 1980’s AT&T breakup was somewhat beneficial in that long distance and cell rates went down but local rates went up (see “The Deal of the Century”), 1990’s California Energy breakups were basically a net negative for customers allowing energy market speculation and manipulation (“Smartest Guys in the Room”), and in a handful of examples like the Soviet Union or South Africa, deregulation lead to outright collapse of essential sectors in banking, agriculture, and energy and set society/customers back decades (“Sale of the Century”/“After the Party”). reply jonas21 15 hours agorootparentThe airlines weren't broken up in the 70s. They were deregulated and allowed to add or remove routes and set fares as they saw fit. Less government oversight in this case turned out to be a good thing for consumers. reply paulgerhardt 14 hours agorootparentThat’s a literal interpretation, but it misses the point of “Hard Landing”. The book argues that while the airlines weren’t monopolies in name, they acted like a government-sanctioned monopoly under the Civil Aviation Board. The Airline Deregulation Act was essentially meant to break up this cartel, and was pushed through despite heavy resistance from those same airlines. They didn’t want the Civil Aeronautics Board dismantled because it protected their monopolies over routes and guaranteed income, and they feared new entrants would disrupt their control. So, while the airlines weren’t formally ‘broken up,’ the airline business, the route monopolies, and CAB were which directly led to the dissolution of companies like Eastern and Pan Am, and the creation or expansion of new entrants like Frontier, JetBlue, and Southwest which were previously prohibited from competing in these markets. reply jmward01 13 hours agorootparentprevIn the short term? The flying experience is less than miserable now and the costs are going up. I see a lot of articles out there talking about how prices have fallen, but I haven't actually seen the data. The one article that actually cited prices as examples was obviously wrong about those prices, had cherry-picked them or used the laughable quoted prices you see to sucker you into clicking (which then triple as you go through the actual process of getting the ticket). Looking at BTS stats [1] the price appears to be going down somewhat since 1995, but it then goes on to say that the price only covers the base fare, not extras like baggage and the like. We all know by the time you actually fly the cost has gone up considerably. I was forced to pay 150$ for a bag on a recent flight (not even over-weight), that price isn't listed in the base fare anymore but it used to be part of the ticket. Looking at the BTS numbers I see an industry that has had 30 years of technology improvements and customers that aren't seeing that benefit.

Now everyone can Looking at 1995 prices is not relevant to the question: those are post deregulation prices reply jmward01 4 hours agorootparentI believed you missed my point about 'in the short term'. My argument, backed by the linked data, was that for the last 30 years the prices actually look flat when you factor in the lost services like luggage. (is that actually a service?) Combine that with the completely horrific experience and there is a clear argument that the overall value proposition for consumers is tanking, badly. Deregulation happened in 1978. The trends I pointed out are lined back to 1995. the consumer benefit looks like it is lasting less time than the detractors to me so 'in the short term' is, I think, a good discussion point. reply ineedaj0b 13 hours agorootparentprevi'd argue most of the annoyance is tsa type things... no water of x amount... stuck in security line arrive an hour early... disrobe and pull everything out now put it back on... this is all gov regulation reply jmward01 13 hours agorootparentThis is the natural result of businesses only fighting the regulations that actually hurt them and quietly letting the bad ones that help them stay. They have no incentive to lobby to get rid of that silliness. In fact, the worse the airport experience is because of someone other than them the easier it is to give us the worst experiences of our life and charge us for it.

Agriculture? Changed hands from state to private, productivity and yield increased, pre-war exports are all-time high.

Also we are talking about breakups not deregulation. reply ywvcbk 11 hours agorootparent> Also we are talking about breakups not deregulation. In a way they were breakups, in the USSR at least, since all almost all sectors of the economy were fully controlled by government monopolies. reply ivan_gammel 10 hours agorootparentNot exactly. There was central planning, of course, but it was not one big corporation - it was extremely heavy regulation, basically telling different state-owned businesses what to produce, how much, where to sell it and where to get supplies. This is the reason why after privatization there were many companies in most sectors, not just one big monopoly. They were privatized independently. reply AnthonyMouse 9 hours agorootparentprev> 1990’s California Energy breakups were basically a net negative for customers allowing energy market speculation and manipulation This was basically a regulatory failure. They broke up the energy market on paper but without making it feasible for new entrants to actually enter the market, which is the sine qua non of making this work. So then the incumbents purposely constrained generating capacity to spike the prices. reply killingtime74 14 hours agorootparentprevYou didn't mention the biggest US breakups, Standard oil, Bell Systems (ATT) and the railways reply maeil 15 hours agorootparentprevThat sounds exactly like a binary, as hinted at by a sibling comment: Breakup of a company monopoly (always good for the consumer) vs. Breakup of a government monopoly (potentially bad for the consumer) reply crazygringo 15 hours agorootparentNo, because of the part on how local phone rates went up when AT&T was broken up. There's no \"always\" here, the world is not that simple. Breaking up a large company is often going to be good for some sets of customers, bad for others. reply josefx 13 hours agorootparent> because of the part on how local phone rates went up when AT&T was broken up. Isn't that caused by the \"last mile\" problem? Even with the split there was always only one company in control of local infrastructure and from what I understand they could even block newcomers from installing their own, citing concerns over possible service interuptions and various kinds of interference. I think Google Fibre even went through several experimental ways to get its infrastructure in place just so it could avoid dealing with any of that. reply luma 15 hours agorootparentprevIn that case, it mostly just created local monopolies. You still didn’t have a choice for local service unless you moved several hundred miles away. From the consumer’s perspective, we just replaced one monopoly with another. reply ywvcbk 11 hours agorootparentprev> Soviet Union [..] essential sectors in banking, agriculture, and energy and set society/customers back decades That was pretty much unavoidable though. The old Soviet system and institutions were unsustainable and couldn’t coexist with “capitalist” institutions. There was no banking sector (at least how we understand it) to begin with, any company producing consumer goods, electronics, cars etc. collapsed overnight because they were producing garbage products that nobody needed after foreign substitutes became available. Basically there were only two choices, sell off everything remotely useful to foreign companies and hope that they modernize/fix it or allow the local oligarchs to privatize/steal everything. Arguably the countries that picked the first option came out ahead (but are now stuck with entirely foreign owned banking, telecommunications. Retail sectors with much of their industry either directly foreign owned or incapable of doing anything but subcontracting) e.g. Belarus tried to hold on much longer, instead it got stuck where it was for several decades with little progress. The Baltic countries crashed and were close to societal collapse for a few years but have been on an almost continuous upwards trend since they recovered. reply ekianjo 14 hours agorootparentprevderegulation and breaking monopolies are not the same things though reply benoau 16 hours agoparentprevOne time Google accidentally forgot to refund $70 million they thought they had refunded for ad fraud, and they only found out when they were sued for a $500k piece of it someone definitely knew they had not received.

Maybe if you compare it to getting a master's in marketing... I'm a user of parts of their ad tech, and I've tried to be a user of more of their ad tech. It may be affordable. I don't know, because there's not much left to compare it with. It's probably somewhat effective for loads of people, since it's everywhere. But it's decidedly NOT \"simple\". It's a monstrosity. If you come from no ad skills you will have to spend days digging through overly verbose documentation just to figure out which boxes to check. And probably a few hundred to a few thousand to \"experiment\" and find what's working. This is absolutely NOT a \"spend hundred bucks, get a few interested visitors\" solution. Even at the other end it's getting more complicated. It used to be: here's some HTML, slap it where you want the ad. Now you have to be constantly vigilant that they aren't destroying your site by sneakily enabling Auto Ads or showing interstitials. When I started this back in '08, there were many of those providers. We could rotate through them to get some variety and get good payouts. ALL of them are now out of business, except Google, who started to magically payout less after competition declined. As someone who uses them a lot, appreciates their technical ecosystem, who has his bills paid in part by their ad ecosystem, who is generally pro-business and thinks it's fundamentally unfair to punish successful companies for their success, I'll say this: Fuck Google. Break 'm up. reply spacebacon 11 hours agorootparentVery true, few people know how to keep ads profitable when you have a high volume of traffic. The rotation scheme used to help. In a way publishers have to have their own private ad tech to integrate with commercial ad tech to game it in some way in order to not be completely milked in a never ended reduction of value of one’s traffic as a user base grows unresponsive. Representing the broker, the publisher and the house is efficient and is how google can spend your ad budget and deliver absolutely nothing in return.

The customers using mega-scale digital ad exchanges get the benefit of being able to buy 0.001% of a billboard the moment someone actually interested in their product walks past. If you want to increase competition and stop the market from consolidating into a few players it's not immediately obvious that breaking up these ad exchanges goes that direction because it deprives reach from everyone except already large companies. reply LeonB 16 hours agorootparent> being able to buy 0.001% of a billboard ^^ this is possible because the ads are delivered digitally, not because of any magic power google has. Even if every website was its own independent advertising space (an extreme opposite), they could all still be open to advertising companies big and small by using “open standards”. The innovations are all technological. reply Spivak 15 hours agorootparentOkay so you have group A who has ads they want to put in front of potential customers and group B who has digital billboards and wants to sell them. Group A doesn't know where to advertise and can't identify customers, and Group B knows about their users but doesn't know what kinds of buyers might be interested in them. I genuinely don't know how this doesn't precipitate a market-maker who can match up the two groups and who naturally becomes huge because the best matchmakers will be the ones with the largest populations of both groups. The bigger they are the more and better matches that can exist and everyone (theoretically at least) gets better prices because buyers and sellers are in competition in a larger pool. reply JumpCrisscross 15 hours agorootparent> don't know how this doesn't precipitate a market-maker who can match up the two groups In finance lingo, Google is the exchange, the market makers, the brokers on both sides and a good fraction of the listed companies to boot. reply Spivak 14 hours agorootparentThis is incredibly fair.

From [1]: >> After buying DoubleClick, Google tied its control over advertising demand to publisher use of its software.

I think that's pretty shady and in several of these cases she really just wants to spear any old Big Fucking Whale so it looks like she's been successful. That said, \"consumer\" really does mean other companies when it comes to Google ads, since they directly pay them a TON of money, so if they can prove that Google's monopoly is distorting the market I think this is fair game, 100%. And the ad market has been incredibly shitty for a very long time because if you don't have an audience in the billions you can't even try to compete, so anything that can open that up to some innovation would be positive, and price competition would allow a lot of products to exist and thrive that otherwise would have failed because cost of user acquisition was too high. That is very good for consumers. Or it could be really negative, depending how they implement it. The funny thing is, despite the company fighting against it strongly, it's uncertain how good or bad it would be for Google shareholders, oftentimes breakups are very good for their stock because as each piece of the company is unshackled from the others, things that would be profitable for the division but get blocked by other interests at the company all of a sudden become possible: IIRC the combined value of the Baby Bells ended up far greater a few years after the breakup, for one example.

Basically, decades ago before the internet, newspapers served a role in facilitating communication between strangers, in a rather poor fashion. Individuals didn't have the money to have their own printing press and distribution system, so they had no way of contacting people unless they already knew their telephone number, or knowing what others had to offer. So newspapers had the \"classified ads\" section so people could spend a small amount of money and run a very tiny ad in the weekly newspaper for others in their town to see, and it was easy for the newspapers to just add a few extra pages with this stuff at the end. The internet simply made this all obsolete.

This article is good, but just to make a complex issue a bit clearer: There are people who sell Display Ad space (\"Publishers\") and people who buy ad space (\"Advertisers\"). Google AdSense is a well-known name, but that's actually their division for small blogs and such -- the big bucks come in from news sites, homepages, and other high-traffic publishers that use a different product altogether. Google isn't a monopoly on the publisher side (say, ads on your \"Google Home\" screen in the Google app), and obviously isn't a monopoly on the advertiser side; the issue comes about in the middle of the two, the \"Ad Exchange\" side. Google runs the show, and has spent roughly infinity dollars to keep it that way, even though this whole segment (Display Ads) is a pretty small slice of their overall revenue. The graphic published by the DoJ does the best job of explaining the overall issue, and the pieces involved: https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-googl... For example, they staved off Facebook's short-lived attempt to break into the exchange market (a meta-market, if you will!) by drowning the issue in money, then eventually doing the corporation equivalent of \"I'll pay you $5 to fuck off\": cartel formation. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi_Blue According to the draft lawsuit, Facebook agreed to reduce its participation in header bidding in return for \"information, speed, and other advantages\" that would come from staying with Google. Facebook allegedly would receive a guarantee of 90% of auctions regardless of the bids; 300 ms to bid (vs 160 offered to others), along with the ability to identify 80% of smartphone users and 60% of web users. But IMO by far the most egregious behavior was that time they made a cool $230M off \"project Bernanke\", so-named because it was deemed a \"bailout\" of Google's struggling Advertiser clients by favoring them in the Exchange auctions. Somehow said with a straight face! The absolute fucking brazenness of stealing from others to please your clients and grow your pocket book while honestly seeing yourself as the good guy helping out little mom n' pop advertisers is breathtaking.

If nothing else, once the dust settles and the redactions clear this will be a fascinating snapshot of how normal, kind people are made to do wildly asocial things with a smile on their face.

And yet... reply materielle 14 hours agoparentTo add onto what you’re saying, this is surely part of Google’s strategy: obfuscation through complexity.

While looking for the Project Bernanke slides I stumbled across this absolute classic internal guidance document, courtesy of the Texas DoJ: https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-11/417885.pdf Don't define markets and estimate shares... For example, a field like advertising sweeps worldwide, and includes lots of different products and services. Defining a \"market\" more narrowly, or even defining one at all, can create issues if economists aren't involved. There's no problem with referring to a \"market segment,'' \"sector,\" \"business/' etc., but just try and avoid defining the \"market\" for what we offer. Similarly, estimating \"market share\" is complicated, and it implies a defined market, so guessing or approximating isn't very reliable. Not to be trite, but it reminds me of 1984 more than a bit; If you want to keep a secret, you must also hide it from yourself. reply mathteddybear 11 hours agoparentprevNo, project Bernanke wasn't about that. At that time, the exchange was a second-price auction, and all parties could submit up to two bids (presumably, the top two bids from their own collection of advertisers). Let's call the Google bids G1 > G2. Since Google already implemented automated bidding strategies, they would submit to this auction (1+a)G1 and (1+b)G2 for certain fixed small value parameters a,b. Project Bernanke computed on historical data the optimal values of these a,b parameters. Cue government discovery misunderstanding documentation reply bbor 4 hours agorootparentHmm, you clearly know what you’re talking about and this contradicts the available info, so thanks for sharing! I’m a little confused though. To bring it back to simple terms: you’re saying that the project was simply to start bidding more on ad space…? How exactly does that help (/“bailout”) their customers, and why would that be its own project? “Determining how much to bid for ad space” is already the job of half of Bayview campus, so I’m confused by this benign explanation. At the very least it sounds like they were using their position as auctioneer to fine-tune their bidding strategies, which seems like a textbook example of monopolistic behavior. But even that would be a step up from what I/the article above accuse them of. reply mathteddybear 3 hours agorootparentThe values of G1 and G2 are computed by a complex algorithm, however, that algorithm is agnostic of the position of the ad in the auction. Unlike the constant factors (1+a) and (1+b) applied on top of that. Other companies in that auction could apply this kind of optimization, too. Perhaps the improvement is not as large for smaller participants, and so, not worth looking into. reply frays 14 hours agoparentprevGreat comment.

If this is true, 2 of the 3 parties here are motivated to bypass Google to increase the money publishers earn and how much advertisers play, are they not? If's not that hard to set up an ad server from scratch. The issue of course is inventory. But publishers and use multiple ad servers. In fact there are tools for them to pick whichever impression will pay them the most from those available. Advertisers are free to buy on multiple platforms. At least I see no allegation that Google is actually or effectively restricting the use of other tools. So can't Google use this to say that publishers use them because they pay the most? And advertisers use them because the ads are the most effective? Advertisers in particularly are heavily metrics-focused. In the background, they're analyzing ad performance (in terms of impressions -> clicks -> action) based on audience segmentation. Now the DoubleClick cookie does have value because it's so widely deployed, Google has a lot of information to derive behavioural characteristics about the user. Just based on what sites you go to, Google builds a profile of your interests, your likely (implied) demographics and so on. You can argue that this cookie is anticompetitive. But I don't see \"cookie\" mentioned once in this article. So I'm really not sure where this goes. It could be the reporting just isn't great on the case because it requires some legal knowledge.

All right on, but I think you're missing the big picture: advertisers can buy from multiple (networks of) publishers, and publishers can sell to multiple (networks of) advertisers, very true.

Just wanted to say that as someone who worked in the space for 5 years and attempted to integrate with google ad tech products: 1. I could never fully understand how all the google products integrated with each other. 2. The guys we talked to at google were often unable to recommend which product was correct for our use case (it seemed like there were multiple entry points but they all funneled back to one or two common sources) 3. Many of the integrations we wanted to do had no clear criteria for whether google would accept you or not. This led to us wasting lots of time. 4. Our whole company focused on an integration with google for 6-9months. When we were validating our implementation google pulled out, citing antitrust concerns. A few months later they announced a product that competed with us.

Great question, because that's definitely how the word \"AdX\" is used by many players in the industry. Hilariously/embarrassingly, I worked there and still never really got to the bottom of these questions -- they have a strong \"don't ask questions about what isn't broken\" ethos there when it comes to terminology. I posted this link above, which is a google-published doc that's much, much clearer than the usual \"Help\" pages: https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/en... The DoubleClick Ad Exchange is a real-time marketplace to **buy** and sell display advertising space. Right off the bat, that's an awfully good sign that AdX is the exchange, not the publisher network. This also meshes with the image published by the DoJ[1] showing \"DoubleClick for Publishers\" as the pub network that you're referring to, and \"Google AdExchange\" as the omnipresent exchange that people who are neither buying nor selling through google must nonetheless go through if they want to leverage the wider ecosystem. It goes on like this, e.g.: ### Who Participates in the Ad Exchange? 1. The large online publishers (sellers)—websites like portals, entertainment sites and news sites 2. **Ad networks and agency holding companies** that operate networks (buyers)—companies that connect web sites with advertisers Of course anyone, Facebook included, can setup their own walled garden for direct ad sales, and AFAIU big fish like NYT and CNN do that already, not to mention the separate search ads ecosystem. But to take part in the wider algorithmic Display Ad sales market, my understanding of the DoJ's complaint is that you're (de facto) mandated to use Google's exchange. But, again; I struggled to understand these distinctions even with access to internal explainers, and the doc I linked is at least somewhat OOD (it mentions AdWords, which was retired in 2018[2]). So I could easily just be somewhat slow and mistaken on this complex issue :) [1] https://www.justice.gov/d9/styles/d09/public/press-releases/...

Also, my understanding is that even on google platform, there is Doubleclick for publishers, but there are other tools: AdSense and AdMob, which are very simple and without much lock in, publisher can move out whenever he wants.

    "originBody": "A good day to trie-hard: saving compute 1% at a time 2024-09-10 Kevin Guthrie 7 min read Cloudflare’s global network handles a lot of HTTP requests – over 60 million per second on average. That in and of itself is not news, but it is the starting point to an adventure that started a few months ago and ends with the announcement of a new open-source Rust crate that we are using to reduce our CPU utilization, enabling our CDN to handle even more of the world’s ever-increasing Web traffic. Motivation Let’s start at the beginning. You may recall a few months ago we released Pingora (the heart of our Rust-based proxy services) as an open-source project on GitHub. I work on the team that maintains the Pingora framework, as well as Cloudflare’s production services built upon it. One of those services is responsible for the final step in transmitting users’ (non-cached) requests to their true destination. Internally, we call the request’s destination server its “origin”, so our service has the (unimaginative) name of “pingora-origin”. One of the many responsibilities of pingora-origin is to ensure that when a request leaves our infrastructure, it has been cleaned to remove the internal information we use to route, measure, and optimize traffic for our customers. This has to be done for every request that leaves Cloudflare, and as I mentioned above, it’s a lot of requests. At the time of writing, the rate of requests leaving pingora-origin (globally) is 35 million requests per second. Any code that has to be run per-request is in the hottest of hot paths, and it’s in this path that we find this code and comment: // PERF: heavy function: 1.7% CPU time pub fn clear_internal_headers(request_header: &mut RequestHeader) { INTERNAL_HEADERS.iter().for_each(|h| { request_header.remove_header(h); }); } This small and pleasantly-readable function consumes more than 1.7% of pingora-origin’s total cpu time. To put that in perspective, the total cpu time consumed by pingora-origin is 40,000 compute-seconds per second. You can think of this as 40,000 saturated CPU cores fully dedicated to running pingora-origin. Of those 40,000, 1.7% (680) are only dedicated to evaluating clear_internal_headers. The function’s heavy usage and simplicity make it seem like a great place to start optimizing. Benchmarking Benchmarking the function shown above is straightforward because we can use the wonderful criterion Rust crate. Criterion provides an api for timing rust code down to the nanosecond by aggregating multiple isolated executions. It also provides feedback on how the performance improves or regresses over time. The input for the benchmark is a large set of synthesized requests with a random number of headers with a uniform distribution of internal vs. non-internal headers. With our tooling and test data we find that our original clear_internal_headers function runs in an average of 3.65µs. Now for each new method of clearing headers, we can measure against the same set of requests and get a relative performance difference. Reducing Reads One potentially quick win is to invert how we find the headers that need to be removed from requests. If you look at the original code, you can see that we are evaluating request_header.remove_header(h) for each header in our list of internal headers, so 100+ times. Diagrammatically, it looks like this: Since an average request has significantly fewer than 100 headers (10-30), flipping the lookup direction should reduce the number of reads while yielding the same intersection. Because we are working in Rust (and because retain does not exist for http::HeaderMap yet), we have to collect the identified internal headers in a separate step before removing them from the request. Conceptually, it looks like this: Using our benchmarking tool, we can measure the impact of this small change, and surprisingly this is already a substantial improvement. The runtime improves from 3.65µs to 1.53µs. That’s a 2.39x speed improvement for our function. We can calculate the theoretical CPU percentage by multiplying the starting utilization by the ratio of the new and old times: 1.71% * 1.53 / 3.65 = 0.717%. Unfortunately, if we subtract that from the original 1.71% that only equates to saving 1.71% - 0.717% = 0.993% of the total CPU time. We should be able to do better. Searching Data Structures Now that we have reorganized our function to search a static set of internal headers instead of the actual request, we have the freedom to choose what data structure we store our header name in simply by changing the type of INTERNAL_HEADER_SET. pub fn clear_internal_headers(request_header: &mut RequestHeader) { let to_remove = request_header .headers .keys() .filter_map(|name| INTERNAL_HEADER_SET.get(name)) .collect::>(); to_remove.into_iter().for_each(|k| { request_header.remove_header(k); }); Our first attempt used std::HashMap, but there may be other data structures that better suit our needs. All computer science students were taught at some point that hash tables are great because they have constant-time asymptotic behavior, or O(1), for reading. (If you are not familiar with big O notation, it is a way to express how an algorithm consumes a resource, in this case time, as the input size changes.) This means no matter how large the map gets, reads always take the same amount of time. Too bad this is only partially true. In order to read from a hash table, you have to compute the hash. Computing a hash for strings requires reading every byte, so while read time for a hashmap is constant over the table’s size, it’s linear over key length. So, our goal is to find a data structure that is better than O(L) where L is the length of the key. There are a few common data structures that provide for reads that have read behavior that meets our criteria. Sorted sets like BTreeSet use comparisons for searching, and that makes them logarithmic over key length O(log(L)), but they are also logarithmic in size too. The net effect is that even very fast sorted sets like FST work out to be a little (50 ns) slower in our benchmarks than the standard hashmap. State machines like parsers and regex are another common tool for searching for strings, though it’s hard to consider them data structures. These systems work by accepting input one unit at a time and determining on each step whether or not to keep evaluating. Being able to make these determinations at every step means state machines are very fast to identify negative cases (i.e. when a string is not valid or not a match). This is perfect for us because only one or two headers per request on average will be internal. In fact, benchmarking an implementation of clear_internal_headers using regular expressions clocks in as taking about twice as long as the hashmap-based solution. This is impressively fast given that regexes, while powerful, aren't known for their raw speed. This approach feels promising – we just need something in between a data structure and a state machine. That’s where the trie comes in. Don’t Just Trie A trie (pronounced like “try” or “tree”) is a type of tree data structure normally used for prefix searches or auto-complete systems over a known set of strings. The structure of the trie lends itself to this because each node in the trie represents a substring of characters found in the initial set. The connections between the nodes represent the characters that can follow a prefix. Here is a small example of a trie built from the words: “and”, “ant”, “dad”, “do”, & “dot”. The root node represents an empty string prefix, so the two lettered edges directed out of it are the only letters that can appear as the first letter in the list of strings, “a” and “d”. Subsequent nodes have increasingly longer prefixes until the final valid words are reached. This layout should make it easy to see how a trie could be useful for quickly identifying strings that are not contained. Even at the root node, we can eliminate any strings that are presented that do not start with “a” or “d”. This paring down of the search space on every step gives reading from a trie the O(log(L)) we were looking for … but only for misses. Hits within a trie are still O(L), but that’s okay, because we are getting misses over 90% of the time. Benchmarking a few trie implementations from crates.io was disheartening. Remember, most tries are used in response to keyboard events, so optimizing them to run in the hot path of tens of millions of requests per second is not a priority. The fastest existing implementation we found was radix_trie, but it still clocked in at a full microsecond slower than hashmap. The only thing left to do was write our own implementation of a trie that was optimized for our use case. Trie Hard And we did! Today we are announcing trie-hard. The repository gives a full description of how it works, but the big takeaway is that it gets its speed from storing node relationships in the bits of unsigned integers and keeping the entire tree in a contiguous chunk of memory. In our benchmarks, we found that trie-hard reduced the average runtime for clear_internal_headers to under a microsecond (0.93µs). We can reuse the same formula from above to calculate the expected CPU utilization for trie-hard to be 1.71% * 3.65 / 0.93 = 0.43% That means we have finally achieved and surpassed our goal by reducing the compute utilization of pingora-origin by 1.71% - 0.43% = 1.28%! Up until now we have been working only in theory and local benchmarking. What really matters is whether our benchmarking reflects real-life behavior. Trie-hard has been running in production since July 2024, and over the course of this project we have been collecting performance metrics from the running production of pingora-origin using a statistical sampling of its stack trace over time. Using this technique, the CPU utilization percentage of a function is estimated by the percent of samples in which the function appears. If we compare the sampled performance of the different versions of clear_internal_headers, we can see that the results from the performance sampling closely match what our benchmarks predicted. Implementation Stack trace samples containing clear_internal_headers Actual CPU Usage (%) Predicted CPU Usage (%) Original 19 / 1111 1.71 n/a Hashmap 9 / 1103 0.82 0.72 trie-hard 4 / 1171 0.34 0.43 Conclusion Optimizing functions and writing new data structures is cool, but the real conclusion for this post is that knowing where your code is slow and by how much is more important than how you go about optimizing it. Take a moment to thank your observability team (if you're lucky enough to have one), and make use of flame graphs or any other profiling and benchmarking tool you can. Optimizing operations that are already measured in microseconds may seem a little silly, but these small improvements add up.

In fact, if you preseed, you are basically combining these ideas but fixing how many internal headers are on each request. At that point, you can use a linked hash table that preserves creation order and just remove the first N from the final list that you send back to clients. reply amluto 2 hours agorootparent> At that point, you can use a linked hash table that preserves creation order and just remove the first N from the final list that you send back to clients.

Does rust not have the equivalent of a LinkedHashMap from Java? All I'm proposing is to start each map of headers off with a sentinel value for all of the headers you don't intend to send back to the client. Then, have a method that iterates over all values, for the places you need to send to internal servers, and another (probably the default?) that starts iteration after all of the internal items, which should just be a different pointer. At this point, there is no need to inspect each header by name, as that was effectively done at compile time when you put the protected headers at the front of the list. Is this somewhat special? I mean, sure. But it wasn't long ago that a hash table was already in the special territory of data structures. Edit: I should add that I'm not certain this idea would be better. Just more ideas on what you could do. reply amluto 2 hours agorootparentThere’s a third party crate for this. C++’s STL also doesn’t have it by default. The creation-order-preserving hash map is basically two data structures in one, it’s more complex and slower than a normal hash map, and IMO it’s rather bizarre and I have never really understood why anyone wants one. reply taeric 1 hour agorootparentI would be surprised if it was dramatically slower, all told. Though, fair that I have not benchmarked in a long time, here. My main \"idea\" here is to stop from having to check all of the headers on a \"per header\" basis. Yes, you can make each check faster, as the TRIE does. You can also remove the entire reason to check individual headers by starting a traversal after where the internal headers are. You could also go with something like making sure the first header is \"InternalHeaderCount: N\" where you then keep the internal headers segregated form the others by a simple count. (This assumes you have solid control over what is adding the headers internally, of course.) (I also forgot to give kudos on the blog title. Any Die Hard reference is a good reference. :D ) reply Conscat 1 hour agorootparentprevIt's especially unfortunate that the intuitive name, `std::map`, is that ordered and generally least useful option of the standard library's three hash map containers.

This optimization makes the situation better, but the solution (which is underway) is to use a different mechanism for IPC and get rid of the use of HTTP headers completely. reply throwaway77385 3 hours agorootparentFor anyone not in the loop, the above poster (JGC) is Cloudflare's CTO himself :) reply alex_suzuki 1 hour agorootparentprevYou chiming in on this post makes me slightly bitter at having gone with CloudFront (I have everything on AWS so it seemed the obvious choice) instead of Cloudflare. reply amluto 3 hours agorootparentprevI’m certainly familiar with systems growing over time and outgrowing their original schema. Is this the same phenomenon that resulted in Cloudflare Tunnels apparently being domain names? Or why domains that are proxied by Cloudflare show up as “CNAME” in the DNS panel?

Where we fail is not calling it that. Instead we just call some code “good” while our thicker skinned coworkers call the rest “fine”. It’s not fine. I don’t want to be working overtime the week of thanksgiving because you can’t think past the horizon. reply gmueckl 1 hour agorootparentThere is a very fine line between \"good enough\" and \"not good enough\" in any product beyond a certain complexity. Finding the pieces that cross that line can be hard and improving \"good enough\" parts is (sadly) mostly a waste of time in commercial settings. reply hinkley 59 minutes agorootparentYou have to backdate starting a project so it happens before things stop being good enough. And take into account bad estimates and the five other deadlines between then and now. Often it’s better to clean as you go. If you have the time and the inclination, shore up one of the least good enough things. It’s not unheard of to open up new feature sets via refactoring. Something that previously would have taken an “impossible” amount of time now becomes profitable, not just possible. reply didgetmaster 41 minutes agorootparentprevThis is why some bugs never get fixed (that is if you define a bug to include inefficient code and not just code that breaks something). reply DamonHD 3 hours agorootparentprevAnd when that happy day dawns, slightly sadly, this nice optimisation will evaporate! reply jgrahamc 2 hours agorootparentMaybe the real treasure was the optimizations we made and discarded along the way. reply DamonHD 2 hours agorootparentIndeed. I am very happy with some of the tricks that I developed (speeding up, and indeed allowing, Solaris C++ linking by prefiltering on MD5 hashes of canonicalised .o files -> nm, anyone?) even though they were lost without trace (yep, Lehman Brothers, where are my Imakefiles now?)... reply jkaptur 1 hour agorootparentThey're probably as critical as ever at Barclays :) reply DamonHD 1 hour agorootparentI really hope not, given that that very old Solaris compiler should have been laid to rest many many years ago. Yes, some of my stuff had kinda made it into BarCap (even onto my desktop dev machine!) when I turned up there later, and even some at Nomura when I turned up there again IIRC! reply 620gelato 3 hours agoparentprevOr perhaps even, insert yet another header with just the list of internal headers being added to the request, assuming this happens at a single place, otherwise a recipe for disaster. I have a slightly different example of this, where a rpc framework used in my company disallows the service owner from modifying certain headers (say request identifier), and will instead create a duplicate header with a suffix. In that scenario at least, I can see this as a fairly reasonable tradeoff, as the goal is to control certain headers from being modified, not because they are platform internal but because there are certain assumptions associated with those headers that are followed company-wide. I'll go check what mechanism is used for this matching. reply amluto 1 hour agorootparentThis doesn’t work if the front end is older than an internal node and a header gets added, at least not without extra logic to patch everything up and handle conflicts. The HTTP Connection header works like this, and one should generally assume that almost nothing implements it correctly. reply pragma_x 23 minutes agoprevIt took me a moment to ponder the effectiveness of mapping utf8 characters into a bitmask. At first, it seemed unwise. Then I realized that 32 bits would get you `a-z` plus six special characters, and 64 bits would get you 'A-Z' (uppercase) plus six more. That's plenty of room for HTTP headers, and for a blazing fast matching algorithm since it just masks and compares a couple integers. Even figuring out which bit corresponds to which character is a simple lookup into a 256-word table. One thing the author leaves out is this technique is technically a Bloom Filter. I find these kinds of things fascinating since they came about in an era where computing was far more resource bound than today (1970 in this case). But here we are, still finding real-world corners to use the same old optimizations. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter reply o11c 2 minutes agoprevThat late in the process, does it even need to support efficient lookup? Could it just be a Vec? reply mightyham 2 hours agoprevI'm not very well versed in data structure optimization, but I was surprised they dismissed hash tables so quickly, especially when the table they are searching through is static. I find it somewhat hard to believe that a specially optimized hash table would not be faster than their trie implementation. reply 5kg 2 hours agoparentThere is FxHashMap (https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-hash) which is faster than std::collections::HashMap. With ~100 static entries, o1hash (https://github.com/rurban/smhasher/blob/master/o1hash.h) should also work. reply rapsey 1 hour agorootparentNote FxHashMap is just the std HashMap with a different hashing algorithm. reply supermatt 2 hours agoparentprevThey mentioned it is the overhead of the hashing that makes it slow compared to the trie. reply mightyham 2 hours agorootparentThe point I'm making is that a specially optimized hashing function would probably blow away any trie traversal. When you know the data being hashed before hand it is possible to make custom hash functions that are as simple as a few bitwise operations on the first, middle and last character of the string (just an example). reply dividuum 2 hours agorootparentRight. Out of curiosity I looked into what code gperf generates and it seems it would end up O(1) for misses (it's always three lookups into a generated table) and O(L) for hits, as a potential hit has to be confirmed by essentially a strcmp. Not sure how something like https://github.com/rust-phf/rust-phf would work, but probably similar? reply treis 1 hour agorootparentprevIsn't the sticky wicket collisions with external to CF defined headers? reply vlovich123 1 hour agorootparentprevIf they just used the default, that's SipHash which is optimized for security and DOS resistance, not performance. XXh3 is ~10x faster than that and there's some newer ones that are even faster than Xxh3 like GxHash (like another ~1.5x-2x faster). You would precompute the hash for the constant string list & then compute the hash only for for the set of strings that begin with C/c since \"cf-\" is a common prefix for those internal headers if I recall correctly, using RawTable to find entries by hash & then comparing against the precomputed value to see if a collision matched before checking a string for equality. reply hooli42 2 hours agorootparentprevHash functions can be as simple as a single modulo. reply ironman1478 1 hour agorootparentAs they said though, the hash function on a string type requires looking at every element in the string. Also, modulo is historically very slow. So, they still have to deal with O(n) operations, where n is the length of the input string. If they can improve the memory hopping problem associated with lists / graph structures (which they claim to have done in their library), then a trie could would be much fast enough, which is what they observed. Combined with the fact that they claim that 90% of the time there is a miss when querying the trie, then you exit early a lot, whereas you always need to compute the whole hash on the input string when doing the hash map strategy. reply mightyham 1 hour agorootparentThe hash does not need to be computed on the whole string. I pointed this out in my other comment but just as a example: a hash function could be as simple as xoring the first 16 and last 16 bits of the string then indexing a 2^16 array. That means hashing is two pointer offsets and an xor (no modulo required). If there are 100 strings that need to be removed, then ~99% of rejections will be a very fast O(1). And in the case of a match, a fast hash + memcmp will be way faster than a trie traversal. In fact, according to the trie-hard github readme, std::HashMap is already much faster than their trie implementation when searching for a match. reply hervature 1 hour agorootparentprev> As they said though, the hash function on a string type requires looking at every element in the string. Maybe for the default hash function. As another commenter pointed out, your data may make the following hash very effective: s[0] + s[len(s)//2] + s[-1] which would be very fast. The point being is spending a day seeing if such a hash exists is worth it. reply Scaevolus 3 hours agoprevDid you try a (tiny) bloom filter? Doing a quick convolution of the header key and a test against a bloom filter (SIMD? Using builtin CRC ops? 256-bit bloom filter size?) might avoid walking the trie altogether in most cases at the cost of a few cycles. reply pragma_x 11 minutes agoparentConsidering that each node's filter in their trie implementation is bloom-like already, the solution is awful close. I agree that testing wider swaths of the string at once might be a dramatic accelerator. A more naive approach might also be warranted. Some frequency analysis of hit/miss for trie nodes might allow them to find specific character positions with a higher miss rate than the first one. Testing such special positions first would speed things up. That assumes, of course, that the header data is fairly regular in nature. reply jgrahamc 2 hours agoparentprevI do not know if the team did that but Bloom filters aren't a panacea: https://blog.cloudflare.com/when-bloom-filters-dont-bloom/ reply Scaevolus 2 hours agorootparentYeah, for this problem you'd want a bloom filter that can entirely fit in vector registers during the computation, which should work well for a few hundred items. reply jkaptur 1 hour agoparentprevI think that would require calculating the hash, which was ruled out as too slow. reply maciek12 17 minutes agoprevAm i missing something or is the big O notation in this article wrong? For example in \"Sorted sets like BTreeSet use comparisons for searching, and that makes them logarithmic over key length O(log(L)), but they are also logarithmic in size too\" how is the search done in logarithmic time? You could have a header that differs from an internal one only on the last character and then you have to read the whole thing. Also space-wise B-trees are linear, not O(nlogn). Additionally, at the end when talking about the trie, how do you achieve O(log(L)) for misses? Tries are not balanced, they do not halve the possible set on comparison (as I think the author states) and even if they did I don't see how that achieves the logarithmic time. reply evmar 3 hours agoprevThis post uses a fancy data structure to construct a to_remove set, then iterates through it to remove these from the underlying header map. It appears the \"remove_header\" call is this one: https://docs.rs/pingora-http/0.3.0/src/pingora_http/lib.rs.h... which calls .remove() on two other data structures, both of which bottom out in this mountain of code: https://docs.rs/http/latest/src/http/header/map.rs.html#1550 reply miso2024 3 hours agoprevFinally a blog post with a trie.

It would be interesting to see how it compares to the trie. reply wolf550e 56 minutes agoprevI don't know Rust. Can someone explain how this data structure stores whether a node is itself a valid word or whether it only leads to more nodes? For example the node \"do\" in their (“and”, “ant”, “dad”, “do”, & “dot”) example. I guess it's a discriminated union provided by Rust algebraic data types or something like that, but why not show the full bit pattern in memory? reply SkiFire13 8 minutes agoparentBy looking at the source code [1] they have a discriminated union with 3 variants representing the possible combinations of representing a valid word and leading to more nodes (excluding the case where it is neither, which is impossible). So the node for the 'o' in \"do\" should be a `SearchOrLeaf` storing \"do\", its corresponding value (the `T`, in a set this would be empty) and the `SearchNode` containing the successors, which should only contain a 't' to \"dot\". [1]: https://github.com/cloudflare/trie-hard/blob/3d8163ca2d9208c... reply hyperpape 1 hour agoprevI'm interested to know why the regex crate didn't do better. I believe it should compile a search for multiple literal strings into an Aho-Corasick automaton, which is structured very much like a trie. reply burntsushi 42 minutes agoparentregex crate author here. From a quick look at trie-hard, my guess is that trie-hard can do lookups on short strings much more quickly than the regex crate can do matches on short strings. The regex crate has a fair bit of overhead for selecting the right matching engine and applying other optimizations appropriate to general purpose matching. But the aho-corasick crate, and especially the specific automatons, would be interesting to try. There's much less overhead there. But, there are some differences: * The contiguous NFA in aho-corasick has a lot more going on inside its \"next transition\" routine: https://github.com/BurntSushi/aho-corasick/blob/cd400ad792d6... --- This is primarily because an Aho-Corasick automaton isn't just a trie. It also has failure transitions to support unanchored search. You can search without respecting failure transitions (and thus treat it as a trie), but the code is still there to deal with failure transitions. So that may have deleterious effects. * The contiguous NFA also specializes its transition function depending on the size of the node. It would be interesting to see whether these techniques would be useful for trie-hard to play with. But there is definitely a benefit to keeping one simple and fast code path for all node types. (Less branching.) * The aho-corasick crate does also expose a DFA directly: https://docs.rs/aho-corasick/latest/aho_corasick/dfa/struct.... --- In theory this should do less work per transition than trie-hard, and so it would be very interesting to measure its perf when compared to trie-hard. The main downside is that it's a DFA and can use up a lot more memory and take longer to build. It seems like Cloudflare cares less about that in favor of optimizing read perf though, so it's not clear why they didn't go this route. * The aho-corasick crate doesn't let you store arbitrary values. You only get back a PatternID when a match occurs. So to get equivalent functionality as trie-hard, you'd need a separate map of PatternID->YourValue. Since that isn't stored with the data in the trie, this alone might penalize you quite a bit with poorer CPU cache performance. * trie-hard seems to provide some customization options for its representation. i.e., Let's you use a `u8` to store its transitions versus a `u128` or `u256`. This might also help with cache usage for a small enough trie. reply hencoappel 58 minutes agoprevGiven it's such a hot part of their code, I'm genuinely surprised they didn't go down the state machine route for as optimal a solution, or even further and made use of vector instructions.

The case stems back to 2016 when the European Commission ordered Ireland to recover up to 13 billion euros ($14.4 billion) in back taxes from Apple. The Commission said at the time Apple had received \"illegal\" tax benefits from Ireland over the course of two decades. In this article AAPL Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT Omar MarquesSopa ImagesLightrocketGetty Images Europe's top court ruled against Apple on Tuesday in the tech giant's 10-year court battle over its tax affairs in Ireland. The case stems back to 2016 when the European Commission ordered Ireland to recover up to 13 billion euros ($14.4 billion) in back taxes from Apple. The European Court of Justice's decision comes hours after the company unveiled new products to revitalize its iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPod lineups. Apple shares were down about 1%. In a statement, the Irish government said that the Apple case \"involved an issue that is now of historical relevance only,\" adding that its position has always been that it \"does not give preferential tax treatment to any companies or taxpayers.\" Apple said in a filing on Tuesday that it will incur a one-time income tax charge of about $10 billion in its fourth fiscal quarter ending Sept. 28, 2024. The government noted it will now begin the process of transferring the assets in the escrow fund to Ireland. \"This case has never been about how much tax we pay, but which government we are required to pay it to. We always pay all the taxes we owe wherever we operate and there has never been a special deal,\" an Apple spokesperson said. \"The European Commission is trying to retroactively change the rules and ignore that, as required by international tax law, our income was already subject to taxes in the US.\" The case to date In 2014, the European Commission, the European Union's executive arm, opened an investigation into Apple's tax payments in Ireland, the tech giant's headquarters in the EU. European Union antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager holds a press conference after Europe's top court ruling on Apple's fight against an order by EU competition regulators to pay a record 13 billion euros in back taxes to Ireland, in Brussels, Belgium September 10, 2024. Johanna GeronReuters The commission in 2016 ordered Dublin to recover up to 13 billion euros ($14.4 billion) in back taxes from Apple, at the time saying that the tech company had received \"illegal\" tax benefits from Ireland over the course of two decades. Apple and Ireland appealed the commission's decision in 2019, and in 2020 the EU General Court sided with the U.S. tech giant. The EU's second-highest court annulled the commission's 2016 decision and said that the executive arm did not prove that the Irish government had given Apple a tax advantage. The commission in turn appealed the General Court's decision, sending the litigation up to the ECJ. The ECJ on Tuesday set aside the General Court's decision and confirmed the commission's original 2016 ruling. The case, which first began under outgoing competition chief Margrethe Vestager, highlights the continued conflict between U.S. tech giants and the EU, which has sought to tackle issues from data protection to taxation and antitrust. This was not the last time that Apple found itself in the EU's crosshairs. Most recently, the commission hit Apple with an antitrust fine of 1.8 billion euros in March for abusing its dominant position in the market for the distribution of music streaming apps. Separately, the EU's sweeping Digital Markets Act has forced companies to change some of their practices in Europe. The commission has opened various investigations under the DMA into tech giants, including Apple, Alphabet and Meta.

The only thing in question here is whether it was applying the same taxation rules to all companies, as granting special exceptions to certain companies could be viewed as state aid (which is not allowed). Ireland claimed it wasn't, the current (over-)ruling says otherwise. This case is also specific to tax rules from many years back. AFAIK the rules have subsequently been tightened and the exemption no longer exists. reply vasco 23 minutes agoparentI think you make it seem like EU doesn't care at all about what member states do in regards to taxation but there's many limitations to what can be done by any member state in order to harmonize and prevent corruption etc. This in practice makes the EU have a lot of say in regards to taxation. Moreover the EU has special rules to limit moving funds to jurisdictions that have taxes that are deemed too low (read tax havens) - this directly implies no member state has agency to lower their own taxes as much. Here's some example limitations: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/EN/legal-content/summary/tackling-... I focused on direct taxation, but in indirect taxation I think there's even more examples. reply hinkley 14 minutes agorootparentMaybe they should do it like Roth IRAs.

If Ireland is willing to give the same tax incentive to any company hiring X people in Ireland, it's fine.

See eg https://competition-policy.ec.europa.eu/state-aid/legislatio... reply jemmyw 6 hours agorootparentprevKind of. It's already prohibited, depending on what you mean.

It seems like Ireland did the thing that's against the rules by offering the deal, not Apple? Obviously they worked on it together, but it feels odd that Ireland has now essentially gotten all the benefits of offering this illegal deal by having Apple do business there and now also gets all the back taxes that Apple probably wouldn't have paid to Ireland if they hadn't gotten the deal.

Apparently, Apple wrote to the Irish tax authorities, and said \"this is how we plan to calculate our taxes\" and the Irish tax authority said \"okay, no problem, that works for us\" and the EU commission investigated some years later, and said \"wait, was that method of calculating taxes available to all Irish companies? We don't think so, so now Ireland has to collect taxes from all the way back many years.\" Ireland said \"no bro, we're all good, they don't owe us anything\", and Apple said \"wait, we just did what we were told to do, and we already paid taxes on that income in the US instead of the EU, you can't retroactively change the rules\" and the EU top court just said \"Sorry, those tax rules go against EU law, and yes we can\" pyrale 7 minutes agorootparentprev> It seems like Ireland did the thing that's against the rules by offering the deal, not Apple?

There's also a perverse incentive for companies to defer paying taxes for 20 years.

I'm not so sure of this, though.

That’s literally the whole point of the EU (or specifically a single market) Effectively - your hypothetical proposed ‘apple law’ would, at some point in the Irish law passing process, be found to be incompatible with their commitments to being in the EU, and I assume it would be then an unconstitutional law. The price of admittance to the EU is basically having this process and constitution.

Ireland's law said they could do this. The EU says that's wrong, and Ireland is seemingly getting a reward for doing something illegal that the EU didn't decide was illegal for almost 30 years? Again, not disputing that this is legally accurate to how things work, but that definitely strikes me as an environment that a lot of businesses would find hard to work with. Other smaller startups I've worked with had Irish branches because it was a good way to hire devs and governments gave us some incentives.

This is not correct, it is only practically true in trivial cases. Excess taxation is a very real pain point for Americans living overseas, never mind the other indefensible things the US government does to its expats like FATCA. Many types of income cannot be offset nor or they covered by tax treaties. Every time there is an impedance mismatch between US tax code and foreign tax code, including basic things like classification of income, deductions, and exemptions, you can end up with liabilities in both countries.

If I didn't get a mortgage then I would still be saving for my home. The same is true with the US balance sheet. It has accrued 35T in debt, but it's used that to fund it's operations.

Retroactive application of arm's length principle The Court's reliance on the arm's length principle, despite acknowledging it's not required by EU law, is problematic. As stated in paragraph 124: > \"Article 107(1) TFEU gives the Commission the right to check whether the level of profit allocated to such branches... corresponds to the level of profit that would have been obtained if that activity had been carried on under market conditions.\" This retroactive application of a principle not explicitly required by law at the time of the tax rulings is unfair and creates legal uncertainty for businesses. 2. Burden of proof The Court's criticism of the General Court's approach to evidence, as noted in paragraph 245, lowers the burden of proof for the Commission in State aid cases: > \"As the Commission stated in recital 441 of the decision at issue, its approach is based on an infringement of Article 107(1) TFEU, which has been part of Ireland's legal order since its accession in 1973, and not on a failure to have regard to the framework defined at OECD level.\" This shift unfairly advantages the Commission in future cases and will lead to increased challenges to legitimate tax arrangements. But, overall, yes, I get the concerns about legal certainty and applying rules retroactively. They're valid points. But when I weigh everything, I still think this ruling does more good than harm. It's a big step towards fairer taxes and more transparency in how big companies operate. Yes, it might ruffle some feathers in the short term.

Just like the concept of 'treason' can be abused to say declare criticism undermining the state, 'spirit of the law' could be invoked in that case to argue that literally anything which reduces government revenue is undermining the spirit of the law in taxation.

Doesn't the burden of non-compliance be on the party that broke the EU rules and not the company who complied with all the rules? Several questions arise: - Was Apple breaking any rules in those years when they had the deal with the government? - How can any company be sure that if they comply with current tax laws they won't be back charged in the future? - Isn't that a bad precedent of \"we change the rules now\", but will punish you for you past behavior for non-complying with the new rules? (e.g. why don't charge back the increase in taxes for this year for the past 3 years) These are not related to the ethical/moral or fairness evaluation of the situation.

That ultimately the taxes owed should probably be paid out to the countries where the sale occurs. As one country reaping the rewards of the tax for the entire European operation would be bizarre, when that country just has a medium sized support/sales operation (which was what Ireland was originally collecting tax on). Does this also have the knock on affect that these companies can now write off this tax so their owed US taxes are much less (assuming they ever repatriate these earning - which they have often avoided to avoid paying US tax)? Anyways, writing the above shows me how much I don't understand about these cases. reply s_dev 4 hours agoparentOther countries aren't getting it -- afaik that was a possibility regarding fall back mechanisms should their primary argument collapse before this ruling. The EU has won their primary case and thus Ireland must be forced to collect an spend it. This is will force a political crisis as the government is complaining it has no money to build houses. So all the those comments saying other EU countries just has to sue Ireland to get some of that won't happen.

Corporate income tax is just a fundamentally bad tax. It's hard to enforce, even with good will it's hard to calculate (is paying $X for a license a legit expense or not?), unjust (buying more expensive things to provide the same service leads to paying less tax) it sets incentives to mix corporate and private use of resources, it incentivizes building holding companies to use losses of one entity to offset tax of another, it gives big players an advantage and it gives dishonest players an advantage.

It doesn't provide enough revenue to be worth all the hassle with enforcement and accounting. reply ajsnigrutin 6 hours agoparentprev> That ultimately the taxes owed should probably be paid out to the countries where the sale occurs. This is hard to implement in practice. Imagine selling in a country with 50% tax, and having a country with 10% somehwere, anywhere in the world. For easier math, let's say you buy dildos from a chinese manufacture for 1eur (including shipping), and sell them for 11eur to end customers. You've just earned 10eur, and you're taxed 5eur, giving you 5eur of profit. What you then do is open a company in a low-tax country, the company is \"completely independent\" and the owner (your cousin) works with both the manufacturer and you. You buy the dildos from your cousin for 10eur, he buys them from china for 1eur has them shipped directly to you, and you sell them for 11eur. So, your cousin earned 9eur, and will pay 10% tax on that (90c, 8.10eur of profit) and you earned 1eur, and will pay 50% tax on that (50c, 50c of profit for you). So instead of paying 5eur in tax, you only paid 1.40eur, and pocketed 8.6eur. Yes, there are some additional costs (another company + paperwork, some percentage for your cousin) but you still earned more. The same can be done with patents and licences, branding deals, etc. Company in rich country made 100M of profits... just have the company in a cheap-tax country charge them 99M for licencing, 1M gets taxed in the expensive-tax country, and 99M in the cheap one. reply Retric 6 hours agorootparentMultinational corporations have subsidiaries not cousins.

I worked many years for an american/canadian/global company in europe. The software WE developed would be owned by a separate company entity. Whenever we sold \"OUR\" software systems to our real local customers, \"we\" would 'borrow/rent' OUR software from that separate entity, at a hefty silly price. Incidentally, that silly price was so high, that \"we\" (our company entity) would consistently produce a loss each year (even though our parent entity was raking it in, through that separate entity and the silly-price money we were transferring to them). Those losses of course are tax deductible, so our company would consistently pay zero taxes or worse (I don't know if they were also able to trigger things like the state having to reimburse them..) It is/was, as far as I know, totally legal and totally disgusting :-/.

If they have a grievance then they can go through the EU courts like Germany did with the Apple case. Big countries signed up to a common market without tax harmonisation and they would leave if it wasn't working for them, just like the UK did.

Also, we accept the fact that in capitalism companies have the goal to maximize profit, but the purpose of a country is not to maximize tax income compared to others reply xbmcuser 10 hours agorootparentA country purpose is to give the best living conditions to its population if that means collecting more tax without directly taxing it population then they are using the most optimum method just like apple with its shell corporations. My problem is with neither rather people giving apple and other corporations hand away absolution for their behavior just because capitalism reply surgical_fire 9 hours agorootparentprev> we accept the fact that in capitalism companies have the goal to maximize profit Not by committing tax avoidance. This is why stronger regulations and tax laws are welcome. I fully expect every corporation to pursue profit no matter how illegal their actions are, and no matter gow much damage they cause to society. reply RickarySanchez 10 hours agorootparentprevYeah the purpose of a country is to maximize the opportunity of its citizens which is exactly what Ireland is doing. They're not trying to maximize tax income otherwise they would have a higher rate reply moomin 9 hours agorootparentAnd it is welcome to leave the EU and cut whatever deals they like if they think that's gonna benefit their citizens. But they're not going to do that, because the value of being in the EU vastly outstrips the inconvenience of this judgement. reply jajko 9 hours agorootparentprevIreland is part of much bigger bloc, and milking it hard since Apple couldn't care less about some irrelevant tiny island nation. The only interesting part of it, it can 'hack' into EU via dodgy tax deals that circumvent EU policies. Not 100% sure if its illegal, but its highly amoral, no questions there. Here in Europe we don't like that, money is not above else, greed is not good. The view on this topic boils down largely where your opinion on above stands. At the end, Apple is just another greedy amoral corporation, just like the rest. Which is fine on its own, but would be nice if some folks would be less fanatical about that brand and got a bit more... balanced view on reality. reply piltdownman 9 hours agorootparentAnd what part of Germany or the Benelux do you hail from? Also \"money is not above else, greed is not good\" is absolutely not the policy of the major economic powers in the European Continent. The 2008 banking crisis and the subsequent austerity imposed on Ireland by the IMF as a consequence of bailing out unsecured bondholder in European Banks in order to stop a contagion effect completely refutes that notion. reply RickarySanchez 10 hours agorootparentprevWell they're not trying to screw over the rest of Europe. They're just gaining a competitive advantage by offering favorable deals. Its something that countries have been doing for much of their existence. To claim their screwing over the rest of Europe is just anti-competitive nonsense. The Netherlands does the same stuff just not as successfully reply Etheryte 10 hours agorootparentYeah no, there's a very big difference between being a country all by itself and being a part of the EU. If you want to be in the EU, you have to play by its rules, that's a part of the deal. You can't only get the upsides of the shared market, but not follow the rest of the rulebook that actually make the whole thing work. reply fransje26 9 hours agorootparentprev> The Netherlands does the same stuff just not as successfully Well, that's absolutely not orthogonal to the \"screwing over Europe\" statement. That simply makes two countries trying to gain an unfair competitive advantage. Nicely hypocritical from the Netherlands by the way, as they are always the ones on their high horses complaining about the financial laxness of the southern and eastern European countries, while at the same time draining them of tax revenues through such constructs. reply Woeps 9 hours agorootparentRegarding the Netherlands, It looked like they where working and making good progress of dismantling this system. But in the end it was all a façade and feet dragging... Now I just hope that with our current government it wont get worse. But hey, we voted for these muppets. So if the EU again fines us we deserve it. reply mytailorisrich 10 hours agoparentprevSurely an EU company, if big enough, could have moved to Ireland and negotiated a similar deal. I understand that the issue here is the nature of the deal with a specific company, but the EU does not want member states to have too much leeway to cut taxes in any case. They have set minima for corporation tax and VAT, for instance. Ultimately this is a question of competitive advantage and of ways for small, peripheric countries to survive and prosper. If everything was the same everywhere in the EU, then why would companies pick Ireland? The US have \"domestic tax-heavens\" and the country is not falling apart... The EU isn't at risk, either, including because of the huge VAT levels compared to corporation tax. Effectively, I think this boils down to powerful EU states who want to have high taxes and don't want others to undercut them. It's odd that the view here, at least among Europeans, seems to be that the higher the taxes the better when the issue is obviously much more complex. reply marcyb5st 9 hours agorootparentThe major problem is that Ireland, Netherlands, and Luxembourg also have veto powers when it comes to EU wide regulations. Luckily they understood this was alienating the other EU members and so they conceded to a minimum of 15% taxation rate [1] [1] https://taxation-customs.ec.europa.eu/taxation/business-taxa... reply mytailorisrich 9 hours agorootparentYes, they are small and weak and had to concede to the big and powerful... And \"alienating\" is exactly my point: Those big and powerful don't want others to set lower tax rates than they have. reply marcyb5st 7 hours agorootparentFair, but then you should allow other countries tax stuff however they want. It's not fair saying \"Ireland can lower taxes as much as they want for big tech, but countries that are food producers can't tax exports to Ireland a bit more to make up for the loss of income due to Ireland's taxation rate\". And if you allow that, what is the point of the European Union? reply izacus 9 hours agorootparentprevNo, the 25 other states don't want them to set those tax rates. reply surgical_fire 9 hours agorootparentprevThis is not a bad thing. In isolation those countries would be weaker, and would have a lot less negotiating power against bigger countries. reply meiraleal 8 hours agorootparentprevThe Netherlands is the 5th biggest EU economy. reply seydor 10 hours agorootparentprev> an EU company, if big enough, could have moved to Ireland and negotiated a similar deal. Probably not, because their home country would go after them / make Ireland liable. These kinds of schemes usually work across jurisdictions reply mytailorisrich 9 hours agorootparentHmm, \"move to Ireland\" means \"home country\" becomes Ireland. Obviously. Companies can do that, and in fact they do that. Fiat merged with Peugeot and suddenly the company is headquartered in the Netherlands, not France or Italy, for similar reasons. reply seydor 9 hours agorootparentIn that case the EU would deem the state aid that the company receives is illegal. This is actually what this ruling claims, that Apple received illegal state aid. reply mytailorisrich 9 hours agorootparentI understand but that's not really the point of my comment. This is just the first line that replies in passing to the previous one... reply seydor 9 hours agorootparentAh well, the EU does have tax havens and it will keep them after this ruling. But there are limits because after all the EU can't be a fair open market if one state gives out so huge state subsidies. reply riffraff 10 hours agorootparentprev> Surely an EU company, if big enough, could have moved to Ireland and negotiated a similar deal. yeah but \"negotiate\" is not how this is supposed to be, because it creates a non-level playing field. If I planned to move my single-person enterprise to Ireland I should be able to get the same deal as Apple did without having friends in the government. One can argue that countries should be able to do this, but EU countries have agreed not to do it. reply anonymous344 10 hours agorootparentprevus is falling apart did u see how much they printed usd? the pay gap, vanishing middle-class, stealing resources from all over planet.. reply actionfromafar 10 hours agorootparentprevThe US is a country, though. reply linotype 10 hours agoprevWhat does \"illegal\" mean? Why is it in quotes? Did they break the law or not? If they didn't break the law, if they adhered to the deal they negotiated with Ireland, isn't this a dangerous precedent? You can just ignore deals because you (EU) said so? Edit: Please downvote me if you must but also post a comment about why I'm wrong. Thanks! reply ko27 10 hours agoparent> You can just ignore deals because you (EU) said so? Of course you can, because EU law has precedence over Ireland's deal in this situation. reply jokethrowaway 8 hours agorootparentI guess what comes as a shock is how much control the EU has. At the same time, if bureaucrauts in Ireland were a bit smarter they could have just written in a special exemption for companies with certain specific requirements - which end up being Apple and a few big ones. Apple was also pretty dumb to go to Ireland while Malta, Cyprus and Bulgaria offer pretty low taxes out of the box. I guess they did that to access UK talent / lower language barrier even if the fiscal setup was riskier. reply bluecalm 13 minutes agorootparentOr Ireland could just lower the tax for every company making it a level playing field. I am not a fan of EU economic ideas at all but I am happy they are starting to enforce this one. My country (Poland) has done such deals as well. Wanna start a small business? 19% corporate tax, 23% VAT, 19% cap gain tax. Some German car company thinking about opening a factory here? Let's offer 0 tax rate for many years + additional incentives! This really is demoralizing how they set rules for small guys but then give big incumbent companies everything they want. reply kwhitefoot 7 hours agorootparentprev> they could have just written in a special exemption for companies with certain specific requirements - which end up being Apple That's not how the law works. The courts look at the intent behind the law, the spirit of the law, as well as the text. It might take longer and more argument but would eventually be struck down as well. reply linotype 10 hours agorootparentprevEven if it was legal under the EU at the time? Maybe Ex Post Facto only applies in the US. reply simongray 9 hours agorootparentIt wasn't legal at the time, that's what's just been established by the verdict. Apple (uniquely) having a near zero tax rate is considered illegal state aid to a company. Private companies are supposed to operate on the same terms within each European country. reply mpweiher 9 hours agorootparentprevIt wasn't. reply delusional 9 hours agoparentprevCNBC likes to use quotes for emphasis. It's supposed to emphasize that the EU court believes the tax treatment from Ireland to be illegal. The EU isn't applying any penalty here, this is owed taxes that apple were not billed by the Irish tax authorities. Once you enter the EU, you forfeit part of your sovereignty. That's what Ireland failed to do here. There is no slippery slope. This is the very foundation of the union. reply droidist2 9 hours agorootparentIs that what you'd call \"scare quotes\"? reply InsomniacL 10 hours agoprevSeems wrong that Ireland cheated the system to attract tech companies then also gets a huge payout. reply oliwarner 8 hours agoparentAs Ireland are still saying, this €13bn (plus interest) is going to work against them. It's supposed to work against them, as a chilling effect for any company trying to work EU states against each other for preferential treatment. I'm sure Ireland will argue that they'll offer any multi-billion multinational this sort of treatment, but that's really the point. The EU doesn't want a race to the bottom and if EU-local businesses are unable to leverage this sort of accounting break, it's a massive leg up for external businesses. While this is a large lump, this fine covers a decade of accounts, and this final decision comes 32 quarters after the original fine. Each of those quarters could have paid this off from flat profit. They're doing okay. reply tankenmate 7 hours agorootparentWhile I largely agree, I don't think there is any fine involved; it is just a requirement for Ireland to collect taxes that the ECJ says Apple should have paid. Hence not a fine. reply oliwarner 4 hours agorootparentYou're right, of course, but Apple and Ireland won't see it that way ;) reply eesmith 9 hours agoparentprevI think you should be cautious about saying \"Ireland cheated the system\". The onus is placed more directly on the Irish tax authority, and then more broadly the government, and then more broadly the voting population, and only then the entire population. Consider how the ruling says \"Ireland had renounced tax revenue, which had given rise to a loss of State resources\". This means many people living in Ireland got less government resources than they would have, including people like children and immigrants who did not have the right to vote so cannot be said to have been involved in the cheating, even though they are part of Ireland. Legally speaking it's not a \"payout\" but \"recovery of unlawful state aid.\" reply InsomniacL 9 hours agorootparent> This means many people living in Ireland got less government resources than they would have No it doesn't. Ireland did this deal to benefit from it. What they lost from direct tax in one area they gained in others. Had Ireland not made this deal, it's unlikely it would have become the conduit for Apple profits from around the world. The subject of the ruling contains \"concerning tax rulings issued by Ireland in favour of Apple\" Just because a country has children and immigrants does not absolve it of criticism. reply izacus 9 hours agorootparentCan you explain where exactly did Ireland gain benefit from not collecting these taxes? reply Rinzler89 9 hours agorootparentBecause getting evenThere is just a tiny count employees in Ireland, mostly legal to run the sandwitch. Utter nonsense. Apple Ireland has more employees than Germany, France, Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden combined. There are employment quotas for the tax arrangements. > https://www.apple.com/ie/job-creation/ reply Supernaut 8 hours agorootparentprevThat is completely untrue. There are over six thousand people employed in their Irish HQ. reply izacus 7 hours agorootparentThat is a tiny amount in comparison to their 170.000 person workforce, isn't it? reply InsomniacL 9 hours agorootparentprevYou can google why do countries give tax breaks. Are you suggesting that Ireland did not benefit from this illegal deal? reply fredski42 8 hours agorootparent> You can google Can we write “search”? Google is hardly a usefull search engine anymore. reply izacus 9 hours agorootparentprevYes, I'm suggesting that Ireland as a country did not benefit from this deal. That does not mean that some Irish individuals did not. reply InsomniacL 9 hours agorootparentApple Ireland has over 60 open positions for roles like Machine Leaning or Data Analytics while similar sized countries like Finland, Lithuania, Croatia, Denmark, Slovakia, Austria, Hungary have 0. Apple Ireland is home to Apples only self-operated manufacturing plant in the world employing ~6,000 people building iMacs to order by hand (lol). There are employment quotas to meet for the tax arrangements which is one example of how Ireland as a whole benefits. reply exe34 1 hour agorootparentprevso they lost on the unit and will make it back in volume? reply eesmith 6 hours agorootparentprev> What they lost from direct tax in one area they gained in others. Where is your evidence? I quoted the court decision to support my position. The very existence of revolving door politics is an example of how conflicts of interest can exist which favor those in power, to the overall detriment of the population. Government officials and politicians are well aware there may be a cushy job for them with the big companies they once regulated, so long as those companies are happy with them. Thus I again caution on using \"Ireland\" in a way which blurs the difference between those in Ireland who gained from unlawful state aid and those who gain from its return. reply csomar 10 hours agoparentprevThe idea was that these big companies will move back to the big centers (Paris/Frankfurt) once they have to pay the same taxes. That didn't happen (surprise) and Ireland is now ending up with a tax deluge and high value tech companies. reply quonn 9 hours agorootparentThe idea was that these big companies and the Irish government obey the law. reply piltdownman 9 hours agorootparentAll tax treaties and agreements between countries (including intra-EU) are bilateral country to country agreements. Most are refreshed every 3-7 years based on OECD (or EU) recommended standards. Ireland's laws and treatment are 100% compliant. Rather than competing and reducing their tax rates countries like France prefer to moan, as politically they can’t be seen to favour big bad businesses. This of course was no problem with the EEC where Germany, France and the other ex-colonial powers made out like bandits selling their coal and steel to Ireland and the CT being paid there. Enter an English-language dominated SaaS economy from the 90s and they got caught out as they were more interested in domestic economic protectionism than dealing with the realities of a paradigm shift towards tech. We pivoted completely to an information economy and service based economy from a predominately agrarian one. Now have a look at the tech job market in 2024 in Dublin versus Paris, Frankfurt, Berlin, Barcelona etc.. If any one of our EU or the other non EU countries were really dissatisfied with Ireland, they have the right to withdraw at any time. reply quonn 8 hours agorootparentLook, it's nice that Ireland is finally not a poor country anymore. That's primarily due to EU politics and support. It is, however, economically nowhere even close to France or Germany, no matter how large you think the \"tech job\" market there is [0]. > If any one of our EU or the other non EU countries were really dissatisfied with Ireland, they have the right to withdraw at any time. Who should withdraw from what?

Shouldn't they then keep their low-tax environment so that they can catch up to the rest of Europe ;) reply piltdownman 8 hours agorootparentprevHow could we be? We're not a post-colonial power like France or Germany who spent years exploiting the African continent in egregious human rights violations. It is literally only since 2021 that we have reached our pre-English Genocide population levels of 1851 https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/31/ireland-popula... Germany has 20x our population, France is not far off it. Neither has anything close to the job market per capita in the IT and Services sector that Ireland has. As for us dragging ourselves up, that has more to with our special relationship with the US. The EU were initially helpful with infrastructural development, access to a Common Market, and to drag us out of the Vatican Law era, but we gave up a huge amount of fishing rights to do so - massively enriching spain, portugal and france who had overfished their own waters. Note also we're not part of Schengen, but maintain a CTA (Common Travel Area) with the UK. Eventually the EU took the legs out from under us in 2008 and forced us at gunpoint to bail out unsecured german bondholders to maintain the integrity of the Euro and prevent a contagion run on German Banks. Irelands FDI sector was highly developed in the late 80s and combined with entities like Enterprise Ireland - ranked first in the world of venture capital investors by deal count in 2020 - hammered home the advantage via our highly-educated English speaking workforce and relatively low cost of living. Even now the number of investments completed by Enterprise Ireland was 42% more than its nearest competitor, French sovereign wealth fund Bpifrance. reply quonn 6 hours agorootparentGermany was never a significant colonial power and did not extract much value from them. Especially not compared to Spain, Portugal, the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands or Belgium. > Germany has 20x our population, France is not far off it. Neither has anything close to the job market per capita in the IT and Services sector that Ireland has. If you say so. And yet those employees are payed less. These jobs exist because Ireland gave US companies large tax breaks and because it is an English-speaking country. Otherwise they would perhaps been based in the UK before Brexit. It's good that Ireland attracts business, but encouraging tax dodging is not the way and this particular judgement is an opportunity to acknowledge this. reply piltdownman 4 hours agorootparentWe encouraged or facilitated nothing of the sort. The commission has caved to political pressure and has fabricated a state aid case. The original general court ruling was unequivocal. This ruling has been overturned by the ECJ - absolutely shamefully; with the entirety of their case is that Apple, and Apple alone were the beneficiary of state aid. That is demonstrably untrue. reply quonn 1 hour agorootparentSo according to you everyone is wrong, all the courts, all the other EU countries (which unjustly are wealthier than Ireland due to colonialism), the commission and the court and of course the decision taken by it. reply fullspectrumdev 9 hours agorootparentprevWhat’s interesting is the deal Apple got was fine under Irish law at the time. Nobody foresaw how things would pan out literally decades later. reply izacus 9 hours agorootparentIrish law yes, EU law no. It's like saying that you couldn't forsee a state law overriding a lower level region/county law. reply piltdownman 9 hours agorootparentThat's not how the EU works. To give just one major example, our constitution regularly overrules EU law - Ireland has to go to referendum for Treaties - e.g. The Lisbon Treaty. reply izacus 9 hours agorootparentThere are whole parts of EU law that always precede local law without the need for local harmonization. At least read up on basics of how EU works if you're going to debate law. reply quonn 9 hours agorootparentprevEU law has precedence, period. reply piltdownman 9 hours agorootparentNo, no it doesn't. The primacy of EU law is completely negated in a number of fairly basic instances - the common market first and foremost. Specifically for Ireland, we are the only EU member state that are obliged to hold public referendums on Treaties. Ratification of the Treaty in all other member states is decided upon by the states' national parliaments. Ireland, Netherlands, and Luxembourg also have veto powers when it comes to EU wide regulations. That's why Article 116 exists. You don't know what you're talking about. reply izacus 9 hours agorootparentYour interpretation just lost in court, so who here doesn't know what they're talking about? reply piltdownman 8 hours agorootparentIt's literally enshrined in German Case Law as 'Identitätsvorbehalt'. The Polish constitutional court OUTRIGHT ruled that EU law does not supercede national law. Thus, primacy of EU law is wholly rejected in Poland. https://www.euronews.com/2021/10/07/polish-court-rules-some-...

Then he immediately changed his diet and started treatment. Not sure but I may have committed a crime. What was the potential harm that was greater than the reward? reply haldujai 4 hours agorootparentPotential harm is always the same - misdiagnosis and/or mismanagement. It’s probably very low in the context of CGM and diabetes as the potentially harmful treatments require prescriptions.

Personally I found all the comparisons to other AI performance bothersome. None of those were specifically trained on diagnostics AFAICT.

And not people just out of training taking their first test, I assume experts do better over time though I might be wrong on that. reply jarrelscy 4 hours agorootparentDeveloper here - its a good point that most of the models were not specifically trained on diagnostic imaging, with the exception of Llava-Med. We would love to compare against other models trained on diagnostic imaging if anyone can grant us access! Comparison against human experts is the gold standard but information on human performance in the FRCR 2B Rapids examination is hard to come by - we've provided a reference (1) which shows comparable (at least numerically) performance of human radiologists. To your point around people just out of training (keeping in mind that training for the FRCR takes 5 years, while doing practicing medicine in a real clinical setting) taking their first test - the reference shows that after passing the FRCR 2B Rapids the first time, their performance actually declines (at least in the first year), so I'm not sure if experts would do better over time. 1. https://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/379/bmj-2022-072826.full.pdf reply rscho 50 minutes agorootparentSomeone downvoted the author !?

Yes, pharmaceuticals are open access in much of the developing world, but it has not happened responsibly. For example, Carbapenem-resistant bacteria are 20 times as common in India as they are in the U.S [1] I really don't like this characterization of medical resource stewardship as \"infantilization\" because it implies some sort of elitism amongst doctors, when it's exactly the opposite. It's a system of checks and balances that limits the power afforded to any one person, no matter how smart they think they are. In a US hospital setting, doctors do not have 100% control over antibiotics.

The tech sector understands very little about clinical medicine, and therefore spends its time fighting windmills and shouting in the dark at docs. reply rscho 8 hours agoparentprevEven if this worked as well as a human radiologist, diagnosis is not only made of radiology. That's why radiology is a support specialty. Other specialists incorporate radiology exams into their own assessment to decide on a treatment plan. So in the end, I don't think it'll change as much as you'd think, even if freely accessible. reply crabbone 6 hours agorootparentAbsolutely this. Also radiologists are usually given notes on patients that accompany whatever image they are reading, and in cases like, eg. ulstrasound often perform the exam themselves. So, they are able to asses presentation, hear patient's complaints, learn the history of the patient etc. Not to mention that in particularly sick patients problems tend to compound one another and exams are often requested to deal with a particular side of the problem, ignoring, perhaps, the major (but already known and diagnosed) problem etc. Often times factors specific to a hospital play crucial role: eg. in hospitals for rich (but older) patients it may be common to take chest X-rays in a sited position (s.a. not to discomfort the valuable patients...) whereas in poorer hospitals siting position would indicate some kind of a problem (i.e. the patient couldn't stand for whatever reason). That's not to say that automatic image reading is worthless: radiologists are, perhaps, one of the most overbooked specialists in any hospital, and are getting even more overbooked because other specialists tend to be afraid to diagnose w/o imaging / are over-reliant on imaging. From talking to someone who worked as a clinical radiologist: most images are never red. So, if an automated system could identify images requiring human attention, that'd be already a huge leap. reply robertlagrant 1 hour agorootparentYou could imagine imprinting into the scan additional info such as \"seated preferred\" or \"seated for pain\".

You are trying to incorporate non-existent data that nobody ever put into any kind of medical system... Yes, in principle, if people taking the images had infinite time and could foresee what kind of accompanying data will be useful at the analysis time, and then had a convenient and universal format to store that data, and models could select the relevant subsets of features for the problem being investigated...

At first glance, the doctor told me there was nothing wrong, even though I had very painful symptoms. While the visit was unproductive, I requested the MRI images on a CD, just because I was curious (I wanted to reconstruct the layers into a 3D model). After receiving the data in the mail weeks later, I was surprised to find a formal diagnosis on the CD. Apparently a better doctor had gotten around to analyzing it (they never followed up). If I hadn't requested my records, I never would have gotten a diagnosis. I had a swollen retrocalcaneal bursa. I googled the treatments, and eventually got better. I'm curious whether this AI model would have been able to detect my issue more competently than the shitty doctor. reply rasmus1610 12 hours agoparentTo be honest, I heard of several radiology practices that hand the patients a normal report directly after the exam and they look at the actual images only after the patient has left. I guess the reasoning is that they want to provide „good service“ by giving the patient something to work with directly after the exam and the workload is so high that they couldn’t look at the images so fast. And they accept the risk that some people are getting angry because their exam wasn’t normal in the end. But on the scale a typical radiology practice operates today, the few patients who don’t have a normal exam don’t matter (the number of normal exams in an outpatient setting is quite high). I find it highly unethical, but some radiologists are a little bit more ethically relaxed I guess.

But if someone is able to connect a network to the raw data outputs from CT or MR machines, one may start seeing these AI's radically outperform humans at a fraction of the cost. For CT machines, this could also be used to concentrate radiation doses into parts of the body where the uncertainty of the current state is greatest, even in real time. For instance, if using a CT machine to examine a fracture in a leg bone, one could start out with a very low dosage scan, simply to find the exact location of the bone. Then slightly higher concentrated scan of the bone in the general area, and then an even higher dosage in an area where the fracture is detected, to get a high resolution picture of the damage, and splinters etc. This could reduce the total dosage the patient is exposed to, or be used to get a higher resolution image of the damaged area than one would otherwise want to collect, or possibly to perform more scans during treatment than is currently considered worth the radiation exposure. Such machines could also be made multi modal, meaning the same machine could carry both CT, MR, ultrasound sensors (dopler + regular). Possibly even secondary sensors, such as thermal sensors, pressure sensors or even invasive types of sensors. By fusing all such inputs (+ the medical records, blood sample data etc) for the patient, such a machine may be able to build a more complete picture of a patient's conditions than even the best hospitals can provide today, and a at a fraction of the cost. Especially for diffuse issues, like back pains where information about bone damage, bloodflow (from the Doppler ultrasound), soft tissue tension/condition etc could be collected simultaneously and matched with the reported symptoms in real time to find location where nerve damage or irritation could occur. To verify findings (or to exclude such, if more than one possible explanation exists), such an AI could then suggest experiments that would confirm or exclude possibilities, including stimulating certain areas electrically, apply physical pressure or even by inserting some tiny probe to inspect the location directly. Unfortunately (or fortunately to the medical companies), while this cold lower the cost per treatment, the market for such diagnostics could grow even faster, meaning medical costs (insurance/taxes) might still go up with this. reply bobbiechen 4 hours agoprev\"We'd better hope we can actually replace radiologists with AI, because medical students are no longer choosing to specialize in it.\" - one of the speakers at a recent health+AI event I'm wondering what others in healthcare think of this.

Radiology remains one of the most competitive and in-demand specialties. In this year's match, only 4 out of ~1200 available radiology residency positions went unfilled. Last year was 0. Only a handful of other specialties have similar rates. As comparison, 251 out of ~900 pediatric residency slots went unfilled this year. And 636 out of ~5000 family medicine residency slots went unfilled. (These are much higher than previous years.) However, I do somewhat agree with the speaker's sentiment if for a different reason. Radiologist supply in the US is roughly stable (thanks to the US's strange stranglehold on residency slots), but demand is increasing: the number of scans ordered on a per patient continues to rise, as does the complexity of those scans.

The software that manages the radiology workflow in a clinic.

It might overlap a bit with the HIS (hospital information system) that's the more general hospital management software. reply lostlogin 11 hours agorootparentThe RIS became a thing before the PACS as digital imaging arrived later in the piece. They should always have been integrated, as many things are clumsy when spread across two systems. Some ‘reports’ are an image (eg vessel mapping and many cardiac reports). Some imaging doesn’t require a written report (theatre screening for implant placement). Some imaging requires multiple reports (a cardiac CT scan which covers lungs often gets a radiology and cardiology report). Some imaging is done to aid the acquisition of a different type of imaging. All these scenarios are handled in various clumsy ways by the various system and work around workflows are made up by staff on a near daily basis. reply tecleandor 9 hours agorootparentOh yes! I've been out of the sector for ~5years but I worked on it for 15 years and it's amusing (well, except when you have to work on it) how different everything is on every place. The manual data introduction, the shortcuts and workarounds, the differences on roles and even meanings! The words RIS, PACS or HIS doesn't mean the same to every person and have different functions on different places.

Annotated radiology datasets, patients numbering into the millions, are the easiest healthcare datasets to obtain. I suspect there are many startups, and know of several long since failed, who trained on these. I've met radiologists who assert most of their job comes down to contextualizing their findings to their colleagues, as well as within the scope of the case itself. That's relevant here - it doesn't matter how accurate or precise your model is, if it can't do that. Radiologists already use \"AI\" tools that are very good, and radiology is a very welcoming field for new technology. I think the promise of foundation models at the moment would be to ease burden and help prevent burnout. Unfortunately, those models aren't \"sexy\" - they reduce administrative burden, assemble contextual evidence for better retrieval (have interfaces that don't suck when integrated with the EMR). reply ilaksh 8 hours agorootparentCan you provide a link or search term to give a jumpstart for finding good radiology datasets? reply naveen99 7 hours agorootparentTgca from ncia has some for cancer Deeplesion is another one out of nih.

My experience as a contributor to Sigrok was sad: I significantly improved a driver and wanted to upstream those changes, but was met with \"well, the maintainer has little time, can you slice your changes into smaller pieces?\", and honestly, after a months of doing that, waiting weeks for feedback, explaining things, I lost interest. Also, with time, I honestly don't remember some details of the changes beyond what's in the commit messages. I also found the style of the code quite antiquated, without any wish to change that. But that's my taste. So, in the end, my work on that driver felt wasted. reply the_biot 4 hours agoparentYour OLS improvement patch set was huge, and a challenge for anyone to review. But you're right that it took much too long to get any traction, and I don't blame you for getting discouraged. Having said that, you did eventually get a ton of comments, by a trusted and well-respected contributor (wsa), but I guess you'd already given up by then, so didn't respond. How about this: make the changes requested, and I'll personally take on further review and/or approval. I'm the original author of the OLS driver, and of course I have the hardware, so that's as good an opportunity to get your code in as you'll get. reply daghamm 10 hours agoparentprev\"can you slice your changes into smaller pieces?\" You don't send a huge patch to a project as a first time contributor. I am sure sigrok would benefit from your improvements, but sometimes the maintainer has a busy life outside the project so you need to adapt to their pace, at least in the beginning. reply xemdetia 7 hours agorootparentI would agree without even the caveat of the maintainer being busy. When a maintainer receives a massive changeset they have to then recover why the task was taken on in the first place and understand any decisions to get to the same outcome presented in the changeset provided. The more logical complexity that this change represents whether it is 3 lines or 3000 lines still needs to be understood by the reviewer as not breaking the rest of the system and equally can be 'massive.' The further you get from an N+1 change into a N+5 or N+6 change is where you get into situations where a N+3 change is flawed based on the rest of the system and invalidates large parts of the changeset, and that doesn't resolve all the issues or concerns. I think a lot of people forget that changesets are sometimes not the most straightforward way to express ideas. They (including myself) also forget that while you are working with a change in front of you it's obvious but in one month it could be opaque. A maintainer is often giving you the perspective of you a month later who built on this system you changed. reply mkj 6 hours agorootparentprevFor something like drivers most of them are probably from first time contributors, and they aren't really going to be hanging around for further contributions. That's fine - the driver would improve if the contributions are accepted, and they don't touch core code that will break other things. But instead totally non-functional drivers are left languishing because PRs aren't merged. In the case of Sigrok the problem didn't seem so much the maintainers, but rather non-developers \"triaging\" PRs with unhelpful advice to split patches, when a lack of actual developers meant they'd never be looked at anyway. Otherwise a fork might have occurred rather than wasting everyone's time. reply jononor 3 hours agorootparentI wish projects would be more strategic around acceptance rates on drivers/plugins contra core. On plugins etc one should have much lower barriers to contributions, compared to on the core. It is actually one of the primary reasons why such architectures are beneficial in FOSS projects. reply klysm 10 hours agorootparentprev> You don't send a huge patch to a project as a first time contributor. Although that’s a good guideline, it’s not true in absolute terms. Sometimes the contribution is a big patch! reply evv 8 hours agorootparentAnd sometimes the best way to contribute is by forking. Depends on the situation for sure, but this encourages an acceleration by the maintainers of the original library. If they don't have the time to do so, they can comfortably ignore the fork. reply giancarlostoro 5 hours agorootparentOn GitHub most PRs come from works though? Or do you mean make an entirely separate driver? reply harvie 4 hours agoparentprevSigrok project is dead...

The next time I need my oscilloscope, I want to take a few moments to try out https://www.ngscopeclient.org/ reply the_biot 3 hours agoparentI will never understand this. libsigrok (the driver backend) supports over 130 oscilloscope models. Why not just write a GUI that uses libsigrok, and instantly get access to all of those? edit: actually I think that's azonenberg's project. IIRC I discussed it with him once, and the reason was licensing, not technical. reply human_llm 5 hours agoparentprevThis looks interesting. I wanted to try it with my Rigol DS1054Z, but there is no AUR package for Arch Linux for it, which makes the installation cumbersome. The user experience with Sigrok is superior in that aspect ;) reply godelski 57 minutes agorootparentI hate to sound like the classic Arch user, but if you're unable to build packages from source I'd highly suggest a different distro. Being a rolling release things will break. I've been a daily Linux driver for over a decade and do live Arch, but it's not for noobs unless you're willing to dive into the deep end (in which case it's great, but because breaking becomes a feature instead of a bug lol) If you have not already done do, I highly suggest installing timeshift[0] and the associated pacman hook[1]. Make sure to appropriately configure them and setup good timers. This will save you a lot of headaches, especially if you have an Nvidia GPU (Jensen please...)

The greatest issue I see is that this is a fairly niche field for open source software historically due to the difficulty of acquiring the actual logic analyzers for a personal or student lab at times. People in general see older projects as establish and will often guide their focus to their own greenfield interests. There are now a growing number of people entering this area of development however and more projects are being founded every month as availability and support for good-quality, stable hardware is increasing! This is an exciting time for open source analysis, and given the availability and maturity of older 24mhz logic analyzers, on-demand manufacturing and supporting protects (kicad) I expect this to continue.

    "originBody": "← Blog Will Wilson CEO Debugging in the Multiverse September 10, 2024 Would figuring out your bugs and outages be easier if you had a time machine? We are now making a time machine directly available to all of our customers. Sometimes, being a software engineer is a lot like being a crime scene investigator. Picture the situation: a car has crashed on an icy road early in the morning. Seems obvious enough. But maybe, just maybe, the brake lines were cut by somebody who wanted the driver dead. Or what if he was drugged? Can we distinguish that scenario from him being sleepy? Our best bet is to surround the scene with that yellow police tape so nobody disturbs it, and to hope that time and chance haven’t obliterated the evidence we’d need to figure it out. What if there was a better way? I’ve been involved in too many production outages and emergencies whose aftermath felt just like that. Eventually all the alerts and alarms get resolved and the error rates creep back down. And then what? Cordon the servers off with yellow police tape? The bug that caused the outage is there in your code somewhere, but it may have taken some outrageously specific circumstances to trigger it. You better pray that somebody added exactly the piece of logging or telemetry that you needed to figure it out, because it could be impossible to reproduce the issue in a controlled way. This puts us in an awkward spot. When writing the code, we need to somehow anticipate what our future selves, who are investigating some disaster, will wish that we had done in the past. When we succeed at this, we collect huge volumes of logs “just in case” they provide some crucial clue, incurring equally huge storage costs. But I am not a very foresightful person, so I usually don’t even get that far. In these cases, what I really wish I had is a time machine that would let me rewind to 5 seconds before the crash, freeze time, and give the car (or my servers) a good look. Bring back my files Obviously the first feature I want from my time machine is the same one I want whenever I accidentally delete data from my harddrive, install malware, or say something dumb in a sensitive conversation: sleep -5. We can do that! (See video.) What exactly is happening here? Antithesis simulates a purely deterministic universe. The reasons we do that are to find bugs faster, and to make them perfectly reproducible once found. But if you can perfectly simulate something, then you can also perfectly simulate it up until 5 seconds from the end.1 Then we can crack open that universe and give you a bash terminal inside of it. The resulting universe is still deterministic, just dependent on what you decided to do. In practice, we never need to replay the simulation from the beginning, because our hypervisor also support fast and efficient snapshotting of the state of the guest system. See this talk by Alex Pshenichkin. Information from the past Let’s get more concrete. Let’s use this to solve a real problem. My server has crashed and its process has exited! No worries, I’ll just rewind time, attach a debugger to the process, and set a breakpoint or capture a thread dump: Packets from the past Or you know what? I can’t count the number of times I was trying to figure out where my consensus protocol went wrong and wished I had a dump of all the network traffic. No biggie, I’ll just go back in time and decide I was capturing the traffic all along: What was slow? Strange and transient performance problems are a snap. Once Antithesis has found them for me, I can rewind time and enable profiling for the period of interest. I don’t need to worry about figuring out how to trigger the pathology again: Back to the future Like any good time machine, we can travel to the future too. The nice thing about a deterministic universe is that if the thing you’re simulating is mostly idle, you can just simulate it faster. Here we are waiting for 10 minutes to pass in just a few seconds. This kind of time compression is very useful when debugging networked systems: Change the past But let’s be real: if you or I had an actual time machine, we wouldn’t be able to resist the temptation to go back to some historic event, change it, and then return to the present and see what’s different. But that’s a pretty useful technique when debugging too! We call it “multiverse debugging.” Let’s rewind time, turn off fault injection on our Kafka cluster, and see if the NPE still happens: Imagine an extreme version of this. You could rewind a second, explore a thousand tiny variations of the past, and compute the proportion of them that still see the bug. Then you could rewind two seconds and do the same thing. Do that enough times and you’ve just recreated the Antithesis bug report. But with this new tool we’re giving you, you could have invented that bug report yourself. What else could you invent? A reactive multiverse You may be wondering what’s up with this interface I’m showing you. It’s just a browser-based reactive notebook. But by connecting the notebook to a deterministic hypervisor, we get access to a definitionally side effect-free world. This means there’s no room to smuggle state, so we can make it truly reactive, even when it’s running commands on the Linux system running inside the hypervisor. When you change the text in the notebook it immediately reacts, and the hypervisor reacts too. The UI is just the inevitable result of the notebook text causing a determistic computation. UI = f(code), even when that code is injecting commands into a distributed system. It’s available now We haven’t even begun to scratch the surface of this capability, but this post is already too long. We are rolling this out to all of our existing customers today. If you’re already a customer, get started with our new documentation. If you’re not already a customer, contact us. We’ll find your bugs and then give you a universe-hopping time machine to fix them.",

You’d think PLs are in the absolute perfect spot to implement things, because they define the semantics and runtime. And there are a few PLs who have time-travel demos, but they’ve never really been seen as more than a cool tech demo. Perhaps the language is too small a vantage point to really get into what’s happening when debugging. reply GuB-42 52 minutes agoparentFrom the little I have seen, most programming language folks don't seem to care much about debugging. They care a lot about bugs not happening in the first place, which is good, testability is sometimes taken in consideration, but not much about what to do after a bug happened. No language will prevent you from misimplementing the specs, but languages can be designed in such a way that it easy to trace back why the button is green and not red. It seems like those who are the most serious about debugging are from the video game industry. They get all the cool stuff with time travel, hot reload, etc... So much that I expected to see something about video games, and was surprised it wasn't. reply munificent 1 hour agoparentprevI know time-travel debugging is very very close to Gilad Bracha's heart and something he was really hoping would make its way into Dart. I don't know to what degree this is true for other language teams but one thing I've observed is that language designers, compiler people, VM people, and IDE/debugger people have more distinct cultures than you might expect. That can make it hard to ship features that cut across those domains. I think we've gotten a lot better at doing that kind of holistic design on the Dart team, but it took years of team-building to get there. reply barumrho 3 hours agoparentprevElm debugger did something like this, but it's much more limited in scope. reply the_sleaze_ 1 hour agorootparentAs does Vue - in 5+ years I've never used it reply casept 4 hours agoprevDoes anything like the Antithesis hypervisor exist as open source?

In my experience it works nearly flawlessly, certainly far above 50%. And even when there are spurious failures in replaying it's easy enough to just re-replay (though I do wish there was some way to export the current position & checkpoints with instruction-level precision to import in a fresh replay). I suppose it depends massively on the recorded program (most of mine are simple C programs, but also a decent bit of Java for JIT inspection or FFI, and I've also recorded an Electron app a couple times, and for fun Factorio) reply quickgist 3 hours agoprevI've enjoyed reading many of the blog posts by Antithesis, really cool work.

Let’s use this to solve a real problem. My server has crashed and its process has exited! No worries, I’ll just rewind time, attach a debugger to the process, and set a breakpoint or capture a thread dump: Is this kind of stuff only possible in an Antithesis Environment? reply wwilson 4 hours agorootparentYes, unfortunately we have not figured out how to rewind time in the real world yet. When we do, there are a lot of choices I'm going to revisit... reply abeppu 4 hours agorootparent... but the intro makes it sound like this system is valuable in investigating bugs that occurred in prod systems: > I’ve been involved in too many production outages and emergencies whose aftermath felt just like that. Eventually all the alerts and alarms get resolved and the error rates creep back down. And then what? Cordon the servers off with yellow police tape? The bug that caused the outage is there in your code somewhere, but it may have taken some outrageously specific circumstances to trigger it. So practically, if a production outage (where I think \"production\" means it cannot be in a simulated environment, since the customers you're serving are real) is caused by very specific circumstances, and your production system records some, but not every attribute of its inputs and state ... how does one make use of antithesis? Concretely, when you have a fully-deterministic system that can help your investigation, but you have only a partial view of the conditions that caused the bug ... how do you proceed? I feel like this post is over-promising but perhaps there's something I just don't understand since I've never worked with a tool set like this. reply jackschu 50 minutes agorootparent(I work at Antithesis) I think you're right that the framing leans towards providing value in prod issues, but we left out how we provide value there. I think you're also right that we're just used to experiencing the value here, but it needs some explanation. Basically this is where guided, tree-based fuzzing comes in. If something in the real world is caused by very specific circumstances, we're well positions to have also generated those specific circumstances. This is thanks to parallelism, intelligent exploration, fault injection, our ability to revisit interesting states in the past with fast snapshots, etc. We've had some super notable instances of a customer finds a bug in prod, recalls its that weird bug they've been ignoring that we surfaced a month ago, and then uses this approach to debug. The best docs on this are probably here: https://antithesis.com/docs/introduction/how_antithesis_work... reply yellow_lead 2 hours agorootparentprevThis was my thinking as well. Prod environments can be extremely complicated and issues often come down to specific configuration or data issues in production. So I had a lot of trouble understanding how the premise is connected to the product here. reply qarl 4 hours agorootparentprev> Yes, unfortunately we have not figured out how to rewind time in the real world yet. 10 bucks says you get complaints for not implementing the \"real world\" feature. reply abeppu 4 hours agoparentprevThe intro mentions that ordinarily, we have to pay a high upfront cost to record info that we might need to debug later. > When we succeed at this, we collect huge volumes of logs “just in case” they provide some crucial clue, incurring equally huge storage costs. The 'packets from the past' section says we can just retroactively decide what we should have recorded. Doesn't that mean we're effectively recording everything always? What's the cost of this? Or is all of this under the assumption that we never have to debug something that happened outside of the simulation environment, e.g. in response to an actual in-bound request from a customer? If this is just saying we can afford to save everything in our development environment ... well in that context recording the logs probably wasn't a \"huge storage cost\" either, right? Or am I missing something basic here? reply wwilson 4 hours agorootparentYou're right that if you tried to do something like this using record/replay, you would pay an enormous cost. Antithesis does not use record/replay, but rather a deterministic hypervisor (https://antithesis.com/blog/deterministic_hypervisor/). So all we have to remember is the set of inputs/changes to entropy that got us somewhere, not the result of every system operation. reply slippy 3 hours agorootparentThe classic time space tradeoff question: If I run Antithesis for X time, say 4 hours, do you take periodic snapshot / deltas of state so that I don't have to re-run the capture for O(4 hours) again, from scratch just to go back 5 seconds? reply wwilson 3 hours agorootparentYes!

How much latency does it add to a production server? reply wwilson 4 hours agoparentThe simulation is a completely generic Linux system, so we can run anything (including NodeJS).

    "originBody": "Image: Hans Isaccson via Unsplash Suzanne Smalley September 9th, 2024 Ford seeks patent for tech that listens to driver conversations to serve ads Ford Motor Company is seeking a patent for technology that would allow it to tailor in-car advertising by listening to conversations among vehicle occupants, as well as by analyzing a car’s historical location and other data, according to a patent application published late last month. “In one example, the controller may monitor user dialogue to detect when individuals are in a conversation,” the patent application says. “The conversations can be parsed for keywords or phrases that may indicate where the occupants are traveling to.” The tech — labeled as “in-vehicle advertisement presentation” — will determine where a car is located, how fast it is traveling, what type of road it is driving on and whether it is in traffic. It also will predict routes, speeds and destinations to customize ads to drivers, the application said. The system could pull data from “audio signals within the vehicle and/or historical user data, selecting a number of the advertisements to present to the user during the trip,” the patent application said. By monitoring dialogue between vehicle occupants the ad controller system can determine when to deliver audio versus visual ads, providing ads to drivers as they travel “through a human-machine interface (HMI) of the vehicle,” the application said. “Such systems and methods provide maximum opportunity for ad-based monetization,” the application said. “These systems and methods may use knowledge of vehicle destination prediction to provide more relevant advertisements, for example, if a user is going grocery shopping, merchandise purchasing, etc.” The patent application does not describe how the collected data would be protected. The technology would be primarily software-based and would require no new hardware, according to the application. Ford filed the application in February and it was published on August 29. Contents of the application were first reported by Motor1.com. The auto manufacturer defended the patent application. \"Submitting patent applications is a normal part of any strong business as the process protects new ideas and helps us build a robust portfolio of intellectual property,” a statement from a Ford spokesperson said. “The ideas described within a patent application should not be viewed as an indication of our business or product plans,” the statement added. In a followup statement, Ford said it \"will always put the customer first in the decision-making behind the development and marketing of new products and services.\" The system also could cull data from third-party applications or set up screen input preferences to predict the number of ads a driver should be served, the application said. Types of trips being made by drivers also will play a role, the application said, noting that whether a vehicle owner is making a “long drive versus trip to medical care facility” would be considered by the system. A Ford patent filed in July proposed technology that would enable vehicles to monitor the speed of nearby cars, photograph them and send the information to police. The idea sparked a backlash from privacy advocates. It is still pending review by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. That application pointed to how hard it is for police to pinpoint speeding cars and said “it is desirable to provide systems and methods that assist traffic police and/or other law enforcement officers [to] perform such tasks.” Ford quietly walked away from another controversial patent application last October after a firestorm of criticism for its plans for a system that would commandeer vehicles whose owners were late to pay and allow them to repossess themselves. That patent application said that the technology would allow self-driving cars to automatically head to repossession lots while standard vehicle lenders would be able to permanently lock cars and cripple steering wheels, brakes and air conditioning in order to pressure delinquent drivers to pay. The third largest car company in the American market, Ford won 12 percent of new vehicle registrations last year, according to Experian.

Remember folks, filing a patent doesn't ensure implementation. If Ford starts snooping on our in-car conversations and injecting ads into our Spotify streams, we can just refuse to buy Fords. They know this. The patent actually makes it less likely that other companies will copy them, so we're less likely to end up in a situation where we have no choice. Now if the NHTSA mandates that all new vehicles come with in-car microphones and AI to listen to conversations to stop drunk driving or some other crazy reason, we're in real trouble. That's why we have touchscreens in every car now - backup cams are mandatory, and if they have to have the screen, they'll use it for everything. 1: https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/airbus-s-retractable-bicycle-s... 2: https://patents.google.com/patent/US20140159444A1/en reply mysteria 3 hours agoparent> If Ford starts snooping on our in-car conversations and injecting ads into our Spotify streams, we can just refuse to buy Fords. Well pretty much all car manufacturers today collect telemetry on driving habits, locations, and such, and more and more vehicles now have a built in cellular modem to send all that data back to the manufacturer. Their privacy policies also give them the ability to do whatever they like with that data [1], and there have been cases of them sending it to insurance companies and the like. Currently on some models you can physically remove the modem or antenna but in the future that may brick your vehicle or be prohibited by law or license agreements.

For instance heated seats is still useful as a differentiator for a premium trim, so it'd make no sense to give it to everyone for free. reply beretguy 1 hour agorootparentDid you know BMW was trying to make heating seats a subscription service? https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/7/23863258/bmw-cancel-heated... reply gruez 1 hour agorootparentI do, but how does what you said invalidate anything in my previous comment?

For even higher profit^Wcustomer satisfaction seat heat rates can be made dynamic based on a number of different inputs like temperature, demand, car occupation, driver stress, fuel/energy price, road congestion, time of day, length of trip and customer status. How about a tiered pricing schedule with a Basic, Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum level? Basic is free, good for who only occasionally expects to use seat heating but offers no discounts. Bronze is for those who use seat heating a bit more often, say 1 to 2 hours per week with a discount of 10% on basic rates. Bronze membership is only €10/month, buy NOW! Silver and gold offer steeper discounts for a monthly fee of €25/€50 while Platinum is for the discerning user who wants to pay more for QUALITY.

This guy's argument was that in fact, entrepreneurs are the ones who can really change and improve the world, and while I don't disagree completely, corporations and executives have earned the way they're portrayed.

By bug I mean the spy device. While I can think of certain things that you might want to be able to do hands-free, these are mostly activities that don't have anything to do with the car itself. Hands-free radio controls, hands-free mobile calling etc. And I'd prefer that these features not be integrated into the car in a way that I can't choose to buy a car with, say, a different radio that doesn't have those features. In other words, I can't think of a reason that a car should necessarily come pre-installed with any sort of microphone what-so-ever. But the idea that there is not only a microphone, but that it is sending what it picks up to some remote server, is a notion that I am deeply uncomfortable with. Most people view the inside of their car as being somewhat akin to the inside of their home. While people might expect less privacy in a car than in their homes, there is still an expectation of privacy to a degree. And that privacy expectation is typically more auditory than visual (of course you can get tinted windows but people expect you might be able to see inside of a car, but not necessary hear what two people are saying to one another). reply SoftTalker 2 hours agorootparentMany people willingly install Alexa or similar devices in their homes, and have always-listening assistants running on their phones.

But I also recognize that I'm in a minority and will probably lose that fight. reply SoftTalker 3 hours agorootparentI can imagine a future where fully autonomous cars are available everywhere and from multiple providers, so that competition drives the price down to close to cost. I would not mind not having to deal with insurance, maintenance, repairs, parking, fueling, charging, and everything else that comes with owning a car. I'm not opposed to that, but I also think it's nothing more than a fantasy. More likely that if we ever have cars that are safely autonomous, they will be kept scarce by a monopoly or oligopoly of companies who will have one-sided insight into the costs and demands and extract maximum prices from users.

    "originBody": "cohost dot org@staff23 hr. ago cohost to shut down at end of 2024 also the August 2024 financial update, but I’m trying not to bury the lede. Hi everyone, We have come to the decision to cease operations of cohost and anti software software club due to lack of funding and burnout. As of today, none of us are being paid for our labor1; all of our money in the bank, and any money coming in from people who buy our merch or don’t cancel cohost plus, is going towards servers and operations — paying the bills so we can turn the lights off with as little disruption as possible. cohost will become read-only on Tuesday, October 1st. At this time, we will make best-effort attempts to keep the servers online through the end of 2024. Development focus has immediately shifted to data export. We have offered minimal data export for GDPR compliance for a while now, but this is a barebones system that doesn’t meet our quality standards. We will be improving this system over the next few weeks and will issue full data exports for all users when the site goes read-only. We will continue to offer downloads of your data export through the end of the read-only period. When the read-only period concludes, we will delete all of your data from our servers without a backup. Even now we want to reiterate that we think “data brokerage” and other common practices of the software industry are inimical to who we are as people, and we would never consider selling your data to others or asserting any rights to stuff you posted under any circumstance. Majority control of the cohost source code will be transferred to the person who funded the majority of our operations, as per the terms of the funding documents we signed with them; Colin and I will retain small stakes so we have some input on what happens to it, at their request. on that note, we’re looking for new jobs. we’ll each be posting about that bit individually. So, what happened? If you’ve read our financial updates, you know that we have never been profitable. This isn’t surprising, even with a team of four; social media is a notoriously unprofitable industry. We had planned to bring in new revenue with eggbux (our tipping and subscription product) but policy changes from Stripe forced us to cancel earlier this year. Since then, we’ve struggled to fill the revenue and morale gap. Colin and I have been doing this for five years, Aidan for three, Kara for nearly two. We’ve been at or over capacity on moderation, engineering, and general operations nearly this entire time. We have all been on-call 24/7/365 since we launched two and a half years ago. The day-to-day needs of just running the site meant developing alternative funding options wasn’t possible. MAU and MRR are down across the year. We’ve managed to build a social media platform that many of our users love, but we just don’t have enough users and we don’t have the resources to safely scale up. It’s important to know when to call it quits. We’re grateful for all the incredible things y’all have created on cohost. We’re grateful for eggbug. We’re grateful that we were able to try and show a better path for social media, even if it didn’t work out exactly as we would have liked. We’re going to do our best to keep things online through the end of the year with the money we have, but we might need additional funding to keep things up until then. If you would be able to contribute funds if necessary, please e-mail us at corp@antisoftware.club. Thank you all for having used cohost. We’ll see you around. ~ jae (and colin, and aidan, and kara) Timeline Immediately: self-service account deletions are available in the settings page. account sign-up and activation is no longer available. Please note that if you delete your account before receiving a data export, you will not receive one; there won’t be any data left for us to export. October 1, 2024: cohost will become read-only. all cohost plus subscriptions will be cancelled. account deletions will remain available. starting October 1, 2024: we will begin processing data exports for all users. we expect this process to take some time. once your export is ready, you will receive an e-mail with a link to download it. data export downloads will remain available until the servers shut down on December 31. December 31, 2024: cohost will go fully offline. all user data will be deleted on our way out the door. January 1, 2025: we will set cohost.org to redirect to the wayback machine1 to prevent link rot. this is something we will be paying for out of pocket since ASSC will no longer be an operating concern, but it’s max $100 per year total so it’s fine.

It started on a thread asking how much it costs to run an instance per user. Because most admins runs things as a hobby, all answers were like \"oh, my instance has a few hundred users and I run it on $20/month VPS, so it's just a few cents per user per month\" No one even considered factoring the cost of the developers, the hours put in by admin, the value of the work done by moderators. Nothing. The only thing that has an actual price is the stupid VPS, so this is all that they think should be chipping in for. For completely unknown reasons, there is a big overlap between the people that make this type of argument and the people that are mystified about the fact so many smart people end up using their talents to optimize the amount of ads being pushed to people online. reply tptacek 21 hours agoparentThis just came up a couple days ago with a thread about a programming education app with 2MM users that was shutting down, with the thread dominated by discussion of their hosting costs and how they could have cut it in half by moving off AWS; if they had managed to get those costs down to zero they still couldn't have afforded a single software developer, probably not even in Tulsa or Little Rock.

This is why I make it a point to pay for software that I find useful/enjoyable. One of the most obnoxious side-effects of the VC startup mill's use of \"free\" services to fuel growth (loss leaders) is that they tricked people into thinking that software was cheap or free to produce. Now people feel entitled to your efforts for as little as possible and, in some cases, get absolutely indignant that you'd ever try to run a real business and profit from your efforts. reply j45 14 hours agorootparentFor that reason it's why I try to keep all stacks as ruthlessly simple as possible, because the complexity will come from the market and flexibility will be invaluable then. Premature over-engineering, or optimization costs a lot more developers, administration and hardware. At times it reminds me of when someone is using AI to do sometimes a SQL query might be able to. So much effort avoiding SQL, to the point of using non-relational databases... only to relate them. reply mattrighetti 21 hours agoparentprevThis is a common argument, especially with tech products. The most recurring one that I hear is that “phone X can be made with Y hundreds of dollars in china”. Like, have you ever considered the amount of software and hardware development/research that’s needed to turn that thing on? reply dan-robertson 9 hours agoparentprevYeah, I think it’s probably wrong to focus on the hosting costs instead of development costs. But I think it’s also the case that companies like meta or pre-Elon Twitter had more developers than necessary for the ‘core’ of the site – lots of the work is downstream of selling ads, like collecting lots of data and developing targeting systems and developing the site where advertisers can buy ad space and analyze their results. There’s some middle ground where you don’t need as many developers-per-user-observed-functionality as an ad-supported site, though I suspect it still dominates hosting costs. reply rglullis 8 hours agorootparentAbsolutely, no one would argue that the only way to be profitable without ads is by charging $8/month like Twitter or the €11.99/month that Zuckerberg wants in the EU. This might be true for closed companies who need to deal with all their overhead, but (e.g) Lemmy has the equivalent of 3.5 FTE and said that €15k/month would be enough for all of them to continue working on it. Even with this ridiculously low threshold, they are still not able to hit the target. Now, imagine if these sites worked in a system where everyone would have to pay a little bit (or have someone else paying for them) so that every user is contributing to development/hosting/etc. Get people paying $9/year ($0.75/month) and I can bet you that you'd be a lot more than 3.5 FTE, we would be getting a viable alternative to Reddit and without all the enshittification and Surveillance Capitalism associated with Big Tech. reply skyfaller 22 hours agoprevI would have been more interested in Cohost if they weren't actively hostile to federation. Their eventual shutdown always seemed inevitable to me, and without federation + account portability, there would be no easy offramp when they failed. You could say the same of almost all corporate social media, and I am phasing them all out too. reply kevingadd 22 hours agoparentFederation wouldn't have meaningfully solved their revenue problems, though. It would have just been a massive engineering timesink. reply skyfaller 22 hours agorootparentIt could have helped their revenue problems indirectly if it meant being able to access more users and content, not only the people who use and enjoy Cohost. People love to talk about network effects, and something like the fediverse means you can start with however many users there are on the fediverse on day one of turning on federation. For me, lack of federation meant they were dead on arrival, just like every Google product can't be trusted to keep existing (and I would never start using a new Google product). Any individual fediverse project could shut down, but the fediverse continues and is probably unkillable like IRC or RSS at this point, even if it's not as widely used as one might like. reply aseipp 19 hours agorootparent> It could have helped Narrator: It could not have helped, it would have mostly just made them even more burnt out, because they (as they said in the post) were already on call effectively 7 days a week and have been since the site started. > the fediverse continues and is probably unkillable like IRC or RSS at this point Who cares? When an IRC channel, or phpbb forum I use closes down, or an RSS feed I used to read goes dark -- I do not think about the wonderful IRC protocol and how ossified it is or about the sanctity of DNS. And these things happen regardless of what the underlying technology stack are. I think \"It really sucks that my community and the people on it are gone now.\" A domain that doesn't resolve and an empty mastodon instance are effectively the same. The users who use the platform are why the platform is valuable, not because it uses some dumb particular tech stack. reply kevingadd 21 hours agorootparentprevThis comes down to a question of what kind of service you want. If you want a way to \"access more users and content\", you can already make an account on a Fediverse instance and access those users and content there. What does Cohost offer by being yet another instance with custom software? If the vast majority of the content I'm accessing is from other instances/services, why would I pay Cohost money for the privilege of having them act as an intermediary? One specific problem with federation/decentralization is that you've now decentralized moderation and given up control over your service's culture entirely. This has some upsides and some downsides, but it again puts you into a weird position: If your moderation and culture position are identical to Mastodon's, why do you need to exist? If you're just another Mastodon instance, why would anyone give you money? When I post on HN or Twitter or Tumblr or Cohost, I at least have a good sense of how the service is moderated, what the rules are, etc. When I post on decentralized services, at any point I can discover that oh, this random instance defederated the one I was unlucky enough to sign up on, so half of my mutuals can't see my posts anymore. Don't worry, you can just migrate your account to a different instance with different rules, and hope IT doesn't get defederated! And because each instance has different rules and culture, you get to look forward to people from other instances complaining that you aren't complying with their rules. It's messy! It's not fun! Of course the rules on those services I mentioned aren't necessarily going to suit everyone's tastes. But I think that's good - a social media service doesn't need to be For Everyone to be successful, and being For Nobody is a horrible outcome. At the end of the day I see the appeal of defederation but it simply doesn't make sense as a way to spend your engineering dollars if your goal is to be profitable. It Doesn't Make You Money. reply rglullis 22 hours agoparentprevSo you are saying that you would pay for an account for Mastodon or Lemmy? reply skyfaller 21 hours agorootparentI am an admin / mod for a Mastodon server that is supported by donations from the community. I have not put my own money in the pot for a while, because I'm donating a lot of time to run it. But I would pay if I had to, and I am considering paying for a GoToSocial server to experiment with an allowlist network: https://gotosocial.org/ https://codeberg.org/oliphant/islands/src/branch/main/ion My server: https://jawns.club Our finances: https://opencollective.com/jawnsclub We're currently paying for managed Mastodon hosting on https://masto.host/ reply rglullis 21 hours agorootparentHow do you think your community would react if you switched to a \"everyone pays a little bit every year\" model? reply skyfaller 20 hours agorootparentI'm sure we would lose some people if we switched to mandatory payments. Since this is already a pretty small community (dashboard currently says 171 active users), I wouldn't care to experiment, since we'd risk losing the critical mass necessary to have an active local timeline, which for me is a major reason to run your own server. I'd also hazard a guess that many people go inactive for a while, and then check in again randomly when they need more social media in their life for whatever reason, and mandatory payments might interfere with that movement in and out of inactivity. Finally, I think pay what you want is better so long as it works, since it doesn't exclude people who don't have money, but do contribute to the community in other ways. The only real reason to move away from pay what you want is if it doesn't pay the bills, and our finances are fine for now. I can see a place for mandatory payments if you're providing extra services at a steeper price, such as paid moderation, but I think the number of people willing to pay what moderation at a living wage actually costs... is rather small. Perhaps if we made moderation more efficient, e.g. sharing moderation decisions between servers, paid moderation could become more affordable by splitting the cost between more users, but there are several problems with that approach... one being that moderation by members of your community is always going to be more clueful than moderation from outside your community. reply rglullis 20 hours agorootparentDo you think it's a fair assessment to say then you are making the same argument I mentioned in the other thread: very few people think that the service of a social media account is actually worth anything, and that this should only be treated as a hobby? Follow up question: if everyone treats social media alternatives as a hobby, do you think that it has a chance of being a viable alternative to the Big Tech platforms? reply skyfaller 19 hours agorootparentBig tech platforms aren't a viable alternative to big tech platforms, just look at the demise of Andreessen-funded Post News, if you're tired of me mentioning Google's failures: https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/19/24135011/twitter-alternat... I think the profit motive is literally destroying the world given the climate crisis, as well as destroying everything good or useful about the Internet. So I think figuring out how to do things without the profit motive is the only way forward, as impossible as that might seem. Surviving capitalism with that attitude may be challenging, but we don't have a future under capitalism anyway. I think that if the value of social media comes from the network effects, then it's not a question of whether you can find some core of users who consider it more than a hobby. (Ugh, you want a network for professionals for whom it's their job?!) For social media to reach its maximum value, it has to reach literally everyone, and at that point you're talking about something that ought to be a government service, like the postal service. For smaller networks that are less focused on reach, maybe hobbyists are the ideal providers. reply rglullis 13 hours agorootparentOh, my. You are one of them... It's amazing how we can get two people to accidentally take the same action while fundamentally disagreeing on everything else. Short version: - Capitalism is not the problem. Corporations that can take their profits in one department and use their vast resources to drive loss leaders is the problem. Break down big corporations into smaller ones that need to compete, and I can bet that we wouldn't see pointless growth and needless consumption. - \"do you want a network for professionals for whom it's their job?\" No, I want the service to be run by professionals who can make a living out of it. The people running the service need not to participate in it. Like email or phone service, you don't expect to be free and you don't expect to be talking with the service provider daily. It should be a simple utility. - \"Public funding\" is magical thinking repeated by people who don't understand basic economics: specially if you are \"against growth\" (like your comment about the climate crisis seem to suggest) then where is the Government going to get the resources to pay for developers? reply krageon 5 hours agorootparentIt's improbably hilarious how you basically don't deviate from personal attacks and strawmen at any point in your post. You don't provide a foundation for the counters to the arguments the GP makes (f.e. you propose smaller corporations wouldn't have \"pointless growth and consumption\", without substantiating how you feel such a thing is possible with capitalism as described and commonly understood). You call \"public funding\" magical thinking, but in the point right before that you mention something should be \"a simple utility\". Those are publically funded. And of course we should not forget these are strawmen and/or personal attacks. This is not a respectable post that adds to the discussion, it's one that distracts and makes everything categorically worse. reply rglullis 4 hours agorootparentWhere do you live that your electricity is public funded?

Enough to cover server and admin costs? Probably not. But it shows some willingness to pay. reply rglullis 21 hours agorootparentThis is not what I am asking. I am asking if OP would join a commercial provider of Mastodon, where access is only given to paying subscribers. I am asking because I happen to run one of those (https://communick.com) since 2019. reply jonathanyc 21 hours agorootparentI was actually searching for a commercial Mastodon host around a year ago. I would have been interested in your service but it did not come up in any search results. I remember checking out Librem One, but the signup process for that was very buggy. Other services were targeted towards people who wanted to host instances themselves, not just have an account. Even now I can’t find your service in the first page of my search results. I ended up just setting up a recurring donation to Mastodon.social via Patreon. Your service looks very cool. Just pointing out that it is very hard to discover even for people who are willing to pay, as the GP comment notes and hopefully providing a useful experience report. reply rglullis 21 hours agorootparentYeah, in my case it gets specially hard because Mastodon's project page does not point to commercial providers, only hosting services. To be honest though, I think that Mastodon is an evolutionary dead-end. It had a huge head start in the space, but I am reasonably sure that it is not the future of the open social web. I am more inclined to pivot into a multi-protocol client (like Pidgin) and offering ancillary services than trying to pick a champion and invest into promoting it. reply jonathanyc 20 hours agorootparent> To be honest though, I think that Mastodon is an evolutionary dead-end. It had a huge head start in the space, but I am reasonably sure that it is not the future of the open social web. Interesting, this was my layman's read too after a while of trying to get into it. To me it felt like it was opinionated but in ways that I disagreed with. For example, instead of a separate UI for private messages, they just add another option to the visibility selector. From a technical perspective I suppose this is somewhat elegant, but from a UX perspective it felt wrong. I saw a thread where people disagreed with it and the maintainers told them to pound sand. Similarly with quote tweets. I know you mentioned not trying to pick champions, but are there any alternatives that you thought were particularly interesting? I'm willing to put in a little time to try things out. The other thing I want to note is I just tried to use the \"Set up Auto-Pay\" button on Communick and got the error \"Could not set up auto pay.

If you are okay with centralized, just go to the cesspool of Twitter or X or Facebook or whatever else has the most network effects in your circle. If you want to control your data, go to something like Mastodon or Bluesky, where the offramp is self-hosting of the old version forever, even if they cease development on the system.

That's a pretty darn strong differentiator. There are other UX differentiators for me, but it's all subjective. Cohost didn't feel as \"cramped\" as the others. The others really put the focus on the \"micro\" in \"microblogging\", even if technically they (now) allow for longer-form posts. The culture just isn't there for it. reply codetrotter 21 hours agorootparent> Cohost didn't feel like a cesspool to me. That's a pretty darn strong differentiator.

There's no like/repost/follow counts, so engagement baiting is discouraged. It's not addicting, I can check it once a day, or once a week, and feel caught up — I didn't get the urge to keep scrolling. Oh and most importantly for me, it allows html/css in posts, which enables so much cool stuff and creativity generally reserved for personal websites. reply Twisol 21 hours agorootparentprevI don't really know -- I'm a user, not an analyst. But the two things that drew me in were: 1. There's no global firehose that your posts automatically get dropped into. I'm a generally shy person, and one of my particularities is that I don't want my content (or, well, existence) to be pushed at somebody who didn't specifically ask for it. The number of social media platforms that meet this criterion is vanishingly small, because everybody and their uncle wants an Algorithm (tm). Mastodon instances also have a default instance firehose; I'm told people don't really look at that, but the fact that it's there at all makes me overthink posting, and I end up not posting at all. Instead of a global firehose, you can add free-form tags to your post that act like much, much more localized streams of posts. You don't have to use tags at all; and you can also use completely nonsense tags that are more like footnotes, in a very Tumblr style that I enjoy. 2. The UI is wider than Twitter, or Facebook, or Mastodon. It feels like it's more inviting to longer-form content, and while there's plenty of short blurbs and memes to be found, there's just a much higher proportion of blog-style content. Also, the way reposting and commenting interact is just way better IMO. If you repost something, the comments on the original post are visible above the comments on your repost, and that makes the whole chain of interactions feel more cohesive. In contrast, quote-retweeting on Twitter creates entirely separate bubbles of discussion (often at odds with each other). And on Cohost, while you can create a repost chain to make a kind of \"thread\" equivalent, the UI naturally discourages it in favor of just making a single long-form post. reply asddubs 21 hours agorootparentprevare there any screenshots of the UI available?

Cohost's revenue per subscriber was really healthy, their subscriber numbers were pretty stable, etc. Sure, they weren't on a skyrocketing growth trajectory, but they also weren't spending aggressively on advertising. Their costs were super reasonable as an ongoing concern too compared with my experience at various startups. Losses that small are practically pocket change. If they weren't able to win investors over with their service's relatively strong performance since launch, what hope do these other services have when the investor money dries up? Do they have secret sauce that isn't \"sell customer data to OpenAI\" and \"run more ads\"? The former works right now but its days seem numbered as a realistic revenue source, and advertising becomes a worse revenue source with every passing day. i.e. from the sources I've seen, Bluesky is operating on something like $20m in total investment. That's a good amount of money, but what happens when it dries up? What's their revenue plan? Whatever it is, I hope it's more compelling than Twitter's answer for keeping the lights on, more successful than Cohost's model, and more substantial than the Fediverse's.

But if your idea of \"can work\" is \"gets us rid of all social network that makes money by selling eyeballs\", then the only way to work will be though finding a valid alternative business model. reply dgellow 10 hours agoparentprevMastodon and Bluesky do work and are decently successful reply colechristensen 22 hours agoparentprevWhat is \"ethical\" when it comes to a social media network? That either means \"moderates so that everyone posting agrees with what I mean by ethics to a satisfying degree\" (and folks do not agree on this) or just \"I have fewer complaints about the moderation of this social network than the other popular ones\". To boil this down to what I actually mean with an example: What are the \"ethical\" allowed things to post about climate change on your social network? (please don't actually fall into the trap of actually discussing climate change here). I can think of about three or four different answers to this question that large blocks of people would passionately defend. And so either \"ethical\" social networks don't exist or there is only one true ethical way to do things and that way is people have to agree with my position and lots of people who don't agree with me are very wrong about ethics. You can do this for a lot of topics and you'll find that contrary to US politics, there are not actually only two ways of thinking about the world and one of them awful. reply nemomarx 21 hours agorootparentI think in this respect they mean ethical to users - no ads, no charging money, features that are built to serve the user instead of optimizing for engagement, etc. reply colechristensen 16 hours agorootparentYou want a service that both has no ads and doesn’t charge money… and you’re saying it’s unethical do to either?

Seems like removing the humans from the equation kind of defeats the purpose. reply ertgbnm 52 minutes agorootparentDepends on the what you are trying to get out of a podcast. Most of the podcasts I listen to are because I want to learn something new in an entertaining format. I'm not listening to develop parasocial relationships with the hosts, so removing that element could be a good thing for me. Of course if you listen to podcasts because you like the parasocial aspect or the celebrity interviews, then yeah... Not really a point. reply smeej 48 minutes agorootparentI don't know that \"parasocial relationships\" are the primary reason people like having real hosts. I have a huge list of things I've managed to change in my life because I heard some other real person talking about how they were possible.

I got used to it before there was a wide selection on Audible and it's ok. You can't use audio for serious books or articles but History, Biographies, Fiction, random tech articles bookmarked in Pocket and it's locally generated, so no latency is great. Additionally, when you use a TTS engine, you can see the text and easily copy the things you want to make a note on later. With Audiobooks it's not possible. reply staticman2 32 minutes agorootparentprevElevenlabs reader does AI voices for free, not sure if they'll start charging at any point since I don't know how this fits into their business model. reply freefaler 18 minutes agorootparentIt'll be great when the AI generation gets on device and you won't need to pay per minute of text generated. Elevenlabs would burn through the investors' money someday and they'd stop subsidizing the reader voice generation. reply netghost 1 hour agorootparentprevI don't know, it depends on whether I get to control the auto generated podcast or someone else.

I'm presuming the set up here is as follows: - LLM-driven back and forth with the paper as context - Text-to-speech Pricing for high quality text to speech with Google's studio voices run at USD 160.00/1M count. And given the average 10 minute recording at the average 130 WPM is 1,300 words and at 5 characters per word is 6500, we can estimate an audio cost of $1. LLM cost is probably about the same given the research paper processing and conversation. So only costs about $2-3 per 10 minute recording.

Occasionally, the tone of the sentence is wrong (like surprised when it should be sad) and the wrong enunciation (bow, like bowing down or tying a bow) but still very listenable. reply dlisboa 1 hour agoprevOne problem I see with this is legitimizing LLM-extracted content as canon.

    "originBody": "AI + ML 27 We're in the brute force phase of AI – once it ends, demand for GPUs will too 27 Gartner thinks generative AI is right for only five percent of workloads Simon Sharwood Tue 10 Sep 2024 // 07:29 UTC AI techniques that require specialist hardware are \"doomed,\" according to analyst firm Gartner's chief of research for AI Erick Brethenoux – who included GPUs in his definition of endangered kit. Speaking to The Register at Gartner's Symposium in Australia today, Brethenoux said in the 45 years he's spent observing AI, numerous hardware vendors have offered offer specialist kit for AI workloads. All failed once vanilla machines could do the job – as they always eventually can. The need for specialist hardware, he observed, is a sign of the \"brute force\" phase of AI, in which programming techniques are yet to be refined and powerful hardware is needed. \"If you cannot find the elegant way of programming … it [the AI application] dies,\" he added. He suggested generative AI will not be immune to this trend. The good news is, he believes organizations can benefit from AI without generative AI. \"Generative AI is 90 percent of the airwaves and five percent of the use cases,\" he noted – and users have already learned that lesson. Brethenoux described the period from late 2022 to early 2024 as a \"recess\" in which IT shops \"stopped thinking about things that make money\" and explored generative AI instead. Those efforts have largely led orgs back to the AI they already use – or to \"composite AI\" that uses generative AI alongside established AI techniques like machine learning, knowledge graphs, or rule-based systems. Organizations have realized that AI may already be making a big contribution to the business in many scenarios that engineers appreciate – such as machine learning informing predictive maintenance apps – but which never caught the eye of execs or the board. Recess is over. An example of composite AI at work could be generative AI creating text to describe the output of a predictive maintenance application. The Register has often heard the same scenario applied to software that analyzes firewall logs and which now uses generative AI to make prose recommendations about necessary actions that improve security – and even writes new firewall rules to enact them. Brethenoux recalled that some orgs he speaks to still think generative AI can power their next application. He often tells them the same outcome can be achieved more quickly – at lower cost – with an established AI technique. GenAI hype meets harsh reality as enterprises wrestle with business case Microsoft exec warns of business functions being sacrificed on the altar of AI AI bills can blow out by 1000 percent: Gartner Amazon congratulates itself for AI code that mostly works Gartner's Symposium featured another session with similar themes. Titled \"When not to use generative AI,\" it featured vice president and distinguished analyst Bern Elliot pointing out that Gen AI has no reasoning powers and produces only \"a probabilistic sequence\" of content. Even so, Elliot said Gen AI hype has reached two to three times the volume Gartner has seen for any previous tech. Generative AI is, in short, being asked to solve problems it was not designed to solve. Elliot recommended not using it to tackle tasks other than content generation, knowledge discovery, and powering conversational user interfaces. Even in those roles, he described the tech as \"Unreliable like Swiss cheese: you know it has holes, you just don't know where they are until you cut it.\" Elliot conceded that improvements to Gen AI have seen the frequency with which it \"hallucinates\" – producing responses with no basis in fact – fall to one or two percent. But he warned users not to see that improvement as a sign the tech is mature. \"It's great until you do a lot of prompts – millions of hallucinations in production is a problem!\" Like Brethenoux, Elliot therefore recommended composite AI as a safer approach, and adopting guardrails that use a non-generative AI technique to check generative results. ® Sponsored: Application builders get ready Share More about AI Gartner GPU More like these × More about AI Gartner GPU Narrower topics Apple M1 Gemini Google AI GPT-3 GPT-4 GTC Large Language Model Machine Learning MCubed Neural Networks NLP Star Wars Tensor Processing Unit TOPS Broader topics Alder Lake Hardware Self-driving Car More about Share 27 COMMENTS More about AI Gartner GPU More like these × More about AI Gartner GPU Narrower topics Apple M1 Gemini Google AI GPT-3 GPT-4 GTC Large Language Model Machine Learning MCubed Neural Networks NLP Star Wars Tensor Processing Unit TOPS Broader topics Alder Lake Hardware Self-driving Car TIP US OFF Send us news",

Doom was a technological power house in the 90's. Created by 5 people in 15 months. Techs advanced enough that you could make a facade of doom by yourself over the weekend (game design aside). Game devs can be so incredibly productive. But instead, demand sweeled to insatiable heights, as well as dev teams. Doom 2016 probably had hundreds of staff involved and 4-5 years of dev time. That's basically what happens when tech aims to be bigger and better instead of how to optimize each dev themselves to be individually more productive and keep the project lean (company structures aren't helping either). reply adventured 1 hour agorootparent> That's basically what happens when tech aims to be bigger and better instead of how to optimize each dev themselves to be individually more productive and keep the project lean Comparing Doom 1993 vs 2016 makes no sense in that context. There's no scenario where you make gigantic scale Doom-style game worlds circa 2016 with even 20-30 people, much less 5-10. Art asset creation alone for 2016 requires far more staff than the original Doom. Optimizing each dev wouldn't begin to scratch the surface in terms of what you need to get to Doom 2016 if we're talking a dozen people or less. You'd need extraordinarily advanced AI agents creating for you, and the year would need to be more like ~2040-2050. The tech underlying a game like Doom 2016 is a modest part of the labor scale problem. reply entangledqubit 26 minutes agorootparentprevWhile I agree that development has gotten more complex (often unnecessarily), compared to the 90s, the sheer number of potential consumers now available seems hard to justify complaining about. reply jaggirs 1 hour agorootparentprevNothing is stopping you from using 30 year old tooling if you think it is better than today's reply visarga 4 hours agorootparentprevAnd computers have become 1 million times better in the last 2-3 decades.

It literally consumes ten thousand times as much power per unit compute as a not-quite modern GPU.

Thus GPUs have been in everything and manufactures of computers have long been trying to figure out how to use those GPUs for workloads that don't need the full power for graphics. For some tasks GPUs are better, for others CPUs with vector operations are better. There is enough room for both on modern computers and this doesn't look to change. reply BiteCode_dev 2 hours agoprevOnce it ends, we will buy more GPUs because any small website will want its own. I know that as soon as I can output 100req/s on the cheap on a llama-level model I will put it EVERYWHERE. And my clients too. DMCA handling? Content flagging alerts? Fuzzy categorization? Natural UI for end user complex queries? All LLM baby. And much, much more. reply thecupisblue 4 hours agoprevAh yes, because LLMs and Generative AI are the peak of AI technology. And in these two years they have been popular, we should have already seen trillion gazillion dollar revenues. While yes, it is \"brute force\" and we'll probably find a way (and already have) to run it on vanilla machines, there is so much more to AI than LLM's and generating photos. And even LLM's and photo generation open up a bajillion usecases that would have taken years of research and development before. But nobody focuses on these - instead, they focus on S&P 500 companies and how they haven't earned much with GenAI. Because these companies are usually known as the peak of human creativity, imagination and are ready to jump on a new technology without much red tape in it. Honestly, it's been like two-three years tops. Even talking to tech startup CEO's I don't get the feeling they remotely understand the technology or application, as 90% of things I've heard them say is \"oooh we could make a chatbot!\" or \"let's replace developers with it - oh it can't one shot generate my whole codebase? pft that sucks\". If these folks don't know how to use it, surely Jim VP of Engineering #62 at ACME & CO that hasn't used any tech except ERP's for the last 10 years will have an idea how to. reply perching_aix 4 hours agoparentDo non-managers / not-business-owners have a better way of using these technologies? Or who exactly are you envisioning as possessing that supposed pinnacle of human creativity? reply thecupisblue 4 hours agorootparent\"non-managers / not-business-owners\" usually do have a better way of using these technologies, unless the former have actually worked in the field or in the frontlines and then advanced to managers. It might sound condescending, but a lot, and I mean a loooooot of product managers, product heads, product owners, VP's, CEO's and such don't have a clue what they're doing or experience in the real world. One might be \"oh but why are they CEO then\", but hell, corporate incompetence is a real thing. I've met dozens, if not hundreds of PMs/POs who were hired based on \"oh they have organisational skills and aren't an autist when it comes to talking\". >\"Or who exactly are you envisioning as possessing that supposed pinnacle of human creativity\" Creative people. It's okay to say some people aren't creative. Most ticket-dragging meeting-slacking Jira people aren't it. I've met devs who had brilliant ideas on AI incorporation, only to be dismissed by the higher ups because they didn't understand it. I've talked to designers who's ideas could save hundreds of man-hours if implemented. But do you really think an average VP knows that they can use their existing component library to train an MMM to output pseudo-code from screenshot and then translate that into their real, existing components? Or that an LLM could be hooked up to auto-correct the mistakes in the input of tens of thousands workers that they actually have people check, wasting human souls on what is basically input formatting? Or shit, that it could even translate John from Warehouse's data directly into monthly reports without him having to go around asking stuff and wasting everyone's time? No, these people usually don't have a clue about the real-world process of actual work that goes on so, so of course they have a problem identifying leverage spots in it. reply baal80spam 4 hours agoprevSome people just can't stand that this (supposed) bubble won't pop. reply lores 4 hours agoprevWe've always been in the brute force phase of AI. Much of AI is throw things at the wall and see what sticks. reply dartos 4 hours agoparentI mean that how machine learning works, right? Millions or billions of iterations to tune some algorithms to output some data which satisfies a success metric. reply marcosdumay 1 hour agorootparentThere's nothing on machine learning that makes convergence inherently hard. And there's certainly something we are doing wrong that makes it so data-intensive. reply danielmarkbruce 3 hours agorootparentprevAI should be renamed \"Brute Force Statistical Computing\". BFSC.

It still needs to be programmable though. Can't get away from that. reply kolinko 4 hours agorootparentYou can get away from that if you constrain it to a specific type of models (say attention based). reply adastra22 4 hours agorootparentprevYou don’t need general programmability for AI inference. reply glitchc 3 hours agorootparentThe money's in the training, not the inference. If you look at Apple and Google, they already have their own hardware for inference in their smartphones. They don't need NVidia for that. reply mupuff1234 2 hours agorootparentApple and Google use TPUs for training. https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/29/apple-says-its-ai-models-wer... reply glitchc 2 hours agorootparentHmmm, that's worse for NVidia. reply Rinzler89 4 hours agoparentprevIt's already there. Have you seen the six figure AI chips that Nvidia is selling to the data center customers? Those chips are no GPUs, they can't draw a single triangle or map a single texture, they're AI accelerators all the way. People still think Nvidia is selling gaming GPUs for AI workloads like it's 2018? Google, Meta, et-all are working on their own AI chips but those chips will have to beat Nvidia's at Performance and TCO and Nvidia shows no signs of slowing down to let competitors catch up. reply kolinko 4 hours agorootparentThe chips are optimised for matmuls, but not for transformer architecture per se. With dedicated ASICS, and weights hardcoded (or stored in SRAM) we could theorically get 1 token per one cycle - so millions/billions of tokens per second, not hundreds. Etched, for example claims they have a chip reaching 500k tok/s in the works. Which is still far from the theoretical max with the current techology. A similar scenario went with Bitcoin's GPU/FPGA/ASIC - the current ASICs are millions of times faster than GPUs. reply throwthrowuknow 4 hours agorootparentThat’s fine if you never need to improve the model, which is valid in some use cases, but for chat style interaction or even code generation you’ll regularly have to update the weights. reply matwood 4 hours agorootparentprev> beat Nvidia's at Performance and TCO TCO, yes. Raw performance, not necessarily. TCO will attack NVDA's margins. When Meta last wrote about their cluster it was presented as power equivalent to X NVDA chips. They are already bringing their own chips into the mix. reply posix_compliant 4 hours agoparentprevWith Bitcoin I feel like it’s different, since the hashing algorithm would only ever change during a fork. This is rare in that it only ever happens every few years. With AI, we’re constantly training different models, which can’t be trained using asics. If we ever get to the point where we no longer need to train new models, then yeah, it will go the way of bitcoin. reply TacticalCoder 4 hours agorootparent> With Bitcoin I feel like it’s different, since the hashing algorithm would only ever change during a fork. This is rare in that it only ever happens every few years. Wait what!? Did the Bitcoin hashing algorithm ever change? reply adastra22 4 hours agorootparentIt’s never happened for Bitcoin. reply qqqult 4 hours agorootparentprevno reply kkielhofner 3 hours agoparentprev> just like bitcoin The problem with this comparison is Bitcoin has basically just been SHA256 for 15 years and likely will continue to be for some time. Transformers have been mostly dominant for at least several years but there are still other archs (CNN, RNN, etc) in various use-cases and we're already seeing nearly-fundamental changes in Transformers and \"emerging\" approaches like Mamba, RWKV, hybrids, etc. Transformers have shown remarkable versatility and adaptability (that's their whole thing) but it's already creaking and showing its age. Startups building Transformer-specific silicon are playing a very risky game that is already somewhat problematic now and almost certainly won't end well. AI is much newer, much more vast, and moving much more quickly. The ASIC design, tape out, manufacture, software ecosystem, actually getting to market, etc cycle is fundamentally too long and I suspect even the Transformer-specific silicon we see now will be viewed as a major blunder in the relatively near future: \"Oh yeah, remember those graveyard companies that did transformer silicon back in the first AI hype round?\" I cannot see how anything other than GPGPU, TPU, NPU, etc (or similar \"generic\" approaches) will have legs. reply brrrrrm 4 hours agoparentprevIt kinda has already with fixed matrix multiplication units. But beyond that, no chance. Bitcoin is an unchanging hash algo, not a developing software reply vidarh 4 hours agoparentprevGroq is one example (NOT Musk's Grok), though currently focused only on inference, I think. reply danielmarkbruce 3 hours agoparentprevAn H100 is already close to ASIC. \"GPU\" is just a path dependent historical naming. reply boringg 4 hours agoprevBetter question is who is going to fill in the gap between supply and demand and how fast will those prices drop. reply amelius 4 hours agoprevWe're also in the alchemy phase of AI. reply ravenstine 4 hours agoprevEven if there is an AI bubble and it pops, lowering the demand for GPUs, I don't see the overall demand for GPUs or even AI becoming less relevant. The lowering of demand would have mostly to do with folks getting off the hype train. Fundamentally, GPUs are about parallel processing, and that's not going obsolete. But if demand for GPUs goes down, that cam be a very good thing because that might also bring down their prices. I would call the end of this \"brute forcing\" more of a healthy market correction and less of \"see, I told you AI is bullshit.\" reply SoftTalker 3 hours agoprevCompanies like Gartner must be panicking. LLMs can easily spit out the buzzwords and MBA-textbook advice that their analysts currently produce. reply marcosdumay 1 hour agoparentPeople do not hire Gartner for the content they provide. I don't know why people hire them. But I know for sure it's not because of the content. reply dboreham 4 hours agoprevAI generated article? reply bbarnett 4 hours agoparentOf course it is, and the AI is assuring us that resources aren't really necessary long term, so don't worry. Please. reply kmeisthax 2 hours agorootparentThe AI isn't thinking nearly that longterm, it just needs to spin together enough bullshit to continue to be useful. reply hiddencost 4 hours agoprevThat's literally never happened. Machine learning is a trade off between model size (training cost), model run time (inference cost), and quality. When some task is solved (e.g., hot word detection or speech to text), it becomes a commodity and some harder task becomes the priority. reply SpicyLemonZest 4 hours agoprevI don't really buy it. The advantage of massively parallel operations seems to me to be fundamental in the architecture of modern AI systems, not something that could eventually be optimized away through an \"elegant way of programming\". It feels like hypothesizing some clever technique that would let you run graphics through your CPU. reply HarHarVeryFunny 3 hours agoparentHis argument seems to be more about the limited utility of GenAI, specifically LLMs (vs image generation), than about more efficient AI techniques. We do seem to be at peak LLM hype right now, with C-suite execs thinking of \"GenAI\" as some sort of proto-AGI that can do magic, and OpenAI/etc still claiming that AGI is just around the corner if only investors will foot the bill for $100B data centers to train ever bigger models. It's not clear what level of datacenter/GPU investment is needed for inference vs training - all the talk of massive GPU clusters seems to be about training needs, not inference. As far as efficiency, presumably we'll eventually switch to smarter (brain-like) dataflow type designs with incremental learning, but for time being we're stuck synchronously pumping 100K contexts through hundreds of transformer layers, and trillion token pre-training runs. Brute force indeed! reply ein0p 1 hour agoprevDoubtful. Everyone is so GPU starved right now that many research directions can’t even be pursued. That’s why almost everyone is basically training the same architecture with minor variations. Once/if that starvation ends, research will dramatically expand. reply blueyes 3 hours agoprevThis is dumb. It's kind of like saying: \"once more processing power is no longer useful, we will no longer need our large human brains.\" SOTA will remain at the edge of what compute can produce for a long time to come. SOTA is a moving frontier, and there will be demand for incrementally smarter models, because they save you time by making fewer mistakes. No matter how much more efficient algorithmic innovations make ML model training, compute will make those algorithms smarter. It's a coefficient. reply thnkman 2 hours agoprev [–] It's funny how we keep moving the goal post in terms of environmentally friendly energy production as technology leaps forward, with a ever increasing energy demand.

The second batch will release Friday September 6th, at 8AM NYC time. Each batch will have 1000 units available for sale. The prices are $100 for just the clone board, $115 for clone/RAM/fan and $160 for a full PCB kit, including the latest 24-bit compatible I/O boards (but not a case). No power supply is included with any package.

I’d love to see this one get embraced as much as the QMTech DE-10 that seems like an excellent alternative, however both boards require new cases and not everyone has the ability to print their own for this project. Also, I wouldn’t be doing my job if I didn’t mention all the red flags this has set off with everyone who’s ever manufactured products before; I’ve been creating and launching products for almost two decades now (at both much higher and lower quantities than this) and the information provided to us about this project over the last two months doesn’t line up with any manufacturing experience I’ve ever had. I’ll personally be waiting for a deep-dive comparison to both the original DE-10 and the QMTech version of the same board, like Ken recently did before buying one. I’d also like to see people who understand how the cores work, do a side-by-side comparison of all three solutions, however my gut tells me they’ll all work the same. So, if you’re a tinkerer, get one and see how it performs. My guess is it’ll be fine and the contradictory information was just a result of inexperience with manufacturing. Fingers crossed though.

I thought it might be also a good DOSBox machine, along with other stuff it runs, but then it's kind of equivalent to what maybe 486 SX 33?

Is there even such a thing? reply Bluecobra 6 hours agorootparentDOS gaming can be a bit tricky, it’s almost as if you need one for each generation of CPU/Graphics. Games like Ultima VII are too slow on a 386 but too fast on even a 75 MHz Pentium. Then you have the later DOS games near the end that use 3DFX/Glide.

And, vivado is free for this level. The extreme learning curve of tooling AND designs that have few parallels to draw with arduino/uC code development.

For faster 68k in the Amiga core and pentium 1 equivalent speeds in the x86 core. ii) Faster ARM chip and better ARM-FPGA fabric, opening up hybrid emulation. Currently the ARM-FPGA layer is a real bottleneck and also the ARM core is a little slow. iii) More spare IO to allow per-system custom io boards. iv) Built in IO/memory board so they can fit in a nicely designed case rather than the current eyesore. reply crtified 10 hours agorootparentSome of those wishes may be addressed by the DE25 line, which is under investigation as a possible next-gen direction for MiSTer. As discussed in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Z0l9cLO0jA reply Dylan16807 9 hours agorootparentprevThe problem is that the FPGA is still priced similarly to when it was the latest and greatest. reply jonhohle 14 hours agorootparentprevI put off buying one when they were cheap because it was already old enough to assume it would be replaced. Then nothing replaced it and the prices doubled. Now that the prices are reasonable again, I look at it and think, something better will replace this soon. reply vhold 13 hours agorootparentOne of the primary FPGA developers a while back said that it's unlikely that the MisterFPGA project will evolve to a much larger FPGA anytime soon because it's an immense gap between the current most complex cores and the systems that come after it. Not only would it require a much larger FPGA, but writing the cores is becoming way more difficult. reply throwaway48476 12 hours agorootparentThe complexity comes from chip designers gluing IP together instead of designing everyday in house. reply whitehexagon 10 hours agorootparentprevThe good thing with stable hardware is that it is well understood, and for this task 'something better' isnt really required. I also hesitated with the de-10 nano, but plunged in anyway a few years ago, with the MiSTer sdram expansion and some usb daughter board thingy. Blew my mind! and took me right back to real arcade machines. No lag, dropped frames, or other rubbish we just take for granted these days. All I was missing was a decent control deck, but I held off thinking I'd eventually build a cabinet, one day maybe! reply awill 13 hours agorootparentprevI'm in the same boat, but this will do up to n64. What else could you want? Dreamcast? PS2? Not sure it's just power, and probably so much complexity vs PSX/N64 that it won't be done for years. reply jonhohle 12 hours agorootparentYeah, there’s not much hope of anything anytime soon. Between Analogue and Polymega I’m covered for those generations. reply tourmalinetaco 11 hours agoprev [–] I have very few complaints with the MiSTer, particularly from a technical perspective, however I have a large bone to pick with Sorgelig and other‘s on their forums, particularly in regards to cartridges. While the technical reasons for not using cartridges are valid (any implementation given I/O limitations would be equivalent to a Retrode, that is ripping a ROM + SAV only to rewrite the SAV and delete the rip), the childish anger I‘ve seen displayed towards cartridges is saddening and downright hypocritical. Have we really moved so far into a world of instant gratification that any minute not spent on entertainment is seen with vitriol and contempt?

Personally, I can hardly wait for an open source cartridge-ready FPGA option to appear, and am particularly excited for Taki Udon’s projects. Till that point, the MiSTer is just a cute but incredibly expensive toy. Not yet a serious option for preservation. reply ofrzeta 7 hours agoparentWhat cartridges? Like for the Atari 2600 or Atari 800XL? I guess at some point you need to decide what type of cartridge to support because they have different pinouts and probably many other characteristics.

    "originBody": "Features of your font you had no idea about Typography Published at 10 September 2024 In the previous article (Quick guide to web typography for developers) we covered the basic steps to improve the typography in your apps. Today I'd like to expand a bit more on the topic of fonts and what you can get out of a high-quality font (paid or free). High-quality fonts often come with a full bag of goodies, it will be unwise to not use what the type designer gifted (or sold) to us. The minimal package you would expect from a font includes different weights and maybe italic. Traditionally, it was made by creating a separate font file. One for Helvetica Regular, one for Helvetica Bold, and separate files for Helvetica Regular Italic and Helvetica Bold Italic. But with OpenType features, we can pack all those fonts into one file, along with a bunch of other goodies. We'll cover some of the most interesting features, but there are more. Available features will vary from font to font, to check what is included with your font, use Wakamai Fondue. Table of contents Variable axes Alternates Stylistic alternates Swashes Numerals Small caps Contextual alternates Further reading Variable axes OpenType fonts can have one or more axes, and by changing their value, we can change the font's appearance. Axes names (and other OpenType features) consist of 4 characters, and the most popular one is wght which controls the font's weight. wght axis Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow. 100 900 There are a couple of other common axes: wdth for width, slnt for slant, ital for italic, and opsz for optical size. But in addition to standard axes, the type designer can create custom axes, which further extends the creative potential of the typeface. There are two ways to manipulate variable font axes. An axis might have its own CSS property, like font-weight which translates into wght axis. For other axes, including custom ones, you will need to use font-variation-settings property. .cls1 { font-weight: 451; /* wght axis */ font-stretch: condensed; /* wdth axis */ font-style: italic; /* ital axis */ font-style: oblique 40deg; /* slnt axis */ font-optical-sizing: none; /* opsz axis */ } .cls2 { font-variation-settings: 'MONO' 0.25; } When possible, you should prefer to use specific properties provided by CSS rather than using font-variation-settings for everything. A major problem with font-variation-settings is that it doesn't play well with cascading, as defining this property on an element completely overwrites values inherited from the parent element. Imagine a situation: you have a paragraph of text for which you want to set a specific width, and it contains an element to which you also want to apply a specific slant. Normally, you should use font-stretch and font-style, but for the sake of example, let's assume you need to use font-variation-settings. You might try something like this: p { font-variation-settings: 'wdth' 75; } .emphasis { font-variation-settings: 'slnt' -5; } The emphasis element will have the correct slant; however, its width will be reset to the default one. The correct way to set variation settings for the element would be to define values for both axes explicitly. .emphasis { font-variation-settings: 'wdth' 75, 'slnt' -5; } To work around this, we can use CSS variables. :root { --wdth: 100; --slnt: 0; } * { font-variation-settings: 'wdth' var(--wdth), 'slnt' var(--slnt); } p { --wdth: 75; } .emphasis { --slnt: -5; } On this website you can play with a lot of different variable fonts, some of them have very interesting and unusual axes. Besides axes, there are pre-defined OpenType features that can be turned on or off (and sometimes they also allow you to select one of the pre-defined values). Let's talk about the most popular ones. Alternates Fonts can contain alternative glyphs for certain characters. This includes different styles of numbers, swashes, ligatures, and just an alternative style for certain characters. But what exactly is available will vary from font to font. Stylistic alternates Starting with stylistic alternates. Those are just alternative forms of letters that you can enable. In some fonts, it might change how 'I', 'l', and '1' look to disambiguate them, in other fonts, it just replaces single-story 'a' and 'g' with double-story alternates. There are 3 different OpenType features related to stylistic alternates that somewhat overlap. Firstly, there is salt to enable stylistic alternates for all letters. It's this one setting that will likely alter how 'a' and 'g' look. Then there are stylistic sets. They are named ss01, ss02, and so on. They replace only a subset of characters with alternates. Sets might have a certain purpose beyond just changing visual appearance, for example, typeface Inter has the stylistic set 'Disambiguation' which changes the appearance of characters that might look too similar to other ones, like 'I' and 'l' or '0' and 'O'. Finally, there are character variants (cv01, cv02, and so on) that replace just a single character. There are two ways to use alternates on the web. You can enable OpenType features directly, similar to how we directly manipulate axes: h1, h2, h3 { font-feature-settings: 'salt' on, 'ss01' on, 'cv06' on; } This is very similar to font-variation-settings and has the same downside with inheritance. Another (newer) option is to use the \"native\" CSS property font-variant-alternates. To use it, we first need to map user-defined values to values that will be passed to the OpenType font: /* This is set per font */ @font-feature-values \"Work Sans\" { /* salt feature */ @stylistic { /* 'on' is the value which we'll use in styles, while 1 is what will be passed to OpenType font. */ on: 1; off: 0; } /* ss01, ss02, ... */ @styleset { /* alt-digits is the name for the set we'll use in styles, while 1 is its number (translates to ss01) */ alt-digits: 1; disambiguation: 2; } /* cv01, cv02, ... */ @character-variant { /* This notation is a bit different: here, simplified-u will be used in styles, but 6 means that it should enable sixth character variant, OpenType feature cv06 */ simplified-u: 6; compact-f: 12 } } h1, h2, h3 { font-variant-alternates: stylistic(on) styleset(alt-digits) character-variant(compact-f); } And while it's definitely more readable, this approach has the same problem with cascading, as defining font-variant-alternates on an element will overwrite the parent value instead of extending it, so in any case, you'll need to do tricks with CSS variables to work around this issue. Swashes Some fonts come with swashes, which can be used to add a bit of character to titles. Similar to stylistic alternates, there are two ways to enable swashes: h1, h2, h3 { font-feature-settings: 'swsh' on; } @font-feature-values \"Work Sans\" { @swash { on: 1; off: 0; } } h1, h2, h3 { font-variant-alternates: swash(on); } Work Sans Regular Work Sans Regular Numerals One font can have different sets of glyphs for numbers. Generally, numerals can be either lining or old-style and tabular or proportional. Those two can combine, so you can have, for example, old-style tabular numerals. Tabular numerals all have the same width. Like a monospaced font, but only for numerals. Since such numerals line up when typed on multiple lines, they're useful in, well, tabular data: tables, bills, reports, you name it. Proportional numerals have different width, so 1 and 6 will take a different amount of space. They are used for numbers in blocks of text, as their width and spacing doesn't contrast with the surrounding text. Tabular numerals: 115679141.42 Tabular numerals again: 46285.07 Proportional numerals: 115679141.42 Lining numerals are aligned by baseline at the bottom, and they all have the same height, usually the same as a capital letter. Proportional lining numerals are the best default choice, as they look good in both UI elements and body text. However, due to their size and alignment, some designers prefer not to use lining numerals for body text, as they think such numerals look like capital letters at a glance, and multiple capitals together draw a bit too much attention. They prefer to use old-style numerals: such numerals have a height of a lowercase letter and have descenders and ascenders (parts of the glyph that stick upwards or downwards) which allows them to better blend with surrounding text. Lining numerals: 36824 Old-style numerals: 36824 Which numerals will be used by default depends on your font. To explicitly set desired style, use font-variant-numeric property: table { font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums; } /* You can combine values too */ .foo { font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums oldstyle-nums; } Small caps I mentioned that multiple capital letters draw a bit too much attention when surrounded by body text. Exactly how noticeable they will be depends on the font. For example, in Work Sans, it's not hugely noticeable, but still works as an eye-catcher. To solve this problem, some fonts bundle a special variant of letters called small caps. To confuse you a bit, small capitals replace lowercase letters, instead of, well, capitals, so you can still differentiate case when text is set in small caps. Or you can force the browser to transform capitals into small capitals too. We love code names! We have code names for projects, teams, and even documents. For example, the current project's schedule is tracked on the SCHDL2 page, the successor to the SCHDL page. Well, we're still working on reducing duplication... We love code names! We have code names for projects, teams, and even documents. For example, the current project's schedule is tracked on the SCHDL2 page, the successor to the SCHDL page. Well, we're still working on reducing duplication... To make the browser use small caps for text, you need to specify the font-variant-caps property. .small-caps { /* Will turn lowercase into small caps */ font-variant-caps: small-caps; } .all-small-caps { /* Will turn everything in small caps */ font-variant-caps: all-small-caps; } If the current font doesn't have small caps, the browser will try to synthesize them from normal capital letters. If you want to disable this behavior, use this CSS property :root { /* Disable all synthesis: missing weights, italic, small caps, etc.*/ font-synthesis: none; /* Disable only small caps synthesis */ font-synthesis-small-caps: none; } Contextual alternates Contextual alternates is one of my favorite font features, mainly because it doesn't require extra work from the developer or from the person typing the text, it just works. Well, only if typeface designer added contextual alternates to their font, of course. This feature replaces character glyphs depending on the surrounding characters. This can be used to replace -> with a proper arrow. Or to adjust the position of @ when it's in between uppercase letters. Inter does this really well: And you don't even need to enable them manually, contextual alternates are enabled by default. But if you want to disable them, there is a font-variant-ligatures property: :root { font-variant-ligatures: no-contextual; } Further reading That's all for today, but we have only scratched the surface. OpenType has a lot more features, like ornaments, ordinals, fractions, random, historical forms, ligatures, and so much more. If you want to go deeper into the woods, here is a nice website showcasing some of OpenType features. And check out this talk by Roel Nieskens about OpenType features.

It's a bummer they're not more prevalent. reply adrian_b 1 hour agoparentTabular numerals are very useful in certain cases, but I find even more useful the old-style numerals. By default, I always use old-style numerals, because they are much easier to read, especially for big numbers, for the same reason why the lowercase letters are easier to read, by having ascenders and descenders that break the uniformity of the characters. I use lining numerals only in the same places where I would use uppercase letters, e.g. in titles or when a sentence begins with a number. reply o11c 36 minutes agoparentprevAny font without tabular numbers is buggy, because it can't support U+2007 FIGURE SPACE &numsp; reply jsheard 2 hours agoprevCaveat: Google Fonts, and by extension Fontsource which mostly just mirrors Googles files, strips out nearly all of the advanced OpenType features to reduce the filesize. It's worth checking the upstream version of your font to see which features it actually offers. e.g. Wakamai Fondue lists 11 features for Googles version of Inter (some essential ones plus fractions, tabular numbers, numerators, denominators and contextual alts), while the full fat version of Inter has a whopping 44 features (too many to list, see https://rsms.me/inter/). reply jfdjkfdhjds 1 hour agoparentit's the year of the lord 2024 and OSes still don't ship with a common set of open license fonts with most of unicode like nerdfonts. shameful.

If anyone, then distro creators and maintainers will have to make that step.

A rare find when there seemed to be a glut of corporate NIH typefaces for a while. macOS used to ship with a beautiful Hebrew typeface that was like the open-source font Shofar, but it seems to have been removed. I do not see similar Hebrew letters in one of the remaining typefaces. I imagine that it is not easy to give a typeface a consistent feel, in all Latin and non-Latin character sets, to the fluent readers of those languages. reply giraffe_lady 34 minutes agorootparentThe number of fonts that include even two good alphabets is pretty low. I have run into needing english and greek or cyrillic in the same document. I know of like three good fonts that have a good english and a good greek. My eye isn't as practiced at looking at cyrillic fonts but it seems even rarer for that combination. Which honestly makes sense and there may not be a solution for. Different alphabets and writing systems have their own typographical histories and conventions. It's reasonable that there is a very limited design space where you're adhering to the conventions of two separate systems as well as maintaining interior consistency. reply creata 1 hour agorootparentprev> a common set of open license fonts with most of unicode I am (clearly) clueless here, but isn't that what Noto's supposed to be? reply jmcmaster 1 hour agorootparentNoto doesn't ship with OS, and users need multiple fonts for different use cases. Grandparent comment is saying that Microsoft, Google, Apple could settle on a common set of open licence fonts and bundle them with the OS (and Linux distros / other OSS OSes could also do the same). Then web design & dev could rely on those fonts without having to locally serve them, or embed with Google fonts, etc. Noto could indeed be one of the bundled fonts in this alternate reality. But no real incentive for any of those big players to do so, and disincentive for Google who gain surveillance data from font embeds as noted elsewhere in thread. reply inferiorhuman 2 minutes agorootparentApple ships six Noto fonts (non-Latin alphabets) with the current version of MacOS. jsheard 1 hour agorootparentprevAlthough if you're not too picky about the finer details or being perfectly consistent across every platform, the system fonts are generally good enough nowadays to put together a pretty decent stack without having to resort to serving web fonts. https://github.com/system-fonts/modern-font-stacks Even if you are using web fonts, those stacks make for good fallbacks. reply jfdjkfdhjds 37 minutes agorootparentprevfirst of, currently it is impossible to cover all of unicode because, surprise surprise, we still have page table issues! the same char in zh, tw, jp, kr might use the same unicode id but have different glyphs. secondly, yes, but even google fonts strip most things from noto it serves because they want the fine grain data of each site/user is using wink wink. reply matheusmoreira 1 hour agorootparentprevProprietary OS problem.

That's the most obvious use-case, but it's just a mechanism to control \"which points in a glyph's outline go where based on what one or more variables are set to\", so just using it to change weight is... kinda obvious and boring?
