I use a paid version called Comic Code [1] I find it very easy to read as well as fun. I had similar feelings about using Monaco in the past. I find it personally makes programming easier on the eyes and enjoyable. I remember reading the font is similar to the letters that are taught in kindergarten which is a theory of why it's easy on the eyes. [1] https://tosche.net/fonts/comic-code reply jrmg 15 hours agoparentTo my eyes, especially at small sizes, Comic Code has way more ‘Courier’ to it than Comic Mono. reply card_zero 13 hours agorootparentIf you look at screenshot #5, the text is the same size as the text the page is written in, yet looks very different. No slab serifs on 'r' or 'n', and a less quirky 'y' and 'k'. So now I don't know if the page is written in the font it's talking about, or some other font. Confusing. reply LeonidasXIV 11 hours agorootparentAccording to my browsers dev-tools the text on the page is Dossier[0], which happens to be a font by the same author. I admit I also first thought that it would be set in the font its trying to demonstrate. [0]: https://www.tosche.net/fonts/dossier reply hapidjus 11 hours agorootparentprevThe page uses the Dossier font. reply rob74 13 hours agorootparentprevYeah, it's different enough to avoid triggering my Comic Sans allergy, but OTOH at least Comic Sans has a clear purpose (comic-style lettering), while this sits in the middle between Comic Sans and a \"typewriter-like\" font (Courier), and I somehow can't imagine a typewriter with this font... reply graemep 8 hours agoparentprev> I remember reading the font is similar to the letters that are taught in kindergarten which is a theory of why it's easy on the eyes. I know some people find it easier to read, but that explanation does not seem right to me. For one thing are kids not taught to read using printed materials? I taught my kids to read using whole words - flash cards and then \"look and say\" books and those did not use fonts anything like this. I personally find it hard to read and it slows me down slightly. I wonder whether some people benefit from being slowed down? Maybe making their eye movements more deliberate or efficient? reply PawgerZ 3 hours agorootparentI believe they mean similar to the fonts when you're learning the alphabet, not when you're learning to read. Like those books where you trace \"A\" ten times then \"a\" 10 times then \"B\" and so on. reply adastra22 19 hours agoparentprevAnother Comic Code user here, although I only bought it because I didn't know about these free alternatives which look just as good. It seriously reduces eyestrain and makes me more efficient. First thing I install on any new computer! reply cubefox 17 hours agorootparentComic Code does look significantly better than Comic Mono (which wasn't created by a professional) in my opinion. Just compare i and l (lower case L), for example. https://fonts.ilovetypography.com/fonts/tabular-type-foundry... reply strunz 19 hours agoparentprevI really like his Codelia font; but I just can't justify spending that much on a font when there's so many free alternatives. Wish the was a cheaper non-commercial license. reply groby_b 18 hours agorootparent$15.50 for something you use every moment of your working life? It's not that much. It's fine to use free versions instead, but maybe let's stop asking for freebies from folks who make their living that way, especially from Indy folks. (Badger your average megacorp for free stuff for all you want, they'll find ways to extract money somehow) reply Eezee 16 hours agorootparentYou need at the very least 4 of those $15.50 fonts to cover italic and bold. If I could get the entire font family for $30 or so I would consider it despite all the free alternatives, but $150 is just way too much if you are making a non-US salary. reply brantonb 14 hours agorootparentThere is a “Comic Code Coding Essentials“ bundle for $30, licensed for up to 5 users. Unfortunately, it’s at the very bottom of the page so it’s easy to miss. reply groby_b 1 hour agorootparentprevI suppose I'm the last person alive to just use plain text. So, yes, sorry for that omission. The full collection is $100. At average European salaries, that's (at worst) half a day of work. Not unnoticeable, but if you care about your tools, not an amount that's entirely unreasonable. The coding family is, as you say, $30 - 90 minutes of work. Beyond US, Europe, and other affluent countries, yes, it gets somewhat unaffordable. I don't have a good answer here. But I don't think asking indy folks to fix global inequality is the right answer, either. They need to live too. Some choose to release their fonts for free (Monaspace, Comic Mono, Inconsolata...), but that's a choice they made for themselves. They ultimately decided it was affordable for them to do that. And that's great! But I really have a problem with complaining about people who are trying to make a living, demanding they give away their work. One because it's somewhat entitled (\"I deserve to get your work for free\"), and two because it's a large part of what discourages indy work. Something our industry sorely needs. reply bmitc 13 hours agorootparentprevThat's actually insanely cheap for a font as well. reply e40 16 hours agorootparentprev$30 is the bundle that seems minimally useful. Does it work on all OSes? reply happymellon 10 hours agorootparent> Font formats > .OTF, .TTF, .WOFF, .WOFF2 Hopefully your OS of choice supports one of those. reply unplug8224 8 hours agorootparentFont creators once again treating TempleOS users like they don't exist? Color me shocked. Jokes aside, this is the only font I've ever paid for, and I use it for all my text editing across Linux/MacOS/Windows with no issues. reply fsckboy 15 hours agorootparentprev>$15.50 for something you use every moment of your working life? $16 to upgrade my life? well worth it. $16 to own something that I'd need to carry around for the rest of my life in a file, or track a download code for, and configure into every new system I boot up, and... nah, that's buying a responsibility creatives out there: you are using and benefitting from the free open source internet where other creatives gave away their work product free. Stop trying to monetize your tiny contributions. reply ghssds 14 hours agorootparentTrue. The only ethical way to obtain money is by working for a corporation. Corporations are the only entities that legitimately can sell anything. reply monban 8 hours agorootparentAs the common saying goes, no ethical consumption without capitalism! reply creata 12 hours agorootparentprev> Stop trying to monetize your tiny contributions. If you think they're not worth it then just click away. And syncing a file isn't exactly hard in 2024. reply awkward 17 hours agoparentprevOne similarity it has with fonts specifically designed to counter dyslexia is that every character looks different. The handwritten look introduces more cues for the reader to pick up on than a more precise font. reply cubefox 18 hours agoparentprevThe font used in the text of the linked piece is different (significantly worse) from the one in the picture at the top. reply rootforce 18 hours agoparentprevThis is cool. I unironically use comic mono as my daily driver. It helps me remember to have fun. reply mstade 10 hours agoparentprevI first saw this when I was on a screen sharing session with a client, and couldn't help but ask – is that... is that comic sans? Turns out he was also using Comic Code, and he basically had the same feelings as you towards it. I thought what the heck why not, and gave it a go. Now I'm hooked as well, for the very same reasons. Coding, somehow, is just more fun and enjoyable now. Moreover, it's probably one of the more legible fonts I've ever used. Didn't expect that! reply Syzygies 13 hours agoparentprevLigatures! Or not! Nice. reply mlsu 20 hours agoprevWhile we're in this thread suggesting comic-style monospaced fonts, I can recommend Monaspace Radon: https://monaspace.githubnext.com/ (go down to variants, it's 4th) It actually works! I actually really like Comic Sans and that style of font. Don't understand the haters! reply dspillett 20 hours agoparentMy two problems with it were/are: 1. Gratuitous overuse often in inappropriate places (bad news from work, invitation to a funeral, etc.) 2. The fact that it was optimised in its hinting for low resolution screens common around the time of its creation (and its initial target, via MS Bob) making it not optimal for higher resolutions (in print, or on more modern higher resolution screens with or without sub-pixel rendering). If you are going to use that sort of font, I think there are better choices than Comic Sans itself (unless CS has had updates over the years, which, come to think of it, is not unlikely). If you really want to wind up people who care too much about what fonts you use, try combining the two most overuses and disliked with Comic Papyrus: https://creativemarket.com/blog/designer-combines-papyrus-an... (since renamed Comic Parchment due to litigious arseholery). reply magnetowasright 15 hours agorootparentFuneral invitation in comic sans (or your combo punch of comic sans + papyrus) is absolutely my vibe, brb gotta update my will to stipulate this Jokes aside, I see a lot of either font on local small businesses' branding and it definitely makes an impression, for better or (usually) worse. I'm probably missing out on some great local businesses because I've written them off without really thinking about it until now because of using either font. reply adastra22 19 hours agorootparentprev> inappropriate places You're begging the question. Why is it inappropriate? reply mannykannot 18 hours agorootparentBegging the question? It appears to be an opinion, and it is definitely not an argument. reply adastra22 18 hours agorootparentStart of thread: > I actually really like Comic Sans and that style of font. Don't understand the haters! Then you replied saying among other things that its use is inappropriate in many contexts. But that’s circular. why is it deemed inappropriate? reply xpe 17 hours agorootparentYou can't spell funeral without fun. reply dspillett 17 hours agorootparentprevYou seem to be talking to three posters as if we are all the same person… reply mannykannot 8 hours agorootparentprevWith or without the apparent misidentification of authorship, it is not clear to me what could be seen as circular here. reply dspillett 16 hours agorootparentprevWell, I gave two examples of many possibilities. To go into a bit more detail on them: Bad news from work in a jovial friendly font like comic sans would be inappropriate from the view of entirely failing to show empathy and read the room. A typeface like that on a 0% pay rise, redundancy notice, or news that the team had lost a significant contract would be an extra slap in the face. I have seen this sort of thing. The level of incredulity that could be read into your reply begs a question or two back: do you really think it might be appropriate?, and if so: why? The funeral notice is more of a grey area as it depends on the person being funed. I don't think many would want comic sans used in that context, I know I wouldn't, but of course some might, and may even request it. Heck, if they requested bright rainbow striped Ransom Note Extra Bold with added porn windings, darn well use that. It is their funeral, after all. reply meowface 19 hours agoparentprevI don't know if I'm unique or something, but Radon is extremely painful for me to look at and makes everything harder to read. It makes me feel like I'm dyslexic or something. I currently use Fira Code and find that very easy to read and look at. reply jihadjihad 18 hours agorootparentIt’s not just you. A few weeks ago I saw the “noble gas” fonts here on HN and gave them a try, ended up going back to JetBrains Mono. Still haven’t found one that can reliably displace it—even my prior daily driver, Fira Code! reply jnrk 12 hours agorootparentI've taken the Coding Font blind test tournament a couple of times the last years, and I somehow always end up with Fira Code as the winner. https://www.codingfont.com/ reply me_jumper 5 hours agorootparentawesome page, thanks for linking that! reply cy_hauser 17 hours agorootparentprevTry Hack. I've tried many including Jetbrains Mono and Fira Code. Both are really good but I drifted back to Hack. It just hits a comfortable place for me. reply meowface 16 hours agorootparentMaybe I just need more time getting used to them, but I just tried installing JetBrains Mono and Hack and switched between them + Fira Code a bunch and I still prefer Fira Code. reply card_zero 12 hours agoparentprevI just don't like it as a comic handwriting font. Something about its character, or lack of character. It should feel lively and impish, but instead it feels lame and half-dead, to me. There's all these attempts at quirkiness like the 'C' with its irregular curve and little hook, but they all fall flat, they don't seem natural, they don't have rhythm. It gives me a feeling like I've been handed a weak joke and I'm expected to read it aloud. reply perelin 8 hours agoparentprevMy daily driver for the last year or so. But it really is an acquired taste.

The LibreSSL logo still has it on their site and if you scroll far enough here [1] they go off about 'weaponizing' it, something about the license actually being free enough to piss off linux nerds while being what it is enough to piss off design nerds https://www.openbsd.org/papers/bsdcan14-libressl/mgp00001.ht... reply dfc 18 hours agoprevI use fantasque sans. I forget what made me choose it over Comic Shanns. It's worth a look if you like this style. https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans reply noisy_boy 14 hours agoparentIt is quite readable, has a certain softness along with some uniformity to it without all the comedy. I used it for quite a while before settling on Iosevka. reply imp0cat 13 hours agoparentprevFantasque Sans Mono has those fancy \"a\" which I quite like. reply tmtvl 6 hours agorootparentIBM Plex (which I'm currently using) also has the double-story (or Roman) 'a', I like how distinct it is from 'o' and 'q' compared to single-story (or Italic) 'a'. reply OJFord 10 hours agoprevI wanted to hate this, but it's actually not horrible at all? Looks nice just as a regular sans-serif font even - turns out the issue with comic sans is the letter spacing? reply knallfrosch 8 hours agoparentI've tried Operator Mono, SF Mono, Ubuntu, Roboto, Consolas etc. Switched daily, weekly, monthly.. But I've been using Comic Mono for 2 years now (SW developer) and forgot all about it. The mark of a truly great font. reply navane 7 hours agoparentprevI was ready to laugh, but instead I felt peacefull. There's a remarkable serenity to this font. reply mellonaut 11 hours agoprevThere is a fork of this[1] that includes programming ligatures, which might make this a more viable FOSS alternative to Comic-Code mentioned elsewhere. [1] https://github.com/wayou/comic-mono-font/ reply worewood 18 hours agoprevI'm working on a fork of it [1], because the original didn't have diacritics (á,ã,etc.), the metrics were a bit off for me and the \"f\" has a line at the bottom which I didn't like; and I'm also trying to adjust parameters because some IDEs (Eclipse on Windows) are have problems with it. I've also made it work with Python 3 and put the source fonts in submodules so you don't need to search for them manually to build it yourself. Work in progress. [1]: https://github.com/caioycosta/comic-fork-mono-font reply gcarvalho 18 hours agoparentHuh, I’m pretty sure the version I use is the one from the post and it does have diacritics. (I’m not on my computer now but will check later.) One thing that bothers me, though, is that “í” is oddly positioned and almost makes it look like there’s an extra space between it and the following character. reply ahmrz 14 hours agoprevI've been using a similar font called Maple Mono [1] for around a year now, and it's amazing.

What they all have in common is slab-like serifs on the i and j. It is not an easy problem to solve to make these two fit harmonically in their allotted space but does anyone know a monospace font that solved this issue in a different way? reply BugsJustFindMe 5 hours agoparentPointfree does it right by giving i and l friendly curves. reply throwgfgfd25 21 hours agoprevWow, this is weirdly lovely. I don't think I would code with it (probably!) but it would look great for sort of blackboard-ish code samples in teaching materials. reply BugsJustFindMe 16 hours agoprevAs I said a year ago, the i, l, and f serifs feel extremely non-comic. It's not right if it's not sans. IMO https://www.dafont.com/pointfree.font is still the best monospace comic font. All the others try to uncomic themselves with smoother more regular letterforms as though the goal for some reason is to become more mechanical and less lovingly human. No! I reject it!

Just wait until you find out how much a professional design font costs! reply prmoustache 12 hours agorootparentIt is all relative, if you want the set of normal, italic, bold and bold italic you need the 80$ package.

It an expense you might not be ready to spend for something you may not be 100% sure you will want to use for more than a couple of months. He has a set of demo fonts but from what I understand this would swap random characters to rectangle so you can't really try it working on an actual code.

All the others are trained on authentic content and this boy gets socialised on the most shallow content imaginable. Poor, socially awkward AI. reply raffraffraff 21 hours agoparentWhy on earth would you train AI on that? In the social media world it's already the closest thing resembling boring, unreadable machine generated content. No matter what you ask it, it'll brag about what a great job it's doing answering you, announce that it's having a baby, then tell everybody that it's being let go because there are better AI. It'll thank a few key people who it worked with, and tell you that it's actually thrilled with this opportunity to take a break from answering your question, and will spend more time on its old hobby of being an online resume. reply theiz 20 hours agorootparentBecause there is a huge market for resume builders and career guidance where AI can play a role. Using LinkedIn you can measure success and network performance and correlate that to the resume and posted content. reply vidarh 13 hours agorootparentThere's also real money in writing LinkedIn content that is believable enough for \"influencers\" to post. I'm currently contracting, and post on LinkedIn at least once a day, and I've added ~1k+ followers in the last month, but it takes effort. Meanwhile, those posts have gotten me work, and so if it was feasible for me to outsource it in a reputationally safe way, I'd consider it. For me the bar for \"reputationally safe\" is really high because my market (cynical tech CTO's etc. don't respond well to things that sounds like ChatGPT) and so I don't expect to any time soon, but for many others that bar is pretty low as long as it's good enough for LinkedIn's algorithm to give it impressions. reply itsoktocry 7 hours agorootparent>I'm currently contracting, and post on LinkedIn at least once a day, and I've added ~1k+ followers in the last month, but it takes effort. Meanwhile, those posts have gotten me work, and so if it was feasible for me to outsource it in a reputationally safe way, I'd consider it. If you need to pay the bills and this helps, good for you. But boy howdy does this sound terrible. It's amazing to me that there are people out there who take anything on LinkedIn seriously. I mean, it's not like the posts are inherently bad, but the entire point of the site is to \"influence\" and sell to each other. It's horrible. If I were looking for talent, it'd probably be the last site I'd use. reply sbarre 6 hours agorootparentAre you ok to accept that you're probably an outlier? Because while I have kind of the same opinion as you, I also know lots of (good and generally smart) people who say they learn a ton of useful work-related stuff from reading LinkedIn posts. Not everyone is at the same point in their career, or has the same level of knowledge and confidence in their craft or job position. For some folks, reading thoughts and writings from more senior people can actually be beneficial.. And yes there's a lot of platitudes and BS on LinkedIn, but some people do put real effort into sharing actually useful information as well. reply Terretta 6 hours agorootparent> people who say they learn a ton of useful work-related stuff from reading LinkedIn posts I suspect this says more about what the reader doesn't know and their mastery of info self-exposure than it says about the contentfulness of LinkedIn posts*. * Not counting content originating elsewhere re-posted on or linked to from LinkedIn. reply sbarre 3 hours agorootparentSo all LinkedIn posts are of the same quality then? Would you also say that all HN comments are of the same quality too? You're painting with an awfully big brush. Look I get it, there's a lot of crap on LinkedIn for sure, and it's pretty obvious this crowd is generally against \"influencers\".. I also see no value in them generally speaking. But it's reductive, and inaccurate, to say that there's zero value across the board on there and that every post is low-value influencer-spam. Not everyone is trying to build an audience or push their newsletter. Some people just want to share their knowledge and interact with their professional peers, and for better or worse LinkedIn is the most known place to do that.. You could say the same thing about this place. Why are we all here? reply Terretta 2 hours agorootparent> You could say the same thing about this place. Why are we all here? Not to preen or self-promote or \"network\". Most here are anonymous. Both of us use names, and you have the meethn and I have a \"we are hiring\" ...

The only argument is that the added value by influencers is zero, be it on Instagram or LinkedIn, so if AI can take that kind of job the net loss is also zero. Of course of course there's an audience for influencers, like there was an audience at Tupperware shows, but they'll be happy to move on to the next fad so again zero loss. reply selimnairb 7 hours agorootparentOnce again, AI will automate checkboxing tasks—-things that some people think some other people value so it has to be done even though basically no on values it so no one wants to do the soulless task. reply kklisura 10 hours agorootparentprev:insert Christoph Waltz meme: You're sheltering LinkedIn slop, are you not? reply bostik 12 hours agorootparentprevAnecdotally, I think a fair chunk of writing CVs (and to a smaller degree, cover letters) is already outsourced. Adding an AI to the mix will only make things worse. I have seen a number of CVs over the past few months that fall into two eye-rolling categories. First, those that have the same set of skills in the exact same order, and routinely sport identical expressions. Over time I've come to associate them with low-grade content farms. Second, a smaller set of exceptionally polished ones that feel unique and really want me to interview the candidate. These candidates will then utterly bomb in the interview, to the point where I'm often asking myself whose CV it was they had submitted. Signal-to-noise ratio is tending towards zero. reply itsoktocry 7 hours agorootparent>Anecdotally, I think a fair chunk of writing CVs (and to a smaller degree, cover letters) is already outsourced.

Now, every resume gets answered and your first interaction with a company is a poorly scripted AI who goes from manic enthusiasm to depressingly rote in the actual job requirements and probably will still ghost you and continue the imbalance of application effort vs employer response. The converse will be true, but the price of AI will just make poor people have to suffer even more Just the long march of wealth inequality and it's time sucking capitalism. reply jongjong 18 hours agorootparentThis seems to imply that machines would ghost humans to save on token fees.

A recent issue in the job application realm is AI application bots that will apply to 100's of jobs on your behalf, which is the opposite problem.

While needless to say it was a lot more varied for men. It was just very blatantly showcasing that a lot of people were looking at profiles for reasons that were not so professional. Now the sidebar is a mix of other features, and I wonder if that was because it was easier to do that than \"clean up\" the profile views. reply dartos 6 hours agorootparentprevWouldn’t you want an ai to talk to recruiters for you? reply slashdave 13 hours agorootparentprevSo you can make more boring, unreadable machine generated content. reply Propelloni 20 hours agorootparentprevThat made me laugh.

If it was just a bunch of linked profiles with a job matching function, it would still be LinkedIn. But of course, you can't work at a place that does something that mundane without suggesting something that makes you look like Facebook or Twitter. You have to at least give people some sort of reason to see what their old colleagues are up to. Nobody really wants to read the LinkedIn feed, so it's perfectly acceptable that it gets flooded with AI generated content. In effect, the content on LinkedIn is that picture of a happy family on your insurance brochure. You can't not have a photo of something on that kind of marketing document, and you can't be a social network without some sort of doom-scrollable content. This is just a cheap way to generate some wallpaper. reply Gethsemane 9 hours agoparentIt is a shame. Twitter used to be quite a popular platform for (useful and interesting) networking in academia, but after it began to fall apart everyone started looking for alternatives. I felt that LinkedIn should be a decent alternative as it could strike that balance between professional and personal content, but there is just no way for a genuine community to develop on LinkenIn in its current form. Even now LinkedIn is possibly the worst platform for being polluted with \"AI slop\", I cannot understand why they are looking to advance this further.

If LI was just business profile, jobs board, and chat with recruiters, how much engineering would they need? I’m not saying to go Twitter mode and fire everybody, but certainly much less than now. So for that extra revenue from the feed, a lot of it will be eaten up by salaries for extra engineers. All of the extra work is going towards something largely viewed as useless. Zooming out, I bet a lot of the economy is like this. In LI’s case literally some of the smartest people, people with PhDs who were maybe even born in another country, thinking for 40 hours a week about how to rank one piece of meaningless drivel above another one. This is instead of solving real, tangible problems that everyone can see. Ok maybe those people will pay taxes and end up contributing to something like education because they have to, but it’s a pretty inefficient way of making the world better. reply fy20 16 hours agorootparentLinkedIn also have tools for recruiters and sales folks to find people. I believe this is where a big part of their revenues come from (they are paid tools). Although, again I cannot imagine it being that complicated. reply lordnacho 19 hours agorootparentprevWell I got invited to Twitter HQ back when it was still called that. It was some obscure team offering an app library of some sort, IIRC. It certainly wasn't something close to the main product.

From the article: A 2021 study empirically tested several of Graeber's claims, such as that bullshit jobs were increasing over time and that they accounted for much of the workforce. Using data from the EU-conducted European Working Conditions Survey, the study found that a low and declining proportion of employees considered their jobs to be \"rarely\" or \"never\" useful. Many jobs that appear bad are actually needed, often only because of regulatory requirements or because their importance is misunderstood. reply consteval 1 hour agorootparentIn my opinion, in today's world most jobs (at least office jobs) are \"movers\". They take something from point A to point B. Often you'll have a chain of movers A - Z. Each link can almost be it's own company depending on the industry. Naturally each thinks they're important, because someone has to move it around. Of course, you could go from A straight to Z and eliminate 25 companies. Point is many, maybe most, companies don't actually produce direct value. They facilitate and they move. Now that's much harder to analyze. reply sensanaty 9 hours agorootparentprevThese are self-reported, though. I wouldn't tell my boss or my colleagues the job I do is useless for hopefully obvious reasons, but when I really think about it in the grand scheme of things it really is a Bullshit Job. Basically any SaaS is (with some exceptions of course) just a collection of Bullshit Jobs. But there's also nothing really wrong with that. We live in the society we live in, which basically necessitates the existence of many Bullshit Jobs in order for things to keep working as they do.

I don’t want to earn money for nothing, even if most people involved feel as though that in itself is worthwhile. It has been a fairly significant factor in any struggle I’ve had finding work. I have to ask myself, is this a bullshit job? The answer is often yes. I’ve recently remedied this to a degree by lowering salary expectations and looking in fields with a more scientific and practical basis in the products and outputs.

But that isn't enforced with the teeth it really needs, and I really don't trust that companies like LinkedIn will do the right thing, nor the legally required thing where they differ, given how much effort it could be and the likelihood of anything being done about it if they don't and this isn't obviously detected (or a whistleblower speaks out). So my choice is to walkaway from the service (or never use it in the first place) or just accept that my stuff will get used that way. That, and given it is public information that we've already agreed to let LinkedIn use however the hell it likes via signup and “by continuing to use this service”¹, so there would be the whole “is it even a privacy issue?” argument² to have before getting to that nitty-gritty. ---- [1] again, maybe there are legal routes to stop that, though I don't know about you but I certainly can't afford the time or legal resources to investigate further [2] I'm assuming “right to be forgotten” doesn't apply in this case, as we are talking about a particular use of the information not wanting the complete removal of it from all their services. reply bogdanstanciu 19 hours agoparentprevI wonder how this works if someone in a GDPR country got slurped up somehow.

And even contemporary LLMs make this much more accessible, for more casual use, by more people. Presumably this sharing of data for training is already happening, and (of course) the new \"preference\" defaulted to ON, even for people who'd previously opted-out of related privacy settings (e.g., \"Profile visibility outside LinkedIn\" was OFF). A ton of LinkedIn users are private individuals (not public figures). They're only on LinkedIn because they want continued employment, that's where the recruiters are, and many employers and other opportunities (including YC?) require LinkedIn profiles. Given LinkedIn's dominant role, with many citizens required to use LinkedIn for something as basic as employment, and meaning people have to share personal information with LinkedIn, maybe it's time for US regulators to set rules on how that information may be used and shared by LinkedIn. reply rdhyee 22 hours agoprevI can get to that setting (when logged in) at https://www.linkedin.com/mypreferences/d/settings/data-for-a... reply telesilla 21 hours agoparentThis tells me that the page does not exist (apparently because I'm in a GDPR region that doesn't allow this behavior from LinkedIn, I understand now from reading this thread). reply fredski42 15 hours agorootparentSame here.

This disregard for your customers is very typical now. Not even a \"how do you do\" or a popup informing me of this change to my \"preferences\". reply too_damn_fast 8 hours agoparentWhat do you use premium for? Apart from linkedin learning, I found no valid use. I was getting fake messages which are literally just ads even when I had premium. reply jlokier 6 hours agorootparentFor me it's because when I was actively looking for a role without Premium, LI started to block me from viewing people's profiles half way through each month, saying I was looking at too many profiles a month for the free tier, so I had to get premium to keep reading. I had no idea; I didn't think I was reading many and I wasn't doing it systematically, just being curious. After getting Premium, I could see who viewed my profile and how many views over time, which I felt was useful. It tells me about personalised top jobs, and it sometimes comes up with things I wouldn't have searched for that do seem interesting. Nothing ever came of those as jobs, but I've learned about companies doing interesting things which overlap my skillset as a result. There's also the ability to send more messages a month to people I'm not connected with, but I write so rarely that's never been an issue. I'm still on Premium by choice, but I still get the fake message ads, spammer connection requests and promoted ad posts. In the end, my last 3 jobs were obtained via LinkedIn, the current one was via a LinkedIn social post which caused me to write to the poster, and a field I work in now (zero-knowledge proofs) is because of a conference someone talked about on LinkedIn. Many plausibly good contracts are advertised only as LI social posts, not even as LI jobs. So it's undoubtedly valuable to me for work, and valuable to have parasocial connections on it (to see those posts), even if it is a strange mixture of fake platitudes and real but self-interested posts. reply renegade-otter 4 hours agorootparentprevSometimes I want to send a \"cold\" message. reply krsna 7 hours agoprevCan’t help but wonder how much of what’s posted to LinkedIn today is already the output of an LLM.

The only way to fight company's greed is regulation through strong legislation. Thanks to the GDPR, in the EU (extended to the European economic area) and in Switzerland, LinkedIn can't use their users personal data to train their AI. It is made clear in there FAQ [1]: > Note that we do not currently train content-generating AI models from members located in the EU, EEA, or Switzerland. Anyway, the best move is still to just get out of this platform [2]. LinkedIn has a history full of dark patterns and really bad behaviors concerning personal data. At some point they even impersonated their users by mailing their contacts (sometimes shadily scrapped) in their name without the impersonated user consent or knowledge.

Any help would be appreciated. jesterswilde 11 hours agoI am blind, it was degenerative so it sounds different than what your kid has. I have a few pieces of advice. This is more about my own upbringing, so don't take any of it as an accusation towards you. 1) Don't hide things about their condition or prospects. I grew up in a very loving home. However, my parents found out I was going blind when I was ~8, I didn't find out until I was 13. My mother wanted to protect me from 'being the blind kid'. But I was. Not knowing made everything so much harder and more confusing. 2) Don't rely too much on technology. Stick and dog are the best tools blind people have. Everything else, in my opinion, is a flash in the pan and won't have long term support. Not made by blind people and with minimal consulting for them. Like what a sighted person thinks a blind person needs after closing their eyes and walking around their house for a few minutes. (Screen readers are useful, I'm not talking about those.) For a piece of tech I was excited for and is now dystopian: https://spectrum.ieee.org/bionic-eye-obsolete 3) Foster independence. The world is not made for us. It's also full of high speed metal deathtraps. The easiest thing to do is stay inside where I know where everything is. Even walking to the grocery store is a deeply uncomfortable endeavor. But I need to do it. I need to be able to live with that discomfort and not let it dissuade me from living the most human life I can. The blind cane is very valuable. It took me too long to accept blindness as an identity, get over the shame, and start using it. I lost a lot of time to that. Blindness sucks in every conceivable way. It affects every part of ones life. But I had a good childhood and I have a good life. All things considered, I'm extremely lucky for the circumstances of my birth because of the family I was born into. You can't take away the blindness but you can still give them a wonderful life. reply Moru 6 hours agoparentMy daughter had a few disabled children in the same group during her kindergarden/school years. No more than one or two at the same time. It was always started with a proper explanation of the handicap and the problems and how to handle the situations. And after that there was just natural playing with eachother in the group. Children are wonderful at learning, accepting and adapting. It just takes a good teacher to lead them on the right path from the start. reply DanielleMolloy 5 hours agorootparentI see the necessity good intentions behind it, but also believe this singling out can lead to developing this sense of shame the user mentioned. reply jesterswilde 9 minutes agorootparentThe shame was my own issue of going from sighted to blind. A disabled person is singularly different than most other folks (although people with major disabilities are ~16% of the population.) The momentary discomfort of being singled out is just the price of admission and better than the alternative of people not understanding out how interacting with us or choosing not to. reply zdragnar 4 hours agorootparentprevEverything has failure modes. The idea, I think, is to get it out in the open up front, after which it is just the new normal that everyone accepts, rather than drag out discovering implications of the difference again and again as they uncover them. reply tomcam 10 hours agoparentprevI have a couple of handicapped kids and definitely vouch for #1. When the first one was born, my wife agonized about whether we should spoil that child because of the handicap. My answer was resounding no. We would simply deal with it, and the kid would have to understand that there were certain limitations. This was tough for my wife, but she acceded. It worked out well. reply PaulRobinson 8 hours agoparentprevWithout wishing to minimise the very real, very serious consequences of your blindness, your points sound familiar to somebody who suffers from severe anxiety. People being overly protective makes things more confusing. Technology (including many medications), often don't really deal with the root cause, but some things do help (like talking therapy and some meds). Independence can be challenging, going outside can be challenging, going outside can be a deeply uncomfortable endeavour, and yet getting on with life is important and so we keep moving. I'm sure blindness sucks in ways I can't easily empathise with as a sighted person, and so it's not anything close to a reasonable metaphor, but I feel I empathise with a sense of discomfort, anxiety and confusion. I never thought it would be the same. Thank you for sharing, and keep moving. reply jesterswilde 7 minutes agorootparentNo worries, I get where you're comin from. Nobody can truly understand what anyone else is goin through and we all have to use ourselves as proxies. reply DanielleMolloy 5 hours agoparentprevThank you for sharing. I'm in research that is somewhat attached to the technology side and find 2) particularly interesting. Did you ever look into electrotactile tongue display units? What is your opinion? I'm curious about what neuralink will present soon. Musk mentioned \"atari graphics\" recently, so they probably will for now only focus on generating phosphene-based crude bitmaps in the primary visual cortex (which has been demonstrated to work years ago). I can't know what they are up to and believe / expect they are internally more ambitious about stimulating the higher visual system. But if it boils down to the phosphene bitmaps I expect TDUs (which have FDA approval, already seem to work well and don't require invasive surgery...) to become part of the discussion. reply tway_GdBRwW 4 hours agorootparentI guess that might depend on how much you trust Musk. reply DanielleMolloy 3 hours agorootparentI trust Musks ability to attract stupid money and hype towards highly beneficial technology and research goals. reply lhamil64 4 hours agoparentprevI've also been legally blind since birth, although I have a decent amount of usable vision.

The main crux of #2, for me, is that there is many technologies people push or suggest to me. They are often short lived, or buggy, or help in a handful of cases but not enough for me to rely on it and make it part of my patterns. What tech have you found reliable and beneficial? Specifically I'm interested in new tech that has actually panned out in your estimation. reply gautamcgoel 10 hours agoparentprevThanks for sharing this perspective, it was very interesting. reply tkuraku 5 hours agoparentprevThanks for your comment.

Bussing is feasible, and some communities (not nearly enough) are good about providing or have non-profits that operate shuttles for those in need as well. A typical suburb will often have apartments near retail areas, but residential districts without alternate transit options may as well be deep rural if your only option is walking through intersections without traffic lights. reply iteria 8 hours agoprevI just want to second the person who said to reach out to your 0 to 3 program. It's extremely important because your child's blindness might be fixable. I was born blind. But it was because of nerve damage. I don't really understand what all the doctors did, but they managed to restore some sight in one eye by the time I was in 3rd grade or so. Enough to read if the book was close and the text large. By the time I was in late high school, I was able to get vision that was functionally enough that I didn't need any kind of accommodation. By late 20s, I had 20/20 vision (I mean in one eye, but that's all you need!) It can be a long road, but the body is very use it or lose it, so starting early is so important. I still have some visual processing issues, but I need no support and I can even drive during the day. Technically at night too, but it's too iffy for me, so I avoid it at all costs.

One of the kids in my 4-year old son's class is blind. I went along for a day to help out on a school trip to some massive playground, which involved loading 60 kids into a bus (they usually walk/bike to school, so not everyone was used to the idea of large buses); keeping track of them in the playground, feeding them, etc etc. Lots of potential for disaster, haha. Throughout the day, it struck me that for the most part this blind kid was just another kid amongst peers. It was very wholesome to see the kids understand his limits instinctively, help him out whenever needed but mostly just bantering and playing alongside him. I never gave these things much thought before, but observing this I saw the importance of having quality, supportive peers to interact with. I hope you can find a supportive, nurturing environment for your boy: one that highlights and reinforces his strengths, not his weaknesses. reply YinglingHeavy 8 hours agoparentHijacking this to give advice critical for a baby who is only a few months old.

Thing is, that clicking can actually be used to develop a type of vision that operates similarly to echo location in cetaceans (whales, dolphins, etc.) – it comes about because the child realizes that if they make a sharp sound, they can begin to orient themselves with the reflections of the sound waves. After all, vision is in the brain; the eyes are just the sensors. Point being, if your son starts making clicking sounds with his tongue, you likely won't want to discourage that. And on the flip, teaching him to click may provide a means of developing his vision in an alternative way. Edit: Here's a Pubmed article on a study where blind and sighted people were trained to echolocate: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8171922/ reply jesterswilde 11 hours agoparentLearning to understand the world around you via clicking isn't a natural or easy thing to do. I can't do it personally but have looked into it. For me the benefits didn't seem worth the time investment (plus I was older when I looked into it.) Learning to click to understand what is around you is, IMO, a viable thing to look into for your kid and decide if you want to undertake that training. Daniel Kish is the name of the guy most famous for it and would be a decent place to start looking. An amusing anecdote and a bit of blind throwing shade a blind: https://youtu.be/u-7w3m7fhl4?t=326 reply ClawsOnPaws 8 hours agorootparentFellow blind person here, adding my own anecdote. I click and echolocate. I have two different kinds of clicks. A soft click for very immediate surrounding which I can do rapidly if I need to, and a loud click for figuring out large spaces which I don't use very often for relatively obvious reasons. They're quite helpful for me and especially in new unfamiliar spaces it's almost a reflex that happens on its own unless I consciously try to stop it for social reasons. Just to add another datapoint. What works for one might not work for another, so there's a lot of trial and error involved in figuring out what works and what doesn't. This can be very frustrating sometimes but sympathy will go a long way. Something I wanted to add, maybe this thread in particular isn't the best place for this but in general, I'm very lucky that my parents did not prevent me from doing things that others may have. For example, I climbed trees, rode a bike, and generally tried to do all of the things my sighted peers were doing. Naturally there were accidents, but not preventing me from doing those things, not preventing me from learning my limits, learning my balance and physical control, getting hurt and getting back up, I believe were absolutely vital to making me the person I am today. I imagine as a parent this can be very stressful or worrying, but I honestly do not believe I would be as independent now if I wasn't allowed to do those things back then. So unless it is absolutely certain that this is something that they will not be able to do at all, maybe consider letting them try it. It will absolutely help confidence, self worth and skills for later independence that are very, very, very badly needed and very easily missed. I'm not a parent however, so of course take this with a grain of salt. My experience may be slightly biased here. reply jesterswilde 14 minutes agorootparentWhat age did you start learning to echolocate and how long did it take?

That would emit soft bleeps, faster when something is on the way or closer to an obstacle. Can be built easily with an Arduino I think that another possibility could be to fill your home or workplace with those devices put on walls or furniture. The idea would be that your table could say to you \"lookout, I'm here\" when you are about to crash against it. Use it first in the areas that were more problematic. The volume of the bleeps should be reduced to a low comfortable whispering level so they don't annoy the user. I wonder why nobody has created still a kitt providing a soundscape for blind people. That product should have a different click sound for each object marked in the soundscape. Another possibility would be a snapshot soundscape, where a remote control could turn on/off the system only when necessary providing the blind people with a mental picture hearing all the blips at the same time and its position respect to the other blips. Like a cane, but covering much more distance reply pvaldes 9 hours agorootparentHum, that last idea deserve more time I want to propose this system. Imagine that you are on a workplace where blind people came often to work or as clients. There is a soft, low, slow and sparse music that is pleasing to hear as a background for anybody and is always changing. Now lets imagine that this music is codified and played on a 3D system. Every time we hear a piano note it means \"door here\", all bass notes mean \"danger/stairs\" and a flute means for example \"WC\". That would be awesome for blind people navigating new places without interrupting other workers asking for directions. Each one of this signals would be played on intervals of one minute or more, never less, so most of the time you have either silence or pleasant sounds that don't bother other people and the notes played by a particular instrument are changed each time for the same reason. If we need more information, we could add short cords from popular music to convey additional words. For example acould play on piano the four note sequence \"here on my car\" from Gary Numan, or iterate over a list of similar parts of very popular songs with the word \"car\" on it to not be too repetitive. Of course it just could also just say \"garage door\" when a modified white cane approach like on elevators, but that could be distracting for non blind workers. reply bluGill 5 hours agorootparentSystems like that have existed for decades in various versions. The only blind people who use them are people who went blind as an adult - and then often only the investor. People who went blind young have learned to deal with the world and discover technology like that is more annoying than helpful. Dogs and canes work very well and solve most of the problem. It doesn't really matter if they are walking into a wall, piano or door - they need to know to avoid it. If you want useful sounds require every traffic light to have beeps when it is safe to cross loud enough to be heard across the street - because that is a real problem blind people have in navigating. Most of the rest of the world is forgiving to the types of mistakes blind people make and so they don't really need help. The other way you can help the blind is just be willing to give directions from the sidewalk in front of a building to the front door. reply navigate8310 8 hours agorootparentprevInstead of the sound clues triggering every minute, it may trigger on arrival of the person wearing RF ID or phone. reply pvaldes 2 hours agorootparentUnless there is a lot of blind workers in the room, much better, yep.

I would 100% support a mothers right to choose, and if that meant that any one of us did not exist because of it, so much the better. A life not lived is guaranteed harm/suffering that didn't happen. This is consistent with negative utilitarianism, which is a better moral or ethical framework than any other. Also consistent with Jainism, which is the only religion in the world that means it when it preaches non violence (but is down with suicide) A whole lot of the world believes in reincarnation (~1 billion people), and have advocated for positions similar to this in their extensive bodies of philosophies for millennia. The idea that we are not to help someone on their way to the next, hopefully better life is just as silly sounding to them as it is for me to go to the 1 billion+ abrahamites around the world and tell them that heaven/hell isn't real. Simply admitting that some conditions make life not really worth living for a lot of people is not worth getting worked up over, especially when it bears out in data that blindness definitely does make people want to choose that option. I can't always blame them: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4624868/ Quoting the abstract \"Mortality was significantly increased in the visually impaired (SMR = 1.3; 95% CI 1.07–1.61), but in gender-stratified analyses the increase only affected males (1.34; 95% CI = 1.06–1.70) and not females (1.24; 95% CI 0.82–1.88)\" Most of the lack of increase in Mortality is explained by women trying and failing to commit suicide far more than men. I'm sure they tried more often too, but this was not explored in the paper. From https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle... (2024, systemic review/meta analysis): \"The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis support the association between visual impairment and increased risk of suicidal tendencies. The risk differed by age group, with a pronounced risk observed among adolescents.\" It is unpalatable to talk in such a direct way about these things, but like a lawyer who has the benefit of distance away from the problem of a client, I, fortunately am not blind, and this is sometimes a good thing.

If we want disabled people to not be treated as outsiders, then it seems to me that disabled people need to be integrated into as many aspects of society as possible, including school, so that kids have disabled people as peers from as early an age as is practical. If some of us have to suffer the consequences of bullying or unfair treatment, then hopefully that's a temporary state, and the fact that more people have interacted with us from a young age is a step on the road to equality. Of course, the reason I can say that is that my experiences in mainstream schools were mild, in retrospect.

We had many concerns - he did not track objects as they moved across the room, he did not recognize me or my spouse whenever we had gotten a haircut or put our long hair up in a ponytail. Our pediatrician was dismissive because our son was sensitive to light. We pushed and pushed and got an appointment with a pediatric ophthalmologist. They were able to diagnose him pretty quickly with Oculocutaneous albinism because on top of everything, he was very sensitive to light. The doctors we worked with have been amazing — he was fitted with glasses (he can see 20/200 with them on!). He had surgery for strabismus and for nystagmus when he was 3. For whatever specific diagnosis you receive (if you receive one!), there are already a lot of resources for you. Occupational therapists are helpful to help meet milestones and adjust. When our kid got closer to school age, the school helped with therapists to take him on walks with a cane and even did pre-braille. Everything we've done is to foster independence in everything he's capable of doing. They took him to the grocery store with a monocular to help him identify things to buy. They helped find specific sunglasses that blocked out light. They helped with countless other things in his movement and activity that have allowed him to really excel in life. For broader learning, one good starter resource is the National Federation for the Blind (NFB). They have regular publications that explore different scenarios of what it is like to live every day. Depending on your son's diagnosis this may be helpful, or there may be one more specific for your situation. For albinism there is the National Organization for Albinism and Hypopigmentism (NOAH), which is large and even has a yearly conference! There are also countless Facebook groups and Reddit, which can be helpful to remediate daily issues, but also to get a really comfortable feeling for people who have grown up with blindness and what their lives are like. My son is now 10 and for the most part, he's not really defined by his disability. He knows it's a key part of who he is, but he has figured out what works for him. He has to wear tons of sunscreen outside and cannot remove his sunglasses on a sunny day. He uses his cane sometimes, and decided not to learn braille. He sits at the front of his classes and sometimes needs something in larger print. He reads a ton, excels in school, and makes friends just like any other kid. He's really a joy to be around, and all the work that he put in when he was younger was absolutely worth it. reply zerkten 5 hours agoprevI hope things work out as well as they can for you. I don't have experience with your situation but wanted to offer one suggestion of a resource for help if you are in the US. Before getting connected with them, I was completely unaware of what early intervention services were provided by our county. They have been an enormous help but most importantly, they are a great set of professionals who do everything possible to help the children in their care. reply red_admiral 9 hours agoprevI don't have any resources specific for blindness, though I know a few people who are blind and still have a great quality of life. I have my thoughts on the \"disability is not a disadvantage, just another way of being\" crowd because that doesn't work for my own situation, but for blindness, I can see the point they're making. There's that old study that looked at what kind of parents give their children the best start and success in life, and after some factor analysis, the single most important attribute was \"loving\". Disability doesn't change that. You might find Matt Might (of \"illustrated guide to a PhD\" fame) comforting on the topic of having a disabled child in general: https://matt.might.net/articles/tenure (despite the title this post is not primarily about tenure). reply xkzx 10 hours agoprevI used to volunteer in a youth camp where some of the participants were blind. As a challenge, everyone spent at least a day blindfolded. Me as well, and to be honest, I got the hang of it relatively quickly. Within 4-5hours I could navigate the building, eat, go to the toilet etc. and my other senses got more keen. It was truly an interesting experience. Not all is bad. You might not know what it is like, so I suggest you try it yourself. Of course, you will need other people that see around you that day, but it will sure give a closer perspective to what your kids life might be. Once in a while I still meet one of the blind kids from the camp (he is 22 now, he was 14 then) and I have to say that he is truly amazing. He echolocates, rides a bike, finished University studying law. went to US, learned English there. Now he wants to know Russia better, so he is going solo on the Transsiberian express.

I'll say a thing or two about living with disabilities though. My friend's kid and my own kid's. My best friend's kid has some neurological thing that stumped his ability to control his left half of his body. Without therapy, this results in muscle atrophy from lack of use. My friend very bummed out about it. But I told him not to worry [1]. Specifically, with the right therapy and proper attention from the parents, the kid was going to end up being the toughest of the three boys. Long and behold that kid is eight, trying out for soccer for the nine year olds and my buddy told me that the kid is the toughest of three. Lesson: you cant make the disability go away, but if you have the right support they can help mold you into someone better. My kid is allergic to everything (including contact anaphalaxis). His diet is very specific. I wield the threat of the ADA as a bludgeon against anyone who tries to exclude him by not being reasonably accommodating. Out if fear, my wife considered pulling him out of day care [1], but I refused. First we couldn't afford being on one income, second he needed peers and was turning two. He's doing very well in day care. He's a social and charming little bugger. We worked out that he cannot have lunch with the other kids and he is aware. Once a month my wife makes lunch for the whole class. Then he can sit w/ everyone and he comes back with a big smile ranting about how he sat next to his buddy or girlfriend. He's only three but he's starting to understand that he has a personal challenge he has to manage and start taking responsibly (i.e. the day he stole a cheese puff he ended up vomiting and in the ER) Lesson: always go for bat for the kid. Never accept that he's unreasonably excluded or accommodated. Don't be afraid. we've probably put in 100 hours of time just on accommodation for him thus far (last year and a half). Lastly, we know a family that has twin, teenaged, severely autistic, boys. No matter how bad it gets, I always remember that I have it easy. [1] Both my wife and friend are the real stoics roll with life's blows types. Im not at all stoic, but I learned a bit from them. I was only reminding them what they already knew. Difficulties can be opportunities to grow. reply ajb 11 hours agoprevHmm I'm far from an expert but no-one else had commented on this aspect: it's not just about how they take in information, it's about how the lack of sight will affect their development. So worth thinking about what the different things your son needs to learn developmentally at each point and whether you can support that with sound, smell and touch. There are some academic articles on this that can be found on Google scholar. If he is only partly blind there may also be ways to make sure that visual brain development is supported reply miki123211 6 hours agoprevCongenitally blind person here, here are a few pieces of advice that I think are the most important. 1. Be the polar opposite of a helicopter parent. A lot of blind people end up extremely incapable as adults, because their parents were too afraid to let them learn anything that might have possibly been somewhat dangerous. Sighted kids can recover from this by watching how others do things, or, in the worst case, watching some tutorials on Youtube, we don't have that luxury. Beware of the sighted specialists that encourage these protectionist attitudes, which we unfortunately have plenty of. This stuff is genuinely hard, my parents actually tried pushing me to learn, but I never really had a motivation to do so, so I mostly didn't, and then had to deal with the consequences later. I figured it out and basically ended up fine, but many in my situation would probably have been stuck at home forever. If you can find a way to teach your kid good white-cane skills without making them miserable, they'll be grateful to you forever. 2. Most blind people eventually end up unemployed, because there aren't that many blind-friendly jobs to go around. The best chance of getting a well-paying job is being somewhat good at tech, and trust me, blind people need to be a lot better at tech than the sighted to use it effectively. You can't just pick up a smartphone or computer and \"wing it\", you need to actually learn how a screen reader works. Then there's the inaccessible software to deal with, and to do that, you need to understand all the weird features that your screen reader can offer. It's a good idea for parents to encourage tech use. Mine were extremely hands-off about the internet and what I did on it, and I genuinely believe that it's the single best decision affecting my life that they've ever made. Keep in mind that, to a blind person, a smartphone is not \"just\" a smartphone, it's also a way to communicate with other blind people around the country / world (and there are few enough of us that just meeting your friends in-person isn't often an option). Not to mention the apps for reading books (which are important because many books never get released in Braille), detecting colors, describing things, reading text on paper documents / labels, interacting with kitchen appliances that otherwise wouldn't be accessible, checking train/bus schedules that you wouldn't otherwise be able to see and so on. With that said, a phone definitely does not replace a white cane, and probably never will. 3. Avoid blind schools for as long as you possibly can, preferably forever. Go mainstream if you have the option. No idea what country you live in, but the idea applies in most places. 4. Encourage forming friendships with sighted people. Make them aware of the blind community, definitely, but don't let them get stuck there. This is hard, far, far harder than it would be with a sighted kid, but it should be a priority, and you should do everything within your power to make this possible. reply throwaway2037 4 hours agoparentThis is a great post. Thank you to share. First hand experiences like this are one of the best parts of HN. This part: > If you can find a way to teach your kid good white-cane skills without making them miserable, they'll be grateful to you forever. Can you go a little deeper on this one? What are some good ways vs bad ways to teach white-cane skills? Last: A question for myself. Sometimes, when I ride the subway, I see a blind person trying to navigate the station, platform, and train doors. Usually, I hang back a few meters to make sure they are OK.

It's not clear how you reached this conclusion, definitely talk to your pediatrician. It can take a baby anywhere from 4-10 months to be able to focus their eyes on any object more than 6-8 inches from their face. Most kids start to focus around 6 months, but a delay in and of itself does not indicate an abnormality.

Reduced contact to his overprotective mother. My most important advice: Support your child, but don't forget to let him make his own experiences at some point. Don't overprotect, which is the worst for blind people. Coping mechanisms are very individual, but one pattern is clear: Those overprotected that don't flee from their parents end up being even more disabled. Why? Because you need time and space to figure out what you can do and what you can't do. But parents have this tendency to protect so much that the child can never find out what they are good at. PLEASE, let him grow and and take risks. He will grow by being allowed to take risks. If your wife has over-protective tendencies, speak to her, make her understand. I can not emphasis enough how important that is. In fact, we have a saying in the blind community: \"Parents exacerbating the disability\" (Zusatzbehinderung Eltern). reply fb03 9 hours agoparentThis advice is generally helpful - overprotective parents or caretakers will always stunt a kids growth.

I can only imagine the range of emotions you must be experiencing, and I can see your love and concern for your son shine through your post.

Actually, I’m begging you to do that, because even if there’s a problem, it could be treatable. Other than that, I have no specific advice I can offer here, but my wife and I are going to pray for your family. We wish you strength! reply madaxe_again 10 hours agoprev [–] A whole bunch of folks here talking about your son, which is fine, because that’s what you asked about - but from experience with friends and family members with disabilities, and friends with kids with additional needs, the people who will need the most help are you and your partner, if you have one. As I’m sure you’ve gathered by this point, a kid is a lot of work. A kid with additional support needs is a lot of work. I’m not just talking about physical labour, but emotional labour. It is hard to watch other kids develop “normally” and see your own struggling, through no fault of their or your own. I strongly, strongly recommend that you seek therapy to talk this through with someone who knows the territory. Help yourselves, it will help him more than you can know. You will also find that a good therapist with the right specialisation will be able to give you much, much better advice than us internet hobos.

To be clearer: Patents that are invalid can get issued because the reason for it being invalid is not known, and I'd argue that nowadays this is likely a vast majority of patents.

Often the patents are repetitious: There are over a hundred variations of the well-known checkerboard and over a thousand different baseball games. ... Preceding THE LANDLORD'S GAME by just under a year, on April 21, 1903, Patent No. 726,023 was granted to Henry Busch and Arthur Jaeger, also for a game board. Their game, called BLUE AND GRAY, made no lasting impression in the world of games which, I suppose, is understandable since it didn't have the innovative qualities of THE LANDLORD's GAME. Yet it was, and is, a delightful pastime, which should particularly appeal to the ChEckers fan who is looking for something different. The name Blue and Gray, of course, refers to the uniforms of the South and the North in the Civil War and in the original game the playing pieces of the contestants were of those colors. https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/19254/blue-and-gray reply wang_li 15 hours agorootparentThe light reflecting boardgame patent is surprising. It is literally laser chess which is a computer game that came out in 1987. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_Chess reply shagie 5 hours agorootparentThe patent covers the game board and some variations that are specified for such a board. Give https://patents.google.com/patent/US7264242B2/en a read and see if that describes the computer game. If not, it's something different. 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to board type games played on a game board or surface, preferably a substantially orthogonally gridded, planar surface, and more particularly to a game which selectively diverts a beam (e.g. laser beam) by user-placed mirrored game pieces that are moved laterally or rotated during play. 2. Description of the Related Art Many board games have been provided which use paths across their surface as part of the game. An example of such a game is chess. In addition, games exist that depend on the deflection or reflection of objects off of other objects to “score” points. The following US Patents are examples of board games, each hereby incorporated herein by reference: U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,516,671; 5,145,182; and 6,702,286. Going into the patent citations there are a number of other laser board games that it references that are different games with different claims as to what they patent. Here's a different board game with lasers that predates Khet - https://patents.google.com/patent/US5145182A/en Is it different? Do they claim different things? Having something similar isn't necessarily legally similar. Blue and Gray is a checkers game that is played on a checkers board with checkers pieces and is distinct enough to receive a patent. Trademarks protect names. Copyrights protect that text or music or ... Patents protect that idea - the rules and mechanics of that game. The game of the present invention generates a “beam” for each player, which can be a low-powered laser diodes to emit a beam of colored light. These beams are reflected and deflected around the playing field by mirrored surfaces of pieces, or stopped by non-mirrored surfaces of pieces. The game is won by a player who strategically maneuvers pieces to reflect a laser beam so as to illuminate a key piece belonging to his opponent, e.g., a “Pharaoh” or “King” piece. With each turn, a player may move one of his pieces to one of the potentially eight, unoccupied adjacent squares (front, back, left, right or diagonal) or may rotate (re-orient) one of his pieces. After moving or rotating a piece, that player presses a fire button that triggers the emission of a beam above and parallel to the playing surface. If the beam hits a non-mirrored surface of a playing piece, that piece is removed from the board and eliminated from further play, unless it is the key piece, e.g., “King” or “Pharaoh” piece, in which case the game ends. The pieces can vary in design and setup, with mirrors being located on multiple (e.g. one, two or more) sides or no sides. And more specifically the claim about movement: 39. A method of playing a game by opposed players; said game comprising two sets of distinguishable playing pieces, each set having movable pieces with no mirrored surfaces, of which one is a key piece, and pieces with at least one mirrored surface, a game board consisting of a first end, a second end, and a plurality of rows and columns, intersecting to form a plurality of spaces, the method comprising the steps of: placing each player's set of playing pieces on the game in a pre-determined starting configuration; and alternating turns, each turn comprising moving, either a translation or a rotation, a piece followed by activation of a laser, said alternating moves continuing until one player illuminates the opposing player's key piece; wherein moving a piece consists of a movement one space in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal direction to an unoccupied adjacent space. Does that describe Laser Chess? reply wang_li 3 hours agorootparent>Does that describe Laser Chess? Yes. Very much it does. It's been 35 years since I played Laser Chess, so perhaps there are some minor differences in the rules. But it describes a game so close to Laser Chess that it immediately brought the game to mind. reply shagie 3 hours agorootparentIn laser chess, pieces have different movement rules. You can move a piece 1 or 2 spaces in a single direction (1 east, or 2 east, but not 1 north east unless that was used as two moves). You could also rotate on your turn. Firing a laser was optional. In Khet, you can move one piece 1 adjacent spot (any of the 8) or rotate (not both) and you always fired the laser. The rules are different - and the rules are patented. If you had different rules that weren't covered by the claims, it would be a different game. Laser strategy game board - https://patents.google.com/patent/US20080054563A1/en - that's a different game that was patented after Khet. https://youtu.be/4nQaWJEBFNk (and if you want to play a digital version https://store.steampowered.com/app/312720/Khet_20/ ) vs https://archive.org/details/laserch or https://archive.org/details/msdos_Laser_Chess_1994 They are different games with different rules. reply wang_li 2 hours agorootparentIt seems to me like taking chess, same pieces, same game board, same movement, same rules except you can't en passant in the A or H file.

I've always been under assumption that one can avoid patent infringing if the underlying implementation is different enough. For example, one of more famous patents is Sega's yellow arrow on top of the screen, showing player where is the next objective. In your game you can still use that feature of \"showing player in which direction the objective is\", you just have to be more creative about it, here are some immediate ideas I got: - small red hand pops up from side of screen when you're stuck for a minute and points to objective - player character himself points with hand to your goal - make sun, moon or other celestial body appear on the sky in the direction where the objective is. Each of these provides the very similar feature without infringing on Sega's patent. reply ThrowawayR2 17 hours agorootparentprevMy understanding is that game mechanics are not copyrightable but they may be patentable, e.g. the US patent for Shadow of Mordor's Nemesis system (https://www.gamesindustry.biz/warner-bros-finally-secures-pa...). reply JonathonW 16 hours agorootparentprevMonopoly was patented-- in 1935.

I don't recall the details, but Wizards of the Coast infamously had a patent on a specific combination of mechanics in Magic: The Gathering, which led to several card games carefully constructed to not infringe the patent in question. This typically took the form of all cards in the game being included in a single box instead of random packs, but in at least one case a company produced a pointed parody in which the instructions told players to not to assemble decks from randomly allocated cards and then \"tap\" them for resources because that would be patent infringement. reply Dalewyn 16 hours agorootparentprevIANAL, but I'm going to chime in as someone familiar with one significant aspect of how the Japanese patent system is used. It is very common in Japan for large companies like Nintendo to file and hold patents for smaller companies, this is especially prominent in the video game industry. This is a tradition borne out of, ironically, refusal to use the patent system at first. For those that don't know, a lot of Japanese society operates on the honor system. You are expected to be truthful and honorable in your business dealings and in general. Patents were initially shunned because Japanese people didn't see a need, you don't need a rights protection system if everyone already respects them. That notion went straight out the window once Japan had to compete on the world stage: Suddenly, westerners saw Japanese ideas that weren't protected by patents and patented them and Japanese companies subsequently got sued and lost. This led to a critical reassessment of how Japanese values are applied, and the result was that larger companies with sufficient financial strength would register and hold patents for smaller companies (not necessarily affiliated, by the way) who don't have the money to pay for all that, and in exchange those patents would be shared as a Japanese industry-wide good. Nintendo is one such custodian of patents for the wider Japanese video game industry at large. I am going to presume that Nintendo is suing Palworld for reasons beyond just its own interests in Pokemon. I haven't played Palworld nor have I looked at the details of this lawsuit, so I can't make an in-depth comment; but this probably isn't Nintendo acting like a copyright draconian as they are commonly seen in the west, rather they are likely doing this for the sake of the entire Japanese video game industry at large. A few years ago, Nintendo sued (and won) a fellow Japanese video game developer, COLOPL, for infringing on mechanics patents that Nintendo was holding as custodian for the industry. Why? Because COLOPL broke the gentlemen's agreement and filed their own patent for the mechanic. reply codetrotter 15 hours agorootparent> A few years ago, Nintendo sued (and won) a fellow Japanese video game developer, COLOPL, for infringing on mechanics patents that Nintendo was holding as custodian for the industry.

While the primary goal of the game is to get all of the pals, most of your time is spent putting your pals to work building up your base, breeding better pals, and manufacturing the weapons needed in order to get even better pals. This is a stark contrast to Pokemon games, where you just walk around challenging gym leaders. It's an entirely different game. So if Pocketpair reskinned a few assets sure, pay Nintendo 5% at most. But those skins had nothing to do with the success of the game and Nintendo doesn't deserve anything more than that. reply pseudonymcoward 10 hours agoparentI think this is kind of a bad take.

From larger studios there has been stuff like \"Monster Hunter Stories\" and \"World of Final Fantasy\". Palworld is really a \"survival crafting\" game and is closer to a game like \"Conan Exiles\" which has a similar gameplay mechanic of capturing slaves to put to work in your base.

Not at all similar, unless Psyduck suddenly got Gatling guns. reply slightwinder 6 hours agorootparentprevCatching is pretty much the same, fighting, yes and now. Original Pokemon is round based with a specific battle screen, while Palworld is real-time on the overworld. Though, the latest Pokemon-Game has a mode where Pokemon can fight others in real-time in the overworld, without interaction of the player. And IIRC you can also catch Pokemon from the overworld directly or at least initiate a Player-controlled fight. So it's very similar to Palworld, but not exactly the same. reply komali2 13 hours agoparentprevIt's a good example of how IP can throttle our societal creative output. For a couple thousand years we all traded stories and art and dances about shared characters, such as various gods, heroes, legends, and monsters, and then suddenly if someone invents a new hero or monster oops now only they can make stories about it or you go to jail. It's absurd. Pokemon has made bajillions of dollars, surely it's time to acknowledge it belongs to our common culture and we all now have a right to make up our own stories, games, music, whatever around it.

Yes it was a great game but the mechanics of gameplay existed for ages; prince of persia had the 3d platforming, the ones previously mentioned for FPS, i don't think the gravity gun was unique itself, but perhaps in a first person shooter, it was. Heck borderlands and rage take half life style gameplay to new places. Minecraft wasn't original (also Lego, in there too). innovation requires \"remixing\".

Another game company, Konami, is suing Cygames for--in short--having a system where characters compete and can be leveled up. Plus the concept of \"fair use\" technically kind of exists legally but not in practice. You sample something and the owner doesn't approve, you're screwed. You don't sample something but simply say something that lowers their reputation, you're screwed (the bar for \"libel\" is incredibly low--even facts can be successfully tried so long as it can be proven that the intention was to in some way lower a person or particularly a company's reputation). The last one is particularly funny since you'll see the media giving endless praise to a CEO/businessperson and treating them as Jesus 2.0, but the very day they die, the floodgates open and you find out they've committed every crime known to mankind and everyone around them knew it. Basically, Pocketpair is quite likely heavily screwed. Nintendo can attack them on several fronts and likely will. People saying they made a better Pokemon than Nintendo themselves probably angered a few people within the company and it's easier to take them out legally than to actually compete. reply Jach 12 hours agorootparentGiven Nintendo's last lawsuit related to patents took several years and ended not with a court win or the game ever shut down during that time but with them getting a settlement, Pocketpair is likely fine.

Patents are not there to protect scientific discoveries or intellectual works. It's much easier to compare two screw heads and work out who copied who from the dates they were put on the market than it is to work out who invented the flashing icon first. What's more, it's an endless debate as to whether the flashing icon can be traced back to an ATARI 2600 game from 1988 is a prior art. Furthermore, patent protection must not have a disproportionate effect on the market. A patent and the licensing conditions for a technology such as the seat belt or ABS brakes should not completely prevent other car manufacturers from implementing them. Software patents are often at the limit of mathematical demonstration, the absence of prior art is difficult to prove and they have disproportionate effects which are exploited by patent trolls. The market is made up of thousands of small studios and independent developers who don't have the means to search for patents. This is not the same as the aerospace market, with 5-6 major manufacturers all backed by law firms specialising in intellectual property and patents.

Copyright: you can create software that does the same thing differently. kinda like torrenting vs direct download, they both deliver bytes too you but the bytes are delivered/received in very different ways. taking someones software/machine instructions (the bytes that are the code) and calling it your own is copyright infringment. if someone creates a new patented algorithm and you copy that algorithm into a different language then it is patent infrigement. also patents have too be filed and approved while copyright is generally a given if the copyright is not already existing (depending on your jurisdiction i guess) reply Loughla 16 hours agorootparentI'm not sure how that answers my question.

Anyhow, top voted comment on this whole hacker news article is a satirical article on how PalWorld copied Pokemon characters but added guns, so yeah, you guys claiming it isn't a ripoff have minority viewpoints but you are pretty insistent on it, so have fun with that! https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41588152 reply GaggiX 6 hours agorootparentIt is indeed satirical but you can agree with the SEO spam you sent before, just don't expect people to agree with you and whine about it if they don't, in fact I really doubt it's the minority viewpoint given you got downvoted and plenty of people upvoted mine, reality speaks for itself. reply flykespice 17 hours agoparentprev [–] I'm surprised Nintendo took so long to sue them.

    "commentBody": "Pivotal Tracker will shut down (pivotaltracker.com)221 points by sandinmyjoints 5 hours agohidepastfavorite164 comments kjksf 4 hours agoFree business idea: clone Pivotal Tracker as a solo dev / small team. People often ask: how do I find business ideas? Well, here you go: many people publicly saying how they love a product that is going away. This is a validated product: people were paying for it. Apparently quite a lot of people. It doesn't get better than this. All you have to do is to clone the product. You can literally market it as a Pivotal Tracker clone. It's not like VMWare will care. You can research companies currently using Pivotal Tracker and build a database for cold calling / e-mailing when you have the product. It's also a product that is doable as a single person or very small team. With modern technologies (React or Svelte, hosted databases etc.) it's relatively simple to clone. Staying small is important: those businesses topple over when revenues don't justify expenses, especially if VC funding is involved and VCs are pressuring for going big or going bust. Or when a profitable product is acquired with the hopes of growing the profits but they don't grow. Stay small to keep expenses in check and you can build a profitable company. This is a bootstrappable business: a $100/mo Hetzner box, backend in efficient language (Go, C#), front-end in Svelte or React and you can serve lots of customers. The rest is your time and hustle. reply quesera 2 hours agoparentAh, I do love the smell of fresh optimism in the morning! I think the biggest challenges are that a) the vast majority of solo devs capable of pulling this off quickly are well-employed, and b) the timeline for MVP++ is effectively January 1st, else the migrators will make different decisions. And that as soon as migrations happen, your storage costs will balloon, so you need a billing strategy on launch. reply catwell 2 hours agorootparentThe best way to pull this off is to bet the tool will end up shutting down and build the replacement before it does. A good example of this is Pinboard: Maciej knew the product inside out, and he knew what being acquired by Yahoo meant. So he started building Pinboard in 2009, caught the various exodus waves from Delicious in the later years (esp. 2011) and ended up acquiring it for $35k in 2017. reply diggan 2 hours agorootparentprev> And that as soon as migrations happen, your storage costs will balloon, so you need a billing strategy on launch. Unless people somehow figure out a way of hosting stuff somewhere else than Amazon/$host_that_charges_per_mb_transit (Hint: they exist) Considering it would have to be a lean operation (assuming bootstrapped), then figuring out basic stuff like \"We don't want to pay per MB sent\" should be a pretty high requirement. reply thelittleone 2 hours agorootparentDont OVH and Hetzner offer this?

Lets say that's 100TB in total (on disk), which you could host with 10x storage boxes from Hetzner, 24 EUR each per month, so 240 EUR in total, which includes 10 unmetered connections (1 per box). reply simoncion 2 hours agorootparent> I don't think you'd have to consider migration all the data from Pivotal... I do. You might not have demands to migrate all data from all of your potential customers, but far, far more people than you might expect treat their issue tracking system as a system of record and external memory for a HUGE assortment of things. One hugely (and obviously) useful query chain that such a system answers is \"Hey, this customer problem sounds familiar. Did we investigate it before? Did we solve it? If so, how? If not, why not?\". For long-running projects, it is impossible to select the correct 10% of data to retain to also retain the ability to reliably -er- service those query chains. reply diggan 22 minutes agorootparentObviously I meant 10% of all customers would hypothetically migrate from Pivotal to this new imaginary service, not that 10% of the data from each customer would be migrated... So 100% of the data migrated from 10% of the Pivotal user base, pretty generous assumptions I think. reply ghaff 2 hours agorootparentprevDevelopers mostly won't pay out of their own pocket. reply dangus 2 hours agorootparentprevThe real reason this won’t work is that Pivotal obviously isn’t making good money if VMWare is cool with shutting it down. If it was some kind of excellent business to be in it wouldn’t be shutting down. An analogy would be to say that it would be a great business model to clone Redbox now that it’s gone. But it’s not because its competitors ate it alive. Sure, there are a bunch of Redbox customers that liked the product, but that number was declining. reply dangrossman 1 hour agorootparent\"Good money\" to a company with $13B revenue a year is a lot different than \"good money\" to a solo developer. If you can pick up six figures a year in revenue and keep things small enough to run solo, it's a good business for you. reply hinkley 1 hour agorootparentprevI’ve worked at a couple places that made the mistake of thinking they could charge a premium for artisanal hand crafted web pages. You get all the customers with deep seated control issues, willing to pay a premium to have everything exactly how they like it, and one by one sticker shock works as therapy and the price they will pay per artisanal, hand crafted webpage slowly declines until it costs you more to run the system than the customers will pay. And in the most recent case of this I’m aware of, at least two different groups got to sell the company to new suckers before the bill came due. reply egorfine 3 hours agoparentprevThe biggest risk: people are going to flock to Linear, which is the next best thing. reply regularfry 2 hours agorootparentYou don't need to capture all of them, just enough to get to profitability.

I am planning to build it for my company reply ericpauley 3 hours agorootparentprevMost people probably have a PT account lying around or can find a friend with one. I just checked and my account from 6+ years ago is still active. reply j45 2 hours agoparentprevThis genuinely is an opportunity as you're saying lol As someone who's built and launched something this big in a few months once upon a time, it feels like way too many technologies, it increases cycle time in ideation land. This would need to just be a postgres server, extended maybe by things like hasura and supabase, and a single codebase front end for all platforms. If postgres can't do it, don't do it. Front end... might be flutter. Could be svelte. Still, being a polyglot agnostic, for the dollar, in speed of development and more importantly iteration, per feature or update, in not needing to create an entire build, environment, nothing really seems to be as complete or as fast as Laravel, as much as it can shock to hear (I am not a heavy user, but considering it). Different strokes though, its just about speed of iteration. reply henning 2 hours agoparentprevDon't people just use Trello instead? reply anamexis 1 hour agorootparentPivotal is very different from Trello reply aantix 4 hours agoprevThe thing that I always liked about Pivotal is that it was visibly obvious that there was only one queue. It forced everyone to ruthlessly prioritize and make the hard decisions. In this moment, do you want me working on this bug, or this new feature? You have to decide - you get one or the other. It avoided the \"Everything is a high priority\" dilemma. reply teeray 2 hours agoparentI also loved that it was adamant about having specific, defined states with no customization. The issue is todo, in progress, done, delivered, accepted… that’s it. Custom issue states are a special kind of hell in JIRA. reply shagie 1 hour agorootparent> Custom issue states are a special kind of hell in JIRA.

I’ve come to think of it like giving a toddler TikTok – there’s a certain type of person who cannot resist thinking that one more workflow state / custom field will be the secret trick for productivity. reply hinkley 1 hour agorootparentprevThat fucking state machine page makes me want to shoot someone. reply cpeterso 2 hours agoparentprevAn alternative to one big queue is a separate queue for each client (external customers, internal teams, the dev team's own tech debt, etc) as described in \"JIT selection from independent streams: An alternative to the “big backlog” of work\": https://longform.asmartbear.com/jit-backlogs/ Each client manages their queue order, so the dev team just needs to focus on the head of each queue. (Of course, the dev team should also work with clients to clarify the requirements for the next few tasks in their queues so the head task will be shovel-ready). The dev team can then choose which queue heads to prioritize and maintain a balance, such as always have one tech debt task and X bug fix tasks in progress in addition to client work. reply jadbox 3 hours agoparentprevI LOVED Pivotal tracker for just this reason- it was way more focused. It was hands-down my favorite task tracker. Since most of my projects were code related, we eventually moved to Github Projects which is honestly very similar in being focused. The downside is that non-technical people may need to get a Github account, but it wasn't that much of an obstacle in practice. reply aquilaFiera 4 hours agoparentprev+1. It's been 15 years since I used Tracker but I miss that aspect of it. reply dangus 2 hours agoparentprevThat sounds more like a disastrous missing feature to me. A good productivity tool doesn’t dictate how teams work. I’d rather have a tool that’s more customizable. reply necovek 1 hour agorootparentI know managers love Jira — a poster child for customizability — esp product managers, but I have yet to meet a software engineer who does. It simply slows everyone down, but when it's your only tool for tracking work, it's still better than nothing. Now, the problem with Jira is not necessarily customizability but that it's dog slow, complex, integrations suck, and permissions system is chaotic. Still, I have yet to see fully customizable work tracking system that's better made than Jira. But also, a fixed set of features does not force you to ascribe the same meaning to them like the authors intended: I've used \"bug\" tracking systems to manage large projects with great success (including big features, enhancements, but also big and small fixes). reply kstrauser 1 hour agorootparentprev> I’d rather have a tool that’s more customizable. You think you would, until you do, and by then it's too late. It's important to have good processes, but the point of all those processes is to help you make things more efficiently. Anything that leads to you spending extra time serving the process directly reduces the amount of real work you can do. reply aantix 2 hours agorootparentprevI hear Jira is the ultimate in flexibility and widely beloved. ;) reply hinkley 1 hour agorootparentThat’s a paddlin’. reply hinkley 1 hour agorootparentprevI hear that the dirty secret of Salesforce is that it’s easier to change your company processes to match Salesforce defaults than to change Salesforce to match your company process. reply ethbr1 5 hours agoprevUnfortunate. Of all the PM tools I've used, I hated Pivotal the least. It made it easy to do the things that were frequently done. It limited customization down to a sane level. And it generally seemed to stay out of the way (significant look at Jira). reply pbowyer 4 hours agoparentLinear is the one I've settled on, it stays out of my way. For now. Looking at the competition it's only a matter of time before it becomes bloated to justify valuations. https://linear.app/ reply kstrauser 3 hours agorootparentA past job used Pivotal for several years until a new employee asked if we'd ever heard of Linear. I think we started the migration maybe a month later. reply sofixa 1 hour agorootparentprev> bloated This is like Excel - nobody needs more than 20% of all its features... but a different 20% for everyone. Project Management/Tracking needs can vary a lot between orgs or even people. reply necovek 1 hour agorootparentThat's not really true: witness Jira boards which are really kanban boards replicated everywhere. Jira, by now, is mostly a database of issues with a terrible management interface that's only accessed through the \"boards\" features.

But carve it in immutable, legal stone that there will always be a classic (reddit style: old) version of the product that's feature-complete but maintained. ... my suspicion is there's actually legalese somewhere that mandates the continuity of old.reddit.com. Otherwise, I'm at a loss to explain its continued existence in light of aggressive app pushing. reply ilrwbwrkhv 1 hour agorootparentThat's true. They are maybe the only major player who went with that approach. I wonder if their users are that vocal? reply ineptech 4 hours agoparentprevAgreed, and I suspect part of what made it great is that it was being ignored.

They're all getting a little bloated, wish one would dial it back vs keep adding (which feels like the inevitable future for Linear). reply uzyn 4 hours agoparentprevI agree. I have been on Pivotal Tracker for over a decade. Still am. Tried Jira and a few others, usually feeling like they are too taxing on the management part. What are alternatives that are light on the customization and day-to-day management? reply semperos 4 hours agorootparentI help build Shortcut (https://www.shortcut.com/) and I think it fits the bill of light—but not spartan—on customization and day-to-day management. To set up a new Shortcut workspace: 1. Sign up 2. Invite teammates, group them into teams if desired 3. Activate the GitHub/Gitlab/Bitbucket integration, so as engineers work via VCS their work in Shortcut progresses automatically 4. Set your workspace's timezone 5. Turn on/off Iterations (sprints) based on your process. Unfinished stories can be set to automatically roll from one iteration to the next. 6. Turn on/off point estimation based on your process Then start writing Stories (tickets/issues) to track work. Going further: Stories can be grouped into Epics. Epics can be grouped into Objectives (with associated Key Results if that's your thing). You can put Epics on a Roadmap to \"share out\" what your team is planning to work on. All optional, based on how you work and the size of your org. reply Goofy_Coyote 4 hours agorootparentprevI’ve been using Github Projects.

Working at Pivotal (the very early days of Cloud Foundry), taught me so much about how to develop software and products. It taught me how to work closely with people (pair programming for the win!).

Shortcut as a product is team-oriented with solid GitHub/Gitlab/Bitbucket and Slack integrations. reply aantix 4 hours agoparentStill feels like too many columns, too many states. Pivotal Tracker - ice box, backlog, or current iteration. I see companies in Trello Hell - well meaning, but often conflated, grey area states. There's like 10-15 columns on their boards. It's a hot mess. reply hinkley 1 hour agorootparentI worked on a tool more crowded than this and of late I’m coming around to the idea that these tools are all built for management which is why they get deployed. These drag and drop views aren’t that helpful for engineers. And they just make it easy for someone else to accidentally fuck up the status on your tasks. The task list in Jira is good enough for finishing or marking one task as blocked and starting another. If anyone is using the interface like Tom Cruise in Minority Report, dragging things around at pace, it’s because people aren’t keeping their tasks updated and a tool can’t and probably shouldn’t try to fix that. You fix that by orienting the UI so devs benefit from using it, not by guilt tripping or lecturing. reply schnable 3 hours agoprevTheir site still has a COVID-era banner about \"unusual times.\" Talk about a neglected product. reply leptons 2 hours agoparentCOVID is still a thing, and we are indeed in strange times. reply justusthane 59 minutes agorootparentWhen does \"strange\" become \"normal\"? reply leptons 15 minutes agorootparentMaybe after the upcoming election?

They were surely using it before any of the big players utilized it. reply bityard 2 hours agoparentMy first tech job was for a small IT consulting company that specialized in open source solutions in the early 2000's. The owner was basically the sales and overall strategy guy, I did consulting and implementations with clients, and most everyone else specialized in either their own low-level tech or business stuff. At our height, the owner started bringing in more projects than our current workflow could handle. Customers started getting angry because their projects would slip through the cracks and get delayed if they weren't calling us up weekly to nag us for status. I sort of became the project manager by default because I touched most of the projects in some way and I was the go-to guy when someone had a question about the status of a project. I wasn't really happy about this because I liked doing tech stuff more than I liked managing projects. In an attempt to preserve my sanity and get back to logging billable hours, I grabbed a deck of blank index cards and wrote down the company name, project name, status and for each project we had. (I didn't like spreadsheets at the time and this was faster than writing code.) That way, I didn't have to actively remember the status of every project. When needed or when asked, I could just grab the card and look. Once a week or so, I would update the status of each project on the card. Not long after, I got to noticing that there was really only four (or five, I don't recall) states that any project could be in and decided to stop writing them on the cards. Instead I placed the cards in dedicated piles that represented the project's status and moved them around as needed. That worked well. Eventually, I thought it would good if everyone on the team could see the projects and their status as well, so I grabbed an old whiteboard, hung it on the wall behind me, drew a column for each status, and taped all the cards into the column corresponding to their status. This was a BIG improvement. I stopped wasting an hour every morning just going over project status with the boss and other employees. Everyone could just walk over to the area near my desk and look at the wall behind me. (It was an open-plan office before those were \"cool.\") Others could move the cards between columns themselves. When a client called demanding an update, I could just glance behind me. A few jobs later, I took a compulsory three-day seminar on Agile and saw that they called this thing a Kanban board. reply hyggetrold 2 hours agoparentprevNo, Pivotal Tracker did not invent this paradigm. For background, I started working around 2005. Before tools like Tracker or JIRA, people who were doing agile development did everything with physical index cards. There was a lot of controversy even about digitizing those workflows back in the day - \"we lose human connection and conversation by putting it in the machine!\" Nobody has those conversations anymore as far as I'm aware. Like others have mentioned on this thread, the true innovation of Tracker was to have a single view where stories are ordered vertically in a single column and grouped by status. This really changes the conversation around what is top priority. Everything can be urgent and have a high level of priority, but if you put something at the top, something else must shift down in compensation. No more doing that thing where there are five number one priorities at the same time. The Agile view in Jira actually owes some inspiration to Tracker, if you can believe it. I know because I was there. I was a client on a Pivotal Labs project way back in the day, back when Tracker was still not publicly available, but only available to clients of Pivotal Labs. Our PM loved Tracker and wanted to use it but knew we could not get approval for it back home, all other teams were on JIRA. So our PM found a JIRA plugin called Greenhopper, tracked down the developer, and fed this person feedback to try and turn Greenhopper into the most Tracker-like thing possible. Greenhopper eventually got absorbed into Atlassian and turned into what is today known as Jira Agile. Tracker felt like such an amazing breath of fresh air and forward looking technology at the time when it came out. Tracker used Ruby on Rails and did sexy AJAX stuff on the frontend (big wow factor back then, this was the age of IE6). I loved Tracker for many years. I could sing its praises all day long. That said, the people who worked on the product had some philosophical things that got in the way of the product evolving. Reasonably, they did not want to turn into a huge enterprise tracking tool. Problem was, there were never any more features built into Tracker that really gave a good view for people who were higher level than the daily boots on the ground folks. So no good visualizations or features for projects where multiple teams must execute in tandem, and there are complex interdependencies between the teams. So while Tracker was awesome for the folks on the dev team, it wasn't very helpful for people in middle or upper management who needed birds-eye visibility easily and at a glance. So although I am sad to see this announcement in a way I'm quite hopeful. There are so many people who love this tool and will miss it, now there's no excuse for them not to go build something better! reply bleonard 1 hour agoprevJust came to say, I still think this is the best balance between the many factors of running a dev team.

At one of my companies they were using Trello for all engineering development which I found just too casual of an approach. Jira would have been overkill.

As a subset of users, they seem to want the flexibility of Excel, except it also has the specific workflow they want out of the box (which is different for every PM). Every product that's chased that rabbit down the hole has ended up with something customizable enough that (a) users need training to actually use it & (b) nobody is ever trained on it. I'm sure Jira is great... if I and everyone else at the company went to a two-week training course on configuring and using it. But none of those people, nor I, am ever going to do that. Tl;dr - project management/tracker tools should have a complexity feature cap, defined by what a reasonable person can intuit in the course of normal use over a month. reply throwaway918299 3 hours agorootparentI would rather just use an actual spreadsheet for issue tracking than Jira. We lost our CTO recently, and he was also the \"jira admin\" (ie. the only person who knows how the hell to do anything with jira) and it's just been a clusterf*ck ever since. reply ethbr1 1 hour agorootparentExcel-as-a-benchmark is a powerful thought argument. If something can't be significantly better than Excel, then product specs probably need refining. It's not that Excel is amazing or perfect in any one thing, but it is a pretty amazing blend of simplicity, flexibility, out of the box features, programmability, and presentation. reply cheschire 4 hours agoprevThis has been coming for a while.

I hated Pivotal in the early days, but after a couple years on the job I learned to really love it especially as the newer flimsier sprint planning tools were popping up in the early web 2 days. Only Trello really \"beat it\" fairly - Jira was always top-down forced, and Asana only won with designers because it was pretty while Pivotal was more tactical (not to mention they clung to skeuomorphic UI a little too long). The rest is history. I guess we can say Pivotal was quite pivotal in the AGILE/sprint/PM software race. RIP reply skybrian 3 hours agoparentWe were doing “velocity” at a startup using a rack of index cards. Software is not strictly necessary when everyone is in the same room. reply latchkey 3 hours agorootparentPT's concept of velocity isn't just tracking a number. It is tracking what work will get done within a period of time based on the average amount of work done previously. It allowed PM's to actually estimate when a feature would be completed and how adding or removing stories (or people!) would impact future feature deadlines. Initial velocity was meaningless and only developed over time as an average value of a team of people working together, taking into account things like vacations and sick days. None of this could be done realtime with a rack of index cards as it was something that happened over many weeks. reply skybrian 1 hour agorootparentYes, that’s basically how we did it. Though not formally accounting for vacation days; there were four of us and we didn’t have people coming and going much. We only did it once a week during the retrospective. It’s not hard to add up story points for the week and remember what you did in previous weeks. You could enter it into a spreadsheet if you want to get fancy. The concept comes from Extreme Programming. Software implementations came later. I think Pivotal Tracker does something useful, but you need a larger team for it to matter.

Having experienced both sides, that bit of paper is without a doubt the most valuable thing I own. It's hard to quantify the kinds of doors it has opened for me. I was able to get a scholarship to study in the UK that covered home/EU rates (a third of international rates, while I might not have been able to get even a student loan otherwise), get government funding for a PhD that would not have been accessible to me otherwise and other grants, travel to international conferences without thinking twice about visas (unlike many colleagues) meeting people that would impact my career and skipping all sorts of and barriers along the way, and never had to worry about deportation because of the EU settlement scheme, easily become a founder (no visa sponsorship needed), and so much more! Even travelling/business in the the middle East, being German rather than Egyptian is an entirely different life, one that my cousins cannot even begin to imagine.

Quite bluntly, this is a discussion over privileges. Not injustice, but privileges. I assure you that countless people from Germany, UK, the EU, or anywhere in the world, would desperately want to have access to the same opportunities.

A few years ago Russia even had a nuclear bomber circling the coast of western Europe. This behavior is not limited to government. It's not unheard of having Russian tourists insulting and threatening locals. In Europe or in any corner of the world. There are also Russian citizens attacking refugees and asylum seekers in foreign soil, even Russia's own war dodgers.

Then more people could see with their own eyes that they're being lied to. This and even more has been already tried, albeit somewhat inadvertently. Look at the neighboring Belarus. After Chernobyl, a fair share of kids and teens went on to spend their vacations in EU countries: Italy, UK, Austria, Belgium were the most welcoming, AFAIR. At least 1/3 of Belarusian kids have been through one of the many Chernobyl kids programmes, many of them multiple times. I was among those kids, as well as Svetlana Tsikhanouskaya who continued accompanying kids as a student, then as a teacher until her 30ies. This definitely changed many individual lives for the better, but has it changed the country for better? I bet no. reply aguaviva 15 hours agorootparentprevThanks -- those are some useful data points. What about the freezing (and probable eventual seizure) of $300b of CBRF assets (apparently 60 percent its total foreign currency reserves)? That's got to be causing some significant pain, somewhere. reply grishka 14 hours agorootparentNot sure if it's caused by this or the sanctions related to USD and EUR currencies themselves, but CBRF has introduced limitations on foreign currency transactions in March 2022. They were supposed to last 6 months but every time they're about to expire they get extended for 6 more months. You can't withdraw more than $10k of USD or EUR cash combined from all foreign currency accounts in each bank, and you can only withdraw the money that was there before March 2022. Past that limit and for any money you received after March, you can only withdraw it as rubles at the CBRF exchange rate, iirc. Most banks also treat dollars and euros like they're radioactive and will hit you with monthly fees if you have too much. So in the end we have three different exchange rates for these currencies: the CBRF one, the one for online operations with those \"virtual\" dollars and euros in currency accounts, and the \"real\" one for cash. reply ZoomZoomZoom 7 hours agorootparentprevI'm not an expert and don't have the necessary and verifiable information to asses the consequences in regards to economy/industry, but the sociocultural effects are negative. 1. Sanctions sped up the formation of the class of war beneficiaries. Sanctions created the demand for sanction circumvention. Since their scope is huge, the demand is accordingly very high (from civil consumers to the government). This led to formation of new supply chains that keep being profitable only while the war and sanctions continue. Now thousands of people engaged in these activities have the monetary incentive to support the war and the government course. This one I deem to be the most consequential in the long term. 2. Any noticeable conflict or rights violation happening with Russian citizens abroad is to be blown out of proportion and presented as a confirmation of pervasive anti-Russian sentiment and support the government narrative of existing encircled by enemies. 3. The lack of accessible ways of integration of the emigrants into local societies (especially in Europe) led to thousands of them coming back, some unwillingly, some grudgingly and feeling disillusioned. This is a huge wasted opportunity and I don't get why it happened (I don't buy the \"we must secure our countries against possible threat actors and dirty money\" explanation). reply throwaway48476 16 hours agorootparentprevSanctions have an effect, the government complains about them a lot. reply chipdart 14 hours agorootparentRandom people in Russia complaining about the inconvenience of not being able to travel to Europe because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and all around imperialism is also an expected effect.

They would've been if there were feedback mechanisms that we could use to communicate our point of view the government, but there aren't any, so in the end it's just a punishment for having been born in a wrong place at a wrong time. reply aguaviva 12 hours agorootparentSo in the end it's just a punishment for having been born in a wrong place at a wrong time. That's what war is, unfortunately. Millions of people in Ukraine are currently being \"punished\" for exactly the same offense, only in ways infinitely worse, as I don't need to tell you. There was absolutely no reason the war had to coming into being at all. But now that we're stuck with it, the only effective questions are -- what can be done to hasten its end; provide some level of justice for those affected the worst; and to make it clear to the responsible parties that something like this can never be allowed to happen on European soil ever again? For their own part -- it's not like the Western governments really have any other choice. Even though the sanctions are having a far more limited effect than they initially hoped -- they simply couldn't keep doing business with Russia as usual after what happened in 2022. That's all there is to it. Meaning, they've no choice but to apply the strongest possible sanctions as they might reasonably be able to (for some definition of \"reasonable\"). It's a cold and calculated strategy - but again, they didn't chose this situation, and that's the moral calculus that they are now forced to adopt in response to the situation that Putin created for them. reply justsomehnguy 9 hours agorootparent> it's not like the Western governments really have any other choice ... after what happened in 2022.

The feedback mechanism you're complaining about is a problem on the side of those being inconvenienced. If they want to complain, they need to direct their complains to their own regime, and address the problems they are causing everyone around them. It's also very telling that the reaction is to complain about mild inconveniences while turning a blind eye to the whole war of aggression, terrorism, and pervasive threats of global Armageddon from their very own government. That, strangely enough, is not an inconvenience nor an issue requiring attention. Tourism seems to be a right to them, but others don't even have a right to exist?

From Europe's side, one of the most basic things that can be done is stop taking in tourists from a nation hell-bent on starting wars of invasion with neighboring countries and threaten the whole world with nuclear Armageddon. Cutting economic ties is also a good strong start. If those hypothetical tourists don't feel strongly about their own nation conducting genocide or bombing hospitals or blowing up damns then perhaps in the very least they should understand that it's something that can negatively affect them too and perhaps, even for the worst possible reasons such as inconveniencing their travel plans, that should not be something they support. And yet here we are, arguing that changes in travel plans are unfair while ignoring a full blown existencial war. reply grishka 2 hours agorootparent> If those hypothetical tourists don't feel strongly about their own nation We do feel strongly about it but we can't act on these feelings.

Here's some choice quotes: \"Complying with the GDPR is a huge undertaking\" \"GDPR compliance (occupies) a huge amount of IT time and resources\" \"Moving your organization into GDPR compliance is a process you ideally started long ago\" The article links to some ICO GDPR data processing checklist, which is a list of 18 different processes you need to have put in place. \"The GDPR is made up of 99 articles that provide a detailed description of the regulation\".\"This is onerous because Data Subjects can make requests in writing or verbally, and you need to be able to comply with the requests “without undue delay\" I'm sure each case might be different, but I can't but help to think this is just a cheap excuse to inflate the work that is required ro comply with data Protection Regulation. I've worked already on a few projects involving data protection, and they all boil down to two steps: - only store anonymous data. No personal data? No problem. - if you need to store personally identifiable information, support deleting it on request. It might be easier to incorporate these requirements at the design stage, but by now this is a very basic set if requirements. reply johnklos 15 hours agorootparentprevYou listed just one slightly onerous requirement: allowing people access and agency over their data. If you don't store their data, you don't have to do that. It's a bit hyperbolic to say that you're, \"not even half way through the article and I'm skipping over tons of what it's saying needs to be done\", when you've literally only listed one thing. reply dmurray 18 hours agorootparentprev> ^-- All that seems to go against your assertion that you just have to \"not track them\", if you have to build out a system for everyone to access all data you hold about them, rectify it, delete it, verbally or in writing, without delay. If you don't track people's data, that \"system\" becomes an automated email reply with \"we don't have any data about you\". But if you deal with individuals, probably you do want to collect at least some data that would be subject to the GDPR protections, and it is definitely easier to forget all about it. reply LegionMammal978 17 hours agorootparentGiven that most things are personal data under the GDPR (e.g., IP addresses have been considered personal data, and things like usernames are clearly personal data), I don't think most companies can get off quite that trivially, short of being completely stateless and never logging anything. reply anonzzzies 16 hours agorootparentYou can log with log if you have good reason; you just have to delete them after a reasonable time. Nothing about this is hard or costly if you think about from the start. Your 'forever data' basically should never contain PII as some users might have terminated their accounts etc so then their info cannot be in some cold store tape archive. Again, not complex; delete backups after a reasonable time and throw away the encryption key. The intent of the gdpr is that you think about all of this and not simply store everything to mine, have stolen, leak or sell later on. The problem is that many companies or the software they use is literally build to abuse that data so then it is indeed 'hard' and expensive to comply. reply LegionMammal978 16 hours agorootparentSure, but regardless of your data-retention period, you still have to know where to find everything derived from anything user-generated, if you want to accurately respond to requests. You're free to argue that the GDPR is making companies do things that they already ought to have been doing, but my point is that \"just don't be one of those evil user-tracking companies\" is not a viable compliance policy in itself. reply Dylan16807 15 hours agorootparentIf your data retention period is less than your response time (which has to be less than a month), can you not say \"everything we had at the time of request is deleted\" and be done with it? A reminder that we're talking about passing visitors without accounts here, and for logging and analytics there shouldn't be a need to store anything longer than a couple days. reply anonzzzies 16 hours agorootparentprevYes, that's true, it is part of the intent though, that's why people say this I guess. reply viraptor 17 hours agorootparentprevAll of that is about complying with gdpr, assuming you're sharing customer data. If you don't, there's nothing to do. It's like \"international shipping of live animals is a massive undertaking and takes lots of time\" - cool, it's true - I'm not doing that so I'm done. Sure, you have to comply with data requests, but if you don't store/share it... that's also trivial. reply snowwrestler 16 hours agorootparentGDPR does not regulate “sharing,” it regulates any use of personal data. IP address is considered personal data, so you can’t avoid GDPR compliance if you are running a website at all (since you must process IP addresses in order to serve a website). reply viraptor 15 hours agorootparentI'm using simplified language here, not writing a legal document. The first use was also supposed to be \"storing/sharing\", but it's processing in practice. But here you go: > GDPR does not regulate “sharing,” 13.1.e requires at least the notification of the recipients of the data. With the requirement about the purpose of use, it effectively regulates sharing. > since you must process IP addresses in order to serve a website That's right and that places the IP in the 4.1.f \"processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller\" area which doesn't require consent. reply snowwrestler 7 hours agorootparentIt doesn’t require a consent dialogue but it requires user notifications and data processing agreements with anyone who is helping you serve your site and an agent available to EU jurisdictions to answer inquiries. Granted a lot of people don’t bother or slide by with some vague crappy language they downloaded from somewhere. The irony here is that the people who think they’re standing up for GDPR are actually the ones not taking it seriously, while the people who take it seriously are the ones who know what a pain it is to comply with. reply viraptor 7 hours agorootparentHave you got some support for this from people experienced with legal matters? Because not only I've never heard of the internet provider notification being required and can't find any act which would apply, I can't even find any European page which does that, including https://op.europa.eu/en/web/about-us/privacy-statement which is responsible for publishing gdpr itself. That publisher's page lists the third party processors for the documents, (as expected) but not the hosting provider. I'd love to see a counterexample. reply snowwrestler 7 hours agorootparentMy experience was the months I spent with a very competent (and no doubt expensive) French law firm to help my employer implement GDPR compliance. None of that is public info that I can link to, however. I’ll edit to add that the user must be notified that you are collecting and processing personal data, which includes IP address. And the hard part is that you must also have internal paper trails that prove that you have written that notification in full knowledge of all the data processing done on your behalf by all your service providers. Is a data center owner routing traffic to your server? You need paperwork in which they commit not to store the IP addresses of your visitors, for example. That is not public-facing but must be available to regulators upon their request. That’s the hard part of compliance and what most people skip. They click OK on the standard agreements with service providers and put up a standard privacy template. That is not actually compliant but folks are essentially betting that they are small enough that data regulators won’t ever come call them on it. reply johnklos 15 hours agorootparentprev\"since you must process IP addresses in order to serve a website\" That's complete nonsense. reply jasonlotito 17 hours agorootparentprev> assuming you're sharing customer data.

Nope, this is also not true. At least, it's not just \"data requests.\" You are in violation of the GDPR. reply anonzzzies 16 hours agorootparentIf you don't have the data, it is trivial; you send an automated mail you don't store anything (of course if you really don't). reply anonzzzies 16 hours agorootparentprevBut why do these companies care? The EU cannot impose this on US companies in the US, so why block? Just do nothing? reply razakel 3 hours agorootparentIt absolutely can if those companies want to do business with EU citizens. reply literallycancer 18 hours agorootparentprevSadly the EU doesn't really communicate this very well, and doesn't care to call out outright propaganda from ad tech and surveillance businesses, but the regulation is not actually hard to be compliant with. It literally just asks that you don't spy on people. That's it. Not spying on users? Great, you don't even have to do anything. I would be extremely surprised to see any attempt at enforcement against a website that didn't collect PII on some technicality such as not having the right footer or a contact person. reply thayne 17 hours agorootparentIt's more than just not spying on people. You have to be able to prove you don't spy on people. And any vendors or contractors you use also don't spy on people, and respond to requests from anyone about all the data you have on them. And delete all of the data you have for anyone who cancels their account. Sure in some cases, that isn't a huge burden, like if you have a website that doesn't handle any customer data. But if you have a non-trivial app where you need to handle a lot of customer data for your app to work, it is a significant burden. And deleting someone's data as soon as they cancel can be really bad if someone accidentally cancels, so you probably want some kind of delayed deletion. reply anonzzzies 16 hours agorootparentYou don't have to delete as soon as they cancel; you can store it in an encrypted backup which you remove after 90 days (and throw away the key). There are a lot of 'for a reasonable period' things; meaning, you cannot store PII (including IPs) forever and you cannot store it at all in case you do not need it in the first place for your app to function (example; SaaS asking for my home address which they don't ship anything). reply thayne 13 hours agorootparent> you can store it in an encrypted backup which you remove after 90 days (and throw away the key) Sure. But that is much easier said than done. Especially if your previous strategy was to just keep everything, because storage is cheap, development cost is expensive, and then the data will still be there if the customer decides to return in a few years. And in many (most?) cases it's not like you just have a single file with all the user's data, that data is spread around in many different database tables , and possibly even multiple databases. The development work to figure out how to clean everything up, without accidentally deleting anything wrong or leaving anything out can be a considerable amount of effort. It's also not always black and white who data belongs to. If I upload an image onto a document that was shared with me, should that image be deleted if I cancel my account? What about something I posted publicly on a social media platform? Or posted privately in a group chat or DM? Does it make a difference if the content of an image or text I wrote included PII? Hopefully you have a lawyer that understands the nuances involved. reply skjoldr 11 hours agorootparentI see this and I feel I must ask: why would you EVER engineer ANY application under the idiotic assumption that none of your users will ever want to remove the data that they had stored in it?! Absolutely baffling. Of course, if a business is that short-sighted and careless, it will struggle to implement GDPR. reply anonzzzies 6 hours agorootparentIt might be more nefarious when companies do that, but on the other hand, Hanlon's razor. reply dns_snek 18 hours agorootparentprevIt's slightly more involved than this, but not extraordinarily so. For example seemingly innocuous implementations like loading fonts directly off Google Fonts without consent (i.e. providing Google with information about visitors' browsing habits) would technically be on the wrong side of the GDPR, but I think it's very unlikely that anyone would complain about it, legally speaking. reply skjoldr 11 hours agorootparentThere already exist ways to proxy those requests in ways that avoid exposing anything about the visitors to Google.

The American in me says that sounds like \"someone will definitely complain about it, eventually, if only because they're hoping for a payout\". reply seszett 16 hours agorootparentMaybe that's the problem, I thought the (mostly local media) companies that were blocking EU citizens were doing it out of spite or to make a point, because it doesn't make sense (for one, they're not subject to gdpr if they don't explicitly do business with EU citizens). But maybe it's just because the US environment is so hostile that they assume it's the same in the EU. But national regulators in the EU don't waste their time with foreign companies that might by oversight not be totally compliant since they're not even under their jurisdiction (worst is they could be fined and have to pay it if ever they incorporate in that country in the near future? Nobody's going to waste time in that). And nobody can sue a company on gdpr grounds and get a payout. They're only fines, they benefit to central states and are a negligible amount in regard to national budgets. reply skissane 18 hours agorootparentprevI’ve been noticing more and more US state and local government websites blocking traffic from outside the US. (And I’m not talking about traffic from North Korea, I’m talking about traffic from ANZUS/AUKUS/FVEY ally Australia.) It seems stupid because just because someone is overseas doesn’t mean they can’t have valid business with a US state or local government. Maybe they are an American who is travelling and has to attend to some official business back home while they are away. Foreigners are allowed to purchase US real estate and incorporate companies in the US, which gives them heaps of legitimate reasons for interacting with local and state governments.

As Russia has invaded Ukraine, the U.S. has positioned itself in opposition to Russia but not Ukraine. Banks, therefore, need to align with these geopolitical stances, leading to decisions that might catch some individuals in the crossfire, even if they’re not directly involved. > Financial institutions often interpret this as: if they're not deeply specialized in doing business in Ukraine, they should avoid it altogether. They fear they won’t be able to consistently ensure compliance with these complex directives from the government [especially because there's a chance those directives might change in a week, or a month, or 3 months]. > This creates a split-brain problem within U.S. decision-making. The government intends to say, \"Please cut down on oligarch money laundering that supports Russia’s war effort.\" However, financial institutions hear this as, \"Under no circumstances should you fund anything related to Ukraine,\" including, for example, scholarships for Ukrainian high schoolers—a slight exaggeration, but not far from the reality in some cases.

I actually doubt they are thinking about Australia at all. I also doubt their legal departments are worried about the Australian government, since the Australian government taking legal action against a foreign government (even a local or subnational one) would in most cases be illegal under all three of international, Australian and foreign law due to sovereign state immunity, and diplomatically they wouldn’t do it to the US because it would offend their American allies. If for some strange reason an Australian government agency had a bone to pick with some US state or county, they’d aim to solve it with the US State Department.

Yes things were quiet in Tuscaloosa. yes there was peace on the campus, but it was peace at a great price. It was peace that had been purchased at the exorbitant price of an inept trustee board succoming to the whims and carprices of a vicious mob. It was peace that had been purchased at the price of allowing mobocracy to reign supreme over democracy.

A PDF of a utility bill as \"proof of residency\", knowing somebody's SSN as \"identity verification\"... Yes, they might be definitionally best practice and accordingly enough from a legal perspective, but I don't see them having any value in actually keeping out bad actors. A fence that surrounds 99% of your pasture indeed has no value if the wolves know where the 1% gap is. reply seszett 16 hours agorootparent> A PDF of a utility bill as \"proof of residency\" That's not really a EU Vs US thing though, but a \"country with mandatory official declaration of residence\" vs not. France is the same as the US there, and I would assume the UK as well. Well I now realise the UK is not in the EU anymore... but France is probably not the only remaining country in the EU where you can move without some kind of administrative declaration? Anyway the point for these countries is to not have a centralised record of where citizens live, for anti-surveillance reasons and resilience against potentially hostile authorities. So you can't ask the state to prove that you live somewhere because it doesn't have a record or if it has it cannot legally communicate it to anyone. In contrast, Belgium for example has centralised records of residents and if your car is parked wrongly, the local police can look up the plate and call you on your registered phone number or knock to your door at your registered address, to tell you to move it. It's practical, but I find it creepy and dangerous. A hostile government would have so much power here. reply lxgr 16 hours agorootparent> the point for these countries is to not have a centralised record of where citizens live In the US, state DMVs effectively still know everybody's address, don't they? And even if they wouldn't – that information is only one data broker query away in the US. I've recently experienced this by signing up for a financial company that, after entering only my phone number and SSN, presented me with my full address and asked me whether everything looks accurate. I understand that historically and value-wise, this is part of where the resistance to centralized government databases is coming from. But practically, they already exist. In the US, resistance against government ID for private contracts seems to come more from an intention of not wanting the government to be able to interfere with the right of people to legally transact with each other without government mandate or intervention. But even that resistance is largely over – I had to show my driver's license to every bank I ever opened an account with. reply seszett 15 hours agorootparentThat's what happens when government is regulated but companies aren't. The kind of process you describe is totally illegal and unheard of in the EU. In France banks also take utilities bills as proof of residence (but they also ask for id or passport to check your identity). ID cards do have an address as well as passports and driving licences, but even the government doesn't accept them as proof of residence because they're often out of date. In my case they all have different addresses and none of them has my current address. My Belgian ID though has to be reissued every time I move to a different municipality. Oh and regarding DMV having addresses yes, but (in France) they are indexed by a DMV-specific key that cannot easily be matched to another database, say social security or taxes (which also independently have addresses on most citizens). Driving license number, fiscal number, SSN, cannot legally be used anywhere else than with their respective services. There is of course the names that can be used, but no system is perfect I guess. Anyway these are just implementation details, but my point is that the EU has many different administrative systems and in at least some of them, utilities are the only legal proof of residence. reply IncreasePosts 18 hours agoparentprevAh. So I can log IP addresses that connect to my service and store them forever? reply lxgr 17 hours agorootparentIP addresses are great for identifying traffic patterns, figuring out where your audience is roughly located etc. as long as you don't use them to selectively block users – since then nobody has a real incentive to \"cloak\" theirs. Once you start doing that, you've completely destroyed the measurement, and at the same time you're still not keeping out unintended users – because these will just use a VPN. To go with an analogy: Imagine a bank enforcing embargo/sanction policies by just asking everyone at the entrance for their name but not checking their ID! You'd get a lot of personal data (since most people won't lie), yet you won't keep any sanction evaders out. reply IncreasePosts 15 hours agorootparentI think we have the same perspective on this. I should have been more specific about my snark - what I was really calling out was the GDPR considering IP address as PII, which is widely lauded on this forum. reply nradov 19 hours agoparentprevIt's not a falsehood though. IP address is a reasonably reliable means of geolocation. Lawyers tend to be more comfortable with gray areas than engineers. Intent counts for a lot in assessing legal compliance. reply saurik 14 hours agorootparentBut it isn't a grey area: it simply doesn't work. It doesn't matter if it correctly identifies most people: it has to correctly identity most terrorists, and it simply doesn't do that, because if you are a terrorist you just keep rotating through IP addresses on cloud providers and VPNs until the entire service is burnt. It isn't that it sometimes doesn't work: it's that it doesn't work at all when it actually needs to work. We could argue that the services shouldn't let you do that in the first place, but the reality is that services currently do work like that, no one is trying to change that, and if they did try to change it we would all be even less happy with the resulting even-more-powerful surveillance state. reply nradov 6 hours agorootparentWrong. At this level there is no compliance requirement to specifically identify \"terrorists\". And the sanctions against Iran, while partly based on state sponsorship of terrorism, aren't limited to just designated terrorist entities. Most services aren't required to blanket block all traffic from Iran. Only certain specific transactions are prohibited. But a lot of companies choose to block everything identified as coming from Iran (and other sanctioned countries) just to play it safe. reply lxgr 17 hours agorootparentprevFrom a \"best practice\"/CYA perspective, sure. But I'm not a lawyer, and looking purely at the outcome of IP blocks (which is usually that regular people are inconvenienced, but the people such policies are actually designed to keep out just shrug and use a $5/month VPN), I can still say that it looks a bit silly. reply gsich 16 hours agorootparentprevNo need for anticipatory obedience though. If whois says it's not Iran - who cares. reply lxgr 16 hours agorootparentThis makes me wonder, though: Who started the IP checks? I think there's a high chance this by itself was anticipatory obedience, since it's fairly easy and cost-effective to do and it gives companies at least something to point at in case of a lawsuit. But my point is that all of this compliance theater does add up; every once in a while mistakes (as outlined in TFA) do happen. Even if they don't, almost free isn't the same thing as free – and some company will inevitably go even further, it'll set a precedent, and the cost to everybody will increase, with questionable benefit. reply greyskull 21 hours agoprevMight be pertinent to suffix this with (2023), though I see there are still recent replies reply jkaplowitz 21 hours agoparentIt's a still-unresolved issue as far as I know; the linked ticket was only closed last year because Gitlab has no control over it as long as they want to continue using Cloudflare.

Getting on the wrong side of the US government. And honestly, I don't see any business (except for ones in Russia, China and Iran) changing provider because they don't provide service to Iran. > damaging to our businesses (no worldwide service) I'm confused, are you arguing here for allowing free-tier services under the sanction regime, or for getting rid of sanctions against Iran altogether? If it's the latter, then the argument is self-consistent. But if it's the former, then you're effectively saying that an american business which currently doesn't provide any services to iranian customers would instead prefer to provide free-tier services for them without any way to get them to paid tier, and that doesn't make any sense.

I'm just not convinced in this case. Just looking at the picture it seems neither innocuous nor particularly transparent even thought it's on glass. Maybe they can make the connections less apparent without exposed coax, and maybe they won't need to add (extra) windows on top of windows, and maybe they can make the conductive areas more transparent, but this is only useful as a proof of concept. Let's see what they can do for a commercial product. Usually, there are tens of antennas on a single tower so they can't all look like this. Also, I'm going to assume that you have to keep anyone from getting within 3 meters just due to radiated emissions, so don't go just looking out that window! reply avianlyric 1 hour agoparentThis is a commercial product, that’s actually been installed and being used. The magic here is a “transparent” antenna. The magic is a carefully tuned, small and innocuous antenna, that when mounted on a window it’s been tuned for, allows 5G to easily propagate through the glass. Glass facades almost universally use Low-E glass to avoid turning the building into a huge greenhouse. Problem for 5G, is that low-e glass is remarkably good at blocking 5G frequencies[1]. Pair that with 5G smaller propagation distances, and issues of finding viable locations to mount 5G antenna becomes a real problem. This product neatly solves that problem by allowing carriers to mount these antenna on the inside of a buildings facade, while providing coverage outside the building. Which will substantially reduce the cost and difficulty of installing 5G masts. You can place all your sensitive equipment in normal building voids, without the need for bulky and ugly weather proofing, and you need to break the buildings weather tight seals (which a landlord isn’t gonna let you do without significant assurances you’re going the cover the costs of any water that comes through) to run cables to external antenna. To make all of this viable, someone has had to do a fair bit of work to figure out how to build an antenna that effectively incorporates the low-e window it’s attached to, into its RF design. The fact the physical antenna is made of glass and partial transparent isn’t actually the interesting part. That’s likely been done because glass is a very rigid material that will make it easy to ensure the conductive parts of the antenna are kept at a specific distance from the window it’s mounted on, to ensure the correct RF coupling occurs.

There are a lot of places in the building where slightly darkened glass panel would not look too out of place, as opposed to a bulky ugly opaque plastic box. Especially if architects really work on integrating it, it can be made very unobtrusive without needing 100% transparency. And, in a lot of buildings there are glass panels which aren't within the foot traffic areas - high windows, ceilings, technical areas, etc. reply jauntywundrkind 3 hours agoparentprevThe transparency is hard to judge from this one photo, where there's a flat background to it and a line or two. This seems not at all unreasonably subtle to me. Even with the array of feeder lines, yeah, maybe it's not for very high end stash places but for most places this seems ay okay. Given what the alternatives are for urban and commercial spaces, this feels like a big win. My main concern is power level. How much power can you emit if Joe in accounting is 8 feet away from it, and how does that compare versus normal building mounted or pole mounted antennas? Also, what frequencies is this antenna designed for; it seems like 5g can run on lots of spectrum; is this mmWave gear or lower?

The article says it's for the \"sub-6\" 5G bands, a.k.a. normal cellular frequencies, not mmWave. As always, these are non-ionizing frequencies, they pose absolutely zero risk to health or safety unless you're absorbing enough power to be meaningfully heated by it. > How much power can you emit if Joe in accounting is 8 feet away from it, and how does that compare versus normal building mounted or pole mounted antennas? Assuming an antenna gain of 10 dBi, which seems to be \"normal\" for panel-style antennas in the 5G low band, just short of 30 watts in to the antenna would be safe according to the guidelines the FCC gives us amateur radio operators for \"uncontrolled\" environments if the antenna were aimed directly at a person eight feet away. Obviously in the real world these antennas will be aimed outward so the energy being absorbed by anyone in the building will be significantly less than that. These should not be installed in places someone could directly touch it or the cables feeding it, but there's no reason to believe there's any danger to someone just existing normally in the same room. reply vel0city 2 hours agorootparentprev> My main concern is power level. How much power can you emit if Joe in accounting is 8 feet away from it That was my first takeaway from the photo from outside. The kinds of antennas they put on top of buildings routinely run many hundreds to a thousand watts or more of power directionally out into the city. That's fine when you're putting it on equipment outside the building on a controlled access roof pointing away from the occupants in the building. Everyone actually in the beam pattern is going to be far away from the active elements. This design doesn't seem to be incredibly directional especially outwards. You're not going to be able to run much power on that antenna, and now you're going to have it on the inside of metallized glass. A lot of that energy is going to stay in the building. I wouldn't want the desk next to this if it's going to run even 100W. Just asking to get some good RF burns. reply generic92034 2 hours agorootparentprev> My main concern is power level.

Many others have done this as well over many years, and have either pivoted (Meraki) or gone out of business and sold their assets to conventional ISPs (Common Networks). The biggest hurdle is that reliably running high performance transmitters is not easy for amateurs, and the payoff for any one transmitter is not that much. I'm going to use the example of a residential ISP but this applies to cell networks as well. The \"meshier\" the network is, the more people revenue needs to be split between, exacerbating the problem. Another issue is that reliability is extremely important for internet access. Given the fact that amateurs are not going to be able to maintain high uptime, for a decentralized mesh network to succeed at actually providing internet service, you need to have a lot of redundancy in any given area, further reducing income from any one node. The solution to this is to have a team of technicians that can go around and fix and optimize nodes as soon as there is any problem. This is basically what an ISP or cell carrier does. An added difference is that in a mesh network, the idea is generally that the property owner owns the node, while with a conventional ISP, the property owner leases to the ISP who owns the node. Property owners generally prefer the latter, since this is the model they are used to operating under as landlords. reply gruez 2 hours agoparentprevHow do you prevent selfish leechers that use network bandwidth, but don't contribute to it, like on public torrents?

Why would it be part of every modem/gateway? Since there's no monetary incentive to participate, in all likelihood all nodes would be run by volunteers who are shelling out extra for a compatible modem/router. Actually come to think of it, you can run a volunteer network providing internet connectivity with off the shelf equipment right now. It's called setting your wifi network to \"open\". Why don't people do that? How would your mesh network fix those issues? reply vel0city 2 hours agorootparentNot only just shelling out more for that compatible modem/router, that volunteer would also have to be willing to set up at least the antennas in a place optimal for others to actually use it instead of potentially optimal placement for their own services. A client on the street is not going to get good connectivity to someone's cell repeater tucked deep in their media cabinet next to their game console and under their TV in the center of their home. You'll need to get your volunteers to bother placing these antennas on their roofs, on the top of flagpoles, etc. to get good propagation. They better have properly grounded it as well and put fourth good lightning protection for this new wire high point at the top of their home. reply vel0city 2 hours agorootparentprev> If it's part of every modem/gateway router That's not really a \"mesh\" then.

Those regular WiFi networks only have tons of available bandwidth because they're not trying to repeat a bunch of wireless traffic. Even the current mesh WiFi networks only really work when you're using frequencies that aren't trying to compete with neighbors. Start getting actual density and it'll all fall apart. Also your idea of \"standard QoS can still apply\" isn't exactly true. That QoS is only going to work if people play along with it. In the end its a shared medium. Get some clients to not play along with your configurations, you'll start getting collisions regardless of what you configure your QoS settings. reply ianburrell 1 hour agorootparentprevIf it isn't doing mesh routing, then it isn't a mesh.

There is a volunteer-driven LoRaWAN Helium[0] mesh network which added 5G some 2 years back. But it's cryptocurrency-driven and apparently unprofitable for volunteers investing in radios and antennas. At least where I live. My neighbor still has the Helium antenna and radio on his balcony but it's offline due to costs/profits disproportion. It's the LoRaWAN, pre-5G hardware though, and I don't know anyone running the 5G version, if it's even a real thing. I liked the idea from technical perspective but the project itself was off-putting for me due to being built around a crypto token and having overall web3 smell. [0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium_Network reply vel0city 3 hours agoparentprevIs it possible? Sure, its possible. Would it actually be feasible and good? Probably not. Take a look at WiFi-dense apartment buildings. So much crowding, no centralized assignment or management of the bands. It is a wild west of people transmitting on whatever channels and whatever power levels they want (within the legal limits). It ends up with few people actually having a good experience when there's no centralized management. 5GHz/6GHz makes WiFi more usable because it naturally limits your ability to hear your neighbors. Going to 700MHz/900MHz/1.2GHz (the normal frequencies used in a lot of 5G deployments) is only going the opposite direction of where WiFi has been going to solve this problem. Expect more noisy neighbor problems as you lower the frequencies. Then we're not only going to saturate the bands with people doing whatever they want (within legal limits), we're going to depend on mesh routing through all that noise? There goes your reliability and efficiency of sending data. reply throwaway48540 3 hours agorootparentI'm talking about creating a single mesh network, not a Wifi-like situation with many networks on the same bands. reply vel0city 2 hours agorootparentThere is no difference in the end. It is still a single collision domain for everyone talking. And who's to say they want to join your mesh and not Bob's super awesome mesh? Or start their own mesh? Oh, you get to decide how to operate the mesh but I can't? I guess you'll end up getting some kind of license so you can standardize how this particular mesh should operate and prevent others from running competing services on the same frequencies as your one mesh. You'll put out standards on what kinds of devices are certified to work on it and ensure certain settings so tx/rx errors are reduced to ensure good usage. You'll start encouraging people to not put up more nodes in a certain area because it's just getting too crowded here, but hey we need to incentivize someone to set up a node on the other side of town. Snap now it seems like we're running a regular carrier. I participate and use city-sized WiFi mesh networks in the amateur radio world. They're not anywhere near a replacement for what normal people think of as internet connectivity. I can't imagine swapping WiFi for 5G cellular stacks would end up making a radical difference. The issues are largely with having to make multiple wireless hops, mesh routing inefficiencies/problems, and having everyone actually play nice all the time. reply ianburrell 1 hour agoparentprevThere are a few problems with this. Mesh is cool for other uses but can't replace the infrastructure of mobile operator. One, what frequency are you going to use? If you use 2.4GHz or 5GHz, your Wifi-using neighbors will hate you. There is the 6GHz spectrum but has problems with long ranges. The 3.5GHz CBRS is probably the best bet but that requires spectrum allocation and organization to run it. The mobile operators have all the good low frequency, long range spectrum. Two, the range with home routers is going to be pretty short, maybe 1mi. That means lots of node to cover a city. Also, 5G routers are not that cheap. It also means that there will be no reception away from the city. Most routers are meant to be used inside, and good coverage, requires mounting them outside on a pole. Three, I'm not sure there is 5G device-to-device. There was LTE-Direct but it never got implemented. There D2D in 5G spec but I can't find any implementations. reply foxyv 3 hours agoparentprevYes it is possible.

The idea is solid. Antennas in glass are protected, so they can be very thin and almost invisible, more aesthetically pleasing than a shark fin or a rod on the roof. I would consider this an aesthetic choice, not so much engineering. A small antenna sticking out on the roof solves the engineering problem adequately. reply HPsquared 2 hours agoparentThey still do, I believe. Cars usually have several antennas embedded in e.g. the rear glass. Even something like the FM radio often has 3+ antennas in different locations and the receiver switches between them to get the best signal. One shark fin isn't enough. reply caseyy 2 hours agorootparentNow shark fins are in vogue again because they house multiple antennas — FM/AM, DAB, GPS, and recently more importantly, 4G. Maybe even WiFi — weird as it sounds, I saw some strings for WiFi antennas in a popular stock media/head unit’s firmware. Though you are probably right and many cars with just FM/AM and DAB still put them in windshields. I’m not sure about that 3+ antenna claim for FM. Do a fact-check there. ;) I think most diversity antenna systems that you describe use 2. And they are still considered “premium”. 3 is a bit overkill for FM, FM is very resilient against obstacles. If I’m wrong, would be interesting to see an example of a car that uses 3 or more. Probably far outside of my pay grade to say the least. reply HPsquared 1 hour agorootparentI'm going by the BMW E90 (Top HiFi option) which has 3 physical FM antennas FM1, FM2 and FM3, all in the rear glass, and a fourth \"FM4\" which is not a physical antenna but a combination of FM1 and FM2. They really didn't want you losing signal! This isn't even mentioning the festoon of other antennas for DAB, mobile (which has a backup too and phones home in a crash: in case the shark fin is broken in a crash) reply sgt 1 hour agoprevWon't tapping on the glass disrupt the signal, or simply wind or heavy rain against it disrupt it as well? reply humanfromearth9 1 hour agoprevNext step is to develop the use case for smartphones, then for foldable smartphones. reply russfink 2 hours agoprevWhy not just make a hawk silouhette into an antenna?

TLDR, skeptical due to the issue of the two 5G frequency ranges. > Because 5G networks include spectrum comprising higher frequencies than 4G, base stations for 5G networks serve a smaller coverage footprint. Sure > It [the window antenna] is compatible with frequencies in the 5G Sub6 band—meaning signals that are less than 6 gigahertz (GHz). Sub6 antennas represent critical portions of a 5G deployment, as their lower frequency ranges penetrate barriers like walls and buildings better than the substantially higher-bandwidth millimeter-wave portions of the 5G spectrum. But 4G seems to go into at least the 3-ish GHz range just fine. At least my layman understanding is that sub-6Ghz doesn’t have the range problem, the whole point of adding that (IMO, less-than-intuitive-to-consumers) frequency band was that (while it didn’t fulfill the bandwidth promises of 5G) it also didn’t have the range problem. So it is there to fill the gaps. The ability to deploy sub-6GHz antennas everywhere seems like it misses the whole point of that band. I’m sure there’s some advantage to the 5G tech in general, because it is newer. But that’s a different pitch, right? reply toast0 2 hours agoparentSub6 is more or less the same frequencies as 4G. I know there's more low frequency (additional spectrum formerly used for over the air TV), and there might be some slightly higher frequency too, but this is the general purpose stuff. The mmWave stuff is really for locations with dense crowds like stadiums and maybe airports and busy train/transit stations. 5G is still better than 4G on sub6 for lots of reasons, but yeah, it doesn't have the oodles of bandwidth that 5G promised. Being able to put more sub6 base stations in more places is still good though. There's plenty of areas with poor coverage, and sometimes the reason there's no coverage is the aesthetics of the base stations are poor. Blending in helps. Which is why some antennas look like weird saguaro or palm trees and pine trees. It might be nice to have antennas in windows in office buildings instead hanging on the side, and it might be easier to install as well. reply westurner 3 hours agoprevWould this work with peptide glass? \"A self-healing multispectral transparent adhesive peptide glass\" https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07408-x : > Moreover, the supramolecular glass is an extremely strong adhesive yet it is transparent in a wide spectral range from visible to mid-infrared.

    "originBody": "Bare metal to production ready in mins; imagine fly.io on your VPS Features 👍 One command VPS setup (docker, traefik, sops, age) 💻 deploy any application from a dockerfile ✊ Zero downtime deployment 🌏 High availbility and load balancing 🔒 Zero config SSL Certs ✅ Connect domains or use sslip.io out of the box 🔥 Built in integration with SOPS 🛸 Escape the vendorlock forever Motivation I'm tired of the complexity involved in hosting my side projects. While some platforms, like Fly.io, stand out in the crowded field of Heroku replacements, I believe a simple VPS can be just as effective. That's why I created Sidekick: to make hosting side projects as straightforward, affordable, and production-ready as possible. You'll be surprised how much traffic a $8/month instance on DigitalOcean can handle. Installation With GO installed on your system you need to run go install github.com/mightymoud/sidekick@latest Usage Sidekick helps you along all the steps of deployment on your VPS. From basic setup to zero downtime deploys, we got you! ✊ First you need a VPS with Ubuntu LTS. I recommend DigitalOcean. Hetzner also gets very good reviews. You can host your own silicon too. As long as you have a public IP address you can use Sidekick. Just make sure the following is true: VPS running Ubuntu - LTS recommended SSH Public Key availble on your machine to login to VPS. That's it! VPS Setup First you need to setup your VPS. To do this you need to run: sidekick init Then you need to enter the following: IP Address of your VPS An email address to use for setting up SSL certs Docker registery to host your docker images - defaults to docker.io Docker username in the said registery Confirm you are currently logged in to that said registery with the username - This is needed to be able to push images on your behalf After that Sidekick will setup many things on your VPS - Usually takes around 2 mins What does Sidekick do when I run this command Launch a new application In your application folder, make sure you have a working Dockerfile that you can build and run. Also make sure you know at which port your app is expecting to recieve traffic. Then run: sidekick launch Then you need to enter the following: Url friendly name of your app - if you opt to use sslip.io domain for testing this would be your subdomain HTTP exposed port for your app to get requests - Sidekick will scan your docker file to try to extract this number and default it. Domain at which you want this application to be reachable - If you choose your own domain make sure to point the domain to your VPS IP address; otherwise we default to sslip.io domain so you can play around. If you have any env file with secrets in it. Sidekick will attempt to find .env file in the root of your folder. Sidekick will use sops to encrypt your env file and inject the values securely at run time. Should take around 2 more mins to be able to visit your application live on the web if all goes well. What does Sidekick do when I run this command Deploy a new version With your application deployed, it's super simple to redeploy a new version. At any point any time you need to only run: sidekick deploy That's all. It won't take long, we use cache from earlier docker images, your latest version should be up soon. Sidekick will deploy the new version without any downtime - you can see more in the source code. This command will also do a couple of things behind the scenes. You can check that below What does Sidekick do when I run this command Deploy a preview environment Sidekick also allows you to deploy preview envs at any point from your application. Preview envs are attached to your commit hash and require a clean git tree before you can initiate them. Once you have a clean git tree, you can run the following command to deploy a preview environment: sidekick deploy preview What does Sidekick do when I run this command Inspiration https://fly.io/ https://kamal-deploy.org/ Vision Simple CLI tool that can help you: Setup your VPS Deploy all your side projects on a single VPS Load balance multiple container per project Deploy new versions with Zero downtime Deploy preview environments with ease Manage env secrets in a secure way Connect any number of domains and subdomains to your projects with ease Remove sidekick You can easily remove sidekick if you hate it. // Mac/Linux cd $HOME/go/bin rm sidekick cd ~/.config rm -rf sidekick // Win cd %USERPROFILE%\\go\\bin del sidekick.exe // Powershell cd $HOME\\go\\bin Remove-Item sidekick.exe Roadmap I still have a couple more feature I want to add here. Also considering some of those to be on a paid version.

I'm still rocking custom Ansible playbooks, but I was planning on checking out Kamal after version 2 is released soon (I think alongside Rails 8). 2) I see databases are in your roadmap, and that's great. One feature that IMHO would be game changer for tools like this (and are lacking even in paid services like Hatchbox.io, which is overall great) is streaming replication of databases. Even for side projects, a periodic SQL dump stored in S3 is generally not enough nowadays, and any project that gains traction will need to implement some sort of streaming backup, like Litestream (for SQLite) or Barman with streaming backup (for Postgres). If I may suggest this feature, having this tool to provision a Barman server in a different VPS, and automate the process of having Postgres stream to it would be game changer. One barman server can actually accommodate multiple database backups, so N projects could do streaming backup to one single barman server. Of course, there would need to be a way to monitor if the streaming is working correctly, and maybe even help the user with the restoration process. But that effectively brings RTO down to near 0 (so no data loss) and can even allow point in time restoration. reply mightymoud 54 minutes agoparent1) Kamal is more geared towards having one VPS for project - it' made for big projects really. They also show on the demo that even the db is hosted on its own VPS. Which is great! But not for me or Sidekick target audience. Kamal V2 will support multi-projects on a single VPS afaik 2) yes yes yes! I really like litestream. Also backup is one of those critical but annoying thing that Sidekick is meant to take care of for you. I'll look into Bearman. My vision is like we would have one command for most popular db types and it would use stubs to configure everything the right way. Need to sort out docker-compose support first though... reply indigodaddy 2 hours agoparentprevPretty sure that fly.io for example supports litestream as I remember seeing some fly doc related to litestream when I was looking a few days ago for my own project. Would also make sense that they do given Litestream’s creator is currently Fly’s VP of Product (I believe). reply 4star3star 3 hours agoprevI like what I'm seeing, though I'm not sure I have a use case. On a VPS, I'll typically run a cloudflared container and configure a Cloudflare tunnel to that VPS. Then, I can expose any port and point it to a subdomain I configure in the CF dashboard. This gives https for free. I can expose services in containers or anything else running on the VPS. I'll concede there's probably a little more hands on work doing things this way, but I do like having a good grip on how things are working rather than leaning on a convenient tool. Maybe you could convince me Sidekick has more advantages? reply skinner927 56 minutes agoparentI must be an old simpleton, but why get cloudflare involved? You can get https for free with nginx and letsencrypt. reply mightymoud 49 minutes agorootparentIt's a tunnel. So VPS can only be reached through cloudflare. It's not only for https, but more for security and lockdown reply hu3 17 minutes agoparentprevNice setup. But isn't this a little too tied to Cloud Flare? Caddy as a reverse proxy on that VPS would also give us free HTTPS. The downside is less security because no CF tunneling. reply mightymoud 50 minutes agoparentprevInteresting setup.... How do you run the containers on your VPS tho? You could still use Sidekick for that! I think your setup is one step up in security from Sidekick nonetheless.

One thing I’ve noticed is the prevalence of Docker for this type of tool, or the larger self-managed PaaS tools. I totally get it, and it makes sense. I’m just slow to adapt. I’ve been so used to Go binary deployments for so long. But I also don’t really like tweaking Caddyfiles and futzing with systemd unit files, even though the pattern is familiar to me now. Been waffling on this for quite a while… reply kokanee 3 hours agoparentI'm a waffler on this as well, increasingly leaning away from containers lately. I can recall one time in my pre-Docker career when I was affected by a bug related to the fact that software developed on Mac OS ran differently than software running on CentOS in production. But I have spent untold countless hours trying to figure out various Docker-related quirks. If you legitimately need to run your software on multiple OSes in production, by all means, containerize it. But in 15 years I have never had a need to do that. I have a rock solid bash script that deploys and daemonizes an executable on a linux box, takes like 2 seconds to run, and saves me hours and hours of Dockery. reply bantunes 3 hours agorootparentI don't understand how running a single command to start either a single container or a stack of them with compose, that then gets all the requirements in a tarball similar and just runs is seen as more complicated than running random binaries, setting values on php.ini, setting up mysql or postgres, demonizing said binaries and making sure libraries and the like are in order. reply hiAndrewQuinn 1 hour agorootparentYou're going to be setting all that stuff up either way, though. It'll either be in a Dockerfile, or in a Vagrantfile (or an Ansible playbook, or a shell script, ...). But past a certain point you can't really get away from all that. So I think it comes down to personal preference. This is going to sound a bit silly, but to me, running things in VMs feels like living in an apartment. Containers feel more like living out of a hotel room. I know how to maintain an apartment, more or less. I've been living in them my whole life. I know what kinds of things I generally should and should not mess with. I'm not averse to hotels by any means, but if I'm going to spend a lot of time in a place, I will pick the apartment, where I can put all of my cumulative apartment-dwelling hours to good use. reply kokanee 0 minutes agorootparentYes, thank you for answering on my behalf. To underscore this, the decision is whether to set up all of your dependencies and configurations with a tool like bash, or to set it all up within Docker, which involves setting up Docker itself, which sometimes involves setting up (and paying for) things like registries and orchestration tools. I might tweak the apartment metaphor because I think it's generous to imply that, like a hotel, Docker does everything for you. Maybe Dockerless development is like living in an apartment and working on a boat, while using Docker is like living and working on a houseboat. There is one thing I definitely prefer Docker for, and that's running images that were created by someone else, when little to no configuration is required. For example, running Postgres locally can be nicer with Docker than without, especially if you need multiple Postgres versions. I use this workflow for proofs of concepts, trials, and the like. bluehatbrit 3 hours agorootparentprevI suppose like anything, it's a preference based on where the majority of your experience is, and what you're using it for. If you're running things you've written and it's all done the same way, docker probably is just an extra step. I personally run a bunch of software I've written, as well as open source things. So for me docker makes everything significantly easier, and saves me installing a lot of rubbish I don't understand well. reply oarsinsync 2 hours agorootparentAfter 20 years of various things breaking on my (admittedly franken) debian installs after each dist-upgrade, and spending days troubleshooting each time, I recently took the plunge and switched all services to docker-compose. I then booted into a new fresh clean debian environment, mounted my disks, and: cd /opt/docker/configs; for i in *; do cd $i; docker-compose up -d; cd ..; done voila, everything was up and working, and no longer tied to my underlying OS. Now at least I can keep my distro and kernel etc all up to date without worrying about anything else breaking. Sure, I have a new set of problems, but they feel smaller. reply stackskipton 2 hours agorootparentprevYea, in same boat and I'm wondering if there is big contingent of devs out there that bristle at Docker.

Not sure if OP’s tool does that reply mightymoud 44 minutes agorootparentNo Sidekick doesn't use firecracker. I know fly.io is built around it yes. They do that so they can put your app to sleep - basically shutting it down - then spin it up real quick when it gets a request. No place for this in Sidekick vision reply indigodaddy 2 hours agorootparentprevWas wondering the same— didn’t see any mention of it in the GH page though, nor even in roadmap reply joseferben 22 minutes agoprevthis looks amazing! i’m building https://www.plainweb.dev and i’m looking for the simplest way to deploy a plainweb/plainstack project. looks like sidekick has the same spirit when it comes to simplicity. in the plainstack docs i’ve been embracing fly.io, but reliability is an issue. and sqlite web apps (which is the core of plainstack) can’t have real zero downtime deployments, unless you count the proxy holding the pending request for 30 seconds while the fly machine is deployed. i tried kamal but it felt like non-ruby and non-rails projects are second class citizens. i was about to document deploying plainstack to dokku, but provisioning isn’t built-in. my dream deployment tool would be dokku + provisioning & setup, sidekick looks very close to that. definitely going to try this and maybe even have it in the blessed deploy path for plainstack if it works well! reply silasb 4 hours agoprevNice, I'm working in the same space as you (not opensource, personal project). We landed on the same solution, encoding the commands inside Golang and distributing those via SSH. I'm somewhat surprised not to see this more often. I'm guessing supporting multiple linux versions could get unwieldy, I focused on Ubuntu as my target. Differences that I see. * I modeled mine on-top of docker-plugins (these get installed during the bootstrapping process) * I built a custom plugin for deploying which leveraged https://github.com/Wowu/docker-rollout for zero-downtime deployments Your solution looks much simpler than mine.

I'll likely continue to use mine, but for any future VPS I'll have to give this a try. reply mightymoud 1 hour agoparenthahah seems like we went down the same rabbit hole. I also considered `docker-rollout` but decided to write my own script. Heavily inspired by the docker-rollout source code btw. Just curious, why did you decide to go with docker plugins? reply aag 1 hour agoprevThis could be great for my projects, but I'm confused about one thing: why does it need to push to a Docker registry? The Dockerfile is local, and each image is built locally. Can't the images be stored purely locally? Perhaps I'm missing something obvious. Not using a registry would reduce the number of moving parts. reply mightymoud 1 hour agoparentLocally here means the locally on your laptop locally, not locally on your VPS. Contrary to popular opinion, I believe your source code shouldn't be on your prod machine - a docker image is all you need. Lots of other projects push your code to VPS to build the image there then use it. I see no point in doing that... reply AndrewCopeland 2 hours agoprevIts a simple cli in go It uses docker There is no k8s Handles certs Zero down time I would love for it to support docker-compose as some of my side projects needs a library in python but I like having my service be in go, so I will wrap the python library in a super simple service. Overall this is awesome and I love the simplicity, with the world just full of serverless, AI and a bunch of other \"stuff\". Paralysis through analysis is really an issue and when you are just trying to create a service for yourself or an MVP, it can be a real hinderance. I have been gravitating towards Taskfile to perform similar tasks to this. God speed to you and keep up the great work. reply mightymoud 1 hour agoparentThanks man! I'm working on the docker-compose support. I got it working locally, but the ergonomics are really hard to get right, cus compose files are so flexible.

But I wanna keep this docker centric... so yeah I am still doing more thinking around this reply Hexigonz 4 hours agoprevOhhhh I like this.

Just bookmarked and then had to double check that I did not just bookmark it a few weeks ago. Turns out I had bookmarked Caddy which is similar but does not deploy the app and don’t think supports Docker. It was the auto CERT that was what I was interested in and what had stuck out in my mind. Have certbot setup and never think about it again, until my server needed to be rebuilt, and I started researching. Good to go for a few months, but my hosting will be up here in a year and going to switch providers and upgrade my setup to 2+ gig so I can run docker reliably. Thanks for posting this one just moved to the top of the list. reply indigodaddy 2 hours agoparentIn what sense would Caddy not support Docker? You can use caddy on the host itself to proxy to a docker container, and you could also have Caddy as a Docker container to proxy to other Docker containers (would just need an initial incoming iptables rule to the caddy container for the latter scenario— although caddy might have instructions somewhere on a more elegant way than iptables to get the connections to the Docker caddy container not sure) reply bluehatbrit 3 hours agoprevThis is super nice, and I'm a big fan of the detailed readme with screenshots. I'll definitely be trying it out, although I do have a pretty nice setup now which will be hard to pull away from. It's ansible driven, lets me dump a compose file in a directory, along with a backup and restore shell script, and deploys it out to my server (hetzner dedicated via server auction). It's really nice that this handles TLS/SSL, that was a real pain for me as I've been using nginx and automating cerbot wasn't the most fun in the world. This looks a lot easier on that front! reply mightymoud 1 hour agoparentSounds like you have a great setup. My vision is to make a setup like yours more accessible really w/o having to play with low level config like ansible. I think you should try to replace nginx with Traefik - it handles certs out of the box! reply achempion 3 hours agoprevThis looks amazing, congrats on the release! Really looking forward for the database hosting feature as well (and probably networking and mounting data dirs). As a side note, any reason why you decided against using docker in swarm mode as it should have all these features already built it? reply mightymoud 1 hour agoparentCorrect me if I'm wrong, Docker Swarm mode is made to manage multi node clusters.

Resource caching, worker spinup) traffic switchover. reply mightymoud 52 minutes agorootparentYup deploy hooks are on my mind. Just didn't put them on Readme. Shouldn't be very hard to implement. Might do this first before docker-compose support. reply superkuh 4 hours agoprev [–] I don't know about you but I find the single command $ sudo apt install $x to be much faster, offers wider range of software, more reliable, less fragile, easier to network, and more secure when it comes to running applications on an Ubuntu VPS. The only thing the normal way of running applications is less good at (compared to this dependency manager manager) is \"Zero downtime\". reply LVB 4 hours agoparentI’m not sure what you’re comparing that to. This project is about easily deploying your own app/side-project, which wouldn’t be available via apt. reply superkuh 3 hours agorootparent99% of what people run in docker is just normal applications. reply indigodaddy 2 hours agorootparentNot sure how true this statement is in general, but it’s definitely not true of course for what the project described as the use case, eg your own side project/app, which you’d obviously not be able to “apt install.” Unless OP meant like the supporting hosting/proxy infra like Apache/nginx, which yeah, that’s what this project is trying to avoid/abstract for the user to have to deal with. At the end of the day if you use this tool I guess all you’d need to worry about (given the tool is stable and works obviously) would be apt upgrades of the OS and even that you can automate, and then just figure out your reboot strategy.

Whether completely correct or not, the official communication on this from Mozilla sounds not friendly at all, everything that Teixeira says points to a very \"evil\" company management, and their actions and proposed goals that they've announced over the last years also don't align with what I would wish to hear and see from such a company. I remember when I decided to fully ditch Google, and today it'll be Mozilla. It's a fucking shame - a company that I've placed A LOT of hope in some years ago. reply mysterydip 6 hours agoparentSo what browser are you using? I'm in the same boat, but all I see is chrome clones. reply wobfan 5 hours agorootparentJust as the other commenter said, I think for a start I will switch to LibreWolf or Waterfox, probably the first, as it's more focused on privacy and seems to be the safer bet. Completely ditching the Firefox core browser is probably not really possible. I'm not 100% sure how comparable the degoogled Chromium's are to something like LibreWolf, but something in me just doesn't want to switch to anything Google related again. My hopes are in something completely new, something that Firefox once was, like a browser built from Servo (which was a Mozilla project, https://servo.org/), or Ladybird. But until they're ready to use for day-to-day-use we got to wait some more years, I fear. reply jsbisviewtiful 2 hours agorootparentI'm eying Ladybird but it's still a ways off.

Privacy, like security, is a trade-off between being easy to use and painfully annoying. Firefox tends towards the \"easy-to-use\" side, while things like LibreWorld slide to the \"painful\" side. That's not a bad thing, but most users won't want to deal with it. In the end, you're still supporting Firefox, which is really just Google in a clown costume. TL;DR: We need more browser engine choice. reply elashri 12 hours agoprevIn related topic, Do people usually tell their employer about a diagnosis like that if they don't ask for special accommodation?

My prayers goes to steve for a healthy recovery. reply xnorswap 11 hours agoparentYes, of course. If I worked somewhere I didn't feel I could tell my employer, it would demonstrate a lack of trust and a toxic relationship. I wouldn't want to work there. I typically disclose it during interview, and disclose even to recruiters that I need a day off or two once a month for health reasons. ( I don't tend to go into details until later in interview if I feel like it's going well. ) Does it close some doors? Yes, absolutely. I had one recruiter tell me that their client was \"startup-y\" so perhaps I \"wouldn't have the stamina\" for it. I insisted I was very capable, but they made their excuses (they lied that they'd send through the job spec) and left. But that's their loss. reply ponector 7 hours agorootparentSuch a weird place to live where you are asking permission to get a day off for health reasons.

Sometimes the employer opts to manage a separate pool of insured people - employees and their families. Such pool is fairly small so if one person comes down with an expensive disease the cost of everyone’s premiums must increase to cover that.

I feel like the most of the reaction here is... artificial? I mean, look at him, poor guy, he has cancer, of course we should side with him against evil Mozilla. All these statements that \"I am finally ditching Firefox\" despite that nothing really has changed are just virtue signaling. Many of the firefox-ditchers in this comments section cannot even properly tell, what they are ditching it for. They just support all good against all evil. I never liked Mozilla leadership in many, many years. It never was the point, really. The only thing that matters always was Firefox, and the only real question was if there is anything better. I don't claim to have an answer to that question (let's just say there were multiple occasions when I considered switching, but never did), but I can tell you for sure, whatever it is, it couldn't have changed because of this guy's demise. Siding with him feels kinda ironic in a way. It was unsightly when it was about Brendan Eich or servo team, because these are technical people, who created something of value, which is why Mozilla exist. But this guy is basically the very same \"evil Mozilla leadership\" who only turned out on the bottom side of the internal corporate games. He isn't the one who created Firefox, or JavaScript, or Rust, or anything. He worked in Microsoft for 14 years, not in Mozilla. I'm not even sure I can recollect, how exactly Firefox changed in the past 2 years (except for Translate button, this was nice). Which is probably a good sign, but still, I don't know any reason to cheer for this guy. He is just a dude with cancer, that's basically his only \"defence\". Defence against... being demoted? Oh, come on. I wonder if his compensation decreased by 40% is less than the total cost of the former Servo team. (And just by the way, the fact I am constantly mentioning Servo doesn't mean I am blaming Mozilla for that decision. It surely wasn't nice, but it is understandable. Firefox is free to use, never financially viable, doesn't have any plans to become financially viable. It is a miracle of sorts that Google still agrees to sponsor them.) And having something like this in his defence speech: > He questioned the need for the layoffs and raised concerns about the potential to disproportionately impact women and people of color Well, it surely doesn't make me more sympathetic. reply fredski42 8 hours agoprevEverybody here seem to have strong opinions on the employer without having heard anything about their side on this. reply joshstrange 7 hours agoparentProbably because Mozilla has burned any goodwill in the community that they had left long ago. reply ParetoOptimal 33 minutes agoparentprevGood.

With some crazy quotes; On April 24, the suit says, Mozilla formally proposed to demote Teixeira to senior vice president of technology strategy, with a 40% reduction in total compensation. He declined to accept the role change. He had not requested additional flexibility related to his diagnosis, the suit says. The suit alleges that Chambers [new CEO] pressed ahead, informing other Mozilla leaders about the demotion, and telling Teixeira’s direct reports that “it would be tough for him to continue to run a large team because of his health,” despite lacking his consent to share information about his health with others inside the company.

How do you know your work hours? reply DavidPeiffer 10 hours agorootparentYour monetary compensation is in an offer letter you sign to accept the role. Salary exempt status is a fixed value per time period, or separately a hourly rate. If paid hourly, you're typically entitled to 1.5x pay after 40 hours of work. Salaried exempt status are not mandated overtime pay. What hours you work depends. Salaried is expecting a job to be done regardless of the hours to complete. Hourly is a mixed bag of \"the schedule for next week is posted every Tuesday\" (common in restaurants) or routine hours long-term (such as shift work in factories). It's awkward to try to explain, but here are some pros and cons from other people. https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditForGrownups/comments/16606tt/... reply nrb 10 hours agorootparentprevThis info often comes in the form of an offer letter that is accepted verbally or in writing.

Any annex to the contract (including base salary changes) must be _voluntarily_ signed by the employee. Forcing signing is illegal. When covid started, my company gave all employees annexes to reduce our pay by 20%, but keep our workload the same. I told 2 bosses, the HR employee and the director of HR mobbing me I will not sign and to piss off. I was the only one to do so out of ~150 employees. I kept my full salary until I quit my job because I don't like working for cunts. reply lucianbr 11 hours agorootparentprevIt definitely is the case in the EU. Where did you get the idea it isn't? In my country, which is in the EU, having someone work for you without a contract is a crime. Because by not having a contract you're denying them rights such as pension contribution, paid vacation, health insurance etc. Plus you have to pay taxes on salary, so if you hire them \"on a handshake\" as it were, you're probably doing tax evasion too. reply throwaway48540 9 hours agorootparentI got the idea from my personal experience where I never was able to refuse what they told me. I'm not saying no contracts, I'm saying that refusing the change means I quit myself, and so no protection. reply spoiler 11 hours agorootparentprevRegarding the EU thing: maybe I've just had an odd experience, but I've always signed employment contracts. Even when I was a student I had a contract from the company I worked at (it was a separate contract, not the usual student contract that I had to get also). reply bbarnett 12 hours agorootparentprevThis varies a lot on region, and even (for example in Canada) provincial jurisdiction, but I agree at the core this is a match. I've seen constructive dismissal discussed for even adding on-call to someone who was hired without on-call requirements, unilaterally. The logic being \"You're suddenly asking me to be paged at any time when on call, that wasn't part of the job description\", and it is paramount to effectively \"firing and re-hiring\" a person in another role without their permission. Why I mention legal jurisdictions, and the above example, is because some US states are 'at will' employment states. In such a state, you can just fire anyone at any time, and thus the whole \"fired and re-hired\" thing doesn't kick in... as the 'fire' part is a-ok. People have contracts in such states, typically, especially at a CPO executive level. So I really wonder here, will this be more about breach of contract? (Of course, there are other issues. The disclosure of medical info... that's just bizarre, and smacks of massive inexperience and lack of judgement, if true) reply kwhitefoot 10 hours agoparentprevIn Norway this is flatly illegal and the relevant government department would probably get involved. Here in Norway companies are legally required to make accommodations for people who fall ill in order to keep them working, so the new CEO would definitely be in the wrong regardless of whether such additional flexibility had actually been requested. > B) you can “decline to accept” a demotion?? You probably can't simply decline it but you can certainly argue against it and if necessary sue in the courts depending on what your employment contract says. If he resigns then I think under UK law it is arguable that it is constructive dismissal: \"Constructive dismissal Constructive dismissal is when you’re forced to leave your job against your will because of your employer’s conduct. The reasons you leave your job must be serious, for example, they: - do not pay you or suddenly demote you for no reason - force you to accept unreasonable changes to how you work - for example, tell you to work night shifts when your contract is only for day work - let other employees harass or bully you \" https://www.gov.uk/dismissal/unfair-and-constructive-dismiss... reply bartread 11 hours agoparentprevThis is one of the shittiest pieces of behaviour by an employer I've ever read about.

Often the people who are fervently in favour of DEI initiatives (rather than in a relaxed way, like ordinary people who wish for equity and inclusion) will make the accommodations only if that person is labelled, diagnosed and if they don't behave “like an asshole”. The annoying thing is that Autism itself is a disorder, largely because the people suffering find it difficult to follow social cues, steer away from taboo subjects and are largely “too honest”. Which to people who did not grow up with Autists (I did) will seem like they’re “being assholes”. I find this to be the highest form of hypocrisy, as disorders such as high levels of autism are expressly considered a part of DEI initiatives and DEI branding, and some fervent DEI supporters will cosplay Autism- when in reality, like all people, they’re on the spectrum but not severely impacted. I find it hard to take this group seriously when they so blatantly disregard broader, universal, accommodations around reading speech charitably to include people so supposedly core to their endeavours.

At any fork point during computation, it may run the two passed closures in parallel. It works best in cases where there are many small computations and where it is expensive to estimate how many are left on the current branch in order to stop trying to share work across threads. Example The following example sums up all nodes in a binary tree in parallel. fn sum(node: &Node, scope: &mut Scope) -> u64 { let (left, right) = scope.join( |s| node.left.as_deref().map(|n| sum(n, s)).unwrap_or_default(), |s| node.right.as_deref().map(|n| sum(n, s)).unwrap_or_default(), ); node.val + left + right } This is the ideal example since per-node computation is very cheap and the nodes don't keep track of how many descendants are left.

    "title": "Ruby-SAML pwned by XML signature wrapping attacks",
    "originLink": "https://ssoready.com/blog/engineering/ruby-saml-pwned-by-xml-signature-wrapping-attacks/",
    "originBody": "Ruby-SAML pwned by XML signature wrapping attacks GitLab and others are affected. The blame lies in the SAML specification, and in credulous engineers that implement it. Ulysse Carion X GitHub Cofounder and CTO, SSOReady CVE-2024-45409 was published on September 10, 2024. It’s yet another XML signature wrapping attack, this time affecting the main Ruby implementation of SAML. The vuln allows an attacker log in as any arbitrary user of the affected system. This attack keeps coming up again and again, and it keeps affecting huge swaths of the internet — this time, GitLab and much of the Ruby ecosystem — at a time. Here’s what this issue is, why it keeps happening, and what we can do about it. XML Signature Wrapping XML signatures are the year 2000’s answer to JWTs. In 2024, JWTs are a very common answer to “I need to sign some data and send it over the internet”. It’s not a perfect spec, but it’s workable. XML signatures do the same thing, but every conceivable step is much more complicated. All an XML signature does is let you cryptographically sign an XML document. Same thing as what JWTs do with alg: \"RS256\" (no ES256, because remember: the year is 2000). There is exactly one sane way to cryptographically sign data: You take your message, and convert it to bytes You sign the bytes, which produces some more bytes You transmit two things: the message-bytes from (1), and the signature-bytes from (2) Don’t get cute. Steps 1-3 is what JWT does. It does step (3) by separating the message and the signature with a period (.), which works because it also base64s the message and the signature, and . can’t appear in base64. People hate on JWT because it forgot about (4); it’s part of an overarching attempt to standardize all of crypto under something called JOSE (and COSE), a bad idea. But overall they’re pretty good. They work. You can mostly ignore the overreach on the part of the spec authors. XML Signatures takes a different approach. Instead, it: Lets you sign subsets of a message, Or none of the message at all, Because instead of sending a signature accompanying your message, you edit the very message you’re signing to sprinkle in someelements, Each of which sign a different subset of the message. A ds:Signature uses a URI to point to other parts of the message, and say “here’s a signature for that part of the message” If you ignore the XML-ness of it all, it’s the equivalent of signing {\"email\": \"bob@company.com\"} by modifying it to be: { \"email\": \"bob@company.com\", \"__sig\": { \"uri\": \"/email\", \"sig\": \"... signature for the string bob@company.com ...\" } } This is a bad idea. It introduces the need for some “signature discovery” step, where you search through the document for signatures (__sig in my JSON example;elements in XML signatures). It basically begs engineers to do this: def validate_xml(xml_document): for signature in find_xml_signature_elements(xml_document): element = resolve_uri(signature[\"SignedInfo\"][\"Reference\"][\"URI\"], xml_document) verify_signature(element, signature[\"SignatureValue\"] Note that this doesn’t actually do anything if the document doesn’t have any signature at all. People write a ton of bugs related to this “signature discovery” step. Every such bug is what they call a “XML Signature Wrapping” attack; someone wrote some tricky XML that makes your code lose track of what’s actually being signed. To anticipate the obvious suggestion: no, sadly you can’t just check whether the top-level XML document is signed, because that’s not how SAML does it (more later), and SAML is the only reason people do XML Signatures (again, more later). So you instead in practice have people adapting their previous code to make sure that the part of the message they care about is, in fact, signed: def validate_xml(xml_document, uri_checklist): checked_uris = [] for signature in find_xml_signature_elements(xml_document): element = resolve_uri(signature[\"SignedInfo\"][\"Reference\"][\"URI\"], xml_document) verify_signature(element, signature[\"SignatureValue\"] checked_uris.append(signature[\"SignedInfo\"][\"Reference\"][\"URI\"]) for uri in uri_checklist: if uri not in checked_uris: throw MissingSignatureError() There are a million ways this goes wrong, but here’s the one ruby-saml ran into: there’s nothing that guarantees the URI the signature points to is unique. So what you could do is take a legitimate message, and just stick some other stuff into the message, reusing the same URI. And then hope your victim’s code will get confused as to what it just signed. Something like this: eve@evil.com alice@customer.com ... the correct signature, but for alice@customer.com ... The victim code finds the signature, resolves the uri to the top-level Message, but then later on would process ImportantStuff instead of Message, if that’s where the Message is normally placed. It’s a mess. Ruby-SAML patched this by throwing if resolve_uri finds more than one match. But Ruby-SAML has no reliable way of validating which parts of an XML document were signed, and so I wouldn’t be surprised if there were more issues in that codebase lurking. SAML is why this matters Nobody cares about XML Signatures anymore, except in the context of SAML. SAML is what people mean by “enterprise single-sign-on”, and it works by having an Identity Provider (Okta, Microsoft Entra, Google Workspace, etc.) send a signed XML message to a Service Provider (a B2B SaaS product). That message typically just contains the logging in user’s email address. It’s an elaborate email address transmission protocol. Concretely, SAML requests are a POST from your user’s browser containing: http://www.okta.com/exkig8gdo63cjI4OD5d7n744L/[...]mDruC1H9E0Lz7sbZg== ulysse.carion@ssoready.com And “implementing SAML” mostly consists of: “Validating” the message, with all the fraught gotchas that entails Logging in the user as ulysse.carion@ssoready.com. Notice how this is roughly the same shape of message that I laid out in the previous example. I won’t disclose it here because that’d be irresponsible, but you can do the same attack. You could get me to validate the message in step (1), but then have some other thing in the message, also with ID=\"id2829877824622019702853127\", that I use in step (2). To repeat it again, the core dumb idea here is that you’re signing a message, instead of signing bytes. XML Signatures interweaves cryptography and the XML tree model into a messy knot. It’s really hard to make sure the message you’re processing is the same as the bytes you verified. How to fix this: disregard the spec SAML library authors need to stop being so credulous about the spec. When a specification is a collection of security flaws, responsible engineers disregard the specification. Responsible engineers should disregard what the SAML and XML Signatures spec authors wrote down, and instead implement the secure thing at its core. Put another way, the reason XML wrapping attacks keep coming up is that people architect their code like this: saml-ruby calls into some xml-signatures-ruby dependency or submodule This seems like good, sane composition. But XML Signatures is insane. It cannot be composed. XML Signatures can’t say “yes this message is valid”. What it can say is “these N potentially-overlapping subsets of this XML document are correctly signed” (It’s actually considerably worse than that, but whatever). There’s no building on top of XML Signatures. So here’s the sane thing to do instead: Notice that every Identity Provider in the world has practically agreed to shape their SAML payloads in the same shape. Assume all messages shaped otherwise are invalid. Disregard the URI in XML signatures. Presume in advance that they’re signing exactly the subset of the SAML payload they should be signing, which is also the subset of the payload you’ll be processing later. Verify that signature, and only that signature. In other words: forget XML signatures. Treat it as some weird relic. Just look at the SAML payload, and implement the de-facto protocol that has emerged. Ignore Postel. When it comes to processing cryptographic signatures, loosey-goosey isn’t “liberal”, it’s libertine.",

If XML was removed, these specs wouldn't have been much better. The motivation of the companies sponsoring specs was to build something that sold more enterprise middleware and identity servers. This was never going to be attractive to the individuals working with IETF, or the people working on web standards who'd create WHATWG (I know SAML isn't their domain.) Many readers here also won't be aware of how web services, SOAP, and XML were the AI hype of the time. These were getting pushed into every kind of solution. At the same time, the alternative options for document and serialization formats weren't ubiquitous, so having XML everywhere was somewhat pragmatic for the average developer.

The amount of fields of use where XML is used bogusly which have nothing to do with markup is truly staggering. XML signing and relying on canonical XML serialization for it is just peak and something else. The sad thing is that XML was meant as a simplification over full SGML for delivery of markup on the web. Specifically, XML is always fully tagged (doesn't make use of tag inference), and does neither have empty (\"void\") elements nor short forms for attributes such as in . Thus XML never needs markup declarations for special per-element or per-attribute parsing rules. This was done to facilitate newer vocabularies next to HTML like SVG and MathML. But soon enough, folks took the XML specification as an invitation for complexity and a self-serving spec circus: namespaces, XInclude (as a bogus replacement for entity expansion), XQuery, XSLT, XML Schema as a super-verbose replacement for DTDs using XML itself, etc. XHTML 2 was the largest failure and turning point, introducing not just a new vocabulary, but trying to reinvent how browsers work in a design-by-comittee fashion. It could be said that XHTML took W3C down along with it. For message payloads in large and long-term multi-party projects (governments, finance/payments, healthcare, etc.), I'm however not sure the alternatives (JSON-over-HTTP and the idiotic quasi-religious apeal to misunderstood \"REST\" semantics) is really helping. XML Schema, while in part overkill and unused (substitution groups), certainly has facilitated separating service interface from service implementation, multiple generations and multiple implementations, test cases bases, and other long-term maintenance goals. reply eftpotrm 9 hours agorootparentI'm not going to argue that XML hasn't been used badly and excessively in a lot of places, it really has, and using every part of it religiously will tie you in knots, fast. But I can't help noticing that Json is gaining more and more XML-like functionality through things like schemas and JsonPath, as people slowly realise why XML had those functions they're now having to replace. I'm a long way from convinced that all the engineering effort to switch was actually beneficial. reply dwaite 2 hours agorootparentAnd schema and paths have much the same issues - they are being used as tools in things like network-exchanged messages when the underlying specs and the implementations out there were not designed with that idea in mind. You are going to have a bad time if your schema validation tries to resolve schema URL by default. You are going to have a bad time if your JSONpath implementation supports the older \"eval\" mechanisms, or has unbounded memory/processing time growth from top-down traversal of the JSON. The issue in the article was purposely avoided in JSON by virtue of JWS not having canonicalization, transforms, or partial signatures. You sign a chunk of binary data, and that binary data might be parsable as JSON. reply darby_nine 4 hours agorootparentprev> But I can't help noticing that Json is gaining more and more XML-like functionality through things like schemas and JsonPath, as people slowly realise why XML had those functions they're now having to replace. I think there's an analogy here to static typing and gradual typing. XML is a massive pain in the ass to implement and JSON is often good enough. Only having to implement the features you plan on using is quite nice. reply eftpotrm 2 hours agorootparentFor who though? If you're a user of whatever-data-format designing your new application, you could always use the subset you actually cared about. No-one forced you to use all the complex bits in XML. If you're a library author - well, yes, you could implement a Json parser at first that was eval(input), then something more complex because that's a security hole, then something else again because that's not too quick, then a new library like JsonPath to get queryability, and... all your work is still less functional than the system you were trying to replace. So yes, you can possibly implement Json libraries in less code than implementing XML libraries. But unless you had a reason to implement a new XML library from scratch anyway, that isn't actually a win. reply darby_nine 1 hour agorootparent> No-one forced you to use all the complex bits in XML. Just parsing XML alone is hugely painful, let alone implementing the rest of the stuff like XSLT, namespaces, validation, xpath, etc etc. Plus, once you've done this, you still need a natural way to map this into domain types, or you need to force people into a visitor pattern or some other awkward deserialization technique. JSON just requires a single JSONValue sum type. XML has its place, but it'd have to be a pretty extreme case of needing rigor or a tree where I need to be able to peg arbitrary attributes onto the nodes in order to see it as attractive. Most APIs won't benefit from all of XML's features. For instance I maintain a podcasting/rss feed library and XML (And more importantly, the way people publish invalid xml) makes me really wish they had gone with a different format in the day that was harder to fuck up. reply aversis_ 7 hours agorootparentprevDevs just love reinventing the wheel every few years.

As always, intentions don't matter at all, and it's the best tool we have for certain types of structures. reply dwaite 2 hours agorootparentIt is a properly named language.

In recent years IETF has given us SCIM (which is sort of like \"offline SAML\") which is 3 RFCs (goals, schemas, http stuff), and of course JWT is actually part of a series of like 9 RFCs (including JWT, of course, but also JWK, JWS, JWE, JWA, ...).

There’s a wild set of rules on how to make xml canonical, sign, add the signature, etc. It’s nontrivial. reply vbezhenar 17 hours agoparentWhat's confusing about it? Everything seems pretty obvious to me. reply bfrog 6 hours agorootparentTo clarify, in signing you have to convert xml to bytes you can get back in the other side, while modifying the same bytes injecting signatures. The whole custom canonical xml serializer is actually complex with escape rules and a bunch of other insanity. On the other side you have to do the opposite by dropping the signature element and serializing the same way. Worse this is done at an element level not a document level as noted in the linked article. Really, it’s not that simple. It typically requires a while xml library for dealing with it that is error prone. Check the number of errors and cves for libxmlsec for example. Or even the versions in C# or Java. reply nimish 6 hours agorootparentprevXml canonicalization is insane but necessary. Far more complex than the signature process itself Then the incredibly stupid need to modify the signed document to insert the signature online so verifying it requires a full blown parser among other things reply captn3m0 17 hours agorootparentprevAdding Signatures to an existing document, no matter the format is just a whole bunch of trouble. reply maxbond 16 hours agorootparentTo expand, generally you wouldn't want to change the identity of the document by signing it (eg change it's hash). That's bananas. If the signature was external to the document, you wouldn't need any complex and error prone rules to canonicalize. You'd just generate an HMAC tag and send it alongside (or, better yet, use an authenticated encryption like AES-GCM). reply jahewson 14 hours agorootparentThe sane thing is to sign bytes, as you suggest. But OP is right that it needs to preclude adding signatures to a document. reply agentultra 5 hours agoprevBusinesses that want to integrate with larger SaaS providers and enterprises are often compelled to implement SAML. I used to fight tooth and nail to avoid it over issues with the SAML spec but... business is business. Good suggestions from the article: work around it. The non-technical folks may force you to implement it in your system. Doesn't mean you have to leave your systems vulnerable. reply benmmurphy 8 hours agoprevi think the problem is signature verification APIs should return the signed data or an error and then the consumer should use the signed data from the API and not any other data. then there is no confusion over what was signed or not. in the case of XML signature verification they probably should return a list of (XMLElement, Path) tuples. so the actual XMLElement that was signed and verified by the API and a path to the element in the document. having APIs that return IDs and then make assumptions that the signature verification code and the consumer code is going to perform resolution the same way is dangerous. even returning the path is a potential footgun but I assume consumers of an XMLSignature need to be able to check that elements appear in certain places in the document. i guess also DOM model APIs are probably implicitly returning a path if they support navigating by `getParentElement()`. reply quickgist 14 hours agoprevI love this quote from the blog: > Why are we making chandeliers out of swords of Damocles?

I’m genuinely curious here, I’m not attempting to bait an argument. reply bawolff 16 hours agorootparentTwo things Saml itself is sort of a kitchen sink. It includes everything you could possibly ever want, but nobody implements all of it so you need to figure out common subset, which defeats the point of a standard. Second, XMLSignature sucks... like badly. Only part of the response is signed, but which part there is no standard on. It is way too complicated. Why have multiple overlapping signatures is crazy. Comments arent signed but change meaning of document. A billion signature types. Etc. reply Freak_NL 12 hours agorootparentXML signatures in SAML suck so much they deserve to be your point one. For functionality at least it's possible to just poke around and see what works with whatever party your connecting, but debugging broken signing? With XML signatures it is possible to have it all working with one provider (perhaps a Windows machine running ADFS) and then be unable to verify the signatures from another, and you'll never know where the fault lies. At least with modern stuff like JWT's the ways to encrypt and sign are well-understood. reply mdaniel 2 hours agorootparentprev> Comments arent signed but change meaning of document Do you have an example of that assertion handy?

But basically in some xml apis, a comment can split a single text node into two adjacent text nodes. Some implementations would only look at the first text node. The original xsignature spec (although i think this has been changed) said to remove all comments from doc before signing it, so the attacker can add arbitrary comments without messing up the signature. reply cmgbhm 9 hours agorootparentprevIt also supports putting keyinfo into the document as well and validates it by default unless you really know to go out of your way to disable it. Oh look, another signature issue… https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2xp3-57p7-qf4v When googling for a SAML dependency, if a library doesn’t already have CVEs for this stuff, it’s likely never been tested. reply silon42 10 hours agorootparentprevPersonally I've found one of the few sane uses of XMLSignature is just to use only enveloped-signature, where the signature is then removed from message before processing... also it can be composed by nesting them (carefully). reply tptacek 18 hours agorootparentprevIt is drastically harder to understand than OIDC, in large part due to XML signatures, which are a demented format, mostly for the reasons stated in this blog post (but also for some reasons it shares with JWT, and also for some sui generis reasons having to do with how complicated xmldsig is and how few implementations there are of it). You really couldn't find a worse format to do cryptography with than XML. reply unscaled 16 hours agorootparentprevIt's not just shitty implementations here. The designers of SAML and XMLDSig cannot just blame the developers for implementing their \"perfect\" spec incorrectly. The blog post above details exactly why XMLDSig can only be implemented securely, if you explicitly make an effort to ignore the spec. When following the specification leads to insecure implementations it's the spec that's shitty, and the spec authors should carry the blame. The Open ID spec isn't great either and has its own share of issues, but in most scenarios, it doesn't rely on signature validation. If you only use the authorization code flow, breaking the ID token signature becomes ineffective, since the attacker still needs a valid authorization code from the IdP for this attack. If you restrict your implementation to what is allowed in OAuth 2.1 [1] or follow OAuth Best Practices [2], you can implement Open ID Connect pretty safely, as they eliminate the implicit grant and introduce PKCE. I sure wish the OpenID foundation would cut all the unnecessary bloat in their spec(namely the ID Token, Implicit and Hybrid Flow and unnecessarily client-side token validation rules) and leave it as just a simple extension to OAuth 2.1 that specifies a few extra parameters and a User Info Endpoint. But if we have to leave with this over-engineered spec, I can still trust that implementations of OIDC would fail less horribly than SAML. [1] https://oauth.net/2.1/ [2] https://oauth.net/2/oauth-best-practice/ reply bawolff 14 hours agorootparent> It's not just shitty implementations here I agree 100% the spec is shitty, but on top of it,some of the implementations are really weird beyond the spec. there was a prominent c library for it that (last i checked) in the default config added a custom hmac signature version where the hmac key is embedded in the attacker control document, and also hooked into the the system web pki, so if the provided key doesnt match, it will test if the doc was signed by a tls key from any website in the world. reply tux3 11 hours agorootparentOutstanding.

The problem in this issue is not only RubySaml, but actually much older code in a module called XmlSecurity. Some major problems with SAML are 1) the user’s browser acts as a MITM between the SP and IdP on all requests (vector for this attack), and 2) it requires the IdP and SP to maintain their own certs, which is fine in theory, but humans at big corps are lazy, and the complexity causes people to be lax on security. reply SigmundA 16 hours agoparent>1) the user’s browser acts as a MITM between the SP and IdP on all requests (vector for this attack) This is exactly how OIDC implicit flow works. The basic difference is using JWT instead of signed XML otherwise it's nearly identical, I mean public/private key signing is the basis for JWT and XML sig. SAML also supports artifact binding which would use a back channel similar to other ODIC flows, but I haven't seen it used much because its make things more complicated and requires the SP to be able to communicate with the IdP. reply SigmundA 19 hours agoprev [–] Microsoft's SignedXml implementation in the .Net framework fixed this 8 years ago so long as you are correctly using the GetIdElement which makes sure there are no duplicates. https://coding.abel.nu/2016/03/vulnerability-in-net-signedxm... reply silon42 10 hours agoparentAnd they \"forgot\" to tell people that if doing this properly, they need to use a schema/DTD where Id is defined as ID and then guaranteed unique by XML parser.

If there’s a way to call an api the wrong way and the right way, and both appear to work, large number of developers will implement the insecure api. Why can’t the incorrect api be removed? I understand there’s pressure to support old client code but vulnerabilities should trump backwards compatibility. reply SigmundA 17 hours agorootparent [–] The incorrect api would be using GetXml and looking at the raw XmlElement and using select nodes or something vs using the GetIdElement on the SignedXML object itself, its not going to prevent you from looking at the xml document directly and do something incorrect but it gives you a correct helper method right next to CheckSignature to do the right thing. I mean at some point you do have to understand the difference between xml and a specific schema of it and how its used in SAML, its not like xml elements are required to have a unique id attribute.

Funny readme but rather harsh. Seems I have been trolled enough to provide a response here... I am not a fan of \"Qwakbooks\" and I can't believe I am about to defend it but... it does allow you to enter journal entries manually. In fact, you do not have to use any of the screens overlayed on top of the GL. The additional features are meant to help users do things faster and more efficiently. The details are not hidden at all but most users don't need to see them to be successful. QuickBooks has all of the same core functionality including a well structured database too. You can interact with the QuickBooks Online API with a few endpoints and achieve the same thing much faster with scalability depending on which features you would like to use. If you don't believe me, just read through the API documentation which is really easy to follow. https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/api/acco... So yes, this is a well structured database for an accounting system but beyond that there isn't much here. Some other points: \"Due to its wide scope, the system is designed to be incomplete, allowing organizations to finalize the implementation.\" The customization involved to make this useable would be quite substantial and unaffordable unless you did it yourself (which would be a distraction from core business) \"Companies that adopt my system are far less likely to get audited...\" This is false. You might survive an audit with a clean general ledger but it doesn't reduce the likelihood. There is also way more to audits than whether the TB balances - the substance of the transactions is obviously more important. ie. the accountant needs to know accounting otherwise audits with any system go poorly. At quick glance... both this and QuickBooks do not have purchase order management, capex or prepaid amortization automation, approval workflows, muti-dimension transaction classification (for FP&A), or strong multi-company/currency support. These are all reasons why companies switch to a more robust (and usually more expensive) system.

There are a few other OSS implementations, a list on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_accounting_softw... As someone who has helped write and manage one used internally at a thousands of active employee organization I have some thoughts: Most of these skip over authorization of transactions, which is very important in many organizations. I.e. Tootie wants to buy a new widget. Her supervisor probably has to approve it along with someone from budget/accounting to confirm we actually have the cash to pay for said widget, etc. These authorization/workflow systems can get stupidly complex. Ours is rule/action based via regex matches against columns in the DB, and we support a _rules view on said table, to help achieve our goals and allow customization for each \"module\" or type of transaction that needs authorization. The other thing often missing is auditing. We have auditors show up once or twice a year and pour over our transactions, audit and access logs. We record every I/U/D that happens against any table in the DB and have kept this information forever. We also have a support ticket system with integrated VCS that we use religiously to help handle the why, that also never erases information. The next big thing often missing is reporting. We have thousands of reports. Every employee basically needs a few different ones. The key people(The accounting, payroll, AP and budget departments, tend to get dozens of reports per employee). We perhaps overly abuse use PostgreSQL's access controls. Every user gets a login, and we use row and column level access controls. This way all of the above features are tied into access control. So if we make a generic report(say a birthday list), we can make it available for everyone, but a supervisor can only see their own employees and say the main manager at a particular location can only see records pertaining to their location. Lastly, these systems do not live in isolation, we are often the first and last source for information. We import and export data automatically against a wide range of various systems, from SSO to random one-off messes some employee managed to get installed somewhere. Having a sane way to deal with IO is essential. Our current best method is for every system we have to two-way sync with(which almost always happens if the product lives past the first year), we keep a separate world-view of what we think their data is. This way when stuff inevitably breaks, we can easily track down if it's an us or them problem and get it routed appropriately. Since we keep both our world-view AND their world-view in our PostgreSQL database, we can replicate any previous state(due to keeping both world-views and precise auditing). reply emeril 3 hours agoprevomg, I'm an actual old fart accountant... \"quickbooks\" is good enough for small businesses (though I 100% appreciate the problems it has) if you need something robust with more controls, you either just use netsuite/etc. or something more specialized for your industry and FFS, only go the route of custom code as a last resort, you are better off slightly changing your business process to match whatever workflow/etc. is in the OTS ERP instead of having some cheap crappy dev (only crappy since most who do ERP programming are often not well paid) shoehorn your (likely ill conceived) process or report into the existing ERP... reply bbor 21 hours agoprevThanks for posting, looks pretty polished to me!

I will say this is by far the most passionate README.md I've ever seen, lol; Intuit didn't invent accounting; they've stolen it. Accounting existed before computers, databases, and software. Transactions were recorded in physical journals using pen and paper, which forced accountants to have a better understanding of company finances due to the process of manual entry, with little room for error. Now, the process has been automated through software, and the journal entries are hidden away, leaving only the final report to spot errors and fraud. None of you can call yourselves accountants; you're just QwackBooks users. The truck drivers of the office. Your boss thinks of you as a whiny, tail-dragging *****.

Why not just use a piece of a paper/the default Excel ledger template/the `ledger` CLI tool if it's so important to do things by hand? P.S. \"Truck drivers of the office\"...? reply journal 21 hours agoparentThere are multiple reasons. 1. Intuit discontinued QB desktop on may 31 this year. 2. Intuit recently raised prices. 3. QB online has terrible navigation. I can make invoice in my system in less clicks. 4. I needed a feature to optionally print supporting documents with the invoice while having the ability to arrange the order of those documents. I then can integrate with mailing service and have PDF ready to mail programmatically. Instead of having to join PDFs together. (this feature doesn't work cause I can't afford IronPDF, it's the only PDF package I would use). 5. I don't like any limits on users or numbers of invoices I can have in my system. 6. Excel is error prone for more than a few records. Drag and drop accidentally one cell to another? 7. Multi-tenancy. I wanted to manage multiple companies without logging out. reply j45 4 hours agoprevWow, this is really neat. Congrats on the launch. Are you seeking or accepting contributors? I’ll be installing it today. I’ve unintentionally worked with and helped implement systemization and automation over a dozen different accounting systems and ERPs. They blur together. Since I have a tech background, it’s not uncommon for me to say an accounting system or ERP is just line item rows moving though tables leaving their history behind… and how do you need it… and now it exists, haha. A few questions: - Journals and accounts are traditionally taught as the manual way to track different financial activities and ensure accurate reporting. Journals capture transactions as they happen, while accounts categorized them for analysis. Now that we have databases and reporting tools, is there a sense of where reporting or crunching things like profitability, job costing, etc could be built up from this? Account code migration - when implementing a new accounting system, companies tend to dither over getting their GL right, or changing it up at implementation. Being able to maintain that history could help migration of data easier. As someone who has helped design and lead implementations overall, with accountants handling their part, accounting depts can get caught in trying to do a lot with accounts and journals in lieu of a report.. while databases have allowed ERPs to report in ways (dimensions, etc) that might not be about accounts or journals alone. Mostly I’m thinking about organizations that wanted to build up calculation of profitability by asset, or resource or service, or product, and how a project like this could help people easily do it from these first principles. reply journal 4 hours agoparentI have a few ideas in the works for accepting contributions that I will iron out in the coming days. I have some breaking changes in the works to make the journal more reliable and testable. The current implementation requires deep understanding of my vision. AFAIK, North Korea, Russia, and United States, all have the same five accounts types and require double-entry. This truly is a mission to rebuild an institution. My goal is to educate a new generation of accountants. The kind who can produce any report from raw journal entries and who can add new features to the journal. Parent-child relationships help with reporting, but I notice the need to include parent-child relationships almost everywhere; locations, items (products/services), chart-of-accounts, users, tasks, etc. I've not touched reporting because I know it will be easy to do. If I get the journal, accounts, and transactions right, the rest is easy street. One thing to mention at this time is that I don't see a need to manually enter journal entries. I'm ready to catch flack for saying this, but maybe... idk. Still in R&D phase. reply karl11 4 hours agorootparentLack of manual journals would be a non-starter, I am actually not clear how a business could possibly run their books without manual journals. An example: you make something that uses 5 inputs. I have inventory and cost of goods sold accounts for each of those inputs, but my invoices out to customers only reference the final product. This is where ERPs add insanely complex inventory management solutions. However, the simple way to deal with it instead is to use a manual journal to reconcile your inventory and cost of goods sold accounts monthly or however often you like. reply journal 3 hours agorootparentI have all the in the works, including complex assemblies and reporting. I wish I had the $ to hire help. reply j45 2 hours agorootparentprevInteresting example - Complex ERP inventory management and manufacturing experience here: It seems reasonable to need manual adjustments, but I'm not sure if entries would be needed. Deciding how to make corrections and adjustments seems to be key in any manual journal entries, or not. If journal entries derive from transactions elsewhere, chaining those together, or something to adjust them them is pretty reasonable. About split entries like the scenario you've outlined? Cost of Goods Sold, vs manufacturing are all often in different parts of the ERP that may not tie back to journals always. Perhaps there is a pattern to setup that is repeatable. I'm not sure if you have a software background, but source code control of managing the bits of what changed when is important. Another scenario where manual stuff might not work is if we have a just in time manufacturing process, and don't complete the finished goods until the items are on the truck and signed for by the driver (un damaged) so then you can finalize manufacturing, invoicing, shipping documents, etc. There's ways to reduce having to undo all of those if product is damaged between manufacturing and shipping. Of course this has it's own caveats. Implemented OK in SAP though. Overall, a real need and goal is: reducing the amount accountants or anyone who works with an accounting data has to dump out data from the accounting system to \"manipulate the data\" to get a view of what happened/happening/needs to happen. Unpopular take based on experience: It's been my experience that a good chunk of accounting groups that run around with their hair on fire that the system is somehow not working... calls in someone with database or analysis skills, to discover something wasn't done as needed, or not configured and implemented. In this way, the Technical ERP whisperers out there who are not accountants but handle the \"in depth analysis\".. reply gamblor956 12 hours agoprevIf you think Intuit is accounting than you don't really know what accounting is. Off the top of my head... every major ERP has better functionality, customizability, and usability than this relatively simple take on a financial system. Even Workday... and that's an accounting system grafted on top of a HR platform. This is basically yet another product created by a programmer that doesn't actually know enough about the field they're disrupting that they don't even realize that their disruption was obsolete a decade ago. And no, as is this program couldn't be used to run a bodega, let alone an aircraft carrier. reply InMice 4 hours agoparentThis comment doesnt deserve the downvotes its getting. If you ever work in an ERP system you will realize the complexity of tracking cost, inventory management (which is not just simple item, location quantity), purchasing, quotes, lead times, approval processes, BOM data structure, assembly, work orders, sales orders internal/external, etc etc. All these may boil down to basic cost account primitives but making a system that is a ledger then dismissing other solutions and saying you could manage the project of constructing an aircraft carrier make you wonder if the author has ever touched an ERP frontend or back. On top of that there are open source ERP and other smaller companies that make proprietary ERP that do not do some of the things intuit may do draw the ire of some. reply 7952 1 hour agorootparentI agree. Although do you think ERP as a discipline is actually successful in solving these kind of problems? It seems to be a field dogged by underperforming or failed systems. reply minimalist 12 hours agoparentprevPlease elaborate more, my friend! Let's say that I was^W am a programmer who is seduced by the plain-text accounting / one-database-is-all-you-need notion and I think my needs will be simple, as I can keep the business of my bodega all in the RAM of my brain... Or at least I think I can. How can this go wrong? What are some of the needs that compel the bodega owner to move on to more sophisticated tools? Is it because of calculating things like taxes and hourly rates and the like? reply FredPret 5 hours agorootparentImagine it’s the year 1890 at Standard Oil and they have a building full of filing clerks. It’s run by the great John D Rockefeller, of which you can read more in the fantastic biography Titan. He’s a stickler for accurate accounting at all times. Now they decide to buy a batch of barrels for all their oil. - one clerk runs down to the cabinet with a file for all the items SO buys. - another cross-references each item and fetches the files of the vendors for each of those items - another cross-references with past invoices to get the most recent price for each item - another gets a list of locations SO uses to store barrels Now the purchasing manager looks at all this and decides which barrels to buy, from which vendor, how many, and where its getting delivered. So he writes out a purchase order / PO. So back to the clerks: - one runs along to file the PO in the PO filing cabinet. Remember, uncle John is watching and he wants to go to any cabinet or any manager at any time and get up-to-date details of what's going on. - another one goes to the Items cabinet, finds the barrels we ordered, and notes on them that a PO was issued for this many barrels on such and such a date. - one actually sends a copy of the PO to the vendor. Skipping over some steps for simplicity, the barrels arrive one day with their invoice attached. An Invoice! Now the army of clerks swing back into action. They get their guy at the warehouse to send them the original invoice that came stapled to the barrels. Then: - one runs to the PO cabinet, finds the PO that was issued, marks it as done, and writes the invoice number on it. - another one runs to the accounting department. There they make the double-entry bookkeeping entries to account for the money that is now owed to the vendor, and for the inventory value that has gone up. - another one runs to the vendor cabinet and records the purchase on their file - another one goes to the inventory cabinet and files a record updating the inventory balance for the barrel item - someone files a copy of the invoice for future reference Eventually we pay the invoice: - a clerk keeps an eye on the payment terms for this and other vendors and calculates how much cash we have to send to each vendor each month - another runs around to each paid invoice marking them as paid - another one actually writes the cheques and mails them off - someone has to tell the accounting department how much money we just paid, to which vendors, out of which bank accounts Things get fun when these barrels eventually get sent to a production facility and filled with oil. Now the clerks have to do the correct filings to destroy the barrel items along with a quantity of oil, and create a new filled-barrel item. The cost of this depends on all of the cost of the barrel item, the oil, the labour, and some other things, all of which is determined using past entries. This is a toy example and the complexity spirals from here. For example another invoice can arrive from the people who transported the barrels. Depending on your CFO, or the current accounting laws, you might want to include that in the cost of the barrels, or record it as a business expense. You might have different departments who do their accounting separately, so now each transaction has to be split correctly. You might want to track the hourly rates of each employee and factor that into the cost of each finished-barrel item, and also tracking what everybody should get paid. Add to this any idiosyncratic business rules stemming from management decisions, laws, unique physical constraints, or whatever. An ERP system is all of these cabinets and their rules put into a relational database with a front-end. reply minimalist 1 hour agorootparentThank you for the excellent reply! I think I understand now... Once a business starts transacting in things other than a single type of money (say durable goods, consumables, services, or say other types of money) it becomes necessary to reconcile these non-money-denominated accounts. And for that, you need more than a single database, or single spreadsheet. You need a suite of persons or softwares that can __account__ for these stocks and flows, and the rules that come along with them. And that is called ERP, of which \"simple\" money accounting is but one component of. So root commenter's objection was more along the lines of: \"those are some bold claims for mere money-accounting program. if you used a _real_ accounting program (as in an ERP) then you'd understand how complex peoples' needs can be\". And the tone they phrased it elicited the downmods :) I guess I understand. I still admire the OP and the frustration that fueled their desire to create a tool that works for them.

It's like playing AoE with a noob who's refusing to advance to the next age because there will be more units, technologies, and strategies to manage. Most businesses have one accountant, which means this entire profession is one initiative away from not existing at all. There's no excuse for a modern accountant to not know at least SQL. The patterns and practices that I demonstrate in the solution are nothing genius, it just took a while to put it all together, and it's very basic. Just one table with credit/debit columns, rows of which have to be organized into a transaction and linked with user-actions, like creating invoice, receiving payment, adjusting inventory, really anything, including foreign transactions. When the calculator was invented, we didn't get stuck with a bunch of \"calculator-operator\" professions, so why does accounting get to stay stagnant? reply tonyedgecombe 8 hours agorootparentIn the UK with have a concept called a micro entity in the tax code. Micro entities have some fairly strict constraints on them (10 employees or less, turnover under £350,000, no foreign currency transactions and so on). Within those constraints the rules are fairly simple and most importantly HMRC provides online forms for filing your books. I always wondered about starting from those constraints and working back to a basic accounting solution for your typical business person. It would probably cover 90% of the companies in the UK as most of them have really simple requirements.

I know it's not really for businesses applications and really not for accountants but that's how I learnt accounting basics. I find that approach much better as I have total control of the structure. I suspect your application provides a similar level of control as the end company has to implement the details. reply journal 15 hours agorootparentI've thought about separating the journal into a command-line application, where the end result might look exactly like plain text accounting, a sorta like ffmpeg for accounting. Plain text is part of my backup strategy. If plain text are roads, then my approach is rail roads. A strict set of application logic so the operator doesn't get overwhelmed and is capable of managing large number of transactions at higher speeds of entry. Then, it's just a matter of building more rail roads for any additional functionality. Once built, you'd probably never have to touch that code again. reply 7bit 13 hours agorootparentprev> It's like playing AoE with a noob who's refusing to advance to the next age I will steal that, and there's nothing you can do to stop me! reply patrickmay 5 hours agoparentprev> . . . the most aggressive readme ever.

    "originBody": "View image in fullscreen In a Commonwealth Fund report, the US system performed poorly on health equity, access to care and outcomes. Photograph: SDI Productions/Getty Images US news US health system ranks last compared with peer nations, report finds Despite Americans paying nearly double that of other nations, the US fares poorly in list of 10 countries Jessica Glenza Thu 19 Sep 2024 00.01 EDT Share The United States health system ranked dead last in an international comparison of 10 peer nations, according to a new report by the Commonwealth Fund. In spite of Americans paying nearly double that of other countries, the system performed poorly on health equity, access to care and outcomes. “I see the human toll of these shortcomings on a daily basis,” said Dr Joseph Betancourt, the president of the Commonwealth Fund, a foundation with a focus on healthcare research and policy. “I see patients who cannot afford their medications … I see older patients arrive sicker than they should because they spent the majority of their lives uninsured,” said Betancourt. “It’s time we finally build a health system that delivers quality affordable healthcare for all Americans.” However, even as high healthcare prices bite into workers’ paychecks, the economy and inflation dominate voters’ concerns. Neither Kamala Harris nor Donald Trump has proposed major healthcare reforms. The Democratic presidential nominee has largely reframed healthcare as an economic issue, promising medical debt relief while highlighting the Biden administration’s successes, such as Medicare drug price negotiations. The Republican presidential nominee said he has “concepts of a plan” to improve healthcare, but has made no proposals. The conservative policy agenda Project 2025 has largely proposed gutting scientific and public health infrastructure. However, when asked about healthcare issues, voters overwhelmingly ranked cost at the top. The cost of drugs, doctors and insurance are the top issue for Democrats (42%) and Republicans (45%), according to Kaiser Family Foundation health system polling. Americans spend $4.5tn per year on healthcare, or more than $13,000 per person per year on healthcare, according to federal government data. The Commonwealth Fund’s report is the 20th in their “Mirror, Mirror” series, an international comparison of the US health system to nine wealthy democracies including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the UK, Sweden and Switzerland. The foundation calls this year’s report a “portrait of a failing US health system”. The report uses 70 indicators from across five main sectors, including access to care, health equity, care process, administrative efficiency and outcomes. The measures are derived from a survey conducted by Commonwealth as well as publicly available measures from the World Health Organization, OECD and Our World in Data. In all but “care process” – the domain that covers issues such as reconciling medications – the US ranked as the last or penultimate nation. Presenters for Commonwealth noted the US is often “in a class of its own” far below the nearest peer nation. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Headlines US Free newsletter Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said most peer nations cover more of their citizens’ basic needs. “Too many individuals in the US face a lifetime of inequity, it doesn’t have to be this way.” But recommendations to improve the US health system’s standing among peer nations will not be easy to implement. The fund said the US would need to expand insurance coverage and make “meaningful” improvements on the amount of healthcare expenses patients pay themselves; minimize the complexity and variation in insurance plans to improve administrative efficiency; build a viable primary care and public health system; and invest in social wellbeing, rather than thrust problems of social inequity onto the health system. “I don’t expect we will in one fell swoop rewrite the social contract,” said Dr David Blumenthal, the fund’s past president and an author of the report. “The American electorate makes choices about which direction to move in, and that is very much an issue in this election.” Explore more on these topics US news Health Healthcare industry US economy Kamala Harris Donald Trump news Share Reuse this content",

My doctors have all been good (attested to by my parents who are surgeons themselves) but the healthcare system is wonky. One thing I didn't expect is that the Indian system where you just drag your health records around paper copy yourself is superior to US EMR systems - which doctors seem to always have trouble with.

I hope you are aware that these also exist in many EU countries, private clinics aren't banned because of public healthcare, you can purchase private health insurance in many countries, I can't say all because I don't know the intricacies of every country's system since this is a national policy and each member-state is free to run their own systems. Here in Sweden I have private health insurance through my employer, I cannot go directly to a clinic for imaging, etc. since it needs a referral from a doctor but it's quite simple and when I needed I had many choices of private clinics to do a MRI.

Health insurance is mandatory. If you can't afford even the basic level, the government pays for it. The basic level itself covers basically everything from emergency care, hospital stays and gp.

In EU I had to wait 2 months and have doctors referral, and that was lucky window I caught by chance. Other people report waiting much longer. To get to the specialist doctors is also hard in EU, compared to the Ukraine. Here I had to wait between 1 to 3 months to a lot of specialists. And if any mistake in the referral is made, then wait need to be repeated. Example - I got a referral for the retinal diag. But to do it 15 mins before the test eye drops are administered (atropine) to dilate pupils. Apparently I have needed to have two referrals - one for the drops, and another for the diag itself, and I got only the second one (made by an eye doctor in the same clinic, so regular staff). So I have waited months, and was denied the procedure, then a spend a week on a phone and visiting clinics in person to sort this out.

And I don't need a prescription or referral for any medical exams or blood tests; I can order them myself. Asia is like this, but Europe to the north and west of Croatia really isn't. I believe that things in the UK and Germany might be a lot slower and much more restrictive. reply jq-r 8 hours agorootparentWell some relatively common things are easy to get in Croatia (bloodwork and meds - GPs like to prescribe those to get rid of you), more serious like exams, treatments, surgeries are absolutely terrible with waiting lists which are years long. People are dying, and/or their condition worsens before they even see a specialist. This is common knowledge for many years now. Private clinics are opening left and right with the same(!) doctors working in both public and private clinics. Also corruption is rampant allowing doctor's friends to jump lines and that also happens for money/favors. So if you're not rich enough to go to a private clinic your second best option is bribes/corruption/nepotism. And if you don't have the latter, you're frankly fucked. reply A_D_E_P_T 4 hours agorootparentI've lived in the US where my health insurance had like a $6000 deductible and a $1400/month price-tag. (And, by the way, I really didn't appreciate how American doctors would gatekeep drugs, restrict their availability, and add significantly to their cost.) Here, you can walk into any private clinic in Croatia, and arrange for even a fairly complicated surgery, and it'll cost you way less than all that. Your annual medical expense bill won't even come close; a very sick person in Croatia, who does everything in private clinics, pays less (annually) than a perfectly healthy person in the US who never sees the inside of a doctor's office. My wife just gave birth here at an \"expensive\" private clinic, with a private room of her own, and the total price was cheaper than a few months of medical insurance would have cost in the US. Ultimately, private clinics are a damn good thing, because price transparency, price competition, and paying out-of-pocket -- they all serve to keep fees reasonable. If a Croatian clinic tried to charge $100 for an aspirin tablet or a bag of saline, there'd be riots with pitchforks and torches. reply jq-r 23 minutes agorootparentI'm not sure if we're talking here about the same things. You may say: \"oh it's easy to get meds and it's cheap to do X, medical system is great\" while being a medical tourist and/or having a far above average pay, I would accept that. It's great if you have the means. Just like it's great in USA if you're rich, right? But directly comparing two completely different systems and different orders of magnitude of purchasing power and taxes doesn't really paint a good picture of how it's here. For an average citizen the system is terrible and getting worse by the day. The examples are too numerous to mention. I'm also not sure if you think that I'm somehow against private clinics. I'm not. They of course won't compete on medications with public services as that's pointless. What I do find apalling is that doctors are working in both public and private clinics completely legally. Moreover, that practice makes the public services worse by removing the availability of the doctors and makes taxpayers being double charged for the same service. There would be riots with pitchforks if most needed some non-basic (\"take these pills\") medical help. When you're young you probably don't need much. But as you get older you actually might need some procedure or a treatment. But by that time you are actually older, sicker, and there aren't too many of you to actually riot. And many jump the lines by having friends (of friends) working in hospitals.

So losing a Baltic state would be another bitter blow and he probably would want to avoid that as he wants to appear \"strong\". Also, NATO is not just the USA.

It is quite obvious at least since Obama that US strategic interests are reorienting towards Southeast Asia, which is understandable as half of humanity lives there. And even with a friendly administration, it can feasibly happen that there will be more crises unfolding at the same time than the US is capable of efficiently addressing. (Say, Ukraine and Israel and Taiwan.) I wonder how much of a choice the other countries have. Being a European and observing European political patterns, I am very sure that Finland, Sweden, Denmark and most of the former Soviet satellites will continue to support Ukraine because they know what is at stake for them. The UK may as well, given that the dislike between England and Russia goes a long way back. But there are influential people in Germany (and I am not talking about the AfD here, but about the industrial lobby) constantly pushing in the back rooms for reconciliation with Russia at any cost, because high energy costs have made a mess of the German economy, and I can see something like a repeat of the Munich betrayal of 1938 in the future. At this phase of the war, Putin would be open to such an agreement with Germany. Not even his wildest plans foresee a re-subjugation of the former GDR, so Germany risks \"nothing\" (well, a lot of goodwill east of the Oder, but that may be an acceptable tradeoff for the businesspeople).

The French discarded all the credibility gained through their extremely bloody victory in WWI by not helping Czechoslovakia and Poland in 1938-9. Prior to that, France was admired and followed by a dozen countries in Central and Eastern Europe which sought to emulate it. Nowadays, meh. It has been almost 90 years since the moment of French weakness and the trust is still not repaired. Putin himself started a major land war with barely 200 000 soldiers against the second largest country in Europe. Any serious military planner would say that it is not nearly enough to ensure victory, and many people including me in fact considered the whole thing a bluff just by looking at the inadequate numbers. Yet here we are, in precisely the sort of unwinnable war of attrition that is the result of such a bad decision. It may yet end Russia as a power, not directly through the force of arms, but through later destabilization. People are experts on stupid decisions, especially if they feel in a Zugzwang.

The obvious end goal is full privatization once the system becomes defunct enough for that to be sold as a \"tough but necessary\" decision. There is also very blatant lobbying from US healthcare firms in the UK as they would seek to expand into the UK once they no longer have to compete with the NHS. It's effectively self-imposed austerity, which has been demonstrated to produce worse outcomes than investing in public services instead. There's an obvious conflict of interest at play as politicians (in the UK especially thanks to its governmental system) rarely have to rely on these public services as they can easily afford private alternatives. There's also the factor of Western corruption. In Germany for example the health minister during the early pandemic owned a significant stake in several pharmacies while at the same time pushing for and implementing a mask subsidy that created massive profits for pharmacies handing out masks at or below cost. These ties are often legal despite the obvious conflict of interest. reply mytailorisrich 10 hours agoparentprevThose rankings are of course heavily influenced by the methodology and metrics chosen. Differences can be very small but obviously even a very small relative difference results in a higher or lower ranking. That's how rankings work. For instance, in this case: \"The U.K.’s health system is the top one for affordability... In the U.K., the National Health Service (NHS) provides free public health care, including hospital, physician, and mental health care\" This does not mean it is 'better' or that others are in fact unaffordable. For instance, in France a visit to the GP costs 30 Euros but 28 are covered by social security and private cover. Arguably 2 euros make no difference vs. \"free\" but it's just that you can beat \"free\" when ranking on affordability.

And then there were numerous tests, and queues, and... She had a viral brain infection that was, luckily, easy to fix. Could go horribly wrong should they wait for a couple more months. The problem is that GPs are afraid to assign tests other than the most simple blood tests (unless it's an obviously broken bone). Case 2. My wife fainted in the middle of a family dinner. It looked serious, and I recognized the sympthoms thanks to dr. ChatGPT. Our car was at service that day. I was trying to get an ambulance but calling all the publicly available NHS numbers but all we got were endless questioneers.

OTOH, with my highest tier private insurance I had an MRI scans, kidney checks, blood tests all done within a week or two, mostly because of how I had to coordinate things between various private clinics. Not fast, sure, but acceptable. reply archagon 6 hours agorootparentHow much do you pay for your private insurance? reply vkazanov 4 hours agorootparentWasn't me, it's a corporate perk reply mytailorisrich 12 hours agorootparentprevAs soon as you need treatment beyond standard GP/prescriptions, like checks/analyses or specialised consultation/treatment then private insurance comes very handy to get good care quickly. Waiting times are not only for non-essential things. The only thing with no waiting time is A&E if you are in immediate danger of death. The NHS is some \"safety net\" that does the bare minimum at this point, or no longer anything at all (eg. dentistry). Interestingly, nowadays if you have a good job and private insurance in China you get better routine checks than in Europe/UK. Even Chinese hospitals are extremely thorough and quick compared to British ones (at least the main Chinese cities) reply vidarh 12 hours agorootparentI have had extensive rounds of tests for various things with the NHS over the last several years, and never had a problem sufficient to feel private insurance, even as cheap as it is in the UK, to be worth it. I don't doubt it's worth it for some, but there's a reason - and while costs will stop some, costs does not explain nearly all of it, given how cheap it is - that only about 10% of the UK population has private insurance, even with the underfunding of the NHS in recent years (e.g. 20%-30% lower healthcare spend for capita PPP adjusted than comparable economies does have an effect). There's an inflection point, sure, where you start spending enough privately that the insurance is worth it, but so many of these things are so cheap here anyway that the gap from between where it starts to pay off until you're ill enough to get reasonably fast treatment with the NHS is quite narrow. Sometimes people think it is wider than it really is because people want and push for treatments that are not medically indicated. E.g. patients pushing for pointless MRIs is common enough that same-day MRIs is a huge industry here even though they only make an impact on outcomes for very specific symptoms. reply mytailorisrich 10 hours agorootparentPrivate care is still quite affordable on a good salary so I can understand that you feel that private insurance is not worth it, but you were also very lucky with your NHS experience. For instance the UK have very bad outcomes for cancer because things tend to be caught late and treatment delayed thereafter. Frankly, for anything potentially serious or time-sensitive I would go straight private (and in fact the NHS tells you to do that when they ask you if you have private insurance). The NHS has much bigger problems than funding. Even the new, left-wing government has indicated that they won't increase funding without reforms. reply vidarh 10 hours agorootparent> The NHS has much bigger problems than funding. Even the new, left-wing government has indicated that they won't increase funding without reforms. It's always very convenient to starve something of funding for years when you want to insist something needs to be reformed before you can spend as much as it costs to provide service at an adequate quality. Reform or no reform, outcomes won't improve without increasing the funding, as no other system in a comparable country manages to deliver more at the NHS cost level. reply mytailorisrich 10 hours agorootparentThe point is that throwing ever more money at a bottomless pit isn't a solution. Hence there must be changes, not just more money. Another issue is that the NHS is a religion. It is blasphemous to suggest departing from free-of-charge delivery or private involvement (although that's already what we have). Even suggesting \"reform\" is badly received. reply consteval 15 minutes agorootparentThe reason is that private intervention is tricky. The US has a fully private healthcare system, and as you can see from this post, it's shit. I'm from the US so excuse any oversimplifications, but over the past couple decades I've noticed a trend of US-ification in British politics. I would be careful with looking to greener pastures. reply mytailorisrich 2 minutes agorootparentThe thing is that right next to the UK is France, which I know. The French system is based on a mandatory health insurance, now with mandatory private health insurance in addition to that. GPs and most health professionals are private practices that set up shop like a, say, lawyer would and there is big private sector involvement up to hospital level. I think there are many similar examples throughout the world. This is partly why I find this focus on the US system in the UK puzzling. My best guess is that it is used as a scarecrow by those opposed to any changes to the NHS. zjp 13 hours agoparentprevAlso: an unironic 1%-er income in France is like literally the bottom of the barrel Bay Area salary.

Obamacare was basically a trillion dollar giveaway to Big Pharma and Big Healthcare. The only positive thing I can see in it for me personally is that it became possible to buy (extremely expensive) healthcare privately rather than through an employer, and you could not be denied due to pre-existing condition. Don’t get me wrong, that’s significant, but the insurance is now three times the price it was before Obamacare and the actual care is much worse.

Calculating any kind of averages makes little sense.

Legally the systems should be rather uniform within a country though. Many countries have a split between publicly financed and privately paid services. It's probably expected that privately paid services are used less in poorer regions. With the US I am not really familiar. I'd expect commercially and legally it works the same over the whole country. In practice many services won't be offered somewhere in rural areals compared to metropolitan areas.

I know California generally has more regulations and has MediCal, but most insurance options I've encountered seem to be multi-state (regional, not necessarily country-wide though). Things like FSA/HSA are nearly the same across all States I think? I'd assume quality of care varies more by region (likely with some correlation between quality and the to major options health insurance providers) than by state lines.

It's not really \"helping\" because the GOP is so opposed to healthcare reform - which would cut into their corporate profits, and they've somehow persuaded their supporters that Jesus hated healthcare but loved automatic weapons. reply fuckyah 13 hours agoprevI'm sure it has nothing to do with the almost ~100 vaccine doses children are being subjected here... reply consteval 11 minutes agoparentYou're correct, it has nothing to do with that reply ainiriand 10 hours agoparentprevSeriously, fuck off. reply cat_plus_plus 12 hours agoprev [–] Because we are paying for the rest of the world.

While I don't know if that covers all the expenses, I don't think people appreciate how much funding the US system is contributing to new med-tech development. A previous client created some analytics software, they have EU regulatory approvals, but those are almost secondary, without FDA approval they would shutdown. All of their client, except for a few UK customer (who just bundle and resell in the US) all of their clients are in the US. For a lot of smaller medical companies, even in the EU, the US market is their number one source of revenue. I might be wrong, but it's also my impression that if you do have the money, you'll get much more in-depth care and treatment in the US. And it's from this segment many companies find the funding to develop new technology that will only much much later trickle down to public healthcare systems else where in the world. reply armada651 11 hours agoparentprevThere is certainly an argument to be made that the US pays the R&D costs for the rest of the world. Most new drugs end up in public healthcare systems as if the pharmaceutical company is throwing an old product into the discount bin. However some of these new drugs are so expensive that some countries are now refusing to allow certain new cancer drugs on the market. Simply because the exorbitant price compared to the questionable gains in quality of life doesn't make sense anymore. reply shiroiushi 12 hours agoparentprev>Once you have a choice of a hip replacement in Mexico or India This is already being done actually. reply johnchristopher 12 hours agoparentprev> Because we are paying for the rest of the world.

    "originBody": "Community blogsBlog topicsLiked blog postsLichess blog Drawing by Gia - https://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=34624 Post-Mortem of our Longest Downtime Lichess17 Sept 20241,07240,644 viewsEnglish (US) Lichess From 14:54 UTC on the 12th September until 01:33 UTC on the 13th September, Lichess experienced the longest downtime in its history. Surprisingly, this downtime was even longer than that time the datacenter where some of our servers were burned down. We’re a community platform, which is solely funded by our community through small charitable donations — so you, as our beneficiaries and stakeholders, who support us and encourage us — deserve to get clarification on what happened, what we did, and what we’ll do in the future to mitigate this risk again. What happened Essentially, our main server (known as manta) lost connection to our private network at 14:54 UTC. Thibault, our founder and main developer, and Lucas, our charity President and main system administrator, immediately began investigating. Within minutes, they had both attempted our usual failsafes and identified the cause was likely a physical hardware issue in our provider’s (OVH) data centre. After that issue was finally fixed by OVH technicians, a secondary issue cropped up on the same server, this time affecting access to the internet, which could also only be fixed physically by a technician in the data centre. From start to finish, the interventions lasted approximately 10 hours. What we did With Thibault and Lucas trying multiple fixes, the content team also quickly stepped into motion. The downtime was unfortunate, given the Chess Olympiad was in progress and our daily commentary was live with hours left. When it became clear the downtime would be more than a few minutes, they began setting up our commentator, GM Illia Nyzhnyk, to a private sandbox version of Lichess. Illia — streaming for Lichess solo for the first time — handled the situation exceptionally professionally, and continued his excellent commentary almost seamlessly. With our own options quickly exhausted on the technical side, Lucas submitted a support ticket to our provider at 15:33 UTC. There wasn’t much more we could do other than wait for OVH to send a technician to fix the physical issue with our server. Thibault, Lucas, and by now several other developers and systems administrators, were now discussing increasingly outlandish (and exceptionally expensive) ideas to get Lichess temporarily back online. After a follow up on our ticket to OVH, around two hours later, OVH let us know that a network connector had been replaced and the intervention was deemed successful. However, we were then almost immediately hit by an additional issue; now it looked like the other network connector of the server was out of order! We then had to send another support ticket, but with it coming up to 19:00 UTC, or 21:00 in Europe, and without getting further replies from OVH, it seemed our next intervention had been pushed until morning. By now, virtually all of our systems administrators and developers were in the same channel, with over 1,000 messages being sent in the infrastructure channel of our Zulip. Unfortunately, there was once again nothing more we could do other than wait. Coming up to 22:00 UTC, and having heard nothing further from OVH, we assumed the issue likely would only be looked at in the morning. Lucas decided to call it a night (with call alerts set up) an hour later. Thibault stayed up. At 00:41 UTC it seemed action was being taken on the server, judging from the logs and some bumpy restarts. In the end, Lichess was up and stable from 01:25 UTC. What we’ll do in the future We’re in the process of getting further information from OVH to understand which component(s) had to be physically replaced, and why the intervention seemed to take an unusually long time. Beyond that, we are investigating failsafes we can set up for these issues. The issue is not solely with OVH — to some extent, we also should have further failsafes set up. However, these failsafes take a considerable amount of time and expertise to set up, dealing with very sensitive parts of Lichess. With the time and expertise it takes, and on the budget that we have, we must ruthlessly prioritise. While our developers and system administrators are incredibly talented, they are generally part-time volunteers; Lucas has a day job as a system administrator. Another of our sysadmins is a CTO at an innovative big geo startup. Another is in aeronautics for a living. This is not shared to excuse us, but to highlight that the skills and resources we already rely on are often stretched thin, with other obligations — and that these individuals have all contributed their time because they play on Lichess and like the site. FAQ I lost rating points — will these be refunded? Unfortunately, any rating lost will not be refunded. We appreciate this is unfortunate, but technically it is very difficult to be able to refund rating after such a crash. On the bright side, rating is not a currency, it automatically adjusts to your skill. It will return to normal after just a few more rated games. I’ve only been getting games as white / black. Is that connected to the crash? We recently made a change where players can no longer choose to play as black or white in all games except for direct challenges. Some players have a debt to a certain colour, to rebalance the games they owe with that colour. These issues are not linked. However, we will be adding a small change so that the rebalancing will be more gradual, and not 20+ games of one colour in a row.

I really appreciate the benefits package for patrons. Thibault is zee best. reply theideaofcoffee 3 hours agoprevI guess some of my questions are addressed in the latter half of the post, but I'm still puzzled why a prominent service didn't have a plan for what looked like a run of the mill hardware outage. It's hard to know exactly what happened as I'm having trouble parsing some of the post (what is a 'network connector'? is it a cable? nic?). What were some of the 'increasingly outlandish' workarounds? Are they actually standing up production hosts manually, and was that the cause of a delay or unwillingness to get new hardware goin? I think it would be important to have all of that set down either in documentation or code seeing as most of their technical staff are either volunteers, who may come and go, or part timers. Maybe they did, it's not clear. It's also weird seeing that they are still waiting on their provider to tell them exactly what was done to the hardware to get it going again, that's usually one of the first things a tech mentions: \"ok, we replaced the optics in port 1\" or \"I replaced that cable after seeing increased error rates\", something like that. reply holsta 6 hours agoprevThis response and post-mortem is superior to most commercial services I have seen in recent years. reply hyperbovine 4 hours agoparentThat's basically every aspect of their service.

Also note in the first few paragraphs they acknowledge the worst impacts to users. That's very selfless - often corporate postmortems downplay the impact, which frustrates users more. Incidentally, a critical service I use (Postmark) had an outage this week and I didn't even hear from them (I found out via a random twitter post). Shows the difference. reply CSMastermind 4 hours agorootparentPresumably because Lichess is free thus doesn't have contractual obligations and SLAs that they'll be sued for breaching. reply redbell 4 hours agoparentprev> so you, as our beneficiaries and stakeholders, who support us and encourage us — deserve to get clarification on what happened Is it that complicated for big tech to reply politely with the above statement when they suddenly disable your account for no obvious reason! reply mewpmewp2 4 hours agorootparentIt may not be complicated, but it does require caring about what you do and your customers as opposed to going through basic minimum requirements to appear that you are doing something. It is much more difficult for corporate cogs to have that level of care compared to someone who does their things with passion. reply morgante 3 hours agoparentprevThe post-mortem is honest, but the infrastructure is well below what I'd expect from commercial services. If a commercial provider told me they're dependent on a single physical server, with no real path or plans to fail over to another server if they need to, I would consider it extremely negligent. It's fine to not use big cloud providers, but frankly it's pretty incompetent to not have the ability to quickly deploy to a new server. reply lukhas 29 minutes agorootparentWe're an understaffed charity. reply morgante 21 minutes agorootparentYeah I'm not criticizing it as a charity, just pointing out this definitely isn't \"superior to most commercial services.\" That being said, removing dependence on single hardware nodes isn't something you need a big team for. I've done failover at 1-person startups. reply KolmogorovComp 28 minutes agorootparentprevAnd yet even Meta recently had a multiple hours downtime, despite a budget thousands if not million times higher. Would you call them negligent too? By increasing the complexity you multiply the failure points and increase ongoing maintenance, which is the bottleneck (even more than money) for volunteer-driven projects. reply morgante 18 minutes agorootparentTo be clear, you don't need to make it more complex / failure-prone. I didn't say failover needs to be automated. Kubernetes or complex cloud services are not required to have some basic deployment automation. You can do it with a simple bash script if you need to. It's just pretty surprising to see the reaction to a hardware failure being to wait around for it to be repaired instead of simply spinning up a new host. reply ctippett 4 hours agoprevOnce the private link was reestablished, could they not have tunneled out to the internet via another server acting as a sort of gateway?

    "title": "Forbes Marketplace: The Parasite SEO Company Trying to Devour Its Host",
    "originLink": "https://larslofgren.com/forbes-marketplace/",
    "originBody": "Are you sick of Forbes appearing in search results? For topics that Forbes doesn’t have any expertise in? Here’s the organic rankings for “best pet insurance”: Forbes ranks #2. Not sure a business website knows how pet insurance actually works. But okay. They also have the #1 ranking for best cbd gummies: Because it’s a marijuana category, PPC ads don’t show for that search term at all. I bet the traffic and click through rate is unreal. Forbes also has a another post ranking at #4 for the same keyword. They might be making over $100K/month just off these two blog posts. I’ve made that much off a single post that ranked #1 for a major product term. Since the normal ads don’t show, this might be one of the most lucrative affiliate terms on all of Google. It’s definitely up there. Let’s do one more. Here’s Forbes ranking #2 for “how to get rid of roaches:” And right at the top of their cockroach post, a juicy ad: A highly ranked “how to” post can make just as much money as a “best of” post if you cram an ad into it. Done that plenty of times myself. So. Does anybody think Forbes is the best authority on pet insurance, CBD gummies, and cockroach infestations? I sure as fuck don’t. The Rise of Forbes in Google – Parasite SEO Perfected None of these Google rankings are an accident. And I’m not cherry picking a few high ranking posts. Forbes completely dominates Google today. In 2020, a completely different company from Forbes partnered with Forbes to run their SEO affiliate business. They created a new company, made it look like it’s part of Forbes (it’s not), and then went to town exploiting every last corner of Google. They refer to themselves as Forbes Advisor publicly but the official entity is Forbes Marketplace. In fact, this Forbes affiliate frankenstein has gotten so big and so successful that I found claims that Forbes Marketplace is trying to buy the actual Forbes company. More on this later. Forbes Marketplace runs a few sections of the Forbes website. Here’s the traffic for forbes.com/advisor/: From nothing to over 20 millions search visits per MONTH in less than 4 years. Holy shit is that some serious SEO growth. This was the first section of the Forbes website that they began operating. This isn’t the only section of Forbes.com that this company runs. They also manage forbes.com/home-improvement/: And they manage forbes.com/health/: To recap the current search traffic controlled by Forbes Marketplace: Forbes Advisor = 20.6 million search visits/month Forbes Home Improvement = 2.9 million search visits/month Forbes Health = 3.8 million search visits/month Total = 27.3 million search visits/month For context, Nerdwallet gets 14 million search visits/month across its entire site. Forbes Marketplace is almost twice the size of Nerdwallet already. Nerdwallet was founded in 2009, it took them 15 years to get as big as they are. Forbes Marketplace basically 2X’d their size in a third of the time. I’m using Ahrefs data which is never perfectly accurate but the overall scale will be close. The crazy part: Forbes Marketplace isn’t going to stop there. They’ve ALSO been working on Forbes Betting for the last two years, it’s already at 455K search visits per month: And there’s an open role in their careers section for an SEO Strategist, Sports Betting right now: They want to create “the #1 organic site for all things related to the NFL, NBA, MLB, MLS, and much more.” You know who I think of when I think of professional sports? Not fucking Forbes. Forbes Marketplace is the single largest (and most successful) parasite SEO program of all time. And it’s just getting started. I firmly believe that Forbes Marketplace is going to go after EVERY affiliate category unless Google stops them. I wouldn’t be surprised if Forbes starts pushing Viagra content soon. Who is Forbes Marketplace? Untangling Who Manages the Forbes Affiliate Program You’d think that the Forbes company is publishing this content and taking all the cash. They’re not. Actually, the players involved have taken steps to obscure who’s actually running the show. It’s a completely different company, Forbes Marketplace. And while Forbes Marketplace is positioned as a subsidiary of Forbes, Forbes only owns a minority stake. Now, I’m really going to get into the weeds for the rest of this post. We’re going to dig through SEC filings, business registrations, and some notes from a scorned founder. This might seem tedious. But when a single company dominates Google to the extent that millions of Americans are pushed to buy their recommended products every month, I think it’s important to know who’s calling the shots. At the end, I’ll tell you who the key players are for the Forbes affiliate program. It’s also a world-class case study on how to set up an affiliate parasite program to rake in hundreds of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. In fact, the affiliate program is SO successful that the folks running Forbes Marketplace are trying to buy Forbes in its entirety. It’s nuts. Let’s head down the rabbit hole. If you dig around the affiliate content on Forbes, you’ll end up on Forbes Advisor: Forbes Advisor is used in two ways which can make this confusing. Forbes Advisor is the B2B, finance, and insurance affiliate category on the Forbes website. This is where the team started. As they expanded, Forbes Advisor got co-opted as the brand they operate under for all the affiliate content on Forbes. Now Forbes Advisor is also the public team that all the other affiliate categories operate under (like Health and Home Improvement). When Forbes publicly refers to its affiliate content, it uses Forbes Advisor to describe all of it. Digging deeper, this is how the Forbes Advisor team presents itself: If you check the other affiliate categories on Forbes, Katie Doyle is always listed at the top as the SVP of Content. Then the content team dedicated to that category. But as anyone in the affiliate game knows, content is only one piece of the business. You’ll need tons of folks in revenue management, link building, tech, and company operations. Where are those people? And where’s the CEO along with the rest of the leadership team? There are tons of open roles across Delaware, India, Israel, and London: Again, someone might assume that all this other stuff is managed by Forbes itself. Again, it’s not. All of this is a completely separate company. The first time I realized that Forbes Advisor is basically a public front is when I checked the Forbes Advisor privacy policy. It references an organization called Forbes Marketplace Holdings Limited: Looking for information on Forbes Marketplace will bring up this SEC filing which has a few mentions of Forbes Marketplace. Here’s how it’s described: Yup, an affiliate content business going after every content category that it can. There’s a few other really interesting facts in that SEC filing. Forbes Marketplace did $22 million in annual revenue from Jan 2021 to Sep 2021: Making a projection for Q4, we can confidently say that Forbes Marketplace did at LEAST $29 million in revenue for all of 2021. Traffic was in a big upswing during this period so I’m confident that revenue grew even faster than the pace set for the first 9 months of 2021. Forbes Marketplace EBITDA was $6.7 million from Jan 2021 to Sep 2021: They were already rolling in cash in 2021 and they had barely gotten started. Forbes Marketplace was officially launched in Sept 2019: Now for the good stuff. Forbes purchased $1,757,000 worth of equity in Forbes Marketplace Holdings Limited: Oooooh man. That “See Note 4” sure does look tasty. What does it say? Here it is in full: All the good shit is always buried in the notes. This tells us EXACTLY what’s going on. I’ll recap: Forbes officially granted Forbes Marketplace the right to use its trademark. Forbes has one seat on the Board of Directors of Forbes Marketplace. The majority shareholder of Forbes ALSO invested in Forbes Marketplace and also got a board seat. Overall, Forbes controls two board seats of Forbes Marketplace. Forbes initially owned 20% of Forbes Marketplace but purchased additional shares from the majority Forbes shareholder, bringing the total ownership to 39.53% after some share dilution. In this filing, Forbes claims they control Forbes Marketplace through its two board seats. Maybe those two board members exert a lot of control. But in my personal experience, boards are pretty damn passive. It’s the founders with board seats that drive everything. As we’ll see below, there are multiple individuals that are major players and I’d bet good money they have board seats. I’d be shocked if Forbes has majority control via the board. It’s safe to say that Forbes has a minority interest in both shares and board control of Forbes Marketplace. The Company Behind Forbes Marketplace: Marketplace Platforms Limited Who controls Forbes Marketplace? We’ve already established that it’s not Forbes. Forbes only controls 40%. So who is it? Searching for Forbes Marketplace brings you to a company called Marketplace: Going to the team section shows who’s actually running the show: Hey! It’s our good friend Katie Doyle! And we have the CEO: Ash Rahimi. Anytime you see a bullshit listing of Forbes in Google, you can blame Ash Rahimi. Let’s keep going. Diving into the Marketplace company eventually leads you to a London-based company that’s officially called Marketplace Platforms Limited: Quick tangent, Marketplace Platforms Limited used to be called Forbes Marketplace Operations Limited: Definitely the right company. Now for why we dug this far. There are two people that are listed as the Registered Officers of Marketplace Platforms Limited: There was a third officer (Achir Kalra) but they resigned in May 2023. Tom Callahan and Chris Thermistocleous are the two current officers. Turns out both of them also have roles at Marketplace: But the real story comes from that resigned officer: Achir Kalra. The Scorned Founder: Achir Kalra On a lark, I looked around for Achir Kalra to figure out why someone would resign from Forbes Marketplace. These folks are printing cash so fast you’d need a fleet of dump trucks to move it all. Why would someone bail? So I found his LinkedIn page. It just so happened that I found his LinkedIn at the exact perfect moment. Recently, Achir Kalra left Forbes Marketplace/Marketplace Platforms Limited. From what I’ve seen, the transition has been contentious. Achir shared a bunch of screenshots of a text message conversation he was having with a reporter from a major news publication. Achir posted screenshots of tons of text messages straight to his LinkedIn profile. He has since deleted them. I grabbed them all before they were taken down. Now, I’m not going to share them all. There’s a bunch of allegations and I’m not going to wade into the fight between Achir and the Forbes Marketplace team. But I’m going to share one where Achir breaks down his timeline and the key players of Forbes Marketplace: There’s a couple of key facts worth highlighting: Achir Kalra was involved in the founding of Forbes Marketplace, he worked at Forbes before then. Sounds like he brought a bunch of the key players together when all this started. At this point, he’e no longer involved. I assume TC is Tom Callahan, the current CFO of Marketplace Holdings/Forbes Marketplace. He’s also a major investor in Forbes Marketplace. Namit is Namit Merchant, the former COO of Media.net. Media.net was acquired by a Chinese tech company for $900 million in 2016 in an all cash deal. I believe Shaifali is Shaifali Sharma. There’s a company registration for Forbes Technologies India Private Limited where Shaifali and Achir are both listed as directors. Achir did mention a divorce in his texts so I assume they’re no longer married. Definitely looks like these non-Forbes folks have majority control. These are the folks that control Forbes Marketplace. And the biggest reveal of them all: Forbes Marketplace bids to buy Forbes in 2024. The Forbes affiliate program has become so successful that it might gobble up Forbes itself. Does that sound like Forbes is running the show? I’m not sure what the management dispute refers to. It could refer to the situation with Achir or it could be an entirely different controversy. How Much Money Does Forbes Marketplace Make? I’m going to walk you through my rough revenue estimate for Forbes Marketplace. My estimate is definitely going to be off, I’ve had to make too many assumptions. But it’ll be in the ballpark. And the revenue is crazy enough that just getting the right number of digits is eye opening. Forbes has stated that Forbes Marketplace earned $22 million in revenue from Jan 2021 to Sep 2021. Multiplying by a third gives us an estimate of $29 million for all of 2021. Again, traffic was on a huge upswing during this period so I’m extremely confident that $29M is a conservative estimate for 2021. Now let’s get a traffic estimate for 2021. Forbes Advisor started the 2021 with about 1.2M searches per month. And ended 2021 with about 4.6M searches per month. Let’s split the two and get a very rough average for the year: 2.9M searches per month. Forbes Home Improvement can be ignored, it didn’t have any traffic in 2021. Forbes Betting can also be ignored, it didn’t start until around July 2021. Forbes Health did start around May 2021 and was earning 770K in monthly searches by the end of 2021. Let’s add another 500K in monthly searches for this. This overestimates the traffic in 2021 and will help make our final revenue estimate more conservative. So we have $29M in annual revenue on an average of 3.4M searches per month in 2021. Now for the current search traffic volume: Forbes Advisor = 20.6 search visits/month Forbes Home Improvement = 2.9 million search visits/month Forbes Health = 3.8 million search visits/month Forbes Betting = 400K searches/month Total affiliate traffic is currently about 27.7M searches per month. If Forbes revenue has scaled proportionally with traffic, revenue will have also grown to $236M in annual revenue. I actually believe the real revenue is a lot higher than this: As search rankings improve, the value of each visitor increases. You get a larger percentage of buyers at rank #1 than you do at rank #5. When traffic grows, ALL your metrics improve (conversions, click-through rates, value per click, etc). Revenue is always higher than you expect once you go through a major traffic growth spurt. When you have a ton of traffic, you can squeeze your advertisers for higher commissions. A company might start out by paying you $200 for each new customer but when you have a ton of traffic, you can get $400 per customer from them. Doubling payouts from partners is very common. I almost missed the Forbes Betting affiliate site. And I know their team is going after other categories (like travel, automotive, and real estate). I have probably missed a few other categories that are starting to get traction and generate their own revenue. My gut instinct estimate is that Forbes is doing $300-400M in annual revenue right now. And I’m extremely confident that they’re in the 9 digits. No wonder they’re trying to buy all of Forbes. Why Is Parasite SEO Even a Problem? Parasite SEO is when a company abuses the domain of another company. They set up a subfolder or subdomain, then post a ton of content trying to rank on Google. Wow does that sound exactly like Forbes Marketplace. Well, Google itself has said it’s a problem: That’s a screenshot from Google’s own spam policies. The key part: “third-party pages are published with little or no first-party oversight or involvement.” I would classify Forbes Marketplace as a third-party. It’s a separate business and Forbes only owns 40% of it. As for oversight, Forbes only has 2 board seats. And really it only has one. It claims it has a second but that’s just the majority shareholder of Forbes. That individual is looking out for their own interests, not Forbes. But fine, we’ll call it 2 board seats. I count at least 3 other major investors in Forbes Marketplace: Tom Callahan, Namit Merchant, and Shaifali Sharma. Plus the CEO usually gets a board seat (Ash Rahimi). So we have 3-4 other board seats that Forbes does not control. Do any of these folks have backgrounds at Forbes? Nope. The one person that worked at Forbes previously was Achir Kalra and he has since left Forbes Marketplace. Not a whole lot of Forbes DNA in Forbes Marketplace. To top it off, Forbes Marketplace has gotten so big and powerful that it’s trying to buy all of Forbes. Would that happen if Forbes was actually in control? To me, Forbes Marketplace looks like a completely different company where Forbes is a minority shareholder. I’d also argue that the Forbes affiliate content is “independent of a host site’s main purpose or produced without close oversight”: All the affiliate sites are set up in subfolders with completely different infrastructure. It’s clear that Forbes Marketplace is using its own section of forbes.com to do whatever it wants. Forbes Marketplace has pushed HARD into health, home improvement, and sports betting. How in the fuck is that related to the core website of business? When you’re making this much money, you stop asking questions. There’s no way that the Forbes editorial team is putting the breaks on anything when there’s hundreds of millions to be made every year. Forbes Marketplace is deliberating obfuscating who’s running the show by using the Forbes Advisor brand. It requires real digging to figure out who’s actually running the affiliate program. This was deliberate. But maybe the Forbes Marketplace team is doing the right thing on their own? Real experts and great content? Are any of us naive enough to believe that Forbes Marketplace has gone from nothing to 27.7M searches per month in less than 5 years while also having the expertise to truly help people across such diverse topics as credit cards, roaches, CBD gummies, and sports betting? It took Nerdwallet 15 years to do that in one category. We’re supposed to believe that Forbes can do it in at least 4 categories within 5 years? There’s no feasible way to build a team with genuine expertise that fast. No way in hell. Forbes Marketplace is a Google heist of the highest order. It’s generic, thin content with a single goal: rank to generate affiliate revenue. And Google has lapped their shit up. Even Forbes Itself Can’t Be Trusted Maybe you think I’m being too cynical. Maybe Forbes does have oversight of all the affiliate stuff. But can we even trust Forbes itself? Forbes was caught spoofing ad inventory. They created a new domain (www3.forbes.com), republished articles from Forbes.com, and then increased the ads in each article from 7sh to 150. And they billed their advertisers for it. Then a bunch of agencies unknowingly bought ads from this shit alternate site for their own clients. This went on for YEARS and they didn’t take down the spam domain until AFTER they were caught. It was theft via ad spend. Plain and simple. This, my faithful reader, is the lauded company that Google has decided to trust above all other companies. The Real Villain: Google I don’t wish any ill will towards the Forbes Marketplace team. The SEO in me respects what they’ve done. They partnered with the ideal domain, then caught a massive boom in Google as Google rolled out an extinction-level event in the SEO world while boosting massive media sites above all others (along with Reddit). And Forbes Marketplace executed perfectly. At scale. Perfect execution and a once-in-a-lifetime lucky break. I’m impressed. Even a little jealous. And at the end of the day, all their employees are just doing their jobs. But holy fuck do I have a grudge with Google. Google has decided that Forbes is the authority in everything. Credit cards, cockroach removal, and getting too high from gummies. Forbes is now the dominant authority in damn near everything. And that is fucking absurd. This is not a simple mistake at this point. This was absurd back in 2022. I watch a ton of B2B search terms closely and that’s when Forbes started appearing EVERYwhere. At the time, I thought to myself: “alright, this is getting out of hand, Google has to pair this back a bit.” Since then, Forbes Marketplace has rolled out entire divisions to dominate the health, home, and sports categories in Google. With plans to keep going. And they’re winning. They’ll keep winning until Google gets off their ass. I know a lot of folks in the SEO industry. Not one person thinks this is normal or okay. I even heard from a source that I deeply trust that Google employees were complaining about Forbes internally. That was two years ago. Since then? Not a goddamn thing has changed. Instead Google continues to unleash their HCU algorithm to nuke niche and small publishers. The worst part about this? I suspect that all this insanity isn’t even a deliberate decision by Google. I believe the search ranking has gotten away from them. That Google isn’t in control of their own rankings or algorithms anymore. Too many subpar leaders in positions with way too much power, way too much complexity in the SERPs, and AI as a massive distraction for the entire search team. It’s a perfect recipe for shipping shit. And now we all have to wade through that shit every day. Meet the Author Lars Lofgren Lars is the Chief Growth Officer and Co-founder of Stone Press.

HowStuffWorks, About.com (now like 10 different domains), many IAC acquired properties, RedVenture sites, even random sites like LiveStrong.com will be wildly prominent when the domains historically aren't relevant or authoritative for a given niche. Even recently, sites like CNN were using subdomains with affiliate offers managed by third parties(1). These sites weren't being de-ranked algorithmically-- someone at Google would have to apply a manual action to remove them from the SERPs. What incentive would there be to do so if a prior agreement was in place? Google doesn't really care about discoverability for smaller domains that may have good content. They are either being risk averse (avoiding potential spammers, junk AI content) by favoring trusted domains, favoring brands who are likely to spend on display or search ads, or maybe a combination of these. 1) https://searchengineland.com/google-begins-enforcement-of-si... reply graeme 5 hours agoprevVery good article.

Pretty much every single large company is actively being ruined by parasites. We're dealing with a generation of CEOs / CFOs who were taught to care about nothing except short-term shareholder value. Quality and reputation doesn't matter anymore, so you replace your products with cheap garbage and hope nobody notices. When that inevitably fails, every single part of the company including its name is being torn apart and sold piece by piece, until nothing is left but an empty shell with a lot of debt. We're intentionally ruining our economies and praising the people doing it.

Like 2006ish. It was after Katrina, I'd never had a full time dev job, and I created it as a POC to show to my employer that they could invest in me full time as a developer (I was helping put their magazines together when I wasn't working on their CRM). I created a marketplace with finely tuned SEO for my employer to advertise (and charge) companies in niche industries. My SEO was better than the SEO of the developers who worked on their sites, and our audience was obviously much larger than theirs, so we ranked higher. Any time you would search for the company name or the product type in a certain geographic area, you'd find links to our pages dominating the search results.
