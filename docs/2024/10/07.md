## [How do HTTP servers figure out Content-Length?](https://aarol.dev/posts/go-contentlength/)

- In Go's http package, the Content-Length is automatically set for responses that fit into a single buffer, while larger responses use "chunked transfer encoding" to send data in chunks without knowing the total size.
- Chunked transfer encoding is efficient for transferring data of unknown lengths and is supported by HTTP 1.1, with each chunk prefixed by its size in hexadecimal.
- HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 use different streaming mechanisms and do not support chunked encoding, but the Go http.ResponseWriter interface simplifies handling headers and content type.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41762468)

- HTTP servers determine Content-Length through explicit definition, single write operations, or manual chunking, which can be complex for developers.
- Incorrect Content-Length can cause issues such as browser errors or hanging, especially when compression alters content size.
- Chunked transfer encoding is beneficial for streaming large or unknown-sized responses but poses implementation challenges across various HTTP stacks.
