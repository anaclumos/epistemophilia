## [What is the history of the use of "foo" and "bar" in source code examples? (2012)](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/69788/what-is-the-history-of-the-use-of-foo-and-bar-in-source-code-examples)

- "Foo" and "bar" are commonly used placeholders in programming, originating from the military acronym FUBAR, and have been part of programming culture since early computing days at MIT and DEC.
- These terms are used to represent unknown values in code examples, helping programmers focus on concepts rather than specific content.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41752436)

- The terms "foo" and "bar" used in programming examples originated in the 1960s at MIT's AI Lab, likely derived from the military slang "FUBAR" (Fouled Up Beyond All Recognition).
- Initially used as placeholder function names, "foo" and "bar" serve a similar purpose to "X" and "Y" in algebra, representing generic variables or functions without specific meaning.
- The evolution from "fu" to "foo" may have been influenced by the increasing presence of women in academia, as "foo" was considered less vulgar.

## [ByteDance is abusing the free video downloading service Cobalt for mass scraping](https://twitter.com/uwukko/status/1842538843720868016)

- A significant increase in traffic to the Cobalt API was observed, resembling a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
- The source of the traffic was identified as Bytedance, but the specific videos or original request sources remain unidentified due to bypassed limiters.
- Despite the inability to pinpoint exact sources, a discernible pattern in the traffic was noted.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41756209)

- ByteDance is accused of using the free video downloading service Cobalt for large-scale data scraping, potentially linked to their AI video generation projects.
- The activity might be associated with BytePlus, ByteDance's cloud service, which could be used by other companies, though the high cost and sales contact requirement suggest otherwise.
- The situation underscores the tension between data scraping practices and the terms of use set by service providers, as Cobalt criticizes ByteDance for bypassing protections while doing the same with YouTube.

## [Router Security](https://routersecurity.org/)

- The Router Security Website by Michael Horowitz offers a detailed guide on improving router security through configuration changes and selecting secure routers.- Key recommendations include changing default passwords, disabling features like WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) and UPnP (Universal Plug and Play), and keeping firmware updated.- The site is ad-free, prioritizes user privacy, and provides resources and tests for ensuring router safety, emphasizing the importance of ongoing maintenance and detecting hacked routers.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41752327)

- The debate on router security focuses on whether disabling ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) and IPv6 is necessary, with many suggesting that modern routers with firewalls can manage these safely.
- IPv6 is gaining importance as ISPs (Internet Service Providers) adopt address-conserving methods like CGNAT (Carrier-Grade Network Address Translation), making its use more relevant.
- The consensus emphasizes maintaining updated routers and proper firewall configurations over disabling ICMP or IPv6, as disabling ICMP can impede network diagnostics and Path MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) discovery.
