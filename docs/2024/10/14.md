## [CRLF is obsolete and should be abolished](https://fossil-scm.org/home/ext/crlf-harmful.md)

- CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed) line endings are considered outdated, originating from mechanical teletypes, and are seen as unnecessary in modern systems where a single NL (New Line, U+000a) is preferred.
- Although a proposal to eliminate CRLF was withdrawn, the initiative highlighted and resolved various software issues, emphasizing the need for systems to adapt to using only NL.
- The post advocates for the cessation of CRLF usage, encouraging developers to update software that still requires CR before NL and to adopt the term "newline" for U+000a.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41830717)

- CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed) is considered outdated by some, but updating legacy protocols like HTTP, SMTP, and CSV to use only NL (New Line) could lead to bugs.- While newer protocols might avoid using CRLF, changing existing ones is not deemed advantageous due to potential compatibility issues.- The discussion underscores the tension between simplifying protocols and ensuring adherence to standards to prevent security vulnerabilities.

- Cloudflare's Durable Object platform now incorporates a full relational system using SQLite, optimizing it for real-time collaborative applications by colocating application logic with data for enhanced performance.
- The platform operates each Durable Object on a single thread, with the ability to create more objects to manage increased traffic, exemplified by a flight booking system assigning each flight a dedicated Durable Object with its own SQLite database.
- A Storage Relay Service ensures durability by streaming Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) entries to object storage and replicating writes across data centers, with a JavaScript API designed for fast, single-threaded operations.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41832547)

- Zero-latency SQLite storage in Durable Objects offers efficient data handling with features like auto-batching writes and no read transactions, but is limited to 128MB RAM per runtime instance.
- Durable Objects are globally unique, ensuring consistency by operating on a single instance, making them suitable for multiplayer applications but potentially unsuitable for high-traffic or complex analysis needs.
- Key concerns include handling schema migrations and the reliance on a single cloud provider, with additional features like auto RPC for communication and hibernating Websockets without cost.

## [Counterintuitive Properties of High Dimensional Space (2018)](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/highd/)

- In higher dimensions, objects like cubes and spheres exhibit properties that defy our three-dimensional intuition, such as the inner sphere's radius extending beyond the cube.
- The volume of a unit ùëë-sphere decreases with increasing dimensions, and most of the sphere's surface area is concentrated near the equator.
- The "kissing number," or the maximum number of spheres that can touch another without overlapping, is precisely known in only a few dimensions, with solutions in eight and twenty-four dimensions using special lattice structures.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41831617)

- High-dimensional spaces exhibit counterintuitive properties, such as the decreasing volume of a unit sphere as dimensions increase, which challenges our understanding due to differing units across dimensions.
- In high dimensions, the volume of a sphere relative to its bounding cube decreases, which aligns with the concept of adding dimensions and is significant for understanding spatial relationships.
- High-dimensional spaces enable near-orthogonality, a critical concept in machine learning, allowing many directions to be sufficiently orthogonal, which is essential for algorithms and data analysis.

## [Why does FM sound better than AM?](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2024/10/13/why-does-fm-sound-better-than-am/)

- FM radio is superior to AM radio in terms of sound quality because it is less susceptible to noise interference.- FM operates by varying frequency, whereas AM varies amplitude, making FM less affected by noise, which primarily impacts amplitude.- Edwin Howard Armstrong, the inventor of FM, anticipated that FM would reduce noise, a significant advantage over AM systems that struggle to eliminate noise without message loss.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41832302)

- FM radio offers superior audio fidelity compared to AM due to its higher bandwidth, with channels spaced 200 kHz apart versus AM's 9 kHz.
- FM is less prone to noise interference because it encodes information through frequency variations, making it more resistant to static and amplitude-based noise.
- The higher frequency band of FM avoids low-frequency noise, such as that from thunderstorms, resulting in clearer sound quality, particularly for music.
