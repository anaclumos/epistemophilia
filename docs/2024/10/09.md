## [On the Nature of Time](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2024/10/on-the-nature-of-time/)

- The post explores the computational view of time, suggesting that time is the universe's ongoing computation, and due to computational irreducibility, we cannot predict the future or "jump ahead" in time.
- It discusses how our perception of time as linear is due to our computational limits, while fundamentally, time may be multithreaded, and our experience is shaped by our bounded exploration of the ruliad, a concept representing the entangled limit of all computations.
- The conclusion challenges traditional concepts like time travel, aligning the computational view of time with the Second Law of thermodynamics, which states that entropy, or disorder, tends to increase over time.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41782534)

- Stephen Wolfram and Julian Barbour propose that time is an emergent property, suggesting a universe that is fundamentally timeless and contains all possible states.
- Barbour's perspective is that time emerges from static geometric relationships, whereas Wolfram attributes it to our computational limitations within a timeless computational framework.
- While both theorists agree on a timeless foundation for reality, Wolfram's ideas are often viewed as speculative and philosophical, lacking empirical support, and relate to concepts like eternalism and block universe theories.

- There is interest in addition-based architectures for neural networks to further reduce energy costs, though concerns about practicality and accuracy compared to IEEE 754 floating-point standards remain.
- The debate includes trade-offs between precision and performance in various computing environments, with speculation on how major companies like Nvidia might influence AI research directions, potentially limiting exploration of efficient computational methods.

## [Practices of Reliable Software Design](https://entropicthoughts.com/practices-of-reliable-software-design)

- "Practices of Reliable Software Design" by kqr presents eight essential practices for developing reliable software, focusing on creating a fast, in-memory cache.- Key practices include using off-the-shelf solutions like Redis, prioritizing cost and reliability over features, and deploying minimal features quickly to learn what is necessary.- Additional practices involve using simple data structures, reserving resources early, setting maximums to prevent performance issues, making testing easy, and embedding performance counters to track system behavior.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41781777)

- Redundancy, or having multiple independent paths to success, is crucial for building reliable software systems, as demonstrated by systems like Google Search and RAID 5.- While redundancy enhances reliability, it can also introduce complexity and inefficiency, particularly in modern systems where failures often result from interactions between components rather than individual component failures.- Balancing efficiency and reliability is essential, with real-world examples showing that over-optimization can lead to system brittleness; thus, using well-understood, simple subsystems and regular maintenance is key to achieving reliability.

## [Don't let dicts spoil your code](https://roman.pt/posts/dont-let-dicts-spoil-your-code/)

- Dictionaries (dicts) in Python are mutable and opaque, which can complicate code maintenance and extension.- It is recommended to convert dicts into structured data models using tools like dataclasses or Pydantic for better code management.- For legacy code, TypedDicts can be used to add structure, and Mapping annotations are suggested for key-value stores to prevent technical debt.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41781855)

- The post emphasizes using value objects, such as dataclasses, for handling data early in the development process to ensure clear data definitions and avoid optional fields.- It suggests that while dictionaries are useful for dynamic data, overusing them can lead to messy code, and structured types should be used for known data to improve code clarity and reduce bugs.- Python provides tools like dataclasses, TypedDict, and Pydantic to facilitate better data handling, promoting clean and efficient code.

- MakeMKV is a related tool that converts Blu-ray Discs (BD) and DVDs to MKV files, offering a command-line interface (CLI) for automation, though some users prefer MP4 for broader compatibility.
- Discussions around LibreDrive and MakeMKV include challenges with Digital Rights Management (DRM) and region restrictions, with users finding workarounds, while legal concerns about DMCA violations persist.

## [PEP 760: No more bare excepts](https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-760-no-more-bare-excepts/67182)

- PEP 760, proposed by Pablo Galindo Salgado and Brett Cannon, suggests disallowing bare `except:` clauses in Python to enhance error handling precision.- The proposal aims to prevent broad exception handling that can obscure significant errors by mandating explicit exception types.- The PEP encourages developers to adopt more precise error handling practices, with further details available on deprecation, tooling, and rejected ideas.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41788026)

- PEP 760 proposes to disallow bare `except:` clauses in Python, which currently catch all exceptions, including critical ones like system exits and keyboard interrupts.
- Critics argue that this change could break existing code, requiring users to upgrade or patch dependencies, which may be burdensome for incidental Python users.
- The proposal has sparked debate about backward compatibility and its impact on Python's ecosystem, with some suggesting it should be a linter rule rather than a language change.
