## [AI PCs Aren't Good at AI: The CPU Beats the NPU](https://github.com/usefulsensors/qc_npu_benchmark)

- Benchmarking Qualcomm's Neural Processing Unit (NPU) on a Microsoft Surface Tablet revealed a performance of only 1.3% of the advertised 45 Teraops/s, achieving just 573 billion operations per second.
- The tests, which included matrix multiplications akin to those in transformer models, showed the NPU performing slower than the CPU, despite using tools like Python, Cmake, and Visual Studio.
- Various factors such as power settings, model topology, and configuration errors were considered, indicating the NPU's performance is significantly below its marketed potential.
