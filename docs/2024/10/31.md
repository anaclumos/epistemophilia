## [OpenZFS deduplication is good now and you shouldn't use it](https://despairlabs.com/blog/posts/2024-10-27-openzfs-dedup-is-good-dont-use-it/)

- OpenZFS 2.3.0 introduces "Fast Dedup," an enhancement over traditional deduplication, addressing high memory usage and performance issues.
- Despite improvements, deduplication is not recommended for general-purpose workloads due to overhead and infrequent duplicate blocks; block cloning from OpenZFS 2.2 is a simpler alternative.
- Fast Dedup optimizes memory usage and efficiency by refining the deduplication table and adding a deduplication log, but is best for specific workloads with high data duplication.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42000784)

- OpenZFS deduplication has seen improvements but remains unsuitable for most users due to its high memory and processing power requirements.- Deduplication is primarily advantageous for specific scenarios, such as virtual machine storage, where data redundancy is prevalent.- Alternatives like compression or file-based block cloning are generally more efficient, and users should evaluate their needs and trade-offs before opting for deduplication.

## [Chain-of-thought can hurt performance on tasks where thinking makes humans worse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21333)

- The paper explores how Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, typically beneficial for large language models, can actually decrease performance in specific tasks.- It identifies tasks such as implicit statistical learning and visual recognition where verbal thinking, akin to CoT, negatively impacts both human and model performance.- The study links cognitive psychology with CoT evaluations, providing insights into when CoT should be avoided in favor of zero-shot methods, which do not rely on prior examples or reasoning steps.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41999340)

- Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning can negatively impact performance in tasks that benefit from subconscious processing, such as implicit statistical learning and visual recognition.- In both humans and AI, overthinking can disrupt mental shortcuts and slow down processes, which may not always be advantageous.- This phenomenon is observed in AI development and human activities like sports and creativity, where intuitive processing often leads to better outcomes.
