## [Egypt declared malaria-free after 100-year effort](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2yl8pjgn2o)

- The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared Egypt malaria-free after nearly a century of eradication efforts, marking a significant public health achievement.
- Egypt is the third country in the WHO's Eastern Mediterranean Region to achieve this status, following the United Arab Emirates and Morocco.
- The certification requires evidence of interrupted malaria transmission for at least three consecutive years, and WHO emphasizes the importance of ongoing vigilance to sustain this status.

## [A step toward fully 3D-printed active electronics](https://news.mit.edu/2024/mit-team-takes-major-step-toward-fully-3d-printed-active-electronics-1015)

- MIT researchers have created semiconductor-free logic gates using 3D-printed copper-doped polymer, potentially simplifying electronics manufacturing.
- This innovation could democratize electronics production by enabling smart hardware creation outside traditional manufacturing hubs, despite not yet matching semiconductor performance.
- The project builds on work with magnetic coils and utilizes a unique resistance property of the copper-doped polymer, with future aims to print fully functional electronics and explore more functionalities.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41899873)

- MIT researchers have advanced 3D printing technology by creating a resettable fuse and a transistor-like device using copper-infused PLA (Polylactic Acid) filament.
- The innovation is significant due to the use of a single material, but it does not yet achieve fully functional active electronics.
- The discovery of the filament's Positive Temperature Coefficient (PTC) effect is important, though the technology remains in its early stages and is not yet ready for broad application.

## [Skeptical of rewriting JavaScript tools in "faster" languages](https://nolanlawson.com/2024/10/20/why-im-skeptical-of-rewriting-javascript-tools-in-faster-languages/)

- Nolan Lawson questions the trend of rewriting JavaScript tools in languages like Rust, Zig, and Go, suggesting JavaScript is often sufficiently fast.
- He points out that performance improvements can be made by optimizing current JavaScript tools, leveraging its bytecode cache and JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler.
- Lawson warns that using newer languages might create a divide, limiting accessibility and debuggability, and potentially alienating average developers from contributing.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41898603)

- The debate centers on whether rewriting JavaScript tools in faster languages like Rust or Go is beneficial, with some arguing JavaScript's speed is sufficient while others see performance gains in using statically typed languages.
- Rewriting in languages like Rust or Go can lead to significant performance improvements, as demonstrated by tools such as esbuild.
- The discussion also considers the ease of modifying JavaScript dependencies and the familiarity of the language, weighing these against the potential benefits of using faster languages.
