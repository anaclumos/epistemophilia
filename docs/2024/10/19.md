## [The long road to lazy preemption in the Linux CPU scheduler](https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/994322/45aa5211a50bc63a/)

- The Linux kernel's CPU scheduler is introducing "lazy preemption," a new concept designed to simplify scheduling and improve system performance.
- Lazy preemption aims to replace existing modes PREEMPT_NONE and PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY with PREEMPT_LAZY, using a new flag, TIF_NEED_RESCHED_LAZY, to allow tasks to run longer unless immediate preemption is necessary.
- This change seeks to make the kernel smaller and simpler, with more predictable latencies, though it requires extensive testing and adjustments before full implementation.

- The Linux CPU scheduler is exploring lazy preemption to simplify the kernel and achieve more predictable latencies, similar to the EEVDF (Earliest Eligible Virtual Deadline First) model.
- Preemption, which allows systems to quickly respond to events, can negatively impact overall throughput and increase lock contention, necessitating a balance between different preemption modes for various workloads.
- Initial testing indicates that lazy preemption slightly reduces throughput compared to the existing PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY mode, highlighting the complexity of managing event priority and preemption levels in the kernel.
