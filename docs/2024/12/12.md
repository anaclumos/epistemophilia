## [Mysterious New Jersey drone sightings prompt call for 'state of emergency'](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/11/new-jersey-drone-sightings-state-of-emergency)

- Over 3,000 drone sightings in New Jersey and the US northeast have led to calls for a "limited state of emergency" and a temporary drone ban by State Senator Jon Bramnick.
- Concerns are heightened due to drones being spotted near sensitive locations, such as President-elect Trump's golf course and critical infrastructure.
- Despite the large number of sightings, the FBI has not provided an explanation, and the Pentagon has dismissed claims of foreign involvement, including from an "Iranian mothership."
