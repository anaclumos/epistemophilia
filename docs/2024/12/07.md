## [: The Dialog Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog)

- The HTML `` element is used to create dialog boxes, which can be modal (pausing page interaction) or non-modal (allowing interaction).
- JavaScript methods `.showModal()` and `.show()` are used to display modal and non-modal dialogs, respectively, while `.close()` is used to close them.
- Accessibility is crucial; ensure focus is set correctly and provide a closing mechanism, such as a button, while using CSS `::backdrop` for styling modal backdrops.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42343089)

- The dialog element on developer.mozilla.org has initiated a debate about the use of interactive HTML elements, such as file pickers and media players, with differing opinions on their consistency and predictability across browsers.
- While some developers criticize the dialog element for being unstyled and not functioning like native popups, others value its semantic and accessibility benefits.
- The discussion highlights challenges in maintaining design consistency and concerns about potential misuse by advertisers, indicating that the dialog element is a progressive step but still requires enhancements.

## [Maps.me co-founder tries to close down Organic Maps open-source fork](https://github.com/orgs/organicmaps/discussions/9837)

- The discussion emphasizes Postgres' versatility in various applications but also points out limitations, such as handling null characters in strings and requiring custom SQL for skip-index scans.- Opinions vary on using Postgres for all purposes, with some cautioning against over-reliance on a single database for large teams and others praising its simplicity and reduced complexity.- Alternatives like Redis are mentioned, along with challenges in scaling and the importance of avoiding over-engineering in the early stages of a project.

## [Lies I was told about collab editing, Part 1: Algorithms for offline editing](https://www.moment.dev/blog/lies-i-was-told-pt-1)

- In early 2024, research into collaborative editing systems for Moment's text editor highlighted challenges with offline editing, where popular algorithms like CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) and OT (Operational Transformation) often fail.- Offline editing increases direct conflicts, with 20-30% of these conflicts resulting in unacceptable outcomes, suggesting the issue is more of a user interface/user experience (UI/UX) challenge than an algorithmic one.- Researchers are now focusing on improving the user experience in offline editing, drawing parallels to how git handles document merging, which is a promising development.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42343953)

- The article addresses the challenges of collaborative editing, especially offline, and critiques current algorithms like Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) and Operational Transformation (OT) for not always yielding semantically meaningful results.- There is a consensus on the need for improved conflict resolution, potentially through user input or advanced tools like Large Language Models (LLMs), to handle semantic conflicts effectively.- The discussion also considers the role of User Interface/User Experience (UI/UX) solutions in enhancing the collaborative editing experience, highlighting that the issue extends beyond algorithms to understanding user intent.

## [Structured Outputs with Ollama](https://ollama.com/blog/structured-outputs)

- Ollama has introduced support for structured outputs, enabling models to generate outputs in a specific format using a JSON schema.
- This feature is now available in the updated Ollama Python and JavaScript libraries, useful for tasks like data parsing from documents and images.
- Users should update to the latest Ollama version and use the format parameter in cURL requests or libraries, with future updates promising performance enhancements and more format options.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42346344)

- Ollama provides a method to generate structured data, such as JSON, from language models, with discussions on using GBNF grammars for more versatile output formats like XML or SQL.- Users debate the reliability of JSON outputs versus natural language, with insights into how language models (LLMs) generate text and the role of structured prompts.- Ollama's integration with llama.cpp is noted for simplifying model usage, though some view it as merely a wrapper, and the feature supports various models with differing accuracy levels.

## [Fructose in diet enhances tumor growth: research](https://source.washu.edu/2024/12/research-reveals-how-fructose-in-diet-enhances-tumor-growth/)

- Fructose consumption has increased significantly over the last 50 years, primarily due to high-fructose corn syrup in beverages and processed foods.
- Research from Washington University in St. Louis indicates that while fructose doesn't directly fuel tumors, the liver converts it into nutrients that support tumor growth in cancers such as melanoma, breast, and cervical cancer.
- The study suggests potential new cancer treatments by exploring methods to prevent fructose from aiding tumor growth, possibly through dietary changes or pharmaceuticals, with partial funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42343544)

- Research from Washington University indicates that high fructose consumption may promote tumor growth by increasing circulating lipids, which are utilized by cancer cells for growth.- While fructose in fruits is typically safe due to additional nutrients, excessive intake from sources like high fructose corn syrup could be risky.- The study underscores the complexity of cancer metabolism and the potential influence of diet on cancer progression, though further research is necessary to fully comprehend these mechanisms.

## [Biggest shell programs](https://github.com/oils-for-unix/oils/wiki/The-Biggest-Shell-Programs-in-the-World)
