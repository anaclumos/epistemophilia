## [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about)

- Advent of Code, created by Eric Wastl, is an Advent calendar featuring programming puzzles suitable for all skill levels, which can be solved in any programming language.
- The puzzles are designed to run efficiently on older hardware and are intended for practice, interviews, or entertainment, without requiring a computer science background.
- Participants are encouraged to share their experiences, test solutions with examples, and seek help if needed, while adhering to guidelines such as not using AI for solving puzzles and respecting trademark rules.

- Advent of Code 2024 has begun, with participants engaging in creative problem-solving and sharing their experiences.- Some participants are experimenting with unique approaches, such as using C without standard libraries or exploring new programming languages like Swift or Ada.- While there are concerns about AI's impact on the leaderboard, the event primarily fosters personal enjoyment, learning, and community interaction.

## [A Brazilian CA trusted only by Microsoft has issued a certificate for google.com](https://follow.agwa.name/notice/AoZSMI38xcA3TrN1sm)

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42284202)

- A Brazilian Certificate Authority (CA), trusted solely by Microsoft, issued a certificate for google.com, breaching Google's Certificate Authority Authorization (CAA) rules.
- This incident raises concerns about the CA's reliability and Microsoft's decision to trust it, as other major browsers do not.
- The certificate could facilitate man-in-the-middle attacks, allowing attackers to impersonate Google and distribute malware, underscoring the need for stricter oversight and transparency in CA trust decisions.

## [Open-source private home security camera system (end-to-end encryption)](https://github.com/privastead/privastead)

- The author developed a home security camera system called Privastead, focusing on privacy by using end-to-end encryption with OpenMLS and implementing it mostly in Rust.- Privastead is open-sourced for those with privacy concerns, requiring a compatible IP camera, a local machine, a server, and an Android smartphone for setup.- Currently, the system supports only one IP camera and Android, but the author seeks community feedback and contributions to enhance its capabilities.

- Privastead is an open-source home security camera system developed to address privacy concerns with existing solutions, utilizing end-to-end encryption via OpenMLS.- The system is primarily implemented in Rust and requires a supported IP camera, a local machine, a server, and an Android smartphone for operation.- The project is available on GitHub, inviting feedback and contributions from the community to enhance its functionality.

## [Ntfs2btrfs does in-place conversion of NTFS filesystem to the open-source Btrfs](https://github.com/maharmstone/ntfs2btrfs)

- Ntfs2btrfs is a tool designed to convert NTFS file systems to Btrfs in-place, preserving the original image as a reflink copy for potential space recovery.
- The tool is available for both Windows and Linux, with specific installation instructions and dependencies for each platform, and it includes features like compression support and rollback to NTFS.
- Limitations include the lack of support for older extended attributes, large alternate data streams (ADS), and encrypted files, with specific conditions required for booting Windows from a Btrfs file system.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42283950)

- Ntfs2btrfs is a tool that enables in-place conversion from NTFS (New Technology File System) to Btrfs (B-tree File System), sparking discussions on its utility and timing for large data transfers.
- Users share mixed experiences with Btrfs, appreciating features like snapshots but recalling past stability issues, while also discussing other filesystems like ZFS and bcachefs.
- The conversation underscores the complexities and risks of filesystem management, with some users advocating for backups and fresh formats over conversion tools.

## [AMD Disables Zen 4's Loop Buffer](https://chipsandcheese.com/p/amd-disables-zen-4s-loop-buffer)

- AMD has disabled the loop buffer in its Zen 4 CPUs, a feature intended for power optimization rather than performance enhancement.- Performance tests indicate negligible differences with the loop buffer disabled, as the op cache compensates with sufficient bandwidth.- The decision to disable the loop buffer, possibly due to a hardware bug, is unlikely to significantly impact performance or power consumption, and the feature was not widely documented by AMD.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42283933)

- AMD has disabled the loop buffer in its Zen 4 CPUs, likely due to undisclosed hardware vulnerabilities, resulting in a minor performance decrease in certain situations.- The loop buffer was designed to enhance power efficiency and performance, but its removal indicates it may not have offered substantial advantages.- The quiet decision to disable the loop buffer has led to concerns regarding transparency and the management of hardware vulnerabilities.

## [OpenWRT One Released: First Router Designed Specifically for OpenWrt](https://sfconservancy.org/news/2024/nov/29/openwrt-one-wireless-router-now-ships-black-friday/)

- The Software Freedom Conservancy (SFC) and OpenWrt have released the OpenWrt One, a wireless router designed to promote software freedom and the right to repair, priced at $89 with a case or $68.42 for the board.
- The router is unbrickable, fully copyleft-compliant, and features a MediaTek MT7981B SoC, MT7976C wifi, 1 GiB DDR4 RAM, supporting Power over Ethernet (PoE) and USB-C power, with a USB serial interface for advanced users.
- The device is FCC compliant, demonstrating that software right to repair can align with regulatory requirements, and each purchase includes a $10 donation to OpenWrt at the Software Freedom Conservancy.
