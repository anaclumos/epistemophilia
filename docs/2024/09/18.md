## [Why wordfreq will not be updated](https://github.com/rspeer/wordfreq/blob/master/SUNSET.md)

- The wordfreq data, a snapshot of language from various online sources up to 2021, will not be updated due to several key reasons.
- Post-2021 language data is unreliable because of the influx of AI-generated content, which skews word frequencies, such as ChatGPT's overuse of certain words.
- Access to previously free sources like Twitter and Reddit now incurs high costs, and the field of natural language processing (NLP) has shifted focus to generative AI, raising ethical concerns and diminishing interest in traditional text data collection.
