## [Contextual Retrieval](https://www.anthropic.com/news/contextual-retrieval)

- Contextual Retrieval is introduced to improve the retrieval step in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by using Contextual Embeddings and Contextual BM25, reducing failed retrievals by up to 67% when combined with reranking.
- This method enhances retrieval accuracy, leading to better performance in downstream tasks such as customer support and legal analysis, and can be deployed using the provided cookbook.
- Traditional RAG often loses context by splitting documents into smaller chunks; Contextual Retrieval addresses this by prepending chunk-specific explanatory context before embedding and creating the BM25 index.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41598119)

- Anthropic has introduced prompt caching to improve the cost-effectiveness of their Contextual Retrieval process, which is a method to enhance Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) results by expanding chunks using a Large Language Model (LLM).
- Prompt caching allows developers to save costs by storing the state after running a large document through a model, rather than regenerating each chunk every time, making it a significant update for those working with RAG workflows.
- The post highlights that while the cookbook provides a guide for a specific RAG workflow, the real innovation lies in the cost-saving feature of prompt caching, which was introduced a month ago.
