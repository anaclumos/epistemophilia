## [Amazon S3 Adds Put-If-Match (Compare-and-Swap)](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/11/amazon-s3-functionality-conditional-writes/)

- Amazon S3 introduces conditional writes, enabling updates only if an object remains unmodified, preventing concurrent overwrites by verifying the object's ETag.- This feature, akin to the HTTP if-none-match header, allows clients to use the if-match header to ensure ETag consistency before writing, enhancing efficiency for distributed applications.- Available at no extra cost across all AWS Regions, implementation can be done using the AWS SDK, API, or CLI, with further details in the S3 User Guide.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42240678)

- Amazon S3 has launched a new feature called Put-If-Match, which acts like a compare-and-swap operation, allowing conditional object writing based on version matching.- This feature improves synchronization and concurrency control, enabling developers to perform more complex operations, such as building databases on S3 without extra infrastructure.- The update brings Amazon S3 in line with similar features offered by other cloud storage services like Google Cloud Storage and Azure Blob Storage.

## [Lies we tell ourselves to keep using Golang (2022)](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/lies-we-tell-ourselves-to-keep-using-golang)

- The article critiques Golang, noting that while it has appealing features like an asynchronous runtime and garbage collector, it also has significant drawbacks, such as the absence of sum types and inadequate error handling.- It argues that Go's perceived simplicity can be deceptive, leading to hidden complexities and challenges in production environments, and stresses the importance of recognizing these issues rather than adopting Go solely for its ease of use.- The article contrasts Go with Rust, suggesting that despite Rust's challenges, it provides more robust solutions for managing complexity and ensuring code correctness.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42243500)

- The article critiques Go's error handling, contrasting it with Rust's more sophisticated approach, which some find more elegant.
- There is a divide in opinion: some appreciate Go's simplicity and explicit error handling, while others find it tedious and error-prone.
- Despite criticisms, Go remains popular due to its simplicity and widespread adoption by large companies.

- Lidar provides high-resolution imaging and performs well in low-light conditions, but faces competition from camera-based systems, which some companies, like Tesla, prefer for cost reasons, fueling ongoing debates on the best approach for autonomous driving.

## [Do you need ID to read the REAL-ID rules?](https://papersplease.org/wp/2024/11/25/do-you-need-id-to-read-the-real-id-rules/)

- An attempt to access the TSA's new digital-ID rules revealed issues with the REAL-ID Act, as the rules are not publicly accessible and require ID for access, raising concerns about secret laws and due process.
- The TSA's digital-ID standards, derived from private documents, involve complex interactions between apps, devices, and government agencies, with privacy concerns over logged ID usage.
- The author argues that the TSA's practices violate public access rights and has reported the issue to the Office of the Federal Register, seeking the withdrawal of the rule.

## [A solution to The Onion problem of J. Kenji Lopez-Alt (2021)](https://medium.com/@drspoulsen/a-solution-to-the-onion-problem-of-j-kenji-l%C3%B3pez-alt-c3c4ab22e67c)

- The post addresses the "Onion Problem," which involves cutting onions to achieve minimal variance in slice volumes for uniformity.- A mathematical exploration using calculus determined the optimal cutting point is 55.73066% below the onion's center, termed the "true onion constant."- This finding refines a previous suggestion of cutting towards a point 60% below the center, providing a more precise method for even onion slices.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42244814)

- The discussion explores a mathematical model for cutting onions evenly, inspired by J. Kenji Lopez-Alt, using a half-disk representation to simplify the geometry and minimize slice size variance.- Users debate the model's practicality and accuracy, considering the onion's 3D structure and non-uniform layers, and suggest alternative cutting methods or tools.- The conversation also considers the balance between uniformity and culinary preferences, referencing food personalities like Adam Ragusea.

## [Redis is trying to take over the all of the OSS Redis libraries](https://twitter.com/TomHacohen/status/1861137484249252093)

- Libraries such as redis-py, Lettuce, and Jedis have been moved under Redis Inc.'s official organization, seen as a defensive strategy against competitors like Valkey.
- The community is worried about trademark claims and potential vendor lock-in, prompting discussions on alternatives like Valkey and Kvrocks, and highlighting the challenges of trademark enforcement in open-source projects.

## [Setelinleikkaus: When Finns snipped their cash in half to curb inflation](http://jpkoning.blogspot.com/2024/11/setelinleikkaus-when-finns-snipped.html)

- In 1945, Finland implemented "setelinleikkaus," a policy requiring citizens to cut large banknotes in half to combat post-WWII inflation, with one half retaining value and the other becoming a government bond.- The policy was ineffective as it only targeted physical cash, a minor part of the money supply, unlike more successful reforms in other European countries like Belgium.- The article speculates that future inflation control might involve digital account freezes, a more precise but potentially controversial method.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42243755)

- In 1945, Finland uniquely addressed inflation by physically cutting banknotes in half, contrasting with modern methods like adjusting interest rates.
- This historical approach has sparked discussions on current monetary policy, where central banks manage inflation through interest rates and open market operations.
- The potential future control of digital money, possibly via central bank digital currencies, raises concerns about increased government oversight of personal finances.

## [Premature Graying of Hair: Review with Updates](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6290285/)

- Premature graying of hair (PGH) is defined as graying before age 20 in Caucasians and before 30 in African Americans, impacting self-esteem.- The causes of PGH are not fully understood but are associated with aging disorders, autoimmune diseases, and oxidative stress, with factors like smoking and nutritional deficiencies contributing.- Common treatments for PGH include hair dyes and nutritional supplements, with studies indicating links between PGH and emotional factors, genetic predispositions, and environmental influences.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42241702)

- Premature graying of hair is associated with vitamin B12 deficiency, particularly in individuals with pernicious anemia, a condition where the body cannot absorb B12 properly.- Diagnosing B12 deficiency can be challenging as supplementation may artificially increase B12 levels, and some individuals cannot convert certain forms of B12 to active forms, leading to "paradoxical B12 deficiency."- Factors such as stress, genetics, and health conditions like autoimmune thyroidism also contribute to graying, and while some supplements may help, there is no proven method to reverse gray hair.

## [LLVM-powered devirtualization](https://blog.thalium.re/posts/llvm-powered-devirtualization/)

- The internship at Thalium focused on deobfuscating virtualized binaries using LLVM, a compiler framework, to make code more understandable, especially in the context of malware.- Virtualization, a strong obfuscation technique used by tools like Tigress and VMProtect, encodes programs into virtual instructions, making reverse engineering complex.- The project successfully used dynamic taint analysis to reconstruct the control flow graph of Tigress-obfuscated binaries, though it was limited to pure functions and single execution paths.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42245170)

- LLVM-powered devirtualization improves performance by optimizing virtual function calls, which are typically slower due to their dynamic nature.
- Bochs, a CPU emulator, can efficiently emulate a Pentium 4 processor on an i7, even bypassing virtual machine detectors.
- The Bochs debugger is particularly effective in analyzing and countering malware and code obfuscators, making it a valuable tool for security research.
