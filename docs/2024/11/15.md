## [Visual Basic 6 IDE recreated in C#](https://github.com/BAndysc/AvaloniaVisualBasic6)

- Avalonia Visual Basic 6 is a C# recreation of the classic Visual Basic 6 Integrated Development Environment (IDE) using Avalonia, intended as a fun, non-commercial project.- The project includes features like a visual designer, compatibility with VB6 project saving/loading, and limited support for the VB6 language.- Building the desktop version typically requires .NET 9.0, but .NET 8.0 can be used with modifications; compilation is done using `dotnet build`, and publishing with `dotnet publish` for both the IDE and runtime.

- A Visual Basic 6 Integrated Development Environment (IDE) has been recreated using C# and is accessible on GitHub, generating nostalgia among developers who started with VB6.
- The project employs Avalonia, a cross-platform UI framework, and supports basic VB6 features, though it remains a work in progress.
- The initiative has received positive feedback, sparking interest in further development and discussions on the evolution of graphical user interface (GUI) toolkits and the simplicity of VB6 compared to contemporary tools.

## [Analysis of economic and productivity losses caused by cookie banners in Europe](https://legiscope.com/blog/hidden-productivity-drain-cookie-banners.html)

- Europeans collectively spend 575 million hours each year interacting with cookie consent banners, a requirement of the EU Directive 2002/58, which aims to protect user privacy.- The economic impact of this time spent is substantial, costing â‚¬14.375 billion annually, equivalent to 0.10% of the EU's GDP, and represents a productivity loss akin to 287,500 full-time jobs.- There is a call for urgent revision of the directive to alleviate economic and productivity burdens, particularly affecting small and medium-sized enterprises.

- The European "cookie law" requires informed consent for tracking, but does not specifically mandate the use of cookie banners; companies opt for banners to comply.
- A common issue is companies incorrectly implementing consent by setting tracking cookies by default and providing banners without a clear reject option, which is non-compliant.
- The law's intent is to protect consumer rights, but companies often engage in "malicious compliance" to frustrate users, suggesting stricter enforcement and potential browser-based consent settings as solutions.

## [Relativty: An open-source VR headset for $200](https://www.relativty.com/)

- Relativty is an open-source virtual reality (VR) headset developed by teenagers Maxim Perumal and Gabriel Combe, designed as a DIY project rather than a consumer product, costing approximately $200.- The headset supports SteamVR games and features experimental positional-scaling using any camera, with a motherboard based on the Atmel SAM3X8E ARM Cortex-M3 processor.- The creators are launching a new company, Unai, to develop a standalone VR headset, and they are currently hiring, with more information available on their website.

- Relativty is a $200 open-source VR headset with 3DoF (three degrees of freedom) tracking, similar to older models like Oculus Go, but lacks the more immersive 6DoF (six degrees of freedom) tracking.- HadesVR is a 6DoF open-source project developed from Relativty, offering enhanced immersion and reduced motion sickness compared to 3DoF systems.- Privacy concerns with Meta's Quest headsets are prompting some users to consider alternatives, and there is potential for educational projects using Relativty despite its limitations.

## [New Apple security feature reboots iPhones after 3 days, researchers confirm](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/new-apple-security-feature-reboots-iphones-after-3-days-researchers-confirm/)

- Apple's iOS 18 introduces an "inactivity reboot" feature that automatically restarts iPhones if they remain unlocked for 72 hours, enhancing security by securing encryption keys in the secure enclave chip.
- This feature increases data protection against theft and outdated forensic tools but presents challenges for law enforcement in data extraction from devices.
- Security researchers and companies like Magnet Forensics have confirmed the feature, highlighting the ongoing tension between Apple's security measures and law enforcement's data access needs.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42143265)

- Apple's new security feature automatically reboots iPhones after 72 hours of inactivity, aiming to maintain security by clearing potential malware or errors.- This feature is akin to the security protocols of payment terminals, which reboot every 24 hours to ensure a secure state.- While some users express concerns about potential connectivity disruptions, the feature is generally viewed as a positive step towards enhanced security, with suggestions to make the reboot interval configurable.

## [Thomas E. Kurtz has died](https://computerhistory.org/blog/in-memoriam-thomas-e-kurtz-1928-2024/)

- Thomas E. Kurtz, co-inventor of the BASIC programming language, passed away on November 12, 2024, leaving a significant legacy in computing.
- Kurtz played a crucial role in developing the Dartmouth Timesharing System, enabling widespread access to BASIC and influencing generations of computing and software development.
- He held leadership roles at Dartmouth, contributed to BASIC standards, retired in 1993, and was honored as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) in 1994.

- Thomas E. Kurtz, co-creator of the BASIC programming language, has passed away, prompting many to share memories and gratitude for his contributions.- BASIC played a crucial role in democratizing computing, making programming accessible to non-experts and inspiring a generation of programmers.- Kurtz's work at Dartmouth, alongside John Kemeny, was significant in the development of time-sharing systems and educational computing, leaving a lasting impact on the tech industry.

## [Seer: A GUI front end to GDB for Linux](https://github.com/epasveer/seer)

- Seer is a graphical user interface (GUI) frontend for the GNU Debugger (gdb) on Linux, designed to enhance user experience with a simple interface.- Developed by Ernie Pasveer, Seer requires Linux, C++17, gdb with "mi" interpreter, CMake 3.1.0+, and QT6, and it no longer supports Qt5 beyond version 2.3.- Key features include source file management, variable tracking, and breakpoint management, with support and detailed instructions available on GitHub or via email.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42146338)

- Seer is a graphical user interface (GUI) for the GNU Debugger (GDB) on Linux, but users report issues such as non-functional font changes and variable hover errors.
- Despite its current flaws, Seer has potential if further developed, with users comparing it to other tools like Gede, which is noted for its simplicity and reliability.
- Discussions highlight various debugging preferences, including GDB's built-in text user interface (TUI), Neovim, gdb-dashboard, and DDD, with some users favoring logging over debuggers for complex scenarios.
