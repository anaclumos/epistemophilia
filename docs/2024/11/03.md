- Nvidia GeForce GPUs have a security vulnerability in their Windows and Linux drivers, which could allow attackers to escalate permissions, leading to potential code execution and data tampering.- The flaw is particularly concerning for multi-user systems, systems with existing malware, and virtualization hosts, though it is not easily exploitable via browsers.- Nvidia has released updated drivers to mitigate the issue, and users are advised to update their drivers, especially on systems with untrusted users or existing malware.

## [Eighty Years of the Finite Element Method (2022)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11831-022-09740-9)

- The article reviews the evolution of the Finite Element Method (FEM) over 80 years, highlighting its significance in engineering and scientific modeling, particularly in solid mechanics.- FEM's development is categorized into four periods: early years (1941-1965), golden age (1966-1991), industrial applications and materials modeling (1992-2017), and the present and future.- It emphasizes FEM's integration with modern computational techniques like machine learning, its impact on industries, and its role in advancing engineering education and software development.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42028569)

- The Finite Element Method (FEM) remains a fundamental tool in engineering, but its practical application has seen little innovation, with many advancements not succeeding in real-world use.
- Industry attention has moved towards Verification and Validation, emphasizing FEM's limitations, while commercial software such as ANSYS and NASTRAN continue to lead the market.
- Emerging methods like Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) and Neural Operators offer potential but have not yet gained widespread adoption.

## [Next Generation Out of Band Garbage Collection](https://railsatscale.com/2024-10-23-next-generation-oob-gc/)

- In 2023, Shopify optimized Ruby's garbage collector by implementing out-of-band garbage collection to reduce latency, though initial heuristics were not fully effective.- By March 2024, a proof of concept was developed to disable major garbage collections during request cycles, leading to the introduction of a new method, GC.config(rgengc_allow_full_mark: true/false), in Ruby 3.4.0-preview2.- Implementing this method on 50% of Shopify's servers resulted in significant latency improvements, with modest capacity gains, and future efforts will focus on optimizing minor collections.

## [Ractor â€“ a Rust Actor Framework](https://slawlor.github.io/ractor/quickstart/)

- The guide introduces Ractor, a Rust library for actor-based programming, covering key concepts like messaging, installation, and creating actors.
- It explains the "cast" (fire-and-forget) and "call" (wait for reply) messaging schemes, similar to Erlang, and provides code examples for creating and running actors.
- The guide also details how to add state to actors and use `RpcReplyPort` for inter-actor communication, with examples of stateful actor implementation.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42030625)

- Ractor is a Rust actor framework that emphasizes supervision, a feature inspired by Erlang's OTP, to manage actor systems effectively.- It integrates with Tokio and has a companion library, ractor_cluster, for distributed scenarios, and is notably used at Meta for distributed overload protection in Rust Thrift servers.- The framework's design, including the use of async_trait, is shaped by Rust's evolving features, but integration with Erlang systems remains complex due to differing messaging semantics and VM requirements.
