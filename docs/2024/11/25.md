## [SQLite: Outlandish Recursive Query Examples](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_with.html#outlandish_recursive_query_examples)

- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) in SQL serve as temporary views for a single statement, with two types: ordinary and recursive, simplifying complex queries and handling hierarchical data, respectively.
- CTEs are created using a WITH clause and can include multiple CTEs in a single statement, with recursive CTEs requiring specific rules like using UNION or UNION ALL operators.
- Materialization hints, available in SQLite version 3.35.0 and later, guide the query planner on CTE implementation, with limitations such as the inability to use WITH in CREATE TRIGGER.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42230384)

- SQLite's recursive Common Table Expressions (CTEs) function like loops, allowing queries to reference themselves, which is useful for complex tasks such as solving Sudoku puzzles or calculating transitive closures.
- Mastery of the syntax, particularly "WITH" and "WITH RECURSIVE," is essential for effectively utilizing recursive CTEs, which operate by seeding a query and executing recursively until no new results are generated.
- For those finding recursive CTEs challenging, resources like the O'Reilly SQL Pocket Guide and a solid understanding of relational algebra can be beneficial in simplifying complex SQL queries.

## [Hey, wait – is employee performance Gaussian distributed?](https://timdellinger.substack.com/p/hey-wait-is-employee-performance)

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42236841)

- The article challenges the assumption that employee performance follows a Gaussian (normal) distribution, suggesting that this view may lead to outdated performance management practices in corporations.
- It critiques the practice of trimming the bottom 5% of employees, advocating for a focus on combined productivity rather than individual performance, and proposes that performance might follow a Pareto distribution, where a few employees contribute significantly more to output.
- The discussion encompasses various perspectives on performance evaluation, hiring practices, and the role of management in influencing employee success.
