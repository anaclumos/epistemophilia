## [The US copyright office has struck down a major effort for game preservation](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/publishers-are-absolutely-terrified-preserved-video-games-would-be-used-for-recreational-purposes-so-the-us-copyright-office-has-struck-down-a-major-effort-for-game-preservation/)

- The US Copyright Office has rejected a DMCA exemption request that aimed to allow libraries to remotely share digital access to preserved video games, concluding a three-year campaign by the Video Game History Foundation (VGHF) and the Software Preservation Network.
- The proposed exemption would have facilitated a digital library for historians and researchers to access out-of-print games, but was denied due to concerns about potential recreational use and market harm, as argued by industry groups.
- The VGHF expressed disappointment, criticizing the decision as being heavily influenced by industry lobbying, which prioritized industry interests over public access to historical games.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42259133)

- This decision has ignited discussions among retro game enthusiasts, who argue that older games provide more enjoyment and nostalgia compared to modern games.
- Critics of the decision believe that current copyright laws are overly restrictive, impeding the preservation of cultural and historical media, and suggest shortening copyright terms to promote innovation and allow older works to enter the public domain sooner.

## [Inferring neural activity before plasticity for learning beyond backpropagation](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01514-1)

- The article introduces "prospective configuration," a novel credit assignment principle in learning, as an alternative to the traditional backpropagation method.
- Prospective configuration involves neural networks predicting desired neural activity patterns before adjusting synaptic weights, enhancing efficiency and effectiveness in learning.
- This method aligns more closely with observed neural activity in human and animal studies and may offer advantages in both biological and artificial learning systems over backpropagation.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42259185)

- A new theory, "prospective configuration," is proposed to explain how the brain addresses the credit assignment problem, differing from the backpropagation method used in artificial neural networks (ANNs).
- The theory suggests that neural activity changes precede synaptic weight modifications, contrasting with backpropagation where weight changes lead to altered neural activity.
- This approach may better align with biological processes and could provide insights into developing more efficient learning algorithms, contributing to debates on AI and human brain learning similarities and differences.
