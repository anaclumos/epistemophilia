## [Bus Number â€“ The GitHub plugin my coworkers asked me not to write](https://www.scannedinavian.com/the-github-plugin-my-coworkers-asked-me-not-to-write.html)

- Shae Erisson's blog explores a GitHub plugin concept to calculate a project's "bus factor," which indicates how many team members can leave before a project is jeopardized.
- The idea was inspired by a 2015 layoff experience, but there are concerns it could be misused by management to identify expendable employees.
- Shae and collaborator mclare faced technical challenges but calculated a truck factor of 12 for the Linux kernel, suggesting a decline from the original study's 80, indicating bus factors have worsened over time.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42111260)

- The GitHub plugin aims to identify "knowledge islands" in codebases, which are areas where only a few team members have expertise, to aid in handover planning.
- While the tool is intended to increase visibility and reduce risk by broadening team understanding of critical code areas, there are concerns about potential misuse by management for layoffs or performance evaluations.
- Critics argue that relying solely on these metrics can be detrimental, as they may not accurately reflect the complexities of team dynamics and project dependencies.

## [When muscles work out, they help neurons to grow, a new study shows](https://news.mit.edu/2024/when-muscles-work-out-they-help-neurons-grow-1112)

- MIT engineers found that exercise aids nerve healing by releasing myokines during muscle contractions, which significantly promote neuron growth.- Neurons exposed to myokines grew four times farther than those not exposed, and physical stretching of neurons also stimulated growth, mimicking muscle contractions.- The study suggests exercise-related therapies could be crucial for nerve repair, potentially leading to treatments for nerve injuries and neurodegenerative diseases.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42115515)
