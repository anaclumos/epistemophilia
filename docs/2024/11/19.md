## [DOJ will push Google to sell off Chrome](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-18/doj-will-push-google-to-sell-off-chrome-to-break-search-monopoly)

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42177767)

- The Department of Justice (DOJ) is urging Google to divest Chrome due to concerns about its market dominance and integration with other Google services, which enhances its data collection and advertising capabilities.
- Critics claim Google's control over Chrome allows it to prioritize features that benefit its advertising business and potentially degrade service quality on rival browsers.
- The DOJ's move is intended to foster competition, but there is debate over whether separating Chrome from Google would truly benefit consumers or simply shift data access to other companies.

## [Scientific American's departing editor and the politicization of science](https://reason.com/2024/11/18/how-scientific-americans-departing-editor-helped-degrade-science/)

- Laura Helmuth, former editor of Scientific American, resigned following controversial social media posts and criticism regarding her editorial direction.
- During her tenure, the magazine faced accusations of promoting a political agenda, which critics argue compromised its scientific credibility, particularly on sensitive topics like youth gender medicine.
- The situation has contributed to a broader crisis of trust in scientific authority, with calls for Scientific American to prioritize science over politics to regain its reputation.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42177619)

- Scientific American's editor has been criticized for allegedly politicizing science, as discussed in Susan Greenhalgh's book on Coca-Cola's use of science to divert attention from obesity issues.
- The debate raises concerns about the phrase "trust the science," suggesting it may align science with faith rather than skepticism, and highlights the influence of politics on scientific reporting.
- The discussion underscores the tension between preserving scientific integrity and managing political influences, with claims that both political sides exploit science to further their agendas.

## [OpenStreetMap's New Vector Tiles](https://tech.marksblogg.com/osm-mvt-vector-tiles.html)

- OpenStreetMap (OSM) has launched vector tiles in Mapbox Vector Tiles (MVT) format, enabling users to customize map styles and switch label languages, enhancing map clarity and flexibility.
- This update marks a shift from the previous use of static raster tiles, allowing for sharper imagery and more dynamic data interaction.
- The post includes guidance on setting up a Python environment and utilizing DuckDB for data analysis, with visualization possible through tools like QGIS and Leafmap.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42182519)

- OpenStreetMap has introduced new vector tiles, which provide smooth zooming and easy style editing but lack the detail of raster tiles, such as Points of Interest (POIs) and street names.
- The open-source community has advanced vector map capabilities, yet challenges like rendering issues with Arabic text persist.
- Vector tiles could potentially lower hosting costs but demand more client-side resources; they are currently in technical preview with ongoing improvements anticipated.

## [Fair coins tend to land on the side they started: Evidence from 350,757 flips](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/374700857_Fair_coins_tend_to_land_on_the_same_side_they_started_Evidence_from_350757_flips)

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42181345)

- A study involving 350,757 coin flips suggests that coins are more likely to land on the side they started on, but the sample size was limited to 48 testers.
- Critics point out that the study's methodology, including low flip height and rotations, may have skewed the results, and potential tester biases could affect the findings.
- The study emphasizes the role of human imperfections in coin flips, but its conclusions may not be applicable beyond the specific conditions tested.
