## [JavaScript Temporal is coming](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/blog/javascript-temporal-is-coming/)

JavaScript Temporal is a new feature in experimental browser releases aimed at improving date and time handling for web developers, addressing limitations of the old Date object. Temporal provides precise management of dates, times, durations, and calendars, with over 200 utility methods, supporting various calendars and time zones. While full cross-browser support is still in progress, Firefox leads with the most advanced implementation, and developers can experiment with Temporal using the @js-temporal/polyfill.

JavaScript Temporal is a new API designed to overcome the limitations of the old Date() API, drawing inspiration from advanced time libraries like chrono in Rust and Joda Time in Java. It introduces a more complex but necessary structure by separating time into naive time, instant, and zoned time, effectively addressing issues like Daylight Saving Time (DST) bugs and serialization discrepancies. Temporal is anticipated to replace popular libraries such as Moment.js, Luxon, and date-fns by providing a standardized, built-in solution for date and time management in JavaScript, utilizing the IANA Time Zone Database.

## [Younger cannabis users have reduced brain function, finds largest study yet](https://newatlas.com/brain/young-adult-cannabis-brain-function/)

A study by the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus indicates that cannabis use can impair brain function in young adults, particularly affecting working memory. The research, involving 1,003 participants and MRI scans, found that heavy and recent cannabis users exhibited reduced brain activity during memory tasks, impacting areas related to emotion, cognition, and social behavior. Published in JAMA Network Open, the study suggests abstaining from cannabis before cognitive tasks may enhance performance, but heavy users might face withdrawal symptoms, highlighting the need for further research on cannabis's long-term brain effects.
