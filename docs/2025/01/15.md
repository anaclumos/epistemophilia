## [Don't use cosine similarity carelessly](https://p.migdal.pl/blog/2025/01/dont-use-cosine-similarity/)

- Cosine similarity, a method for comparing vectors, can be misleading if used without understanding the context, as it may not accurately capture semantic similarities. - Embeddings, such as those from word2vec or sentence embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs), require careful and intentional use to ensure they reflect the desired relationships. - To improve vector similarity results, consider using LLMs directly, creating task-specific embeddings through fine-tuning, and ensuring text is clean and prompts are well-engineered before embedding.

- In Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications, using a "semantic re-ranker" can enhance the matching of user queries when employing cosine similarity. - Avoid storing vector embeddings of empty content, as they can lead to false matches; some projects use special encodings to represent "nothingness" to prevent this issue. - Exploring alternatives such as Large Language Models (LLMs), cross-encoders, L2 re-ranking models, or graph-based methods can provide more accurate retrieval results than relying solely on cosine similarity.

## [Generate audiobooks from E-books with Kokoro-82M](https://claudio.uk/posts/epub-to-audiobook.html)

- Kokoro v0.19 is a new text-to-speech model with 82 million parameters, providing high-quality audio output in multiple languages, including American and British English, French, Korean, Japanese, and Mandarin.
- Claudio Santini developed Audiblez, a tool that converts e-books into audiobooks using Kokoro, processing .epub files and generating audio files, with a conversion time of about 2 hours for a 100,000-word book on an M2 MacBook Pro.
- Audiblez requires installation via pip, supports various languages and voices, and needs ffmpeg for .m4b file creation, with the tool available on GitHub for further development and improvements.

- Kokoro-82M is an AI tool designed to convert e-books into audiobooks, offering convenience, particularly for non-fiction works.
- While AI-generated audiobooks can fill gaps where no human-narrated versions exist, they currently lack the emotional depth and character provided by human narrators.
- The tool sparks debate on AI's impact on creative professions, drawing parallels to historical technological shifts, and raises concerns about diminishing opportunities for training and experience in these fields.

## [Road signs to help people limit radiation exposure in contaminated areas](https://www.theautopian.com/if-you-ever-see-this-speed-sign-youre-probably-going-to-die/)

- The Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) contains Cold War-era signs, such as "MAINTAIN TOP SAFE SPEED," intended for radiological contamination zones.
- These signs were part of Civil Defense strategies to safeguard citizens during a potential nuclear apocalypse, though they were never utilized.
- Some of these signs are still included in the MUTCD as Emergency Management signs, highlighting historical fears and preparedness efforts from that period.
