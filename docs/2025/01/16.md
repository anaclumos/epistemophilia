## [No Calls](https://keygen.sh/blog/no-calls/)

- Zeke Gabrielse, founder of Keygen, initially avoided sales calls due to his introverted nature, implementing a 'no calls' policy, which led to more direct interactions and his first enterprise sale.
- Gabrielse identified four key issues to address for a successful 'no calls' approach: unclear offerings, poor onboarding, hidden pricing, and lack of trust, suggesting clear messaging, transparent pricing, self-serve onboarding, and trust-building documentation.
- While some enterprises still expect calls, Keygen uses brief 'discovery calls' to transition to email discussions, and Gabrielse encourages others to consider a #nocalls approach if it aligns with their style.
