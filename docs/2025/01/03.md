## [Can LLMs write better code if you keep asking them to “write better code”?](https://minimaxir.com/2025/01/write-better-code/)

- In November 2023, a meme trend involved users asking ChatGPT to iteratively enhance images, which was then applied to code using Claude 3.5 Sonnet to improve a Python program. - Initial attempts with vague prompts like "write better code" showed some improvements, but structured prompt engineering with specific optimization goals led to significant performance enhancements. - The experiment underscored the importance of human oversight, as while Large Language Models (LLMs) can offer innovative ideas, they may also introduce subtle bugs during code optimization.

## [U.S. appeals court strikes down FCC's net neutrality rules](https://www.tvtechnology.com/news/sixth-circuit-of-appeals-strikes-down-fccs-net-neutrality-rules)

- A U.S. Appeals Court has invalidated the FCC's net neutrality rules, which mandated equal treatment of internet traffic by broadband providers, citing the FCC's overreach of legal authority.
- The decision references a Supreme Court ruling that restricts the powers of regulatory agencies, impacting the FCC's ability to enforce net neutrality.
- FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel called for Congress to legislate net neutrality, while Commissioner Brendan Carr supported the court's decision as a check on regulatory overreach.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42578237)

- A U.S. appeals court has invalidated the FCC's net neutrality rules, citing insufficient legal authority under current law. - The decision follows the Supreme Court's overturning of Chevron deference, which had permitted agencies like the FCC to broadly interpret statutes. - The court classified broadband providers as offering an "information service," not a "telecommunications service," thus restricting the FCC's regulatory power and ending federal net neutrality rules, potentially allowing ISPs to throttle or prioritize internet traffic.

## [Be a property owner and not a renter on the internet](https://den.dev/blog/be-a-property-owner-not-a-renter-on-the-internet/)

- The article stresses the importance of owning your digital space instead of relying solely on major internet platforms, which often prioritize their growth over user interests. - Strategies for maintaining control over your online presence include owning a domain, diversifying content across multiple platforms, and building direct connections with audiences through email lists. - By creating your own web property, you ensure flexibility and resilience in your digital endeavors, reducing dependency on any single network.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42581119)

- The discussion emphasizes the importance of owning one's digital presence instead of depending on social media platforms, addressing concerns about AI exploiting user-generated content. - It explores the complexities of copyright, AI ethics, and the significance of having a personal website or domain for better control over online data. - The conversation also considers the practicality and limitations of self-hosting, given the dependence on external services like domain registrars and hosting providers, advocating for more independence in managing one's online presence.

## [The Alder Lake SHLX Anomaly](https://tavianator.com/2025/shlx.html)

- Harold Aptroot discovered that the SHLX instruction on Intel's Alder Lake processors exhibits a "medium latency" of 3 cycles, which is atypical for left-shift operations that usually take 1 cycle. - This latency issue is specific to Alder Lake's performance cores and does not affect the efficiency cores, contradicting Intel's claims of a 1-cycle latency. - The latency varies based on the initialization of the shift count register, with 32-bit instructions or 64-bit instructions without immediates achieving 1-cycle latency, while 64-bit instructions with immediates result in 3-cycle latency.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42579969)

- The Alder Lake SHLX Anomaly is a performance issue where specific instructions, such as `mov rcx, 1`, cause the `SHLX` instruction to execute slower, potentially due to the register renamer's handling of small immediates.
- This anomaly can lead to a 3x slowdown and is challenging to reproduce because context switches may reset the register state, inadvertently speeding up the code.
- The issue is newly discovered and primarily affects shift counts, impacting instructions like `SHL`, but not others like `ANDN`, and is not typically accounted for by compilers.
