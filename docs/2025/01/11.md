## [Be Aware of the Makefile Effect](https://blog.yossarian.net/2025/01/10/Be-aware-of-the-Makefile-effect)

- The "Makefile effect" describes the practice of engineers copying and modifying existing complex configurations, like Makefiles, instead of creating new ones from scratch. - This approach is prevalent in various systems, such as Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) configurations and build systems, and can indicate overly complex or poorly designed tools. - While not inherently negative, the Makefile effect can impede learning, complicate security, and lead to inefficient debugging, highlighting the need for thoughtful tool design that considers configurability and ease of use.

- The "Makefile Effect" describes developers' tendency to copy and modify code or configurations without fully understanding them, often due to tool complexity or infrequent use.
- This phenomenon is widespread across programming and configuration tasks, where developers use known solutions to save time and effort, potentially leading to difficult-to-maintain code.
- The discussion emphasizes the need to balance using templates and existing solutions with gaining a deeper understanding of the tools and systems involved.

## [Portals and Quake](https://30fps.net/pages/pvs-portals-and-quake/)

- The article is the first in the "Demystifying the PVS" series, focusing on Quake's precomputed visibility system to address overdraw, where pixels are rendered multiple times. - Quake uses portal culling and potentially visible sets (PVS) by dividing the world into cells and portals, precomputing visibility to optimize rendering. - The article introduces the Portal and Leaf classes in vis.py, a Python reimplementation of Quake's visibility algorithm, highlighting the use of a leaf-to-leaf visibility matrix.

## [Very Wrong Math](https://www.charlespetzold.com/blog/2025/01/Very-Wrong-Math.html)

- A design and construction company made a math error on Facebook, incorrectly calculating the Earth's radius as 4,333 feet, leading to a vastly underestimated circumference of just over 5 miles.
- The error stemmed from calculating arc lengths without using the Earth's actual radius, which is approximately 3,959 miles.
- The post highlighted that the outer arc was less than 1% longer than the inner arc, suggesting a potential reduction in flight time due to decreased air resistance.

## [Nearly all binary searches and mergesorts are broken (2006)](https://research.google/blog/extra-extra-read-all-about-it-nearly-all-binary-searches-and-mergesorts-are-broken/)

- In 2006, Joshua Bloch identified a bug in the binary search algorithm, initially noted in Jon Bentley's "Programming Pearls," where an overflow occurs when 'low' and 'high' exceed the maximum int value.
- This bug, affecting arrays with lengths of 2^30 or more, was rare in the 1980s but is more common today, also impacting mergesort and other divide-and-conquer algorithms.
- Bloch recommends fixing the issue by calculating the midpoint as `int mid = low + ((high - low) / 2);`, highlighting the challenges of writing error-free code and the necessity of thorough testing.
