## [Why is Git Autocorrect too fast for Formula One drivers?](https://blog.gitbutler.com/why-is-git-autocorrect-too-fast-for-formula-one-drivers/)

Git's autocorrect feature executes a mistyped command after a default delay of 0.1 seconds, which is often too quick for users to cancel. Introduced in 2008, the feature uses a modified Levenshtein distance algorithm to guess the intended command, but defaults to not running any command if mistyped. A proposed patch suggests interpreting a setting of "1" as "immediately" to enhance usability, allowing users to configure the delay or prompt for confirmation.
