## [Thoughts on a Month with Devin](https://www.answer.ai/posts/2025-01-08-devin.html)

- In March 2024, a new AI company introduced Devin, an AI software engineer, with a substantial $21 million investment, aiming to automate tasks from learning new technologies to deploying applications. - Initial demonstrations of Devin were impressive, but testing by Answer.AI revealed mixed results, with Devin excelling in simple tasks like API integrations but struggling with complex projects. - Despite a user-friendly interface, Devin's autonomous nature led to inefficiencies, succeeding in only 3 out of 20 tasks, underscoring the disparity between AI expectations and practical performance.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42734681)

- AI agents, such as Devin, enhance productivity by managing simple tasks but cannot yet replace software engineers due to the need for thorough code review and testing. - Companies relying solely on AI for engineering have encountered problems with code quality, highlighting the current limitations of AI in complex problem-solving. - While AI tools are rapidly advancing, they are presently most effective as supportive tools for human developers, with potential for handling more significant tasks in the future.

## [Some things to expect in 2025](https://lwn.net/Articles/1003780/)

- LWN.net predicts the rise of the extensible scheduling class (sched-ext) in more distributions and an increase in Rust code within the Linux kernel by 2025. - Potential security threats, similar to the XZ backdoor, and challenges from AI-generated code are anticipated, alongside concerns about single-maintainer projects. - The year may witness more open hardware, a resurgence in mobile device distributions, and security issues in cloud-based products, with global conflicts potentially affecting the development community.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42731962)

- By 2025, major projects may face challenges as developers integrate AI-generated code without fully understanding it, similar to past issues with code copied from StackOverflow.
- The increasing use of AI tools in coding can lead to "learning debt," where developers rely on AI without grasping the underlying code, highlighting the need for responsible code comprehension.
- The tech industry must adapt to these changes, balancing the advantages of AI with the necessity for skilled and knowledgeable developers to ensure code quality and accountability.
