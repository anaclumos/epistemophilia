## [OpenAI Furious DeepSeek Might Have Stolen All the Data OpenAI Stole from Us](https://www.404media.co/openai-furious-deepseek-might-have-stolen-all-the-data-openai-stole-from-us/)

OpenAI, Microsoft, and AI expert David Sacks allege that DeepSeek unfairly used OpenAI's data to develop a superior language model. Investigations by Bloomberg and Financial Times are examining if DeepSeek improperly trained its R1 model using OpenAI outputs, potentially through a technique called "distillation," which extracts knowledge from existing models. The situation is notable as OpenAI, often criticized for using data without authorization, is now raising concerns about similar practices by others.

## [Parkinsons patient "feels cured" with new adaptive deep brain stimulation device](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgn49r069wo)

Kevin Hill, a Parkinson's patient, reports feeling "cured" after receiving a groundbreaking brain implant that sends electrical signals to his brain, significantly alleviating his symptoms. The adaptive deep brain stimulation system, developed by Medtronic, automatically adjusts treatment based on brain activity, offering potential improvements in patients' quality of life. With approximately 153,000 people in the UK affected by Parkinson's, this innovation could have a substantial impact as the number of cases is expected to increase.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42857293)

A new adaptive deep brain stimulation (DBS) device is reported to significantly alleviate Parkinson's symptoms, with one patient claiming to "feel cured," though skepticism persists. Critics caution that such reports may offer false hope, as DBS treatments are not universally accessible or affordable, and they do not address all symptoms like dementia or psychosis. While DBS has been used for years and shows promise, more clinical trials are necessary to validate its effectiveness, and it is important to note that it is not a cure for Parkinson's disease.
