## [Self driving 1993 Volvo with open pilot](https://practicapp.com/carbagepilot-part1/)

- A group of friends participated in the Carbage Run 2025 Winter edition, a 6-day rally through Sweden to the polar circle and back to Helsinki, requiring cars to be at least 20 years old and valued under â‚¬1000.
- They transformed a 1993 Volvo 940 Estate into a self-driving vehicle using openpilot from comma.ai, incorporating modern components like electric power steering, a Bosch iBooster, and a Tesla radar sensor.
- Future updates will include details on wiring, a custom Engine Control Unit (ECU), and plans to open-source the code, highlighting the project's innovative approach to retrofitting older vehicles with autonomous technology.

- A 1993 Volvo 940 was retrofitted with OpenPilot, a self-driving technology, highlighting the intersection of classic car design and modern tech.
- The project faced challenges, including updating the brake and steering systems, raising legal and safety concerns, particularly with DIY modifications like welding the steering column.
- The discussion extended to car regulations in Europe, the decline of hotrods in the US, and cultural differences in car modification freedoms, with the project viewed as an inspiring DIY effort despite safety concerns.

## [VoxelSpace: Terrain rendering algorithm in less than 20 lines of code (2020)](https://github.com/s-macke/VoxelSpace)

- NovaLogic's 1992 game Comanche utilized the Voxel Space engine, a 2.5D rendering technique based on ray casting, to create detailed terrains with shading and shadows.
- The Voxel Space engine used height and color maps and a simple rendering algorithm, drawing vertical lines from back to front, which could be optimized for performance.
- The engine's code is available under the MIT license, but the technology may still be patented in certain regions.
