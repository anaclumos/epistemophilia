## [How to improve your WFH lighting to reduce eye strain](https://rustle.ca/posts/articles/work-from-home-lighting)

To minimize eye strain while working from home, create a balanced lighting environment using natural light, sheer curtains, and flicker-free artificial lights. Implement the 20/20/20 rule: every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds to relax your eyes. Complement your workspace with light-filtering curtains and desk lighting that matches monitor brightness, while also taking regular breaks to maintain overall health.

To enhance work-from-home (WFH) lighting and reduce eye strain, use diffuse light from multiple sources and maintain a consistent color temperature. Consider the impact of wall color on lighting and aim for a "Golden Hour" effectâ€”diffuse, warm, and gentle lighting for a photogenic and comfortable environment. Explore LED lighting options, such as high Color Rendering Index (CRI) bulbs, for improved light quality.

## [Federal Court (Finally) Rules Backdoor Searches of Data Unconstitutional](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/01/victory-federal-court-finally-rules-backdoor-searches-702-data-unconstitutional)

A federal district court has ruled that backdoor searches of databases containing Americans' private communications under Section 702 require a warrant, marking a significant legal decision in United States v. Hasbajrami. Despite Congress reauthorizing Section 702, evidence shows misuse by the FBI and intelligence community, with 3.4 million warrantless searches conducted in 2021, prompting calls for reform to ensure constitutional protections. The court's decision highlights the unconstitutional nature of warrantless searches under Section 702, urging Congress to mandate warrants for searches involving U.S. persons' data before its expiration in 2026.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42797756)

A federal court has declared backdoor searches of data unconstitutional, igniting debates on government surveillance and privacy rights. The ruling challenges the constitutionality of Section 702 spying, highlighting the roles of Congress and the Supreme Court in safeguarding privacy. Despite the ruling, skepticism persists about its impact, as critics believe federal agencies like the FBI may continue such practices until internal regulations are revised.

Despite these challenges, F-Droid is valued for its open-source apps, with discussions on app submission processes and the potential integration of progressive web apps (PWAs).

## [Understanding gRPC, OpenAPI and REST and when to use them in API design (2020)](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/api-management/understanding-grpc-openapi-and-rest-and-when-to-use-them)

API design primarily uses two models: gRPC (Remote Procedure Call) and REST (Representational State Transfer), both often mapped to HTTP, with gRPC using HTTP/2 for efficient communication. REST APIs are known for their simplicity and stability, while gRPC offers efficient client libraries and server implementations, making it suitable for internal APIs or when using specific tools like Cloud Endpoints. OpenAPI, similar to RPC, requires constructing URLs from templates, exposing HTTP details, and may involve complex custom HTTP mappings, offering broader HTTP tool compatibility compared to gRPC.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42799245)

Developers often find gRPC challenging due to tooling issues, particularly in Java, and difficulties with debugging and configuration, despite its advantages like bidirectional streaming and efficient transport. OpenAPI is a documentation standard for APIs, facilitating easier client generation and testing, and is often confused with REST, which is rarely implemented in its pure form. The decision to use gRPC, OpenAPI, or REST depends on specific use cases, team expertise, and project requirements, highlighting the importance of understanding each technology's strengths and limitations.

## [Tech takes the Pareto principle too far](https://bobbylox.com/blog/tech-takes-the-pareto-principle-too-far/)

Bobby Lockhart critiques the tech industry's reliance on the Pareto Principle and MVPs, which often result in unfinished products due to insufficient incentives to complete them. He contrasts this with the gaming industry's 'vertical slice' approach, which focuses on creating a polished product from the start. Lockhart advocates for a craftsmanlike approach to software development, emphasizing the importance of completing and refining products for a polished final outcome.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42800557)

The Pareto principle, or the 80/20 rule, is being discussed in the context of tech, particularly in software and product development, suggesting that 80% of effects come from 20% of causes. Critics argue that this principle results in products being marketed as complete despite lacking the final 20% polish, while supporters claim it enables efficient resource use and rapid market entry. The debate spans multiple industries, including gaming and AI, with differing views on whether the principle fosters innovation or leads to mediocrity.

## [I made a multiplayer shooter game in Lisp, here is my journey](https://ertu.dev/posts/i-made-an-online-shooter-game-in-lisp/)

The game "Wizard Masters," a multiplayer third-person shooter, was developed using Clojure, a Lisp dialect, and is available on CrazyGames. Clojure was chosen for its full-stack capabilities and interactive REPL system, while Babylon.js was used for graphics due to its features and community support. Challenges included complex networking with Clojure async libraries, state management with Clojure's immutability, and the lack of a strong Clojure game development community, highlighting the potential benefits of transitioning to mainstream engines like Unity or Unreal for future projects.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42796906)

A multiplayer shooter game was developed using Lisp, with ClojureScript and Babylon.JS for the frontend, and Clojure for the backend, utilizing Websockets for coordination.
