## [Mistakes engineers make in large established codebases](https://www.seangoedecke.com/large-established-codebases/)

- Working in large, established codebases, often with millions of lines of code and involving hundreds of engineers, presents significant challenges for software engineers. - A common mistake is inconsistency, where engineers ignore existing code patterns and implement features in isolation, which can lead to maintenance issues and hinder future improvements. - To effectively work within large codebases, engineers should research existing patterns, understand the codebase's production impact, be cautious with dependencies, and carefully remove unnecessary code to maintain quality and value.
