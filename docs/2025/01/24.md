QR codes can be manipulated to direct users to different destinations by creating overlapping patterns that change based on scanning conditions. This technique can be used for targeted attacks or to serve varied content, but simpler methods like server-side redirection are often more effective. Despite its intriguing nature, the practical use of this QR code manipulation is limited due to its complexity and visibility.

## [The State of Vim](https://lwn.net/Articles/1002342/)

Following the death of Bram Moolenaar, Vim's founder, in 2023, the community has reorganized to ensure the continuation of Vim's development, with Christian Brabandt taking a more active role. The project is addressing challenges such as managing the Vim GitHub organization, updating the website, and considering changes like XDG support, while remaining in maintenance mode. VimConf 2024 in Tokyo highlighted international collaboration, with presentations in English and Japanese, and emphasized community input and careful testing over a single leader approach.

Vim's success under new leadership has sparked discussions on governance models, such as BDFL (Benevolent Dictator For Life), with differing opinions on single leadership versus committee-based approaches. Neovim, a modern alternative to Vim, has gained traction due to its features and community support, though some users remain loyal to Vim for its stability. The conversation highlights the challenges of sustaining open-source projects and the advantages of plugin architectures, with Vim and Emacs continuing to be resilient in the evolving landscape of developer tools.

## [UI is hell: four-function calculators](https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/ui-is-hell-four-function-calculators)

The article explores the complexities in designing user interfaces for basic calculators, focusing on challenges with operations and edge cases. It highlights historical quirks in calculator design, such as the combined "x÷" key and non-intuitive behaviors in some apps. The discussion includes the benefits of Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) for simplifying calculations and reducing ambiguity, alongside user experiences and preferences.

## [Build It Yourself](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/1/24/build-it-yourself/)

Armin Ronacher addresses the problem of dependency churn in software development, especially in JavaScript and Rust ecosystems, where frequent updates and numerous dependencies can lead to security vulnerabilities and complexity. He suggests a shift towards writing code with minimal dependencies, emphasizing the advantages of stable, self-written functions over extensive dependency graphs. Ronacher calls for a cultural change in both corporate and open-source communities to prioritize simplicity and stability in coding practices, which can lead to reduced maintenance and faster implementation.

The text highlights the challenges of managing dependencies in programming, comparing Rust's tendency to accumulate dependencies with C++'s control over them. It discusses security concerns related to package management systems, contrasting Debian/Ubuntu's systems with Docker/Python/Rust, and raises trust issues with unknown maintainers. The conversation emphasizes the importance of balancing the use of existing libraries with writing custom code to minimize complexity and security risks, considering long-term implications.
