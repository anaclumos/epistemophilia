## [Hitting OKRs vs. Doing Your Job](https://jessitron.com/2025/01/05/hitting-okrs-vs-doing-your-job/)

- In Engineering, quarterly Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) often seem redundant as they tend to mirror product roadmaps, leading to potential conflicts if they differ.
- Marketing finds OKRs beneficial for defining quarterly focus, aligning with project timelines, and highlighting new campaigns or audiences, while ongoing tasks are tracked by Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
- Effective OKRs should emphasize unique or changing priorities each quarter, rather than routine tasks, to avoid stagnation and ensure they provide value beyond the roadmap.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42607623)

- OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) can sometimes misalign with actual work, emphasizing metrics over meaningful contributions and potentially leading to gaming the system rather than addressing real issues.
- Effective implementation of OKRs requires alignment with customer needs and company goals, but this alignment is often difficult to achieve, leading to bureaucratic processes and a lack of trust in employees' intrinsic motivation.
- In large organizations, OKRs can foster competition instead of collaboration, focusing on visible rather than valuable work, thus failing to capture the complexity of tasks.
