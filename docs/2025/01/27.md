## [A layoff fundamentally changed how I perceive work](https://mertbulan.com/2025/01/26/once-you-are-laid-off-you-will-never-be-the-same-again/)

The author received an unexpected layoff notice from their company's COO, despite previous assurances that layoffs wouldn't occur, indicating a disconnect between company communication and actions. The experience led to a loss of trust in modern work environments, where employees feel disposable even when companies are financially stable, prompting a shift towards minimal effort and job security skepticism. In Germany, labor laws prioritize protecting vulnerable employees during layoffs, but this does not guarantee job security for all, leading to advice for employees to adhere strictly to contract hours and seek other job opportunities.
