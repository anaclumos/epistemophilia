## [Right to root access](https://medhir.com/blog/right-to-root-access)

- Consumers should have the right to install any software on devices they own, but companies often lock bootloaders and restrict root access, limiting user control. - While security is a valid concern, these restrictions are seen as anti-consumer and anti-competitive, contributing to e-waste and limiting repair options. - Advocates suggest that a "right to root access" should be included in right to repair discussions, with exceptions for critical systems where risks are too high.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42677835)

- The debate on root access in devices underscores the conflict between consumer freedom and vendor control, with many advocating for the right to install any software on owned devices. - Critics argue that vendor-imposed restrictions prioritize profit over consumer control and privacy, limiting users' ability to modify their devices. - The discussion extends to broader themes of property rights and the autonomy to manage one's own devices, with differing views on the security benefits of locked devices versus informed consumer choice.

## [Doom (1993) in a PDF](https://doompdf.pages.dev/doom.pdf)

- A developer has created a Doom source port that operates within a PDF file, inspired by a similar Tetris project. - The project uses an older version of Emscripten to compile C code to asm.js, allowing it to run in the PDF's JavaScript runtime. - The implementation includes a 6-color monochrome display and is compatible only with Chromium-based browsers using the PDFium engine.

## [How did they make cars fall apart in old movies (2017)](https://movies.stackexchange.com/questions/79161/how-did-they-make-cars-fall-apart-in-old-movies)

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42679127)

- In older films, practical effects were used to make cars fall apart, as seen in the 1965 French film "Le Corniaud," where a car was disassembled and reassembled with hooks and explosive bolts for a scene.
- These stunts required detailed planning and engineering, facilitated by the simpler construction of cars at the time.
- Modern films would likely use CGI (Computer-Generated Imagery) for similar scenes due to the complexity and safety standards of contemporary vehicles.

## [Standard patterns in choice-based games (2015)](https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2015/01/26/standard-patterns-in-choice-based-games/)

- The blog post by Sam Kabo Ashwell explores recurring design patterns in choice-based games, including Time Cave, Gauntlet, Branch and Bottleneck, and others, which affect gameplay and narrative structure.
- These patterns influence player experience and story progression, with examples from interactive fiction illustrating their application.
- The post notes that these patterns are flexible and can overlap, rather than being strict categories in game design.

### [Reactions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42678647)

- Choice-based games use narrative branching to enhance player agency, but this can lead to "Time Caves," where some paths are overly detailed, and others are underdeveloped, causing players to miss key content.
- Tools can assist in creating a main story trunk with side paths that rejoin, but branching remains complex and resource-intensive, prompting some to advocate for linear stories or sandbox mechanics.
- Games like Disco Elysium and Nier Automata are noted for their successful use of branching, and there is discussion on AI's potential to dynamically generate story paths, though current technology may not yet achieve coherent narratives.
