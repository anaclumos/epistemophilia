      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>In November 2023, a meme trend involved users asking ChatGPT to iteratively enhance images, which was then applied to code using Claude 3.5 Sonnet to improve a Python program. - Initial attempts with vague prompts like &quot;write better code&quot; showed some improvements, but structured prompt engineering with specific optimization goals led to significant performance enhancements. - The experiment underscored the importance of human oversight, as while Large Language Models (LLMs) can offer innovative ideas, they may also introduce subtle bugs during code optimization.</li>

<li>A U.S. Appeals Court has invalidated the FCC&#39;s net neutrality rules, which mandated equal treatment of internet traffic by broadband providers, citing the FCC&#39;s overreach of legal authority.</li>
<li>The decision references a Supreme Court ruling that restricts the powers of regulatory agencies, impacting the FCC&#39;s ability to enforce net neutrality.</li>
<li>FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel called for Congress to legislate net neutrality, while Commissioner Brendan Carr supported the court&#39;s decision as a check on regulatory overreach.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Harold Aptroot discovered that the SHLX instruction on Intel&#39;s Alder Lake processors exhibits a &quot;medium latency&quot; of 3 cycles, which is atypical for left-shift operations that usually take 1 cycle. - This latency issue is specific to Alder Lake&#39;s performance cores and does not affect the efficiency cores, contradicting Intel&#39;s claims of a 1-cycle latency. - The latency varies based on the initialization of the shift count register, with 32-bit instructions or 64-bit instructions without immediates achieving 1-cycle latency, while 64-bit instructions with immediates result in 3-cycle latency.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>API Parrot is a new tool designed to simplify the automation of business processes by automatically identifying data correlations between API requests and providing a graphical flow representation. - It allows users to record requests, define inputs and outputs, and export these flows as JavaScript code, making the process more efficient than manual reverse engineering or using less optimal technologies like Robotic Process Automation (RPA). - The tool is built on Electron and is available for both Windows and Linux platforms, with a tutorial available for reverse engineering the USPS API.</li>

<li>Ghostty, a new terminal emulator, had a security vulnerability similar to one from 2003, allowing ASCII escape characters to execute commands like opening applications. - The issue was notably problematic with Zsh and Bash in vi mode, but Ghostty 1.0.1 has resolved this by disabling the feature by default. - Despite the security flaw, Ghostty is commended for its features, and the developer promptly addressed the issue, providing fixes and workarounds for users.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Mark Rejhon, in collaboration with Timothy Lottes, has introduced a new open-source algorithm for simulating CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) displays, available on Shadertoy and GitHub.- This algorithm reduces motion blur on 240Hz+ displays and offers a softer flicker compared to BFI (Black Frame Insertion), and has been integrated into the Retroarch emulator.- The simulation is compatible with LCDs and OLEDs, providing real-time and slow-motion modes, and is particularly effective for reducing motion blur in legacy 60fps content.</li>
