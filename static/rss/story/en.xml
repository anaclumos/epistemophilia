<li>David Bessis, a mathematician, posits that mathematical thinking, which balances intuition and logic, is beneficial for everyone, enhancing creativity and understanding.- In his book &quot;Mathematica: A Secret World of Intuition and Curiosity,&quot; Bessis likens mathematical thinking to a dialogue between reason and instinct, akin to yoga, and emphasizes it as a skill developed through practice.- Bessis views math as a universal life lesson that can bring joy, clarity, and self-confidence, suggesting it is not just problem-solving but a form of self-help.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>A University of Alberta study indicates that weight-loss drugs such as Ozempic may lead to heart and muscle shrinkage, raising concerns about potential long-term health effects.</li>
<li>The study observed heart muscle loss in both mice and human cells, prompting researchers to recommend monitoring heart health in users of these drugs.</li>
<li>Experts suggest that up to 40% of weight loss from these drugs is muscle, advising users to maintain muscle mass through proper nutrition and resistance training during treatment.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Underjord, an Elixir consulting team, investigates Erlang&#39;s hot code updates, a distinctive feature allowing code changes without stopping the system.</li>
<li>Although Elixir, based on Erlang, supports hot code updates, the standard mix release lacks the necessary files, prompting experts to recommend learning this skill.</li>
<li>Hot code updates are particularly useful in development with Nerves for embedded devices, and more tooling in Elixir could enhance this process.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>BM25, or Best Match 25, is a widely used algorithm for full-text search, implemented in systems like Lucene/Elasticsearch and SQLite, and often paired with vector similarity search in hybrid search systems.</li>
<li>It ranks documents based on relevance to a query using factors such as query terms, Inverse Document Frequency (IDF), term frequency, and document length normalization, following the Probability Ranking Principle.</li>
<li>BM25 scores are context-specific, meaning they are comparable within the same document collection but not across different collections or over time, due to potential changes in the collection affecting scores.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The paper critiques TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) as outdated for modern datacenters, citing issues like stream orientation and in-order packet delivery.- It proposes Homa as a replacement, which addresses these TCP limitations but is not API-compatible with TCP.- Homa&#39;s adoption could be facilitated through integration with RPC (Remote Procedure Call) frameworks, making it more accessible for widespread use.</li>

<li>Bluesky is gaining traction as an alternative to X, but it is not yet fully decentralized or federated, relying on its own servers.- The platform employs the AT Protocol, which includes Personal Data Servers, Relays, and App Views, allowing users to host their own data, though this requires technical expertise and can be costly.- While Bluesky is free and offers features like domain-based usernames and customizable moderation, its financial model depends on domain sales, raising questions about its long-term sustainability.</li>

<li>YC&#39;s proposal to use Large Language Models (LLMs) for chip design is criticized for not matching the expertise of human engineers in creating innovative chip architectures.</li>
<li>While LLMs might lower design costs, they are unlikely to revolutionize chip design in high-value markets, similar to past attempts like high-level synthesis (HLS).</li>
<li>LLMs could be beneficial in verification processes, potentially addressing the talent shortage in this area, but they are not expected to produce superior chips or open new markets.</li>

<li>Following the official AWS Amplify guide for OpenSearch integration can lead to unexpectedly high costs, as experienced by a user who received a $1,100 bill.</li>
<li>AWS support adjusted the bill and recommended setting up budget alerts, highlighting the importance of monitoring AWS services and pricing.</li>
<li>The guide&#39;s complexity and default settings can be misleading, especially for those new to AWS, emphasizing the need for understanding the technology and using AWS budget tools to prevent unforeseen expenses.</li>

<li>The study by Hunter Ng investigates &quot;ghost hiring,&quot; where employers post job ads without the intention of filling them, using data from Glassdoor and LLM-BERT analysis.- It reveals that up to 21% of job ads could be ghost jobs, particularly in specialized industries and larger companies, contributing to job market issues such as the Beveridge Curve disconnect.- The study suggests that policymakers should address ghost hiring as it leads to job fatigue and distorts market signals.</li>

<li>Despite the widespread integration of digital devices in classrooms, the anticipated academic improvements have not been realized, with global test scores in math, science, and reading declining.- Studies indicate that frequent computer use in schools often leads to poorer learning outcomes, primarily due to the encouragement of multitasking, which hinders effective learning.- Some regions, such as Europe and Southeast Asia, are shifting back to traditional teaching methods, suggesting that American schools might also benefit from reducing digital reliance in education.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Shae Erisson&#39;s blog explores a GitHub plugin concept to calculate a project&#39;s &quot;bus factor,&quot; which indicates how many team members can leave before a project is jeopardized.</li>
<li>The idea was inspired by a 2015 layoff experience, but there are concerns it could be misused by management to identify expendable employees.</li>
<li>Shae and collaborator mclare faced technical challenges but calculated a truck factor of 12 for the Linux kernel, suggesting a decline from the original study&#39;s 80, indicating bus factors have worsened over time.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>MIT engineers found that exercise aids nerve healing by releasing myokines during muscle contractions, which significantly promote neuron growth.- Neurons exposed to myokines grew four times farther than those not exposed, and physical stretching of neurons also stimulated growth, mimicking muscle contractions.- The study suggests exercise-related therapies could be crucial for nerve repair, potentially leading to treatments for nerve injuries and neurodegenerative diseases.</li>
