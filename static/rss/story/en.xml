<li>The post addresses the &quot;Onion Problem,&quot; which involves cutting onions to achieve minimal variance in slice volumes for uniformity.- A mathematical exploration using calculus determined the optimal cutting point is 55.73066% below the onion&#39;s center, termed the &quot;true onion constant.&quot;- This finding refines a previous suggestion of cutting towards a point 60% below the center, providing a more precise method for even onion slices.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>In 1945, Finland implemented &quot;setelinleikkaus,&quot; a policy requiring citizens to cut large banknotes in half to combat post-WWII inflation, with one half retaining value and the other becoming a government bond.- The policy was ineffective as it only targeted physical cash, a minor part of the money supply, unlike more successful reforms in other European countries like Belgium.- The article speculates that future inflation control might involve digital account freezes, a more precise but potentially controversial method.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Researchers from Johns Hopkins University have uncovered what could be the oldest known alphabetic writing, dating to approximately 2400 BCE, in a Syrian tomb.</li>
<li>This discovery suggests that alphabetic writing is 500 years older than previously believed, potentially altering the understanding of its origins.</li>
<li>The writing, found on clay cylinders at Tell Umm-el Marra in Syria, predates known scripts from Egypt and will be presented at the American Society of Overseas Research&#39;s Annual Meeting.</li>

<li>Ken Shirriff&#39;s blog delves into computer history, with a focus on vintage computers and integrated circuit (IC) reverse engineering, providing insights into the complexities of chip design and manufacturing.</li>
<li>In a post about the Pentium processor, he explains &quot;antenna diodes,&quot; which protect circuitry from plasma-induced charges during the etching process, a critical aspect of manufacturing.</li>
<li>Despite being released in 1993 with 3.1 million transistors, the Pentium&#39;s use of antenna diodes is limited due to space constraints, highlighting ongoing challenges in modern IC design to mitigate antenna effects.</li>

<li>A study in the Journal of University Teaching &amp; Learning Practice examines the use of Z-Library, a shadow library providing free books and academic articles, highlighting high costs and limited access as primary motivators.</li>
<li>Chinese postgraduate students, among others, use Z-Library to combat academic poverty, viewing it as crucial for academic success despite legal issues faced by the platform.</li>
<li>The study recommends that universities and publishers increase free access to content to bridge digital divides and address the needs of students relying on such resources.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>A University of Alberta study indicates that weight-loss drugs such as Ozempic may lead to heart and muscle shrinkage, raising concerns about potential long-term health effects.</li>
<li>The study observed heart muscle loss in both mice and human cells, prompting researchers to recommend monitoring heart health in users of these drugs.</li>
<li>Experts suggest that up to 40% of weight loss from these drugs is muscle, advising users to maintain muscle mass through proper nutrition and resistance training during treatment.</li>
