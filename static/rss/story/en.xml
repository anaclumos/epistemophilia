<li>In March 2024, a new AI company introduced Devin, an AI software engineer, with a substantial $21 million investment, aiming to automate tasks from learning new technologies to deploying applications. - Initial demonstrations of Devin were impressive, but testing by Answer.AI revealed mixed results, with Devin excelling in simple tasks like API integrations but struggling with complex projects. - Despite a user-friendly interface, Devin&#39;s autonomous nature led to inefficiencies, succeeding in only 3 out of 20 tasks, underscoring the disparity between AI expectations and practical performance.</li>

<li>Zeke Gabrielse, founder of Keygen, initially avoided sales calls due to his introverted nature, implementing a &#39;no calls&#39; policy, which led to more direct interactions and his first enterprise sale.</li>
<li>Gabrielse identified four key issues to address for a successful &#39;no calls&#39; approach: unclear offerings, poor onboarding, hidden pricing, and lack of trust, suggesting clear messaging, transparent pricing, self-serve onboarding, and trust-building documentation.</li>
<li>While some enterprises still expect calls, Keygen uses brief &#39;discovery calls&#39; to transition to email discussions, and Gabrielse encourages others to consider a #nocalls approach if it aligns with their style.</li>

<li>OpenAI missed its 2025 deadline for releasing Media Manager, a tool designed to help photographers opt out of having their work used in AI training data.</li>
<li>The tool aimed to identify copyrighted content and address copyright disputes, but it appears to have been deprioritized, with no updates since August.</li>
<li>Photographers currently face a cumbersome process of submitting each work they want excluded, leading to criticism that the system is unfair and unlikely to be widely adopted.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Cosine similarity, a method for comparing vectors, can be misleading if used without understanding the context, as it may not accurately capture semantic similarities. - Embeddings, such as those from word2vec or sentence embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs), require careful and intentional use to ensure they reflect the desired relationships. - To improve vector similarity results, consider using LLMs directly, creating task-specific embeddings through fine-tuning, and ensuring text is clean and prompts are well-engineered before embedding.</li>

<li>Apple is testing processors from TSMC&#39;s Arizona facility, with plans for mass production by the first quarter, potentially becoming TSMC&#39;s first U.S. customer for locally manufactured chips. - This initiative aims to bolster U.S. silicon independence, reducing dependency on Taiwan, which is vulnerable to geopolitical and natural risks. - TSMC&#39;s Arizona fab is set to produce advanced 3nm and 2nm chips, with ongoing efforts to enhance local recruitment and partnerships with U.S. universities, although packaging will initially occur in Taiwan until the Peoria facility is operational.</li>

<li>Matt Mullenweg, co-founder of WordPress, has disbanded the WordPress Sustainability Team, leading to significant backlash from the community.</li>
<li>The team was dissolved following the resignation of team representative Thijs Buijs, who cited leadership issues, and Mullenweg&#39;s claim that the team was not meeting its objectives.</li>
<li>Critics have accused Mullenweg of hypocrisy, as he initially supported the team&#39;s formation, and the disbandment has raised concerns about the future of sustainability initiatives within WordPress.</li>

<li>In 2006, Joshua Bloch identified a bug in the binary search algorithm, initially noted in Jon Bentley&#39;s &quot;Programming Pearls,&quot; where an overflow occurs when &#39;low&#39; and &#39;high&#39; exceed the maximum int value.</li>
<li>This bug, affecting arrays with lengths of 2^30 or more, was rare in the 1980s but is more common today, also impacting mergesort and other divide-and-conquer algorithms.</li>
<li>Bloch recommends fixing the issue by calculating the midpoint as <code>int mid = low + ((high - low) / 2);</code>, highlighting the challenges of writing error-free code and the necessity of thorough testing.</li>

<li>The post discusses data structure flattening, a technique for compilers that optimizes abstract syntax trees (ASTs) by using a single array with indices instead of pointers. - This method enhances performance by improving memory locality, reducing reference size, and simplifying memory management, resulting in a 2.4× speedup in a microbenchmark. - The technique is notably used in Rust projects and offers ergonomic benefits, such as easier memory management, and is compared to bytecode interpreters for further performance improvements.</li>
