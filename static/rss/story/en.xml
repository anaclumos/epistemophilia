<li>AMD has disabled the loop buffer in its Zen 4 CPUs, a feature intended for power optimization rather than performance enhancement.- Performance tests indicate negligible differences with the loop buffer disabled, as the op cache compensates with sufficient bandwidth.- The decision to disable the loop buffer, possibly due to a hardware bug, is unlikely to significantly impact performance or power consumption, and the feature was not widely documented by AMD.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>A 2024 benchmark tested memory consumption for running 1 million concurrent tasks using coroutines across various programming languages, including Rust, C#, Go, and Java.- C# with NativeAOT demonstrated the best memory efficiency, outperforming other languages, while Go consumed more memory than anticipated, even more than Java with GraalVM.- The study underscores that some languages, like .NET with NativeAOT and Java&#39;s GraalVM, have improved scalability, whereas Go&#39;s goroutines were less efficient, and Rust&#39;s memory usage was optimized by adjusting task handling.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The article introduces &quot;prospective configuration,&quot; a novel credit assignment principle in learning, as an alternative to the traditional backpropagation method.</li>
<li>Prospective configuration involves neural networks predicting desired neural activity patterns before adjusting synaptic weights, enhancing efficiency and effectiveness in learning.</li>
<li>This method aligns more closely with observed neural activity in human and animal studies and may offer advantages in both biological and artificial learning systems over backpropagation.</li>

<li>The post addresses the &quot;Onion Problem,&quot; which involves cutting onions to achieve minimal variance in slice volumes for uniformity.- A mathematical exploration using calculus determined the optimal cutting point is 55.73066% below the onion&#39;s center, termed the &quot;true onion constant.&quot;- This finding refines a previous suggestion of cutting towards a point 60% below the center, providing a more precise method for even onion slices.</li>

<li>In 1945, Finland implemented &quot;setelinleikkaus,&quot; a policy requiring citizens to cut large banknotes in half to combat post-WWII inflation, with one half retaining value and the other becoming a government bond.- The policy was ineffective as it only targeted physical cash, a minor part of the money supply, unlike more successful reforms in other European countries like Belgium.- The article speculates that future inflation control might involve digital account freezes, a more precise but potentially controversial method.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Researchers from Johns Hopkins University have uncovered what could be the oldest known alphabetic writing, dating to approximately 2400 BCE, in a Syrian tomb.</li>
<li>This discovery suggests that alphabetic writing is 500 years older than previously believed, potentially altering the understanding of its origins.</li>
<li>The writing, found on clay cylinders at Tell Umm-el Marra in Syria, predates known scripts from Egypt and will be presented at the American Society of Overseas Research&#39;s Annual Meeting.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Ken Shirriff&#39;s blog delves into computer history, with a focus on vintage computers and integrated circuit (IC) reverse engineering, providing insights into the complexities of chip design and manufacturing.</li>
<li>In a post about the Pentium processor, he explains &quot;antenna diodes,&quot; which protect circuitry from plasma-induced charges during the etching process, a critical aspect of manufacturing.</li>
<li>Despite being released in 1993 with 3.1 million transistors, the Pentium&#39;s use of antenna diodes is limited due to space constraints, highlighting ongoing challenges in modern IC design to mitigate antenna effects.</li>

<li>The European Space Agency (ESA) has released the highest-resolution images of the sun&#39;s surface, captured by the Solar Orbiter in March 2023, from less than 46 million miles away.</li>
<li>The Solar Orbiter, a joint mission with NASA launched in 2020, has achieved milestones such as capturing the closest images of the sun and its polar regions.</li>
<li>The new images, taken by the Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (PHI) and the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI), provide unprecedented detail of the sun&#39;s magnetic fields and outer atmosphere, aiming to enhance understanding of the sun&#39;s dynamic nature.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Fabien Sanglard&#39;s review praises Quake 3&#39;s network model for its efficient use of UDP/IP, which is preferred over TCP/IP to minimize latency in fast-paced gaming environments.</li>
<li>The server manages UDP&#39;s unreliability by using snapshot histories to create delta packets, ensuring efficient communication between the client and server.</li>
<li>The NetChannel module pre-fragments messages to prevent router fragmentation, and handles guaranteed delivery for certain messages, enhancing the overall network performance.</li>
