<ul>
<li>In 1970, IBM&#39;s Bill Harding initiated Project SWIFT, aiming to automate wafer-fabrication to produce integrated circuits (ICs) in under a day, a significant reduction from the typical month-long process.- SWIFT achieved a 5-hour turnaround per layer, a feat still unmatched, and introduced innovations like automated processing and real-time control, foundational to modern semiconductor manufacturing.- Despite its brief existence, Project SWIFT&#39;s advancements and Harding&#39;s visionary leadership significantly influenced the evolution of semiconductor production techniques.</li>

<li>The US Copyright Office has rejected a DMCA exemption request that aimed to allow libraries to remotely share digital access to preserved video games, concluding a three-year campaign by the Video Game History Foundation (VGHF) and the Software Preservation Network.</li>
<li>The proposed exemption would have facilitated a digital library for historians and researchers to access out-of-print games, but was denied due to concerns about potential recreational use and market harm, as argued by industry groups.</li>
