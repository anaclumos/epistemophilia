<h2><a href="https://p.migdal.pl/blog/2025/01/dont-use-cosine-similarity/">Don&#39;t use cosine similarity carelessly</a></h2>
<p>Cosine similarity, a method for comparing vectors, can be misleading if used without understanding the context, as it may not accurately capture semantic similarities. - Embeddings, such as those from word2vec or sentence embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs), require careful and intentional use to ensure they reflect the desired relationships. - To improve vector similarity results, consider using LLMs directly, creating task-specific embeddings through fine-tuning, and ensuring text is clean and prompts are well-engineered before embedding. </p>
<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42704078">Reactions</a></h3>
<p>In Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications, using a &quot;semantic re-ranker&quot; can enhance the matching of user queries when employing cosine similarity. - Avoid storing vector embeddings of empty content, as they can lead to false matches; some projects use special encodings to represent &quot;nothingness&quot; to prevent this issue. - Exploring alternatives such as Large Language Models (LLMs), cross-encoders, L2 re-ranking models, or graph-based methods can provide more accurate retrieval results than relying solely on cosine similarity. </p>
