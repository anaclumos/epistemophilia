<h2><a href="https://tavianator.com/2025/shlx.html">The Alder Lake SHLX Anomaly</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Harold Aptroot discovered that the SHLX instruction on Intel&#39;s Alder Lake processors exhibits a &quot;medium latency&quot; of 3 cycles, which is atypical for left-shift operations that usually take 1 cycle. - This latency issue is specific to Alder Lake&#39;s performance cores and does not affect the efficiency cores, contradicting Intel&#39;s claims of a 1-cycle latency. - The latency varies based on the initialization of the shift count register, with 32-bit instructions or 64-bit instructions without immediates achieving 1-cycle latency, while 64-bit instructions with immediates result in 3-cycle latency.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42579969">Reactions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The Alder Lake SHLX Anomaly is a performance issue where specific instructions, such as <code>mov rcx, 1</code>, cause the <code>SHLX</code> instruction to execute slower, potentially due to the register renamer&#39;s handling of small immediates.</li>
<li>This anomaly can lead to a 3x slowdown and is challenging to reproduce because context switches may reset the register state, inadvertently speeding up the code.</li>
<li>The issue is newly discovered and primarily affects shift counts, impacting instructions like <code>SHL</code>, but not others like <code>ANDN</code>, and is not typically accounted for by compilers.</li>

<h2><a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=YXnwlZe0yf&noteId=yrsGpHd0Sf">30% Drop In o1-Preview Accuracy When Putnam Problems Are Slightly Variated</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Putnam-AXIOM is a benchmark designed to assess large language models (LLMs) on advanced mathematical reasoning using problems from the Putnam Mathematical Competition. - The benchmark includes 236 original problems and a variation with 52 altered problems to avoid data contamination. - OpenAI&#39;s top-performing model achieved 41.95% accuracy on the original problems but experienced a significant performance drop of approximately 30% on the altered problems, highlighting challenges in adapting to variations.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42565606">Reactions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A study revealed a 30% decrease in the accuracy of the o1-Preview model on Putnam problems when minor variations were introduced, indicating challenges for Large Language Models (LLMs) with small changes. - The findings fuel the debate on whether LLMs can genuinely reason or if they primarily depend on pattern matching and memorization, similar to human errors under pressure. - Despite these challenges, models like o1 and o3 continue to perform well on complex mathematical problems, though their capacity to generalize is still under scrutiny.</li>
