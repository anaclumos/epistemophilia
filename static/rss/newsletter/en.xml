<h2><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15042">Compiling C to Safe Rust, Formalized</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The paper by Aymeric Fromherz and Jonathan Protzenko discusses translating C code to safe Rust, focusing on memory safety by avoiding unsafe Rust features.</li>
<li>The authors introduce a type-directed translation method, static analysis using &quot;split trees&quot; for pointer arithmetic, and a strategy for handling C&#39;s struct types in Rust.</li>
<li>Their approach successfully translates the HACL* cryptographic library and EverParse&#39;s binary parsers into a verified 80,000-line cryptographic library in pure Rust, maintaining performance with minimal strategic copies.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42476192">Reactions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Converting C code to Safe Rust is difficult due to fundamental language differences, particularly Rust&#39;s ownership model, which requires significant redesign for safety.- Tools like C2Rust assist in translation, but the process is complex, and some C programs can&#39;t be ported without changing their semantics due to inherent unsafety.- While translating C to Rust can enhance safety and reveal bugs, Rust&#39;s safety is often misunderstood, and formal verification of C code, which aids translation, is not always available.</li>

<h2><a href="https://lodev.org/cgtutor/xortexture.html">The XOR Texture (2004)</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>XOR textures are generated by applying the XOR operation on the x and y coordinates of a pixel, making them simple to create and useful for testing texture mappers.- While XOR textures are not suitable for demos or games due to their overuse, they can be adjusted using different RGB values or converted from HSV to RGB for varied color effects.- Similar textures can be created using AND and OR operations, with XOR returning 1 if bits differ, AND if both bits are 1, and OR if any bit is 1.</li>

<ul>
<li>OpenERV is an initiative to develop an open-source energy recovery ventilator (ERV) system, but users are concerned about the lack of comprehensive documentation, which may deter DIY enthusiasts.</li>
<li>The absence of 3D files for the recovery core, a vital ERV component, has led to skepticism about the project&#39;s open-source claims, suggesting a possible marketing focus.</li>
<li>The project holds promise, particularly for northern climates, and the creator is enhancing the system with plans for testing by the PassiveHaus institute, indicating potential future improvements.</li>

<li>Smart TVs are prone to quick obsolescence due to outdated software and bloatware, and they pose privacy risks by collecting user data.</li>
<li>Dumb TVs, which focus on display quality and longevity, can last over a decade and offer a more private viewing experience when paired with streaming devices like Roku or Chromecast.</li>
<li>To appeal to tech-savvy consumers, dumb TVs need enhancements in display quality, size, and connectivity, and should be marketed as a privacy-conscious alternative.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42425398">Reactions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The resurgence of &quot;dumb TVs&quot; is suggested, as smart TVs profit manufacturers through data collection and advertisements.</li>
<li>While some smart TVs can function as dumb TVs by avoiding internet connectivity, future models may mandate connectivity.</li>
