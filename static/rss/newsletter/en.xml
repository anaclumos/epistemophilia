<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42476828">Reactions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A US judge has held Israel&#39;s NSO Group accountable for hacking journalists through WhatsApp, raising questions about the responsibility of companies in hacking and surveillance activities.</li>
<li>The case underscores ethical concerns related to the sale and use of cyber tools, likening them to traditional weapons sales, and prompting discussions on potential legal consequences for management.</li>
<li>It also brings attention to broader issues such as privacy, government surveillance, and the responsibility of social media companies in safeguarding user data.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15042">Compiling C to Safe Rust, Formalized</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The paper by Aymeric Fromherz and Jonathan Protzenko discusses translating C code to safe Rust, focusing on memory safety by avoiding unsafe Rust features.</li>
<li>The authors introduce a type-directed translation method, static analysis using &quot;split trees&quot; for pointer arithmetic, and a strategy for handling C&#39;s struct types in Rust.</li>
<li>Their approach successfully translates the HACL* cryptographic library and EverParse&#39;s binary parsers into a verified 80,000-line cryptographic library in pure Rust, maintaining performance with minimal strategic copies.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42476192">Reactions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Converting C code to Safe Rust is difficult due to fundamental language differences, particularly Rust&#39;s ownership model, which requires significant redesign for safety.- Tools like C2Rust assist in translation, but the process is complex, and some C programs can&#39;t be ported without changing their semantics due to inherent unsafety.- While translating C to Rust can enhance safety and reveal bugs, Rust&#39;s safety is often misunderstood, and formal verification of C code, which aids translation, is not always available.</li>

</ul>
<h2><a href="https://www.os2museum.com/wp/dos-append/">DOS APPEND</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The OS/2 Museum blog explores vintage PC computing, with a focus on OS/2, DOS, and related subjects.- A recent post highlights the DOS APPEND command, a Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) program that aids older DOS applications in accessing files across different directories, first introduced in DOS 3.3.- The post delves into the history, evolution, and implementation of APPEND, discussing its significance in modern computing contexts.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42475011">Reactions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The DOS APPEND command was historically significant for modifying assembler behavior without changing the assembler, akin to modern environment variables and overlayfs mounts.</li>
<li>DOS commands like SUBST and JOIN were used for directory mapping and path management, helping to overcome path length limitations.</li>
<li>The discussion includes DOS&#39;s historical development on DEC minicomputers and the evolution of computing hardware from minicomputers to current systems.</li>
