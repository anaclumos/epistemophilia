<h2><a href="https://p.migdal.pl/blog/2025/01/dont-use-cosine-similarity/">Don&#39;t use cosine similarity carelessly</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Cosine similarity, a method for comparing vectors, can be misleading if used without understanding the context, as it may not accurately capture semantic similarities. - Embeddings, such as those from word2vec or sentence embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs), require careful and intentional use to ensure they reflect the desired relationships. - To improve vector similarity results, consider using LLMs directly, creating task-specific embeddings through fine-tuning, and ensuring text is clean and prompts are well-engineered before embedding.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42704078">Reactions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>In Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications, using a &quot;semantic re-ranker&quot; can enhance the matching of user queries when employing cosine similarity. - Avoid storing vector embeddings of empty content, as they can lead to false matches; some projects use special encodings to represent &quot;nothingness&quot; to prevent this issue. - Exploring alternatives such as Large Language Models (LLMs), cross-encoders, L2 re-ranking models, or graph-based methods can provide more accurate retrieval results than relying solely on cosine similarity.</li>

<ul>
<li>Choice-based games use narrative branching to enhance player agency, but this can lead to &quot;Time Caves,&quot; where some paths are overly detailed, and others are underdeveloped, causing players to miss key content.</li>
<li>Tools can assist in creating a main story trunk with side paths that rejoin, but branching remains complex and resource-intensive, prompting some to advocate for linear stories or sandbox mechanics.</li>
<li>Games like Disco Elysium and Nier Automata are noted for their successful use of branching, and there is discussion on AI&#39;s potential to dynamically generate story paths, though current technology may not yet achieve coherent narratives.</li>

<h2><a href="https://blog.yossarian.net/2025/01/10/Be-aware-of-the-Makefile-effect">Be Aware of the Makefile Effect</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The &quot;Makefile effect&quot; describes the practice of engineers copying and modifying existing complex configurations, like Makefiles, instead of creating new ones from scratch. - This approach is prevalent in various systems, such as Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) configurations and build systems, and can indicate overly complex or poorly designed tools. - While not inherently negative, the Makefile effect can impede learning, complicate security, and lead to inefficient debugging, highlighting the need for thoughtful tool design that considers configurability and ease of use.</li>

<ul>
<li>The &quot;Makefile Effect&quot; describes developers&#39; tendency to copy and modify code or configurations without fully understanding them, often due to tool complexity or infrequent use.</li>
<li>This phenomenon is widespread across programming and configuration tasks, where developers use known solutions to save time and effort, potentially leading to difficult-to-maintain code.</li>
<li>The discussion emphasizes the need to balance using templates and existing solutions with gaining a deeper understanding of the tools and systems involved.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="https://30fps.net/pages/pvs-portals-and-quake/">Portals and Quake</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The article is the first in the &quot;Demystifying the PVS&quot; series, focusing on Quake&#39;s precomputed visibility system to address overdraw, where pixels are rendered multiple times. - Quake uses portal culling and potentially visible sets (PVS) by dividing the world into cells and portals, precomputing visibility to optimize rendering. - The article introduces the Portal and Leaf classes in vis.py, a Python reimplementation of Quake&#39;s visibility algorithm, highlighting the use of a leaf-to-leaf visibility matrix.</li>

<ul>
<li>Quake level designers utilized &quot;hint&quot; brushes and &quot;area portals&quot; to optimize game performance, a technique that has been foundational in 3D graphics. - Games like Prey and Portal brought portals into the spotlight for gameplay mechanics, though the concept has been used in rendering since early 3D graphics. - Unreal Engine 1 employed zones for optimization, and contemporary engines like Unreal Engine 5 continue to use similar methods to enhance rendering efficiency.</li>

<h2><a href="https://www.charlespetzold.com/blog/2025/01/Very-Wrong-Math.html">Very Wrong Math</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>A design and construction company made a math error on Facebook, incorrectly calculating the Earth&#39;s radius as 4,333 feet, leading to a vastly underestimated circumference of just over 5 miles.</li>
<li>The error stemmed from calculating arc lengths without using the Earth&#39;s actual radius, which is approximately 3,959 miles.</li>
<li>The post highlighted that the outer arc was less than 1% longer than the inner arc, suggesting a potential reduction in flight time due to decreased air resistance.</li>

<h2><a href="https://research.google/blog/extra-extra-read-all-about-it-nearly-all-binary-searches-and-mergesorts-are-broken/">Nearly all binary searches and mergesorts are broken (2006)</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>In 2006, Joshua Bloch identified a bug in the binary search algorithm, initially noted in Jon Bentley&#39;s &quot;Programming Pearls,&quot; where an overflow occurs when &#39;low&#39; and &#39;high&#39; exceed the maximum int value.</li>
<li>This bug, affecting arrays with lengths of 2^30 or more, was rare in the 1980s but is more common today, also impacting mergesort and other divide-and-conquer algorithms.</li>
<li>Bloch recommends fixing the issue by calculating the midpoint as <code>int mid = low + ((high - low) / 2);</code>, highlighting the challenges of writing error-free code and the necessity of thorough testing.</li>

<ul>
<li>Many binary searches and mergesorts are prone to integer overflow issues, especially in older implementations, as highlighted in a 2006 article.&quot;</li>
<li>The article emphasizes the importance of considering edge cases and hardware limitations in programming, which remains relevant today.&quot;</li>
<li>Developers are advised to use built-in functions or larger integer types to prevent such bugs, underscoring the need for caution with data types and input sizes.&quot;</li>

<ul>
<li>In Engineering, quarterly Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) often seem redundant as they tend to mirror product roadmaps, leading to potential conflicts if they differ.</li>
<li>Marketing finds OKRs beneficial for defining quarterly focus, aligning with project timelines, and highlighting new campaigns or audiences, while ongoing tasks are tracked by Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).</li>
<li>Effective OKRs should emphasize unique or changing priorities each quarter, rather than routine tasks, to avoid stagnation and ensure they provide value beyond the roadmap.</li>

<li>OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) can sometimes misalign with actual work, emphasizing metrics over meaningful contributions and potentially leading to gaming the system rather than addressing real issues.</li>
<li>Effective implementation of OKRs requires alignment with customer needs and company goals, but this alignment is often difficult to achieve, leading to bureaucratic processes and a lack of trust in employees&#39; intrinsic motivation.</li>
<li>In large organizations, OKRs can foster competition instead of collaboration, focusing on visible rather than valuable work, thus failing to capture the complexity of tasks.</li>
