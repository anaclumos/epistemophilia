<h2><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/blog/javascript-temporal-is-coming/">JavaScript Temporal is coming</a></h2>
<p>JavaScript Temporal is a new feature in experimental browser releases aimed at improving date and time handling for web developers, addressing limitations of the old Date object. Temporal provides precise management of dates, times, durations, and calendars, with over 200 utility methods, supporting various calendars and time zones. While full cross-browser support is still in progress, Firefox leads with the most advanced implementation, and developers can experiment with Temporal using the @js-temporal/polyfill. </p>
<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42876840">Reactions</a></h3>
<p>JavaScript Temporal is a new API designed to overcome the limitations of the old Date() API, drawing inspiration from advanced time libraries like chrono in Rust and Joda Time in Java. It introduces a more complex but necessary structure by separating time into naive time, instant, and zoned time, effectively addressing issues like Daylight Saving Time (DST) bugs and serialization discrepancies. Temporal is anticipated to replace popular libraries such as Moment.js, Luxon, and date-fns by providing a standardized, built-in solution for date and time management in JavaScript, utilizing the IANA Time Zone Database. </p>

<h2><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/api-management/understanding-grpc-openapi-and-rest-and-when-to-use-them">Understanding gRPC, OpenAPI and REST and when to use them in API design (2020)</a></h2>
<p>API design primarily uses two models: gRPC (Remote Procedure Call) and REST (Representational State Transfer), both often mapped to HTTP, with gRPC using HTTP/2 for efficient communication. REST APIs are known for their simplicity and stability, while gRPC offers efficient client libraries and server implementations, making it suitable for internal APIs or when using specific tools like Cloud Endpoints. OpenAPI, similar to RPC, requires constructing URLs from templates, exposing HTTP details, and may involve complex custom HTTP mappings, offering broader HTTP tool compatibility compared to gRPC. </p>
<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42799245">Reactions</a></h3>
<p>Developers often find gRPC challenging due to tooling issues, particularly in Java, and difficulties with debugging and configuration, despite its advantages like bidirectional streaming and efficient transport. OpenAPI is a documentation standard for APIs, facilitating easier client generation and testing, and is often confused with REST, which is rarely implemented in its pure form. The decision to use gRPC, OpenAPI, or REST depends on specific use cases, team expertise, and project requirements, highlighting the importance of understanding each technology&#39;s strengths and limitations. </p>

<h2><a href="https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/essence-of-successful-abstractions/">Isolating complexity is the essence of successful abstractions</a></h2>
<p>Complexity in software development should be managed and isolated rather than eliminated, as emphasized by Fred Hebert. In microservices, complexity is often hidden within individual services, while programming languages like Rust and TypeScript manage complexity through type systems and tools like Rust&#39;s borrow checker. Rust and TypeScript are favored by developers for their ability to reveal and manage complexity, allowing for successful abstractions by isolating complexity in well-defined areas. </p>
<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42787531">Reactions</a></h3>
<p>Isolating complexity is essential for creating effective abstractions in software engineering, as it determines where complexity is managed and how it impacts cognitive load. Rust&#39;s type system requires programmers to handle memory complexity, contrasting with garbage collection systems that manage it at runtime, illustrating different tradeoffs in complexity management. The decision to expose or hide complexity through abstractions is crucial, with types and tests serving different purposes; types can constrain code behavior but also introduce their own complexities. </p>

<h2><a href="https://bera-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjet.13544">Metacognitive laziness: Effects of generative AI on learning motivation</a></h2>
<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42780022">Reactions</a></h3>
<p>A study highlights that generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, can lead to &quot;metacognitive laziness,&quot; where users depend too much on AI, reducing self-regulated learning. This reliance on AI may decrease deep learning and critical thinking skills, as learners might not engage actively in understanding and evaluating information. While AI can enhance task efficiency, the study emphasizes the importance of learners actively participating in the learning process to develop essential cognitive skills. </p>

<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42779147">Reactions</a></h3>
<p>Accurately reporting food intake is challenging, with people often misjudging portion sizes by an average of 53%, even among trained professionals. Hidden ingredients like oils and fats are less problematic than portion size errors, highlighting the need for precise measurement tools like food scales. New technologies and apps, such as SnapCalorie, aim to improve diet tracking accuracy, though they often require subscriptions due to high operational costs, potentially aiding users in making more mindful dietary choices. </p>
<h2><a href="https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/discussions/4276">ROCm Device Support Wishlist</a></h2>
<p>ROCm is gathering community feedback to determine which GPUs to support in future updates, with current compatibility details available on their website. Users are advocating for broader support, particularly for older and consumer-grade GPUs, and improved integration with Windows systems. There is a strong demand for consistent support across all architectures, emphasizing the significance of VRAM for AI applications, and calls for enhancements in AMD&#39;s APU support and a development process similar to NVIDIA&#39;s CUDA. </p>
<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42772170">Reactions</a></h3>
<p>ROCm, AMD&#39;s software platform for GPU programming, faces criticism for its hardware-specific code compilation, resulting in inconsistent GPU support compared to Nvidia&#39;s CUDA. Users are frustrated with AMD&#39;s lack of long-term support for GPUs, with some experiencing dropped support soon after purchase, leading to calls for improved cross-platform support and better documentation. The community urges AMD to support all GPUs, akin to Nvidia, and some users have shifted their hopes to Intel for better competition in the GPU market. </p>

<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42777857">Reactions</a></h3>
<p>Companies, including some from China, are using GitHub to promote products by posting &quot;research papers&quot; and code samples without delivering actual Software Development Kits (SDKs) or libraries. This practice is considered misleading, similar to false advertising, as promised APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) or model weights often do not materialize. The trend of using GitHub repositories as promotional tools, sometimes lacking source code, raises concerns about transparency and authenticity in AI research and development. </p>
