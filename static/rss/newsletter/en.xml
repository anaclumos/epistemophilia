<h2><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/11/amazon-s3-functionality-conditional-writes/">Amazon S3 Adds Put-If-Match (Compare-and-Swap)</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Amazon S3 introduces conditional writes, enabling updates only if an object remains unmodified, preventing concurrent overwrites by verifying the object&#39;s ETag.- This feature, akin to the HTTP if-none-match header, allows clients to use the if-match header to ensure ETag consistency before writing, enhancing efficiency for distributed applications.- Available at no extra cost across all AWS Regions, implementation can be done using the AWS SDK, API, or CLI, with further details in the S3 User Guide.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Amazon S3 has launched a new feature called Put-If-Match, which acts like a compare-and-swap operation, allowing conditional object writing based on version matching.- This feature improves synchronization and concurrency control, enabling developers to perform more complex operations, such as building databases on S3 without extra infrastructure.- The update brings Amazon S3 in line with similar features offered by other cloud storage services like Google Cloud Storage and Azure Blob Storage.</li>

<h2><a href="https://fasterthanli.me/articles/lies-we-tell-ourselves-to-keep-using-golang">Lies we tell ourselves to keep using Golang (2022)</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The article critiques Golang, noting that while it has appealing features like an asynchronous runtime and garbage collector, it also has significant drawbacks, such as the absence of sum types and inadequate error handling.- It argues that Go&#39;s perceived simplicity can be deceptive, leading to hidden complexities and challenges in production environments, and stresses the importance of recognizing these issues rather than adopting Go solely for its ease of use.- The article contrasts Go with Rust, suggesting that despite Rust&#39;s challenges, it provides more robust solutions for managing complexity and ensuring code correctness.</li>

<ul>
<li>Y Combinator (YC), a prominent startup accelerator, is known for launching successful companies like Airbnb and Stripe, but many of its startups build similar or identical products to previous YC companies.</li>
<li>The PearAI controversy highlighted this trend, where PearAI was accused of cloning another YC product, yet YC CEO Garry Tan defended the practice, citing the importance of choice and innovation.</li>
<li>Deckmatch&#39;s analysis of YC trends shows popular startup categories include AI code editors, restaurant PoS systems, and business finance tools, with some areas like crypto trading seeing decreased interest.</li>

<ul>
<li>An attempt to access the TSA&#39;s new digital-ID rules revealed issues with the REAL-ID Act, as the rules are not publicly accessible and require ID for access, raising concerns about secret laws and due process.</li>
<li>The TSA&#39;s digital-ID standards, derived from private documents, involve complex interactions between apps, devices, and government agencies, with privacy concerns over logged ID usage.</li>
<li>The author argues that the TSA&#39;s practices violate public access rights and has reported the issue to the Office of the Federal Register, seeking the withdrawal of the rule.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The post addresses the &quot;Onion Problem,&quot; which involves cutting onions to achieve minimal variance in slice volumes for uniformity.- A mathematical exploration using calculus determined the optimal cutting point is 55.73066% below the onion&#39;s center, termed the &quot;true onion constant.&quot;- This finding refines a previous suggestion of cutting towards a point 60% below the center, providing a more precise method for even onion slices.</li>

<ul>
<li>The discussion explores a mathematical model for cutting onions evenly, inspired by J. Kenji Lopez-Alt, using a half-disk representation to simplify the geometry and minimize slice size variance.- Users debate the model&#39;s practicality and accuracy, considering the onion&#39;s 3D structure and non-uniform layers, and suggest alternative cutting methods or tools.- The conversation also considers the balance between uniformity and culinary preferences, referencing food personalities like Adam Ragusea.</li>

<h2><a href="http://jpkoning.blogspot.com/2024/11/setelinleikkaus-when-finns-snipped.html">Setelinleikkaus: When Finns snipped their cash in half to curb inflation</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>In 1945, Finland implemented &quot;setelinleikkaus,&quot; a policy requiring citizens to cut large banknotes in half to combat post-WWII inflation, with one half retaining value and the other becoming a government bond.- The policy was ineffective as it only targeted physical cash, a minor part of the money supply, unlike more successful reforms in other European countries like Belgium.- The article speculates that future inflation control might involve digital account freezes, a more precise but potentially controversial method.</li>

<li>In 1945, Finland uniquely addressed inflation by physically cutting banknotes in half, contrasting with modern methods like adjusting interest rates.</li>
<li>This historical approach has sparked discussions on current monetary policy, where central banks manage inflation through interest rates and open market operations.</li>
<li>The potential future control of digital money, possibly via central bank digital currencies, raises concerns about increased government oversight of personal finances.</li>

<ul>
<li>Premature graying of hair (PGH) is defined as graying before age 20 in Caucasians and before 30 in African Americans, impacting self-esteem.- The causes of PGH are not fully understood but are associated with aging disorders, autoimmune diseases, and oxidative stress, with factors like smoking and nutritional deficiencies contributing.- Common treatments for PGH include hair dyes and nutritional supplements, with studies indicating links between PGH and emotional factors, genetic predispositions, and environmental influences.</li>

<h2><a href="https://blog.thalium.re/posts/llvm-powered-devirtualization/">LLVM-powered devirtualization</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The internship at Thalium focused on deobfuscating virtualized binaries using LLVM, a compiler framework, to make code more understandable, especially in the context of malware.- Virtualization, a strong obfuscation technique used by tools like Tigress and VMProtect, encodes programs into virtual instructions, making reverse engineering complex.- The project successfully used dynamic taint analysis to reconstruct the control flow graph of Tigress-obfuscated binaries, though it was limited to pure functions and single execution paths.</li>

<ul>
<li>Analytical Anti-Aliasing is a technique designed to remove jagged edges (jaggies) in rasterized images by pre-calculating the fade of shape borders, ensuring smooth edges without artifacts.- This method is efficient as it does not require additional buffers or hardware and is compatible with basic WebGL 1.0, making it accessible for various applications.- It is highlighted for its professional use in platforms like Unity and Valve Software, offering clarity and sharpness without the blurriness common in other anti-aliasing methods, such as SSAA (Super-Sample Anti-Aliasing), SMAA (Subpixel Morphological Anti-Aliasing), and DLAA (Deep Learning Anti-Aliasing).</li>

<ul>
<li>This article is the final installment in a series about generics in the Go programming language, specifically focusing on constraints, a new feature.- Constraints in Go generics limit the types that can be used in generic functions, allowing for more precise operations by using basic interfaces like <code>fmt.Stringer</code>.- The series highlights various constraint types, such as type set constraints, unions, intersections, and interface literals, and encourages further exploration through the book &quot;Know Go&quot; by John Arundel.</li>

<li>Go&#39;s generic constraints introduce complexity, contrasting with the language&#39;s focus on simplicity, due to differences between &quot;implementing&quot; and &quot;satisfying&quot; a constraint and limitations on constraint contents.</li>
<li>The complexity is partly attributed to retrofitting generics into Go, which was not initially designed to support them, sparking debate on their necessity and impact on the community.</li>
<li>Despite the complexity, generics are considered beneficial for library code, though some developers question their necessity for specific use cases.</li>
